Monkeypox may spread sexually, he noted, but it is clearly spreading through non-sexual close contact, as well.\n\n“I don’t think we have enough information at this point to completely classify it. I think there’s some suggestions, but there’s more study that needs to be done,” Adalja said.\n\n“There are other infections – for example, syphilis – that spread through other ways other than sexual transmission,” he said. “Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness, but it can also be spread sexually. The question to me is more about making sure we’re clear on what’s going on from a physiological standpoint before you would make that type of claim.”\n\nSome experts argue that labeling monkeypox as an STD could be not only misleading but potentially harmful for public health.\n\n“A negative about suggesting that monkeypox is an STD is that people who are not having sex think immediately, ‘OK, I’m not going to get it,’ ” said Dr. Saju Mathew, an Atlanta-based primary care physician and public health specialist.\n\n“What a lot of people will think is it’s like herpes or gonorrhea or chlamydia – meaning you have to have sex to get it. That’s not true. So that is why it’s dangerous to suggest that it is only exclusively transmitted via sex. That’s misinformation,” he said. “It is transmitted via sex in a majority of cases, but it’s not exclusively transmitted via intimate contact. You can also get it through non-intimate contact.”\n\nDavid Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said he and his colleagues refer to monkeypox as a “sexually associated” infection for now.\n\n“With the data that is available now, we know that the primary mode of transmission is sexually associated – contact that is of a sexual nature. Technically, a sexually transmitted infection is defined as an exchange of genital fluid that have a virus or bacteria that is associated with a sexually transmitted infection,” Harvey said. “We need the science that shows definitively that this is an infection that can be passed by semen or genital fluids, and the science on that is not quite clear yet, which is why we’re calling this sexually associated.”\n\nWhat makes an STD\n\nSTDs, also known as sexually transmitted infections or STIs, are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact such as vaginal, oral or anal sex. In some cases, these infections also can spread through skin-to-skin intimate contact, as with herpes and HPV.\n\nThe long history of STDs dates to archaic times. Some studies suggest that migrations of modern human ancestors can be associated with HPV, types of herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nIn modern times, a study out of Nigeria was among the first recent reports to describe the possible sexual transmission of monkeypox. That country experienced a large outbreak of monkeypox in humans in September 2017, and the study about it was published in the journal PLOS One in 2019. Previously, human-to-human transmission was thought to primarily occur by means of saliva or respiratory droplets or direct contact with the pus or crust of lesions.\n\n“There is no formal process to label an infection as an STI or STD,” Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote in an email to CNN on Monday. “Experts generally determine, scientifically, if a pathogen can be transmitted through sex, in which case it’s called ‘sexually transmissible.’ And how frequently the infection is referred to as an STI relates to the proportion of transmissions accounted for by sex vs some other route – but there is no ‘rubric’ that is used to guide this determination.”\n\nShe said monkeypox can be described more accurately as “sexually transmissible,” as sex is one of the ways the virus can spread – but not the only way.\n\n“Sex is a human behavior. If stigma wasn’t associated with infections transmitted through sex, there would be less concern of implications for saying monkeypox is an STI for people who are more heavily impacted,” Nordlund wrote. “It’s also important to look at this question globally – and keep in mind the implications for this label vary depending on where you are in the world. For example, there are countries where homosexuality is penalized by prison or even death. Labeling monkeypox as a STI or STD could have far-reaching consequences in these countries.”\n\nThe monkeypox virus can spread during skin-to-skin contact, direct contact with a monkeypox rash or scabs from an infected person, or direct contact with their respiratory secretions. Scientists are still researching whether monkeypox can be spread through semen or vaginal fluids.\n\nAlthough the risk is low, there is also some potential for the virus to spread through items or surfaces like clothing, bedding or towels that were used by someone with monkeypox.\n\nIn the current outbreak, transmission is mostly via skin-to skin-contact, Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, wrote in an email to CNN on Tuesday.\n\n“CSTE does not make the determination on whether a disease or condition is classified as sexually transmitted. Regardless of how monkeypox is classified, emphasizing the prevention messaging is most important,” Hamilton wrote.\n\n“People should avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with those who have a rash that looks like monkeypox, avoid contact with the object and materials those infected with monkeypox have used, and practice frequent hand washing. Those exposed to monkeypox or those more likely to get monkeypox should get vaccinated.”\n\nMathew said the skin lesions caused by a monkeypox infection actually could be mistaken for a common STD like herpes or syphilis, and in some cases, a person with monkeypox could have coinfections with common sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nWhen he treated his first monkeypox patient in Atlanta, Mathew immediately noticed that the person had the typical lesions on his face. But the 25-year-old man also had buttocks pain, Mathew said. “He ended up having another STD in addition to monkeypox,” which was herpes.\n\nMathew added that about 25% of monkeypox patients in the US have had STD co-infections.\n\nHarvey said that “when diagnosing monkeypox, you have to test for monkeypox, but you also have to do the range of other STI tests to ensure that those are either ruled out or diagnosed as well.”\n\n“We do happen to have the highest sexually transmitted infection rates in the US, basically in American history. So it’s not surprising that we’re diagnosing more STIs in the context of the current monkeypox outbreak,” he said. “Anecdotally, we’re hearing from some of our clinics across the country that they’re seeing rates anywhere of 15% to 40% of coinfections with other STIs, but we don’t have national data on that right now.”\n\nThe CDC’s clinical guidance tells health care providers, “It is important to comprehensively evaluate patients presenting with genital or perianal ulcers for STIs. However, co-infections with monkeypox and STIs have been reported and the presence of an STI does not rule out monkeypox.”\n\nCombating stigma\n\nAny efforts to call monkeypox a sexually transmitted infection “will only increase stigma and ignores other means of transmission,” Jason Farley, nurse scientist and the inaugural Leadership and Innovation Endowed Chair at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\n“The virus is spreading among close contacts and sexual networks within the gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men communities. We have also seen spread, although limited thus far, within households with cases in men, women and children. The latter is transmission likely through skin-to-skin contact of parents and children, but environmental contamination resulting in transmission is also possible,” Farley wrote.\n\n“If we look at how the AIDS response unfolded, for example, it took almost a decade to get the heterosexual community to pay attention and realize that HIV was not a gay disease,” he wrote. “We cannot allow the same form of inaccurate information to guide our public health practice today.”\n\nHarvey, of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said that stigma is something STD clinics combat daily and he worries about the monkeypox outbreak being stigmatized in the context of it being a sexually associated disease.\n\n“We don’t want people to dismiss this as a sexually transmitted infection, but at some level, this buys into the stigma of sexually transmitted infections,” he said. “And so, for those of us who work in this field on a full-time basis and deal with these issues every day in and out, we want to do everything we can to break down stigma, especially in relation to sexually transmitted infections, so that we’re ensuring people get tested and treated free of shame or fear.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOverall, whether or not monkeypox is designated an STD, Harvey said the response to the outbreak is weighing down STD clinics.\n\n“STI and sexual health clinics across the country are bearing the brunt of responding to testing and treatment needs right now – and they don’t have additional funding to handle the influx of patients. We’re also seeing other sexually transmitted infection testing and care already getting disrupted,” Harvey said.\n\nOne survey of more than 80 clinics, conducted by the National Coalition of STD Directors, between July 26 and 29 found that 63% have received referrals from other health care providers for suspected monkeypox cases, 52% have served people who have been turned away from other providers, and 40% have incurred unanticipated expenses for supplies or personnel due to monkeypox response.\n\nAlso, 65% of clinics have had to modify workflows to manage monkeypox, such as changing from walk-in clinics to appointment-only, and 22% have had to reduce either symptomatic or asymptomatic screening for other STIs to prioritize monkeypox services.\n\nThere is “a lack of additional funding, a lack of federal funding, that can directly support these programs,” Harvey said. “These programs need support for supplies, testing, to pay for testing, they need additional staff hours and other types of capacity to help support the response for this outbreak.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}]}

Even if they had, that alone wouldn’t have swayed their opinions about Haley, the pair said.\n\nBut they saw it as part of a series of events raising Haley's profile with just eight weeks to go until New Hampshire voters cast their primary ballots.\n\n“You start looking at patterns of people that are starting to endorse, and that draws your attention. It makes you aware,” Carlson, a venture capitalist, said.\n\n“That’s essentially the momentum Haley is getting.”\n\nThe Trump equation\n\nBob Davis was one of few voters in the crowd who had heard about the Koch endorsement. The announcement gave Davis “confidence that Nikki could possibly carry” the primary and potentially beat Trump, he told USA TODAY.\n\nA retired health care administrator, Davis was among a large contingent of town hall attendees who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. But this election cycle, Davis said, the former president has given “1000 reasons every day” to choose a different candidate.\n\nAnd while the 78-year-old still is deciding who to support, if “pressed with hot coals,” he said he’d circle Haley’s name because other challengers, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy “don’t have as much horsepower” in terms of intelligence and the ability to get things done.\n\nHaley, and big-money backers like AFP Action, have used similar arguments, often describing the 51-year-old as a new generational leader, to distinguish her from Trump and the crowded field of GOP contenders\n\nOn Tuesday, as Haley more comfortably entered the No. 2 spot in the 2024 New Hampshire race, she appeared to ramp up those calls and directly target Trump more than ever before.\n\nSticking to her classic stump speech, Haley at first told the new throngs at the Opera House that she believed “President Trump was the right person at the right time.”\n\n“But the truth is,” she added, “rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him everywhere he goes. And with a country as divided like we are, in a world with threats pointed at America, we can’t afford any of that chaos.”\n\nDespite Haley’s rising momentum, her path to victory in New Hampshire remains narrow. Trump is garnering over 60% of the vote in most polls, compared with Haley's roughly 10%, and with less than 50 days until the first votes are cast, time is running out.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/12/nikki-haley-endorsement-new-hamsphire-chris-sununu/71805277007/", "title": "Nikki Haley gets coveted NH endorsement from Chris Sununu", "text": "MANCHESTER, N.H. — New Hampshire's popular Republican Gov. Chris Sununu endorsed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley Tuesday night, a critical move that could invigorate the White House hopeful’s campaign as she seeks to take on former President Donald Trump in the first-in-the-nation primary.\n\n“It’s unbelievable,” Sununu said to a packed crowd at the McIntyre Ski Area in Manchester, describing Haley’s momentum in the state. “To see her out there to see you're connecting with folks to feel that momentum is real and it is changeable.”\n\nSununu decided against a presidential run of his own in August and has for months said he would back an alternative to Trump in the 2024 race. Since then, he has been one of the busiest politicians on the campaign trail – attending countless town halls with Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nAmong the most popular Republican governors in the country, Sununu has urged flocks of voters packed into tiny diners, American Legion halls and auditoriums across New Hampshire to “get behind a winner” who could beat President Joe Biden in a general election match up.\n\n“I call it retail management,” Sununu, 48, said while discussing the factors impacting his potential endorsement outside of a Haley event in November. It's an old-fashioned style of politicking Sununu employed during his four successful gubernatorial campaigns in the Granite State and one he believes could be a winning strategy for the modern-day GOP.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“America has an amazing opportunity to have a president that understands national policy but that connects with communities at a retail level,\" he said.\n\nNow, Sununu is pinning Haley as just that – the candidate with enough broad kitchen-table appeal among conservatives and moderates alike to take on Trump in the GOP primary and face Biden in November 2024.\n\nRecent polls in the Granite State show the former ambassador to the United Nations rising to second place in the race behind Trump, with Christie and DeSantis trailing a third and fourth respectively.\n\nHaley in recent weeks has also racked up a number of major conservative endorsements, including one from the Koch-brothers backed Americans for Prosperity Action. The pushes signal growing consensus for the former Palmetto State governor as a top Trump rival.\n\nSununu’s move to endorse Haley breaks with a decision by his early voting state counterpart, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, to back DeSantis.\n\nThe Florida governor has largely bet his chances in the 2024 race on Iowa's evangelical voters. A Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom poll published earlier this week found the governor in second place in the Midwest state, over 30 percentage points behind Trump and just three points ahead of Haley.\n\nDeSantis' campaign communications director Andrew Romeo brushed off Sununu's endorsement of Haley in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\n\"What happens in New Hampshire will be significantly impacted by the outcome in Iowa where the true Trump alternative will emerge,\" Romeo said. \"And when Ron DeSantis comes out in that position he will be joined by over 60 New Hampshire state legislators who stand ready to take the fight to the establishment and their candidates of yesteryear to return power to grassroots conservatives.\"\n\nChristie's campaign also dismissed the endorsement, saying in a statement that it merely puts the former prosecutor \"down one vote in New Hampshire.\"\n\n\"When Governor Christie is back in Londonderry tomorrow, he'll continue to tell the unvarnished truth about Donald Trump and earn that one missing vote and thousands more,\" the campaign said.\n\nSununu's impact on the race\n\nWhile Sununu has one of the highest approval ratings out of any governor in the U.S. – a whopping 63% of voters view his job performance favorably – it’s unclear whether his endorsement will meaningfully affect how Granite State voters view the 2024 GOP field.\n\nTrump has long been the frontrunner among New Hampshire Republicans and across the country. And many of the dozens of voters USA TODAY has spoken with at campaign events across the state in the last few months have said that endorsements don't play into their electoral decision making, often citing concern that outside groups have a specific agenda.\n\nCameron Easley, Morning Consult's Lead U.S. Politics Analyst, told USA TODAY that Sununu’s impact will “depend a lot of ways on which voters are actually going to turn out to vote in the GOP primary this year.”\n\nSununu ranked as the fifth most popular governor in Morning Consult’s recent survey of U.S. state leaders. But among Republican voters, his strong approval rating was only 27% – much smaller than that of Reynolds in Iowa or South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.\n\nWhere Sununu shines compared to other leaders is with independent voters, which comprise roughly 40% of New Hampshire’s electorate.\n\n“If we get a Republican primary that has a lot of people who really identify more as independent or are truly unaffiliated in terms of how they identify their own partisanship, [the endorsement] has a bigger chance to have a big, big impact,” Easley said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/23/new-hampshire-primary-2024-election-live-updates/72312175007/", "title": "New Hampshire primary replay: Donald Trump wins, but Nikki Haley ...", "text": "Former President Donald Trump defeated former South Carolina Gov.

So we can all focus Republican funds behind the guy who can help us save our country.”\n\nBut Steven Steiner, 63, said he suspects New Hampshire's famously skeptical undeclared voters - many of whom are supporting Haley - could tip the primary.\n\n“That’s a question mark. We'll find out,” said Steiner, a realtor in Conway, New Hampshire.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene issues warning to Nikki Haley: ‘After tonight, the primary will be over’\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., criticized Nikki Haley before polls closed in New Hampshire, targeting Haley's record as governor in South Carolina and accusing her of being “for foreign wars.”\n\n“President Trump is not a new candidate. He was our president for four years. He has a record we can trust,” Greene said in a video shared on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe Georgia lawmaker added that “If Nikki Haley decides to drag this out to South Carolina, her political career will be over too.. at least what’s left of it.”\n\nHaley is seeking to build momentum Tuesday heading into the primary in her home state next month. But it’s not clear New Hampshire Republicans will clear the way, with Trump holding a significant lead in polls in recent days.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolls close in New Hampshire\n\nMost Granite State polls closed at 7 p.m. Eastern time, and polls are set to close statewide at 8 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe coming hours will be tense as Granite State voters make their voices heard. Nikki Haley is trying to defeat Donald Trump – or come close enough to alter the sticky narrative that the former president is the runaway frontrunner.\n\nWhile Joe Biden isn’t technically on the ballot due to a battle between the Democratic National Committee and New Hampshire officials, Democratic organizers are still hoping to deliver a victory for the president seeking a second term in office.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump and NH Republican Gov. Chris Sununu go at it on social media\n\nTrump began primary day not by attacking Haley but by attacking her most prominent New Hampshire supporter, Gov. Chris Sununu, a fellow Republican.\n\nSununu responded by questioning Trump's age and mental capacity.\n\nTrump started it with a Truth Social post that hit Fox News as well as Sununu: \"Why does Fox keep putting New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu on??? Every time I mention his name at a Rally, they BOOO like crazy ... To have this loser on so much is really bad TV.\"\n\nOver on X (formerly Twitter), Sununu responded: \"I suppose it’s tough keeping up with the conversation given your advanced age. Maybe try subtitles next time. Thanks for watching.\"\n\nTo be continued.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nYoung voters ho-hum about old candidates\n\nMany youngsters in New Hampshire were voting in their first primary, but when they looked at some of their top options, none excited them.\n\nSure, the 52-year-old Haley brought a breath of fresh air, but polls indicate she's at best a longshot for the Republican nomination. The leading candidates in both parties, Biden and Trump, are 81 and 77, respectively, likely older than many of the new voters' grandparents.\n\n\"Both of them are too old,\" said Jacob Baldy, 24.\n\nWinning the youth vote figures to be crucial in the general election, and if it's a Biden-Trump rematch, that may not come down to who's more appealing but rather less objectionable. Camden MacLean, 19, went to a Trump rally and was disheartened to notice the former president was more focused on attacking his enemies than explaining his policies.\n\n\"People are less concerned with finding solutions and more concerned with 'my way or the highway, my agenda or nothing else,'\" MacLean said, referring both candidates.\n\nBiden focuses on abortion rights supporters, union members\n\nAs Trump and Haley fight it out in the New Hampshire primary, Biden and the Democrats are counter-programming with events aimed at key constituencies: Abortion rights supporters and union members.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden − who's not on the ballot in New Hampshire − joined Vice President Kamala Harris and other officials addressing a Virginia audience of \"reproductive rights groups, members of Congress, and grassroots supporters,\" his campaign said.\n\nHowever, the gathering did not go smoothly. Biden was interrupted about a dozen times by pro-Palestinian hecklers protesting his support of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nOn Wednesday, as political professionals assess the New Hampshire results, Biden will address members of the United Auto Workers at its national Community Action Program conference in Washington, D.C. Biden is seeking the UAW's endorsement.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nTrump's defamation against writer moved to Thursday\n\nOne way or another, Trump will not give his day-after assessment of the New Hampshire primary from a courthouse in New York City.\n\nThe judge in writer E. Jean Carroll's defamation suit against Trump postponed proceedings scheduled for Wednesday, after the trial was delayed Monday when a juror took in sick.\n\nThe Carroll-Trump trial will now resume Thursday, and Trump is expected to testify.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nA push to protest war in Gaza with cease-fire vote\n\nUniversity of New Hampshire student Alexis Eaton said she had planned to vote for Democratic candidate Marianne Williamson in Tuesday's primary but changed her mind after learning about a movement to write in \"cease-fire\" instead.\n\n“I think it’s going to send a message,” Eaton, 21, said before entering her polling place in the town of Durham, intent on following the recommendation of peace activists encouraging New Hampshire voters to press Biden for an immediate halt to Israel's military campaign in Gaza.\n\nTyler O’Connell, who graduated from UNH in May, said the conflict is an important issue, but she was planning to write in Biden's name.\n\n“There’s a lot of unrest around Palestine and Israel and there have been so many calls for cease-fire that it seems like it’s gone unheard,” said O’Connell, 23. “I know for me personally that’s also something that I’ve been thinking about, but I think overall Biden is still the right person for the job.”\n\n− Margie Cullen\n\nWhen is the next presidential election?

They have their differences: Karibian is holding a Biden sign while Sharon, a Trump supporter, is waving a sign that reads “Make America Great Again.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean they don’t chat every once in a while.\n\n“We’re all Americans,” said Karibian, a federal government employee based in Salem. “We might have different views on things but it’s nice to see ... we can all get along. We’re all Americans. We’re all trying to do what’s best for the country.”\n\nSharon, a retired business owner, said while he and Karibian discussed their political differences, they’ve been discovering areas where they agree. “I love people,” Sharon said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump expects Haley to drop out. Haley: This isn't a coronation.\n\nTrump said at a rally Monday that he expected Haley to drop out of the race Tuesday. Haley doesn't want to hear it. “I don’t care how much you all want to coronate Donald Trump,\" Haley said Tuesday on Fox and Friends. \"At the end of the day, that’s not what Americans want. Americans want a choice.“\n\nHaley says 70% of Americans don't want a Trump-Biden rematch and both are saddled with high disapproval ratings. Next up on the primary list is South Carolina, her home state, and she says she is already buying campaign ads. Her recurring theme: “This has always been a marathon. It’s never been a sprint.”\n\nAt a polling station stop in Londonderry, Trump greeted cheering supporters, predicted victory and professed a lack of concern about Haley's campaign future.\n\n\"I don't care if she stays in,\" Trump told reporters during the stop. \"Let her do whatever she wants. It doesn't matter.\"\n\nVoter in Atkinson says Trump is 'the only guy who can do the job'\n\nVoters gathered inside the Atkinson Community Center as early as 7 a.m. in Atkinson, about 25 miles southeast of Manchester. Joel Winslow, 54, said he voted for Trump because “he’s the only guy who can do the job.”\n\n“Everybody else has been in government for so long, the same stuff keeps happening and happening,” said Winslow, an electrician. Winslow said he admires the former president because he “hasn’t been in government forever” and serves the people.\n\n“With all the punches he gets thrown, with all the cases that get thrown into court, the guy just keeps coming back,” Winslow said. “And a guy with his stature and his money, why would he want to put himself through that? So I really think he’s for the people.”\n\nDean Olsen, 62, also voted for Trump because of his border, economic and other policies. Olsen said the cost of groceries and gas have risen sharply under the Biden administration and the impacts have been significant on his family.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHaley takes shot at Trump's age (he's 77, she's 52)\n\nHaley, 52, attacked Trump’s age while visiting the polls in Hampton with Gov. Chris Sununu on Tuesday. She said Trump is “mentally fit,” but she said voters need to ask whether they want “two 80-year-olds” in Trump and Biden on the ticket in November. Trump is 77.\n\n“When you’ve got a country in disarray and a world on fire the way we do,” Haley said, “you need someone at the top of their game that can put in eight years and get things back on track.”\n\nIt's the latest in a series of shots Haley has taken at Trump's age. At a rally last week Trump repeatedly appeared to confuse Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, drawing a warning to voters from Haley that Trump's \"mental stability\" would continue to decline.\n\n− Max Sullivan\n\nOn Politics\n\nA primer on primaries and caucuses\n\nThe 2024 election season kicked off with a frost-bitten start as Iowa Republicans headed to their caucus in freezing weather. Trump cruised to a notably early and wide victory, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis narrowly edged out Haley for second place. Now DeSantis is gone and the focus is on New Hampshire, which conducts a primary. But what makes a caucus different from a primary? And how does a primary end up ultimately factoring into the general election?\n\nUSA TODAY is answering all your questions about how the country votes and why it matters. All you need to know is here.\n\n− Anna Kaufman\n\nDeSantis says Florida taxpayers won't pay Trump legal bills\n\nThe detente between Trump and DeSantis, who dropped out of the race Sunday and endorsed Trump, might not last very long. DeSantis has threatened to veto any effort by Florida lawmakers to have the state bankroll Trump's legal bills. On the social media site X (formerly Twitter), DeSantis re-posted a Politico story headlined \"Some Florida Republicans want taxpayers to pay Trump's legal bills.\"\n\nDeSantis commented: \"But not the Florida Republican who wields the veto pen…\"Trump, who has said nice things about DeSantis since he dropped out of the presidential race, has not commented on the potential flap.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDixville Notch is all about Nikki Haley\n\nThe polls say Haley is a long shot, but she got off to a flying start when the six registered voters of Dixville Notch cast their ballots for her. The resort town with the tiny population historically makes a big splash by opening its polls at midnight, the first place in the nation to vote, count and announce its results in presidential primaries. As usual, the handful of voters were greeted by an overwhelming number of reporters from around the world.\n\nLes Otten, owner of the Balsams Resort that served as the polling location, was excited to cast his ballot.\n\n“It’s what ought to happen in every community in the United States, where there is 100% participation, everybody votes,\" Otten said. \"None of the six of us can complain about the outcome of the election, because we’ve participated.”\n\nHaley was appreciative, posting on social media \"A great start to a great day in New Hampshire. Thank you Dixville Notch!\"\n\nWhich Republicans are still running for president? Ryan Binkley, Nikki Haley and Donald Trump\n\nAfter entrepreneur Ramaswamy, DeSantis and a bevy of other GOP nomination hopefuls dropped out of the Republican primary, three candidates were left Tuesday.\n\nTrump, Haley and the much lesser known businessman and pastor Ryan Binkley are still in the running.\n\nLooking for more information? You can catch up with the USA TODAY Network's voter guides for everything you need to know about the Republican, Democratic and third-party candidates.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nCan Nikki Haley win New Hampshire?\n\nThe odds aren’t in her favor. Trump led Haley 55% to 36% in a Suffolk University/Boston Globe/NBC-10 tracking poll conducted in the state Jan. 18-19. And DeSantis’ exit from the 2024 primary may bolster Trump’s lead. Nearly 60% of the Florida governor’s likely voters said Trump was their second choice in the poll.\n\nHaley’s campaign, however, is hoping that DeSantis’ exit will give her a boost with undecided anti-Trump voters in the final hours before New Hampshire's primary.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen do polls close in New Hampshire?\n\nPolling times vary by town and city in New Hampshire. Most are open from 7 or 8 a.m. to 7 or 8 p.m., but some, like Hebron, don’t open until as late as 11 a.m. If you're a New Hampshire resident, you can check your polling place to find out the exact time your location opens and closes.\n\n– Margie Cullen\n\nDeSantis' withdrawal reshapes New Hampshire's GOP race\n\nNew Hampshire's Republican primary shifted this week when DeSantis dropped out of the GOP race after his loss in the Iowa Caucuses. The Florida governor immediately endorsed Trump, but some of Haley's supporters in New Hampshire have argued that won't matter in the Granite State.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor has long sought to build a broad coalition, sometimes fueled by moderate, anti-Trump Republicans. The question remains: Will those voters propel Haley to her first 2024 win, or will Trump quickly claim victory in New Hampshire?\n\n– Karissa Waddick, Marina Pitofsky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/22/new-hampshire-primary-live-updates/72309196007/", "title": "New Hampshire primary live updates: Trump, Haley face off", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the New Hampshire primary for Monday, Jan.22. For the latest news on the primary, view our live updates file for Tuesday. Jan. 23.\n\nDonald Trump hosted a primary eve rally in Laconia, N.H., featuring a guest list designed to send a message to his remaining rival, Nikki Haley: Former GOP candidates who have dropped out and endorsed the former president.\n\n“Now is the time for the Republican Party to come together,” Trump told backers as he forecast a big victory Tuesday over Haley. Protestors heckled Trump several times before being escorted out.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy joined Trump at the “unity” rally and predicted that Haley would soon join their ranks.\n\n“We end this primary tomorrow,” Burgum told the crowd. Not on Monday’s guest list: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who announced his withdrawal on Sunday.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHaley, meanwhile, discounted Trump’s endorsements from politicians, calling them elitists who do not understand the country. “I don’t want their endorsements,” Haley told NBC News. “I want the endorsements of the hardworking people of New Hampshire and South Carolina.”\n\nIntroducing Haley at her event, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu made a similar dig at Trump. The former president has become this\" establishment guy\" who is \"so proud\" to get congressional endorsements, Sununu said, \"because he doesn't want to hold them accountable.\"\n\n- David Jackson and Francesca Chambers\n\nFour polls give Trump large lead in New Hampshire\n\nA raft of polls out of New Hampshire on Monday show Trump poised to run away with Tuesday's GOP primary in the Granite State, despite Haley's recent surge.\n\nInsiderAdvantage has the biggest gap: Trump 27 points ahead of the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Boston Globe/Suffolk has a 19-point gap, Washington Post/Monmouth 18 points, WHDH-TV/Emerson 16 points.\n\nThe polls were taken before DeSantis dropped out Sunday, but he was trending very low in all of them. And Monmouth officials note that DeSantis supporters in the poll were twice as likely to name Trump than Haley as their second choice.\n\n“Even with a bump in the number of Democratic leaners turning out in the Republican primary, Haley is not able to catch the front-runner,” said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute. “Trump’s base continues to be more committed and more motivated than other primary voters.”\n\nOn the Democratic side, President Joe Biden appears poised to win handily via write-in votes despite passive participation.\n\nTrump poised to romp in NH:DeSantis drops out of race\n\nHaley takes slight shots at Trump, touts strength in SC\n\nHaley's longshot chances of beating Trump in New Hampshire don't appear to have improved with DeSantis' departure from the race. They're actually worse according to some estimates that indicate two out of every three DeSantis voters would opt for Trump.\n\nAsked about that disparity in a Fox News interview Monday, Haley said: \"I mean that’s what y’all think. What I'll tell you is, I know that the DeSantis voters, they love America and they wanted a new generational leader. And they wanted a conservative that was going to go in there and clean up government. And that's what we're going to do.''\n\nHaley also took a slight shot at Trump when she said, \"rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him,'' and called him out on some lies. At the same time, she seemed to hedge her bets in New Hampshire by emphasizing her strength in her native South Carolina, site of the next Republican primary Feb. 24, where she was elected governor twice.\n\n\"I know South Carolinians very well,'' Haley said. \"They want you to fight for it. They want you to earn it. They want to see your grit. And they don't want you coming in and doing a rally. They want you to show them what you're made of. I'm going to do that all over again in South Carolina.''\n\nOnly one South Carolina member of Congress supports Haley\n\nWhen Reps. Nancy Mace and Jeff Duncan endorsed Trump on Monday, Rep. Ralph Norman was left as the only Republican member of Congress from South Carolina to back Haley, a two-time governor of the state who was born and raised there.\n\nSouth Carolina's lone Democrat in Congress, Rep. Jim Clyburn, is a key Biden supporter.\n\nIn addition to five of South Carolina's seven representatives, Trump has been endorsed by both of its U.S. senators, Scott and Lindsey Graham, and by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster. Scott was appointed to the Senate by Haley in 2012 as a replacement for the retiring Jim DeMint.\n\nFake robocalls discourage Democrats from voting in primary\n\nThe office of New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said it's investigating robocalls made to several voters, using an artificial intelligence-generated voice that sounds like Biden, discouraging them from voting in Tuesday's Democratic primary.\n\nFormella said the calls seem to be an illegal attempt to curtail voting and that voters “should disregard the contents of this message entirely.”\n\nIn the call, the voice impersonating Biden says “it’s important that you save your vote for the November election. ... your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.\"\n\nAaron Jacobs, spokesperson for the effort to write in Biden in the New Hampshire primary, described the calls as \"deep fake disinformation designed to harm Joe Biden, suppress votes and damage our democracy.\" He said the issue was referred to law enforcement to determine who is responsible.\n\n\"We are confident that New Hampshire voters will respond by showing up to the polls and making clear that we won't be intimidated by these dirty tricks,\" Jacobs said in a statement. \"We remain focused on one goal until polls close on Tuesday: encouraging Granite Staters to write-in Joe Biden.”\n\nNH Sen. Maggie Hassan joins Write-In Biden effort\n\nNew Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan joined volunteers at a Write-in Biden Get Out The Vote event on a frigid Monday morning in Manchester. While Hassan has criticized the Democratic National Committee’s move to make South Carolina the first-in-the-nation primary instead of New Hampshire, she urged voters to write in Biden’s name on the primary ballot.\n\nWhen New Hampshire Democrats refused to move the primary, the national party ordered candidates to \"take all measures possible not to participate\" and has disqualified the state from receiving delegates to the nominating convention. Biden, who lobbied for South Carolina in an effort to \"ensure that voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process,\" is expected to defeat challengers Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson in the New Hampshire primary anyway.\n\nHassan said she has addressed her concerns with Biden and will continue to lobby for Democrats to join Republicans in keeping New Hampshire at the front of the primary line.\n\n“The DNC made a terrible decision not to have New Hampshire go first,” Hassan said. “But at the end of the day, Granite Staters know that the stakes are really, really high in this election.”\n\n− Margie Cullen\n\nTrump changes tune on DeSantis, retires nickname\n\nAfter relentlessly ridiculing DeSantis for months on the campaign trail, Trump extended an olive branch once the Florida governor bowed out of the presidential race and endorsed his front-running campaign nemesis.\n\nTrump, speaking Sunday night at a rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, described DeSantis as a “really terrific person” and lauded him for running a “great campaign” for the nomination.\n\n“He was very gracious and he endorsed me,” Trump said. “I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron and everybody else to defeat crooked Joe Biden.”\n\nHaley is the last major candidate who can derail a November rematch between Trump and Biden. But it was DeSantis who routinely led Trump in presidential polling after the Trump-led GOP came up considerably short of expectations in the 2022 midterm elections. DeSantis was a fundraising machine, and his staunch conservatism and calls for tight border control drew him the nickname “DeFuture.”\n\nBut almost from the moment he formally announced his run in May, a series of technical issues and campaign gaffes bogged down his effort while fueling withering criticism from Trump. A distant second place in Iowa and low polling ahead of Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary appeared to seal DeSantis’ fate, and he withdrew Sunday. Hours later Trump said he was dropping his nickname for the Florida governor.\n\n“Will I be using the name Ron DeSanctimonious?” Trump said. “That name is officially retired.”\n\nTrump’s day: A defamation trial in NY, a campaign stop in NH\n\nOne day before the New Hampshire primary, Trump briefly appeared at a unique campaign venue: A courtroom in New York City. As he did last week, the Republican front-runner is attending the defamation trial of writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of sexual assault back in the 1990s.\n\nTrump, also accused of defaming Carroll about the attack, figures to testify Wednesday when the trail resumes after it was delayed Monday when a juror took ill. Trump’s lawyers had asked that his appearance be postponed until after Tuesday’s primary.\n\nTrump headed back to New Hampshire for a night rally Monday.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHaley supporters embrace her sweater choices\n\nHaley can often be seen wearing a signature Ralph Lauren American flag sweater on the campaign trail, and some of her supporters have taken notice. Women at several of Haley’s recent campaign stops have dusted off similar crewnecks in a show of support.\n\nCarol Booth, 65, put on her daughter’s old cream-colored flag sweater before heading to one of Haley’s events at a brewery in Manchester on Monday. Booth, a para educator, left school early so she could meet Haley, who she said “has to win” to save the future of the country.\n\n“We need to change and I believe she's the one that can do it,” said Booth, who was shaking from excitement after meeting Haley.\n\nA day earlier, 67-year-old Robin Stewart of Londonderry broke out her navy knit sweater of Old Glory to attend a Haley meet-and-greet at a seafood restaurant in Hampton. Stewart, an anti-Trump Republican, also said Haley's the future of American politics.\n\n“We need a decrease in age around here and some fresh outlooks on things,” she said.\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nDixville Notch prepares for quadrennial 15 minutes of fame\n\nThe tiny New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch is a few hours away from making history, its six registered voters set to cast the first primary ballots of the U.S. election season. The handful of voters and a phalanx of media will gather at The Balsams Resort, where voting will commence promptly at midnight Monday.\n\nThe tradition began in 1960, eight years after the state gained its first-in-the-nation primary status. In Dixville Notch the polls remain open just long enough for its residents to vote, and the results are counted and the results released to the national media.\n\nIn 2020, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent $1 billion of his own money in an ill-fated run for president. But he was a winner in Dixie Notch with three write-in votes, one from a Republican and two from Democrats. The remaining votes went to current Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The town became a Biden stronghold later that year, with all five votes in the November election cast for Biden.\n\nThe amazing rise and dysfunctional fall of Ron DeSantis\n\nA year ago, DeSantis was one of the most prominent Republicans in the country. Briefly nicknamed \"DeFuture,\" DeSantis was a prolific fundraiser and popular governor who seemed positioned to try to take the GOP into a post-Trump era. But the failure of DeSantis to sell himself to Republicans as a Trump alternative was one of several flaws that ultimately undermined his presidential campaign, a list that also includes a fractious campaign organization and a notable inability to project warmth on the campaign trail.\n\n\"The candidate had an incredible track record of success, but he never learned how to communicate it,\" pollster Frank Luntz said.

Can ...", "text": "BRETTON WOODS, N.H. – Rudy Glocker strolled into the Omni Mount Washington Resort on a mission to see former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, as snow blanketed the luxury hotel’s red tin roof.\n\nGlocker, a 54-year-old entrepreneur, had seen Haley once before at an event over the summer near his company, Burgeon Outdoor’s, a Lincoln, New Hampshire store that specializes in outdoor apparel. Her foreign policy expertise and leadership style impressed Glocker, a former Goldman Sachs executive.\n\nAhead of the Granite State’s first-in-the-nation primary, he wanted to be sure he was backing the right candidate.\n\n“She has a vision,” said Glocker, a Harvard Business School graduate, who said the former South Carolina governor's approach evoked the problem-solving ability of a business owner. “She expresses a desire to understand the issue, understand what drives it and to take action that will hopefully help solve the problem.”\n\nGlocker is a part of a key demographic that Haley is counting on to overtake former President Donald Trump in Tuesday's primary: highly educated and fiscally conservative professionals.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe departure on Sunday of Ron DeSantis left Haley and Trump locked in a two-person race in which the former president is the heavy favorite.\n\nThough Trump has held a commanding lead in the GOP field throughout the primary campaign, Haley began seeing momentum for her candidacy in New Hampshire last fall as she crisscrossed the state answering voters' questions at town halls.\n\nUpscale voters are an important part of her coalition there. New Hampshire is a relatively wealthy state that boasts proximity to the Boston area along with scenic mountains and coastal areas. Its median household income of roughly $90,000 is more than $10,000 higher than the national average, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nA USA TODAY/Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll in early January found that New Hampshire residents earning more than $100,000 a year were more likely than other voters to support Haley. She performs her best among highly educated voters who earned either college or advanced degrees.\n\nWhile combative rhetoric is a staple of Trump's speeches and also featured heavily in DeSantis's campaign appearances, Haley has a more measured style. The former South Carolina governor and former UN ambassador puts a strong emphasis on explaining her policy proposals, from the economy to the border to foreign policy. That appears to be part of her appeal to college educated voters.\n\n“Much of primary politics is identity politics. When all the candidates have an R or a D next to their name, voters' choices often rely on intangible factors,” Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said.\n\nFor Gail Myers, 69, that was exactly the case after meeting Haley at the Bretton Woods event Tuesday.\n\n\"I felt like I was her long-lost sister,\" said Myers, who formerly owned her own drapery business.\n\nMyers and her husband, the former president and CEO of A.I.M. Mutual Insurance Companies, drove an hour and half from their home in Wakefield in the lakes region for the event. A friend who served in the South Carolina State Senate told them Haley was \"the real deal.\" Haley's brief 20- minute address in the hotel's ballroom had Myers hooked.\n\n\"Everything that she had to say was right on target. That was all my feelings,\" Myers said. \"I'm definitely voting for her.\"\n\nHaley has courted supporters like Myers by hosting campaign stops at 4-star hotels in coastal and mountain vacation havens frequented by the wealthy, such as the Omni Mount Washington Resort in Bretton Woods, Portsmouth’s Wentworth by the Sea and the Inn on Main near Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro.\n\nIn wintertime, travelers from New York and Massachusetts flock to resorts like Bretton Woods to ski down the White Mountains renowned peaks and cozy up by the fire in the lodges. During the summer, they line the streets of quaint downtowns near the seacoast, bumping shoulders with locals as they wait for dinner reservations at chic restaurants.\n\nNew Hampshire also has rural voters of more modest means and blue-collar voters. Working class voters are a base of support for Trump both in New Hampshire and across the country. The USA TODAY/Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll found the former president performing well among those with a high school degree or some college.\n\nIf Haley is to do well against Trump, she'll need to overperform in the white-collar communities where she has spent much of her time, such as Portsmouth and Hollis.\n\n\"More than anywhere else in New Hampshire on Tuesday, I'm paying attention to those bedroom communities – suburban communities in the southern tier of the state that make up the outer ring of metropolitan Boston,\" Scala said.\n\nThe Sununu Factor\n\nHaley has an important supporter in New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu.\n\nSununu is one of the most popular governors in the country and is himself among the state’s elite. His family owns and operates a ski resort in northern New Hampshire that he helped run before he was elected in 2017. As governor, Sununu has championed a platform of fiscal responsibility and traditional conservative policies, such as business tax cuts.\n\nHis electoral success rate in the state is nearly unmatched – he won four races before announcing last year that he would not seek another term. Sununu chalks his victories up to retail politics and says that’s how Haley can pull ahead in the state, too.\n\n“National strategies don't work in New Hampshire. You've got to be really genuine. You've got to connect with folks,” he said in an interview. “That's the fundamental rule.”\n\nGreg Moore, state director of Americans for Prosperity, an arm of the conservative Koch-backed group that endorsed Haley last November, noted that Sununu has a higher favorability than Trump with wealthy suburban voters.\n\nFor instance, in the 2020 general presidential election, Trump lost the once-Republican stronghold of Bedford, a suburb of Manchester, to President Joe Biden. In the same election, Sununu carried the town by more than 70%.\n\n“If Nikki Haley is smart, she's listening to him, as he sort of gives her advice as to how to position herself with those types of communities,” Moore said. “Fundamentally, I think that's an area where she can really clean up.”\n\nLinda Wells, 65, is among the voters in the state who were turned off by Trump but is drawn to Haley's message. A former business analyst for Fidelity Investments, Wells said she is looking for a candidate who is \"cool, calm, collected, logical and future-focused.”\n\n“I don't want Trump again. I'm tired of the drama,” the Wolfeboro resident said after attending a November town hall for Haley. Just down the road, multimillion dollar mansions, including one owned by Sen. Mitt Romney, surrounded one of the state's premiere summer destinations – Lake Winnipesaukee.\n\nWells, an independent voter, has donated to Haley’s campaign and is considering whether to volunteer for her on Election Day.\n\n“I want somebody fresh and new that will spend her time and energy tackling the issues,” Wells said.\n\nHaley’s big business backing\n\nHaley's business background and popularity with donors drew attacks from other Republicans, including DeSantis and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Both sought to paint the former UN ambassador as beholden to Wall Street.\n\nHaley sat on the board of Boeing after leaving the Trump administration. In 2020, she stepped down over the company’s pursuit of a federal bailout during the pandemic. She’s held several other board positions and has made millions from speaking engagements, private consulting and stock market holdings since leaving office, according to her financial disclosure forms.\n\nBut in New Hampshire, voters such as Glocker say they don’t see her business ties as a liability.\n\nInstead, they look at her professional pedigree, international background and time as a governor as a trifecta for a presidential candidate. In fact, one of the experiences Glocker said he valued most in Haley, a former accountant, was her time working as a bookkeeper for her family’s South Carolina dress store.\n\n“When I first met her, we talked about the challenges of running a small business,” the former Goldman Sachs vice president said, recalling when Haley came into his store after her event over the summer.\n\nThe pair talked like colleagues about the metrics behind the business – sales growth, profit margins, overhead costs – and Glocker said it gave him faith both in Haley’s financial policy plans and her ability to dig into the granular and big picture as president.\n\n“As a small business owner, one of the things is everybody at your firm looks to you for leadership and how to handle a situation,” Glocker said. “I think being honest and blunt, those types of things, is important. And I think Nikki Haley has some of those characteristics.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/23/new-hampshire-primary-2024-live-updates-trump-haley-biden/72309568007/", "title": "NH primary: Donald Trump wins; Nikki Haley vows to stay in race", "text": "Former President Donald Trump defeated former South Carolina Gov.

I think it shows that people feel democracy is threatened, and that we really wanted to give Joe Biden his first victory in the primary season tonight towards November,” said state Sen.

So I'm really pleased by the grassroots enthusiasm.”\n\nWatters is confident this will help Biden as the 2024 cycle continues.\n\n“I think it really has strengthened the Democratic party,” said Watters. “A lot who voted on the Republican side are going to end up voting for us.

She had planned to vote for Democratic candidate Marianne Williamson, but the “state of the world” and learning about the movement to write in \"ceasefire\" changed her mind.\n\nVote Ceasefire is an organization of voters encouraging New Hampshire residents to vote “ceasefire” as a write-in presidential candidate to push President Joe Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nTyler O’Connell, who graduated from UNH this past May, said the conflict is an important issue for her, but she was planning to write in Biden's name.\n\n“There’s a lot of unrest around Palestine and Israel and there have been so many calls for ceasefire that it seems like it’s gone unheard,” said O’Connell, 23. “I know for me personally that’s also something that I’ve been thinking about, but I think overall Biden is still the right person for the job.”\n\nDespite her disagreement, she didn’t really consider writing in ceasefire. “New Hampshire is a very important primary,” she said.\n\n— Margie Cullen\n\nMore:New Hampshire young voters agree on one thing: their lack of excitement for this election\n\nVision-impaired voting technology touted in Exeter\n\nEXETER — Dana Trahan, who is a member of the Coalition of Blind and Vision Impaired Voters in New Hampshire, said the ability to vote without the help of another person reading the ballot felt “empowering.”\n\nTrahan credited the technology called One4All Accessible Voting System, which has a tablet, keyboard, headphones and printer and allows visually impaired residents to vote independently. She noted it is widely offered in presidential votes, but to date only Exeter and Concord in New Hampshire offer it for municipal elections, too.\n\n“I, like everyone else, can go to the polls and exercise my right to vote,” said Trahan. “It could be that a poll worker reads my ballot to me and fills in and they’re not supposed to tell anybody anything, but it just feels so different to go in and do it myself.”\n\nAccording to Trahan, state Rep. Mark Paige, D-Rockingham 11, is working on legislation to strongly encourage other New Hampshire towns and cities to include the One4All system in all municipal and school elections.\n\n“It’s even more important to have the word spread about it,” said Trahan. “This way I can have it read to me over the headphone, use the arrow keys to make my selections and there’s a printer in my booth as well that will fill in the oval. Then I take my paper ballot and turn it in like everyone else.”\n\n— Aqeel Hisham\n\nBiden focuses on abortion rights supporters, union members\n\nAs Trump and Haley fight it out in the New Hampshire primary, Biden and the Democrats are counter-programming with events aimed at key constituencies: Abortion rights supporters and union members.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden − who's not on the ballot in New Hampshire − joined Vice President Kamala Harris and other officials addressing a Virginia audience of \"reproductive rights groups, members of Congress, and grassroots supporters,\" his campaign said.\n\nOn Wednesday, as political professionals assess the New Hampshire results, Biden will address members of the United Auto Workers at its national Community Action Program conference in Washington, D.C.

Chris Sununu Tuesday.\n\nHaley said Trump is “mentally fit,” but she said voters need to ask whether they want “two 80-year-olds” in Trump and President Joe Biden on the ticket in November. Trump is 77.\n\n“When you’ve got a country in disarray and a world on fire the way we do,” Haley said, “you need someone at the top of their game that can put in eight years and get things back on track.”\n\nHaley was trailing Trump in the polls by 22% Tuesday morning, according to an NBC poll. She has lasted longer in the race than other Republicans, however, like Ron DeSantis, who dropped out this week.\n\nTrump said at a rally Monday he expected Haley to drop out of the race Tuesday. Haley said she intended to stay in the race.\n\n“I don’t do what he tells me to do. I’ve never done what he tells me to do,” Haley said.\n\nHaley was asked if she planned to continue to run in the primary in her home state of South Carolina next month if she doesn't get the results she wants in New Hampshire.\n\n\"We’re going to South Carolina. We put in the ad buy,” Haley said. “This has always been a marathon.

At its peak, the line wrapped around the ramp going into the building.\n\nCampaigning outside the polling station while holding his “Write-In Joe Biden” sign was David Mirsky. He described the Democratic National Committee calendar shake-up, which led to Biden not being on the ballot in New Hampshire, as national political “calculations” and “strategy.”\n\n“We’re with them whatever they decide,” said Mirsky, referring to the DNC. “I don’t think there’s any real challenge (for Biden), the other people running in the Democratic Party are not established here. They haven’t made a very reasonable case for being president, the other two.”\n\nContrary, Susan Scannell said the whole voting process “is all about big money and advertising.”\n\n“New Hampshire used to matter,” said Scannell. “We’ve been here for 30-plus years, it was always grassroots.”\n\nExeter is politically known to be a blue town, but Valerie Pevear was adamant voting for former president Donald Trump would “save the future of this country.”\n\n“I’m hoping that he gets in and we have a better economy and I’m sick of paying high gas prices and groceries,” said Pevear. “I’m a single mother of two, and I’m a server… It's taking a toll on me.

Dean Phillips, a Minnesota Democrat challenging President Joe Biden, and advocates of the Write-In Biden campaign outside of a Portsmouth polling place.\n\nChris Liquori, a resident of neighboring Kittery, Maine, is supporting Dean’s longshot candidacy though he can't vote in the New Hampshire primary. Just by putting his name on the ballot, unlike the sitting president, Dean has proven himself to be a superior candidate, he said.\n\n“Joe Biden should be here,” Liquori said. “He should be campaigning, should be asking the people in New Hampshire for their vote.”Wielding Write-In Biden signs next to him were Massachusetts residents Drew Russo and George Varghese, also non-voters in the primary.\n\nRusso expects the majority of Democrats and a strong showing of independent voters will fill in the write-in oval and cast their vote for Biden. The president’s record, with the passing of the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, should be enough to warrant another four years, Russo said.\n\n“He has restored America in terms of what he's done to help the economy rebound, especially after the pandemic. He's brought stability and decency to the White House,” Russo continued. “And you know, Joe Biden didn't do terribly well here in the New Hampshire primary four years ago. But in the fall, he won a very commanding victory over Donald Trump. I think we're going to see that happen this year.”\n\n— Ian Lenahan\n\nPortsmouth Ward 1 has special election, too\n\nPORTSMOUTH — In Portsmouth voting Ward 1 at New Franklin School, there is a special primary election for a New Hampshire House of Representatives seat on the ballot Tuesday in addition to the presidential primary.\n\nTwo Democrats, former state Rep. Jacqueline Cali-Pitts and public health researcher Jennifer Mandelbaum, are running for the Rockingham County District 21 House position vacated last month. The winner of this primary will run unopposed in the March 12 special election as no Republicans filed for election.\n\nA total of 464 ballots had been cast at 10 a.m. According to ward moderator Steve Pesci, most candidates were taking two ballots into each voting booth - one for their preferred presidential candidate’s political party, and the other for the state representative seat, which features two Democrats and no declared Republicans.\n\n“It’s unique,” he said.\n\nThe New Hampshire secretary of state has given the ward permission to release results of one race before others, if not all are tallied up at once.\n\n“We’re going to follow that protocol if it seems rational,” Pesci said.\n\nIf the Democratic write-in campaign for President Joe Biden is successful, poll workers may have a long evening ahead of them hand counting.\n\n“I think we're all very curious about what today's going to be like. I think we're going to have good turnout, especially amongst Republicans,” Pesci said.\n\n— Ian Lenahan\n\nSomersworth moderator reports steady undeclared voter turnout\n\nSOMERSWORTH — Ward 1 Somersworth moderator Bonnie McNair said about 360 votes had been cast by noon, with 1,670 registered voters in the ward.\n\n\"It's been fairly steady, much less than I expected,\" she said.\" A lot of people are declared independents and many are asking for a Republican ballot.\"\n\nMcNair said several people told her they had received robocalls telling them their vote didn't mean anything.

She added there has been a steady stream of new voters that registered.\n\nVivienne Authement, first-time voter, said that it’s important for her to vote to get her voice out and be heard. She said more young voters should be aware of decisions that would have an influence on them in the long run.\n\n“I keep an eye on the news regularly and the events happening throughout the world,” said Authement. “I did my research pretty heavily on both parties and all the candidates that would be on either ballot and made my informed decision from that and who I thought would be the best for the country.”\n\nThough New Hampshire is a purple state, Stratham is considered to be a “blue town.” However, according to Bakie, as of 3:30 p.m., more Republican ballots were cast compared to Democrats.\n\nDonald Trump supporter John Baker said “there isn’t a lot for them Democrats to come and vote for right now.”\n\nOn the battle between Trump and Former South Carolina Governor Nicki Haley, Baker said the former has “already got the experience” and “already shown what he can do.”\n\n“I think that’s what we need right now,” said Baker. “I think any of the Republican candidates would have been a better choice than our current president… but he’s (Trump) going to be the best one to get this turned around quicker.”\n\nHowever, Betty Smith, a Haley supporter, said Trump is not leading by example.\n\n“(Haley's) positive, she’s always upbeat and Trump is always knocking people down,” said Smith.\n\n— Aqeel Hisham\n\nFormer state Sen.

That may result in a smaller turnout this year, in a race heavily focused on the Republican race, according to Town Administrator Todd Selig and Town Clerk Rachel Deane.\n\nIn 2012, fewer than 2,000 people voted in the presidential primary in Durham with Democratic incumbent President Barack Obama facing no serious competition. But in the last two election cycles, 2016 and 2020, Durham saw a big jump with between 5,000 and 6,000 voters.\n\nThe 2020 race had a competitive Democratic primary. Deane said of same-day registrations that year, 92 registered as Republicans, 710 as Democrat, and 654 as undeclared. In total, 1,456 voters registered on primary day.\n\nWhat complicates predicting this cycle is the write-in campaign for Biden.\n\n“There are a lot of people in New Hampshire who are very upset about the efforts of the Democratic National Committee to strip New Hampshire of its first in the nation status. That is clear,” said Selig. “But it’s unclear how that will impact participation at the polls.”\n\nDeane said Durham is right on track with with absentee ballot requests: In 2020, there were 400 and there were 350 in 2024 as of Monday, with more expected.\n\n— Margie Cullen\n\nTwo local NH House seats on the ballot\n\nSpecial elections are being held for two New Hampshire House seats today.\n\nIn Newington and in Portsmouth Ward 1, two Democrats from Portsmouth, former state Rep.

The winner of this primary will run unopposed in the March 12 special election as no Republicans filed for election.\n\nFormer state Rep. Robin Vogt, a Democrat formerly of Portsmouth, held the seat but resigned on Dec. 1 when he moved to Durham. Cali-Pitts occupied the House seat from 1998 until she was upset by Vogt in the fall 2022 primary.\n\nLee and Madbury residents, as well as voters from Ward 4 in Dover, will vote for a new representative following the death of former state Rep.

And I would say, you mean the guy that I beat when I ran for governor?\" she said to cheering. \"Yeah, that’s what I thought.\"\n\nMadbury resident Dan Holmes, 51, said Haley has shown \"good character\" throughout the campaign and his entire family is supporting her. DeSantis' exit should help her on Tuesday, said the software company worker.\n\n\"It will narrow the field a little bit,\" Holmes added. \"He was not gaining momentum in this state. This is a super important state to demonstrate your abilities as a candidate. To show that you can develop a relationship with the voters. And he hadn't really shown much ability of that.\"\n\nHaley gave extended remarks on national security in Exeter, in place of her traditional stump speech, promising to recoup land that Chinese companies have purchased in the U.S. and end normal trade relations until Xi Jinping’s government \"stops murdering Americans.\"\n\n\"Don't let Biden tell you that China's a competitor,\" she said. \"They never saw us as a competitor: they always saw us an enemy. We've got to start looking at them they way they look at us.\"\n\nHaley was at one point interrupted by a protester who held up a yellow sign calling her an \"oil sellout.\" She said in Exeter, as she did at a previous New Hampshire event, that she is “always happy to see a protester” because her deployed husband, Michael, and other service members are putting their lives on the line for their freedom of speech.\n\n\"I will beat Donald Trump and Joe Biden,\" she pledged. \"We can do this.

She is going into a buzzsaw.”\n\nIt's Nikki Haley's turn in the barrel, as the former president and his supporters turn their fire on his last remaining challenger. In his New Hampshire victory speech on Tuesday night, Trump – who faces four felony indictments in federal and state courts – went after his former U.N. ambassador’s character and her appearance, and suggested without evidence that Haley was ripe for a criminal investigation.\n\n“I don’t get too angry,\" Trump said. \"I get even.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMore:Nikki Haley says America was never racist.

Does she have a chance to beat him?\n\nReveling in a reputation for dirty tricks\n\nThe Palmetto State has a long list of campaign outrages, some attributed to the late GOP strategist Lee Atwater, who worked for President George H.W. Bush in the 1980s. Atwater died in 1991, but his so-called \"dark arts\" live on.\n\nIn 2000, after defeating George W. Bush in New Hampshire, Arizona Sen. John McCain was attacked in South Carolina through a telephone poll that asked Republican voters, \"Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain…if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate Black child?\" (McCain and his wife had adopted a daughter from Bangladesh.)\n\n\"Our state has been infamous for its last-minute dirty tricks, anonymous phone calls, and personal attacks,\" Haley wrote in her 2012 memoir. \"It’s largely the work of a few consultants and politicians... But their twisted tactics don’t reflect the views of the vast majority of the people of South Carolina, or even most who participate in the political process.\"\n\nIn 2010, during her first run for governor, Haley was slimed by a political blogger and a consultant working for one of her primary opponents, both of whom claimed to have had affairs with the married politician. She was called a “raghead” because her parents are Indian immigrants who practice the Sikh religion.\n\nMore:'We don't want them': Trump threatens to blacklist Haley donors\n\n“Nearly every important South Carolina race has allegations of a love child or someone who’s in the closet,” Wilson said. “It’s a tradition that would shock the normies in other states.\"\n\nIn a CNN interview on Wednesday, South Carolina’s Republican chairman seemed to revel in his state’s reputation − while making a veiled warning to the Haley camp.\n\n“Someone once said, ‘Politics ain’t beanbag,’ and that’s true, especially here in South Carolina,” said state GOP Chair Drew McKissick, who also serves as the Trump-backed co-chair of the Republican National Committee, said. “We have sharp elbows.”\n\n“The McCain-Bush primary is legendary,” McKissick continued. “We could potentially see that same type of thing here, possibly,” he said of the Trump-Haley showdown. “Or, you know, somebody might make a decision about a change of course between now and then.”\n\nMore:Hanging on after New Hampshire, Nikki Haley turns to home state of South Carolina\n\nPolitical 'blood sport'\n\nHaley’s supporters say she’s ready for whatever’s coming.\n\n“I mean, that's their decision as far as the blood sport nature of this,” said Mark Harris, a strategist for SFA Fund Inc., a super-PAC that’s backing Haley. “But Nikki Haley grew up in the reality of South Carolina politics, won a primary election that she was not supposed to win in her first house race, and then won a primary election she wasn't supposed to win in her first governor's race.”\n\nOn Wednesday, the ABC News-538 polling average showed Trump with the support of 62% of Republican voters in South Carolina, to Haley’s 25%.\n\n“It’s an uphill battle,” said Gibbs Knotts, a professor of political science at the College of Charleston. “She’s got a month to work on this. I don’t know if there are enough persuadables.”\n\n“The stakes are so high,” Knotts said. “It’s a make-or-break state.”\n\nRelated:The Smiths guitarist calls for Donald Trump to 'shut down' using band's music at rallies\n\n\"Wherever she may come from'\n\nAnd the former president is keen to break Haley.\n\nTrump has highlighted Haley’s Indian ancestry, calling her “Nimbra” and other manglings of her full name, Nimrata Nikki Haley. (Haley has gone by Nikki her entire life.) Asked to explain, he told Fox News’ Bret Baier it was all in fun – while again questioning the American-born challenger’s citizenship.\n\n\"It's a little bit of a takeoff on her name,” Trump said. “You know, her name, wherever she may come from.\"\n\nMore:How Donald Trump's campaign schedule is headed full speed for a crash with his court dates\n\nHaley has focused on Trump’s age after he appeared to repeatedly confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at a weekend campaign rally where he touched on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. “Nikki Haley is in charge of security,” he said. “We offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, national guards, whatever they want.”\n\n“I mean, look, we’ve seen him get confused,” Haley told CNN. “He was confused about me having something to do with keeping security away from the Capitol. Clearly, he was talking about someone else.”\n\nThose shots may seem timid compared with what’s to come – unless Haley takes the GOP’s hint and withdraws.\n\n“It’s an incredibly ugly campaign the Trump folks are going to run,” Wilson said.\n\nSo far, Haley isn’t backing down.\n\nThe former governor is “consistently familiar with how to win in the sort of bare-knuckle arena that is South Carolina politics,” Harris told reporters.\n\nContributing: Karissa Waddick, USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/south-carolina/2022/11/17/trump-announced-2024-run-a-poll-shows-nikki-haley-as-a-big-challenger/69650502007/", "title": "Trump announced 2024 run. A poll shows Nikki Haley as a big ...", "text": "After months of speculation, the central question of \"Will he? Won't he?\" was finally answered Tuesday night. Former President Donald Trump announced he would be running in 2024 for another term in the White House in a special event hosted at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nWhile several GOP contenders are considering running, it is too early to say whether the field will be as crowded as it was in 2016, when Trump first ran. Already, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, one of the hopefuls, bowed out citing \"family concerns,\" as reported by Politico.\n\nBut in South Carolina, which has so far been a major stronghold for the former president, a Nov. 2022 poll by Winthrop University showed that Trump could possibly face some competition in the state for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nEven as she hasn't formally announced a run, half of the Republican voters in SC think that former SC Gov. Nikki Haley should run for president in 2024, the latest poll said.\n\nPollsters asked respondents who they would support if both Nikki Haley and former President Donald Trump ran for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2024.\n\nSC Republican voters, about 45% of the ones polled, favored Trump. However, about 37% picked Haley −an eight percentage point difference that is the first indication of Haley's regional influence. The margin of error in the statistical analysis of the responses was around 5%, which means that Haley and Trump are very close in competition, said Winthrop Poll Director Scott Huffmon.\n\n\"She's still she's a very popular figure in Republican circles. She was the governor of the state, she left the Trump administration without too many scars and scrapes and she's considered to be by many at least one of the rising figures,\" said longtime South Carolina based political consultant Chip Felkel.\n\n“Haley has a strong showing against the former president, who is popular within his party,\" Huffmon said in another press statement and in sync with Felkel. \"Since this was conducted before the disappointing midterm results, for which many Republicans blame Trump, her star may have risen even further.”\n\nThe 2022 mid-term elections saw several high-profile Trump-endorsed candidates losing competitive races in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan and threw into question Trump's dominance in the Republican Party. USA Today has reported instances where Trump's closest allies advised him not to announce his candidacy so early in the election cycle.\n\nAs for statewide officials, hours after his announcement, the Post and Courier reported that Gov. Henry McMaster had endorsed the former president.\n\nBut could his announcements deter challengers?\n\nBack in 2021, Haley told the Associated Press that she would not consider running in 2024 if Trump announced a second run.\n\nBoth Haley and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-SC, based on their travels to states such as Iowa and New Hampshire that host Republican primaries, have showcased a pattern of fundraising and building connections suited to a major national player and pushed them into the spotlight as presidential hopefuls for 2024.\n\nOffices and spokespersons for Haley and Scott have not yet returned calls and emails from The Greenville News about reactions to Trump's announcement.\n\n\"We need to have a competitive, healthy primary process,\" Felkel said. \"And it's certainly my hope that whether it's Haley or Ron DeSantis from Florida, or Asa Hutchinson from Arkansas, or Scott, that they would they would recognize that the there's time to turn the page and they would not let Trump's presence deter them.\"\n\nDuring the midterm elections in SC, a mix of Trump-endorsed candidates sailed to victory in races that either ran unopposed or were focused on partisan voting. Some of these candidates, like newly elected U.S. House Rep. Russell Fry, were first-time challengers. While some, such as Gov. Henry McMaster, were incumbents.\n\nBut where regional influence was pitted against national rhetoric, especially during the June 14 primaries, where Trump-backed Katie Arrington lost to U.S. House Rep.

Nikki Haley announced a a 2024 run for president Tuesday, Feb. 14 via her Twitter feed.\n\nAs former SC. Gov. Nikki Haley prepares to enter the presidential fray, GOP operatives and political observers in Greenville and Spartanburg said the next few months will be part of a waiting game.\n\nHaley, they said, was a formidable politician. But could she prove to be more electable and desirable than former President Donald Trump to South Carolina voters?\n\n“A lot of voters will be a little loyal to Trump based on his accomplishments and based on fighting the fight we wanted him to fight as far as issues,” said former Greenville GOP chair Nate Leupp. “But then, we also want to have the best chance in the November elections.”\n\nLeupp said he is not convinced, yet, of Trump's electability in the general election, but if he had to vote today, he would vote for Trump in the presidential primary.\n\n“Unless someone else shows me they can do what Trump did and are more electable,” he said.\n\nCurt Smith, chairman of the Spartanburg County Republican Party, said Haley will have to have a strong showing in South Carolina to have a chance at overcoming Trump.\n\n\"Nikki Haley is a very popular person in South Carolina, but Mr. Trump is extremely popular here,\" Smith said. \"She's going to have to show she has strength here. If she doesn't have strength in South Carolina, she's not going anywhere.\"\n\nLast week, Smith attended an event in the SC Statehouse where Trump introduced his South Carolina leadership team and received endorsements from Sen. Lindsey Graham, 4th District Congressman William Timmons, Gov. Henry McMaster and former state Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer.\n\nThe main difference between Haley and Trump, he said, was experience.\n\n\"Mr. Trump is far more of a business person, able to look through issues and forward,\" Smith continued. \"Nikki cannot drain the swamp and get corruption out of Washington, where Mr. Trump could.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence are also expected to join the GOP presidential race.\n\nRecent SC polls show Donald Trump's potential GOP competitors gaining ground\n\nIn the last election cycle, former President Donald Trump's presidential candidacy seemed to be a no-brainer. Several state GOP parties, including the South Carolina Republican Party, canceled their 2020 primaries citing the need to save taxpayer dollars since it was going to be an easy win for Trump.\n\nBut recent polls by SC Policy Council and Winthrop University signal an opening for other candidates to potentially challenge Trump's dominance.\n\nThe SC Policy Council polled 386 likely 2024 SC Republican primary voters and found that only 37% said the GOP should pick Trump in 2024, while 47% said the GOP should nominate someone else.\n\nIn a head to head contest, 52% of the voters said they would vote for DeSantis over Trump, the poll data released Jan. 27 showed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Winthrop poll showed a close contest between Haley and Trump. Among those likely to vote Republican, about 45% of the ones polled, favored Trump. However, about 37% picked Haley. The margin of error in the statistical analysis of the responses was around 5%.\n\nDanielle Vinson, a political science professor at Furman University, said it will be important to see how Haley navigates her views about Trump.\n\n\"When she was governor, she didn't endorse him in the primary. She spoke out against him at times during that year. In 2016, she kept a little bit of arm's distance between her and him while she was in the administration as the UN ambassador, but then after she left, she was actually pretty vocally supportive of him at times.\"\n\nSome political analysts have said Haley may be a vice presidential contender. But Vinson is not convinced.\n\n\"I don't think being Trump's Vice President is the way to set yourself up to be President of the United States, and I really think that what she wants to do,\" Vinson said.\n\nSmith said he has not heard that Haley is angling to be vice president.\n\n\"Everybody's speculating,\" Smith said. \"Nobody knows what's in her head or what's going to happen when she gets in the race. It will be interesting if she doesn't attack Mr. Trump.\n\n\"Kamala Harris was out of the race early, and she became vice president. Anything can happen.\n\nTrump is also facing a legion of lawsuits and DeSantis rising in the early New Hampshire polls.\n\n\"If Trump continues to look weak, people who like Trump's style may not find Nikki Haley all that appealing and may prefer DeSantis.\"\n\nBut Vinson said Haley should do well among suburban women voters in a way that DeSantis may not. In terms of her ideology, there are no questions about her Conservatism, Vinson said.\n\nThe jury's out on whether Haley can prevail in what could be a crowded primary.\n\n\"My overall view of Haley is that she has always been the underdog and she's always ended up winning,\" Leupp said. \"It's also very significant because I believe she will probably be one of the best female presidential candidates the GOP side has ever had.\"\n\nDevyani Chhetri covers South Carolina and national politics for the Greenville News.

Of those, 356,000 people who have been vaccinated only once can be released from lockdown if they show a negative PCR test.\n\nFines of between €500 (£421) and €3,600 (£3,034) can be levied if a person is found to have breached the rules.\n\nThe Guardian reported that “a long list of exceptions has led critics to warn that the partial lockdown will be difficult to enforce”. Activities that allow unvaccinated people to leave lockdown include “essential shopping and outdoor physical exercise”, as well as to “satisfy their basic religious needs”.\n\nNeighbouring Germany has also signalled that it may “reintroduce some restrictions on social gatherings and checks of vaccine status or test results on public transport in an attempt to curb rising infection rates”, the paper added.\n\nThe two-tier restrictions “spurred a jab surge”, said The Independent. But “frustration simmers” below the surface and “many unvaccinated Austrians are standing firm”.\n\nMore than 462,000 have come forward for jabs since the plan was announced, according to government data. But “a vocal minority” remain “unlikely to get jabbed amid doubts about the effectiveness of the new restrictions”, the paper added.\n\nThe plan has ushered in a lockdown “​​​​without precedent”, and will “likely spur more criticism” of the government “and embolden Austria’s anti-lockdown protestors”.\n\nIn France, where protests against mandatory vaccination have become a regular fixture, Le Monde also described the partial lockdown as “unprecedented”, adding that the number of patients being admitted to hospital “sounded the alarm bell”.\n\nCentre-left newspaper Libération said the measures mean unvaccinated Austrians now “face a wall”, describing the options as “booster or confinement”.\n\nAustria’s largest newspaper, Kronen Zeitung, said the measures were part of an effort to give “vaccinated people as much freedom as possible”, adding that encouraging vaccinations could mean “the winter season can be saved” amid surging cases.\n\nThe paper also quoted a nurse who described “corpses parked” in the corridors of medical facilities, adding that the situation in hospitals paints a “depressing picture”.\n\nIn a comment piece for German red-top Bild, Filipp Piatov said that measures are an effort to “intimidate” Austrians into getting vaccinated, adding that the country which has “long been considered a blueprint for Germany” is setting a “daunting example”.\n\nAdding that young people are being “put under massive pressure to get vaccinated against a virus that is hardly dangerous for them”, Piatov argued that “this policy against children and young people must not” be introduced in neighbouring Germany.\n\nCentre-right broadsheet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung took a more measured tone, describing the measures as an “emergency brake” as “intensive care units threaten to reach their limits”. Adding that Germany “declared Austria a high-risk area” on Sunday, the paper said that the country’s infection “numbers speak a clear language”.\n\nDeutsche Welle (DW) said that “thousands” of people took to the streets to “protest what they say is a vaccine mandate by the back door”. Protestors “chanted for their freedom outside of a fortified chancellery”, making their “hostility to the new lockdown heard”.\n\nOne woman told DW: “I am here today because I want to fight for my rights, these measures are absolutely discriminatory. Starting with the legal obligation for health workers to be vaccinated, which occupational group will be forced next?\n\n“My body, our bodies, we have the right to decide.”\n\nDW added that “not all are opposed”, with one man stating: “All unvaccinated people should get vaccinated because they don’t know what damage they could cause.”\n\nThe New York Times (NYT) reported that countries across Europe “are introducing increasingly targeted restrictions against the unvaccinated who are driving another wave of contagion”, adding that Austria has taken “the toughest line yet”.\n\nDescribing those who refuse the jab as “putting economic recoveries, public health and an eventual return to pre-pandemic freedoms at risk”, the paper said: “Austria’s step fit[ted] a pattern of governments across Europe passing rules to make life harder for the unvaccinated, with the goal of motivating people to get a shot.\n\n“Taken together, the measures are a bleak and clear sign that a virus that however fleetingly seemed a piece of European history was still very much part of its present and future.”\n\nThe Washington Post called the restrictions “the most drastic of a string of measures being taken by European governments to get a massive regional resurgence of the virus under control”.\n\nContinuing that “the Austrian government’s next move may well be to tighten the screws”, the paper added that “one proposal is limits on going out at night that would also apply to the vaccinated”.\n\nComments made by Arne Duncan, who served as education secretary in the Obama administration, led Fox News’s coverage. She was “criticised on social media” after “praising” the measures in Austria, the broadcaster said, “raising questions on whether a similar policy could be embraced by other countries”.\n\nAdding that Duncan “is not part of the Biden administration”, the broadcaster said the Austrian restrictions “raised new questions about the liberties that unvaccinated Americans will have as the virus continues to circulate into the winter months”.\n\nThere is no evidence that Joe Biden is considering similar measures.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Harold Maass", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Devika Rao", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet"], "publish_date": "2021/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/961101/the-curious-return-of-fast-fashion", "title": "The curious return of fast fashion | The Week", "text": "In Chile, something peculiar is happening when it comes to fashion – and the results can be seen from outer space.\n\nSlowly but surely, a “giant dump” of unused clothing is piling up in the Atacama Desert, and this is “now clearly visible to satellites”, Insider reported.\n\nThis is a so-called “fast fashion landfill”, where discarded or unused clothing is accumulating, reaching 39,000 tons so far, the website added.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

These rubbish dumps are comprised of clothes from all over the world, and cannot be disposed of in a safe manner as it is “not biodegradable and has chemical products”.\n\nThe United Nations warned the result is an “environmental and social emergency”. But in the place where “fast fashion goes to die”, the matter continues to spiral out of control – and the “scale is breathtaking”, National Geographic added.\n\n‘High human cost’\n\nThe fast fashion problem extends globally. Ghanaian clothes traders have visited Brussels to warn of the “‘environmental catastrophe’ of dumping vast amounts of textiles in the west African country”, said The Guardian.\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 100 tonnes of second-hand clothing is discarded every day in the nation’s capital, Accra, the newspaper added, and fast fashion producers are being urged to shoulder the blame.\n\nThe fashion industry is “responsible for 8-10% of global emissions”. There are growing fears about how fast fashion could impact climate change, the BBC reported, with the use of raw materials being the number one culprit.\n\nCotton is estimated to use “about 2.5% of the world’s farmland”, while the production process for clothing requires “43 million tonnes of chemicals a year”, the broadcaster said.\n\nWith clothes produced at a faster rate, companies are churning out waste and using valuable resources in larger quantities.\n\nSimilar landfill mountains have been observed in Nairobi, Kenya, reported the Daily Mail, as exporting junk clothes to less developed countries “has become an ‘escape valve’ for ‘systemic overproduction’”. Investigators said the “stealth waste stream should be illegal”.\n\nA lack of workers’ rights and poor working conditions have also been cited as a symptom and side effect of fast fashion, with sweatshops and textile factories under the spotlight.\n\n“My fingers were bleeding, but they forced me to work gruelling hours for less than two dollars a day,” Nasreen Sheikh, a Nepalese former child labourer, told El País. The then nine-year-old “slept, ate and worked in the same room”, and now “denounces the high human cost of fast fashion in the Global North”.\n\nFast fashion’s ‘curious comeback’\n\n“If consumers want to keep up with the Jones’, or the Kardashians, who is anyone to say them nay?” argued Walter Block in an article for the Foundation for Economic Education.\n\nFor Block, fast fashion is not “an example of capitalism gone wild”, despite the “present hissy fit” to the contrary. Instead, criticisms of fast fashion “often crumble in the face of basic economics”.\n\nThose who spearhead so-called fast fashion brands have also defended their processes. John Lyttle, CEO of Boohoo, told BBC Radio 5 Live’s “Wake Up to Money” in 2021 that immediacy is the “biggest trend”.\n\nIt is a “curious comeback” for fast fashion, said The Wall Street Journal, but one that can be attributed to the online apparel retailer Shein. The store brought in “$23 billion of revenue” last year, making it “worth more than H&M and Zara combined”, the paper reported.\n\nThe demand for these brands remains high, as Shein plans to “open 30 stores this year to rival Primark”, said the Daily Mirror. “The temporary stores will open across the EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region as Shein looks to increase its high street presence”, the newspaper added.\n\nShein, though, is also under the microscope “for its alleged reliance on supply chains that run through the Xinjiang region of China, the site of widespread human rights abuses against the Uyghur minority”, said Politico.", "authors": ["Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Harold Maass", "Richard Windsor", "Devika Rao", "Harriet Marsden", "Julia O'Driscoll"], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/technology/960836/good-news-stories-about-ai", "title": "Eight good news stories about AI | The Week", "text": "The rapid spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) programmes is sparking doomsday predictions ranging from mass lay-offs to the end of humankind.\n\nAccording to the latest Artificial Intelligence Index from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, public scepticism about the potential benefits of AI is highest in Western countries such as the UK, Germany, France and US, the home of Silicon Valley. By contrast, the overwhelming majority of people from the world’s two most populus nations, China and India, felt that the positives of AI outweighed the drawback.\n\nLike any major technological advancement, the impact of AI will be mixed.

The 1859 \"Carrington Event\", named after Richard Carrington, the British astronomer who documented it, disrupted the planet's communications systems, causing pylons to spark and giving electric shocks to telegraph operators.\n\nToday, a solar storm of a similar scale would be potentially \"catastrophic\", said The Telegraph . \"Such is the modern world's reliance on vulnerable electrical power and communications systems, a direct hit would [have] economic and social consequences comparable to those of the recent pandemic\".\n\nUsing AI to make predictions about solar storms is \"extremely important\", said Science Alert . The \"combined speed of prediction with the ability to apply those predictions to an entire globe makes Dagger a considerable step forward\".\n\nImproving education\n\nProminent tech companies, executives and billionaires have been hailing AI chatbots as \"education game-changers\", said The New York Times . The tools, they say, will \"revolutionise, and automatically personalise, student learning\".\n\nAccording to Forbes , AI teaching offers numerous advantages, including the ability to act like an \"infinitely patient grandmother, never rushing or giving up and going on to the next thing\". It could also improve retention, by personalising learning to make sure information is going in.\n\nDespite this, the release of AI tools like ChatGPT, created an \"initial panic from the education sector [which] was understandable\", said MIT Technology Review . Several leading universities in the UK, including Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge, warned students against using ChatGPT to cheat.\n\nBut after the concern died down, the outlook has gradually become \"a lot less bleak\". Universities have embraced the fact that advanced chatbots \"could be used as powerful classroom aids that make lessons more interactive, teach students media literacy, generate personalised lesson plans, save teachers time on admin, and more\".\n\nConsequently, MIT said, it looks likely that \"ChatGPT is going to change education, not destroy it.\"\n\nMind-reading for health gains\n\n\"One of AI’s biggest potential benefits is to help people stay healthy so they don’t need a doctor, or at least not as often,\" said PWC. AI is already being used to detect diseases earlier and with \"more accuracy\". For example, AI software can interpret mammograms and translate patient data into diagnostic information to determine breast cancer risk \"30 times faster\" than human doctors, \"with 99% accuracy, reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies\".\n\nUS researchers are also developing an AI-decoder that can translate brain activity into a continuous stream of text, \"a breakthrough that allows a person’s thoughts to be read non-invasively for the first time\", reported The Guardian’s science correspondent Hannah Devlin. The advance, outlined in a paper in Nature Neuroscience, raises the prospect of new ways to restore speech in patients struggling to communicate due to a stroke or motor neurone disease.\n\nAnalysing climate data\n\nAI \"as a tool is uniquely positioned to help manage\" the \"complex issues\" surrounding climate change and its impact on environmental, social and economic systems worldwide, said Boston Consulting Group. AI programmes can \"gather, complete and interpret large, complex datasets on emissions\" and more, and \"help identify the most at-risk regions\".\n\nMore specifically, AI can be used in hazard forecasting for long-term events such as sea-level rises, and for immediate, extreme events such as hurricanes. For example, the World Economic Forum reported that an application by San Francisco-based company Pano AI scans video feeds from mountaintop cameras to \"detect wildfires, alert homeowners and assist fire crews in controlling the fires\".\n\nDetecting infant blindness\n\nA recent AI-led breakthrough could pave the way to more effectively detect a leading cause of blindness in children. In a study published in The Lancet Digital Health, an international team of scientists and clinicians revealed how they had developed a deep learning model to identify which at-risk infants have retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The condition occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in the retina of premature babies, and can lead to blindness if left untreated.\n\n\"Symptoms of ROP cannot be seen by the naked eye, meaning the only way to identify the condition is by monitoring infants at risk with eye exams,\" said University College London, which co-led the study. But an AI tool that was trained using thousands of images of the eyes of newborns \"was found to be as effective as senior pediatric ophthalmologists in discriminating normal retinal images from those with ROP”.\n\nDecoding animal language\n\nAI and machine learning has long helped analyse and translate human language, but now researchers are making major steps in decoding how animals communicate, which experts say could significantly advance ecological research and conservation efforts. For instance, in 2021, researchers used audio recordings to identify a new species of blue whales in the Indian Ocean. \"Each blue whale population has a distinct vocal signature, which can be used to distinguish and monitor different ‘acoustic populations’ or ‘acoustic groups’,\" the international team explained in an article in Nature.\n\nCalifornia-based non-profit Earth Species Project (ESP) is also using AI to identify patterns in large data sets of visual, oral and physical animal communications. CEO and co-founder Katie Zacarian told the World Economic Forum earlier this year that with the progress being made, \"we are moving rapidly toward a world in which two-way communication with another species is likely\".\n\nHelping with grief\n\nAI-powered technology is also being used to \"develop chatbot avatars of people’s deceased relatives, preserving their memories and helping with grief\", reported Euronews.\n\nIn 2021, an article in the San Francisco Chronicle detailing how a freelance writer trained an AI chatbot to impersonate his dead fiance received widespread attention. Less than two years later, as advanced AI programmes such as ChatGPT emerge, \"grief tech\" is a rapidly expanding field.\n\nCalifornia-based company HereAfter AI invites users to upload audio, images and videos of late loved ones to an app to create a \"life story avatar\" that chats on demand in the voice of the deceased. Another California start-up, StoryFile, \"records footage and audio prior to a person’s death and then makes it interactive through the power of conversational AI and a holographic avatar\", said Euronews.\n\nLucy Selman, associate professor in palliative and end-of-life care at Bristol University, told the Financial Times that tackling grief in such ways \"won’t be for everyone\". Research was needed into the ethics of such AI-powered tech and whether it might be harmful in delaying or prolonging grief, she said, but it is an “interesting advance\".\n\nProtecting rivers\n\nProponents of AI say it has a multiplicity of positive uses; and now wildlife experts have identified a new one. They say the kind of facial recognition technology that is used at airports could be adapted to prevent invasive fish from colonising British rivers. There is growing concern that pink salmon are establishing breeding colonies in UK rivers, threatening native Atlantic salmon and potentially disrupting fragile ecosystems, reported The Telegraph. Norwegian experts have had similar concerns – and have developed AI river gates to keep the fish out. The software has been trained to recognise the distinct features of the invaders. If the AI concludes that the fish coming up the river are Atlantic salmon, the gates open. If it decides they are pink salmon (which have distinctive humped backs), the gates stay closed and the fish are diverted to a holding tank and taken back out to sea.\n\nIntroduced into Russian rivers in the 1950s, pink salmon were rarely observed in British rivers until 2015, but 200 have been seen since then, and last year, their smolts (young salmon) were found in two Scottish rivers for the first time. In Norway, numbers reached 100,000 in 2021, and they are likely to hit a million this year.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "Theara Coleman", "Devika Rao", "Elliott Goat", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/16"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/technology/955603/what-is-the-quantum-apocalypse", "title": "What is the quantum apocalypse? | The Week", "text": "Cybersecurity experts have been warning of something called the \"quantum apocalypse\" – the point when quantum computers become a reality and render most methods of internet encryption useless.\n\nIf you imagine a standard computer to be like a horse and cart, explained the BBC, then quantum computing – a new and more powerful way of processing information based on quantum physics – is \"more like a sports car – a huge leap forward\".\n\nThe practical implications of such machines are enormous. John Thornhill in the Financial Times said some companies are already looking at combining rudimentary quantum computers and regular computers \"to optimise port logistics, airline schedules, grocery deliveries and television advertising programming, for example\". Looking longer-term it is hoped that the sophistication of quantum computers could enable scientists to design new chemicals, paving the way for advanced medicines and materials. It could also help weather forecasts and stock trades, and even combat global warming.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nBut, warned Thornhill, \"the serious threats of quantum computing may emerge quicker than its possibilities\".\n\nWhat could happen?\n\nThis is what the BBC has described as the \"dark side\" to quantum computing. Current computers would take years, decades and even centuries to crack the encryption codes created by today's machines, but the fact that a quantum computer could theoretically do this in \"just seconds\" poses an enormous cybersecurity risk.\n\nSecurity experts warn of the dangers of Q-Day, when a quantum computer might crack the RSA cryptosystem: an algorithm written in 1994 by the mathematician Peter Shor that underpins much of the modern internet and is used by the likes of tech companies, banks and governments to protect their data.\n\nThe notion of all the world's most encrypted files – from WhatsApp messages to online banking to government data – suddenly being broken into thanks to the advent of quantum computing is known as the \"quantum apocalypse\".\n\nThe quantum apocalypse could also mark the end of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, as it would make the blockchain network – which is considered to be pretty much hack-proof – insecure. UK cybersecurity firm Post Quantum has said that if measures are not put in place, then \"bitcoin will expire the very day the first quantum computer appears\".\n\nWhen will it happen?\n\nThere is a fierce debate about how far we are from developing full quantum computing. A leaked Google research paper published in 2019 suggested that a computer designed by the tech giant had achieved \"quantum supremacy\" and Google claims this has again been achieved this Summer. In what Telecom TV described as a \"flashily impressive\" exercise, Google said the latest version of its Sycamore computer being 241 times more powerful than the Sycamore of 2019. This, Google said, puts it “beyond capabilities of existing classical supercomputers”.\n\nMost agree, however, that it will be at least another decade or more before we have a quantum computer stable enough to run Shor's algorithm.\n\nTim Callan, chief compliance officer at cybersecurity firm Sectigo, warned The Independent that quantum computers could reach the point of defeating our current encryption systems within \"the next 10 or 15 years\".\n\nWhen that happens, \"our modern systems of finance, commerce, communication, transportation, manufacturing, energy, government, and healthcare will for all intents and purposes cease to function,\" he added.\n\n\"The old joke that quantum computing is a technology of the future – and will forever remain so – is not so funny any more,\" Thornhill said.\n\nCould it be solved?\n\nBut it's not all doom and gloom. As data scientists make advances in the world of quantum computing, they're also working to create quantum-resistant algorithms to protect our digital footprints.\n\nIn the UK, all \"top secret\" government data has already been classified as \"post-quantum\", said the BBC. This means that it uses new forms of encryption that scientists believe will stand up to quantum computers.\n\n\"If we weren't doing anything to combat [the 'quantum apocalypse'] then bad things would happen,\" an unnamed Whitehall official told the broadcaster.\n\nNone of this comes cheap. The UK has invested millions into the industry over the last few years and that amount is only going to rise. But if you listen to the experts, the consequences of the \"quantum apocalypse\" could be so catastrophic that advancing our current systems of encryption is most definitely money well spent.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Rebekah Evans", "Harriet Marsden", "Richard Windsor", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/952773/links-between-bill-gates-jeffrey-epstein-examined", "title": "The links between Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gates explained | The Week", "text": "Bill Gates has admitted that fundraising meetings held with the late-billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein were a “huge mistake”.\n\nDiscussing the role that his relationship with Epstein played in his divorce from Melinda Gates, the Microsoft billionaire told The Sunday Times that “at the time” he “didn’t realise that by having those meetings it would be seen as giving [Epstein] credibility”.\n\n“You’re almost saying, ‘I forgive that type of behaviour’, or something,” he added. “So clearly the way it’s seen, I made a huge mistake not understanding that.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nSpeaking publicly about her separation from Gates for the first time in March, Melinda told CBS News that although “many things” contributed to her decision to end the pair’s marriage, she “did not like that he’d had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no”.\n\nShe also told the broadcaster that journalists should ask Bill whether he had cheated on her during the course of their marriage. Asked by The Sunday Times’ associate editor Alice Thomson whether he would answer that question, he refused, saying: “No.”\n\nFateful meetings\n\nAnnouncing their divorce in May 2021, Bill and Melinda gave no explanation for their separation beyond a joint statement shared on Twitter that said “we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives”. But a former employee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told The Wall Street Journal that Melinda’s “concerns about the relationship” between her husband and Epstein “date as far back as 2013”.\n\nSpeaking to CBS, Melinda said that the relationship between her husband and the financier had been a factor in her divorce, and that she had “made it very clear” she was deeply uncomfortable with the relationship.\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast, Melinda was present for a meeting between her husband and Epstein at the latter’s Upper East Side mansion in September of that year, and afterwards told friends that “she was furious at the relationship between the two men”.\n\nMelinda described “how uncomfortable she was in the company of the wealthy sex offender”, the site said, and “told friends she wanted nothing to do with him”. Sources close to the couple told the site that “Gates’ friendship with Epstein – who for years was accused of molesting scores of underage girls – still haunts Melinda”.\n\nSpeaking to CBS, she said she went to meet Epstein because she “wanted to see who this man was”, adding that she “regretted it from the second I stepped in the door”. She described Epstein as “abhorrent” and “evil personified”.\n\n“I had nightmares about it afterwards. So, you know, my heart breaks for these young women, because that’s how I felt and here I’m an older woman. My god, I feel terrible for those young women. It was awful,” she said.\n\nAsked whether her ex-husband listened to her concerns at the time, she said: “Any of the questions remaining about what Bill’s relationship there was – those are for Bill to answer. But I made it very clear how I felt about him.”\n\nIn a statement to CBS, Bill Gates said that his meeting was a “substantial error in judgement”.\n\nDamage limitation\n\nGates has “done his best to minimise his connections” with the disgraced billionaire, The New York Times (NYT) reported, telling The Wall Street Journal in April 2021: “I didn’t have any business relationship or friendship with him.”\n\nHowever, the NYT found that “beginning in 2011”, he “met with Epstein on numerous occasions”, including “at least three times at Epstein’s palatial Manhattan townhouse, and at least once staying late into the night”.\n\nEmployees of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation “also paid multiple visits to Epstein’s mansion”, the paper added, while “Epstein spoke with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and JPMorgan Chase about a proposed multibillion-dollar charitable fund”.\n\nThe Gates’ charitable foundation has “championed the well-being of young girls”, The New York Times said. But at the point at which the meetings began, Epstein had already served jail time for soliciting prostitution from a minor and was registered as a sex offender.\n\nIn May 2021, The Daily Beast reported that Gates sought Epstein’s advice “on ending his marriage with Melinda after the Microsoft co-founder complained about her during a series of meetings at the money manager’s mansion”.\n\nA person familiar with the meetings told the site that “going to Jeffrey’s was a respite from his marriage. It was a way of getting away from Melinda”. They added that Gates and Epstein “were very close”.\n\nGates’ spokesperson disputed the description of the pair’s relationship, telling the site: “Any claim that Gates spoke of his marriage or Melinda in a disparaging manner is false. Bill never received or solicited personal advice of any kind from Epstein - on marriage or anything else. Bill never complained about Melinda or his marriage to Epstein.”\n\n‘An open secret’\n\nBill and Melinda’s billion-dollar divorce could open the floodgates to a torrent of allegations of infidelity and non-disclosure agreements used to protect the Microsoft founder’s public image, former employees have claimed.\n\n“There have been whispers for years” about Gates’s “inappropriate extramarital relationships”, Vanity Fair reported, adding that “for the people who worked for him”, his “behaviour was something of an open secret”.\n\nOne former employee told the magazine that Gates would often leave the Microsoft headquarters just hours after arriving, saying: “We all assumed that it was when he was with women. I knew there were many off-site meetings that were not on his calendar.”\n\nOthers told Vanity Fair that allegations against Gates have been “largely suppressed by Gates’s liberal use of nondisclosure agreements, ostensibly to keep more damning details under wraps”.\n\nIn early July, Bill admitted during an “off-the-record” Q&A session that the end of his marriage to Melinda was his fault, sources claimed.\n\nAn attendee of a “summer camp for billionaires” hosted by law firm Allen & Overy told The New York Post that he “might have been on the verge of tears” as he “fessed up to messing up” and “basically referred to the fact that it [the divorce] was his fault”.\n\nResponding to a question by CNBC host Becky Quick following a talk on climate change, Bill did not use the word “affair” while discussing the ongoing divorce proceedings, the source added. A second attendee told the paper his answer was “very moving”.\n\nSources in the room said Quick did not raise his links to the late-billionare paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. A third attendee told the paper he appeared “agitated” during the appearance, adding: “Bill Gates was pretty much a total asshole.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Brigid Kennedy", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/05/10"}]}

Rodriguez, who was accused of steroid use by former teammate Jose Canseco in his book and lost 30 pounds before MLB’s testing program with penalties in 2005, faced significant skepticism.\n\nBagwell, suspected of PED use but with no paper trail to prove it, was forced to wait seven years until finally making it.\n\n“It was an interesting process,’’ Bagwell said. “Anxiety was very, very high.’’\n\nCertainly, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, the greatest hitter and pitcher of the steroid era, are familiar with the waiting game.\n\nYet they made their greatest stride toward future election, drawing 54% of the vote, 10% better than their previous high, with five years of eligibility remaining.\n\nIt’s a similar voting pattern Bagwell faced despite having Hall of Fame credentials when he retired. Bagwell, who hit .297 with 449 homers, 1,517 runs, 1,529 RBI, .408 on-base percentage and .540 slugging percentage, has admitted to taking only androstenedione in 1998, an anabolic steroid that didn’t become banned in baseball until 2003.\n\nBagwell received 41.7% of the vote his first year in 2011, but after his voting percentage stalled, it grew from 55.7% in 2015 to 71.6% last year to a staggering 86.2% on Wednesday. He received 381 of 442 votes, easily eclipsing the 332 votes needed to reach the required 75%.\n\nThere’s little reason to believe Bonds and Clemens won’t soon be walking through the halls of Cooperstown, too, and Bagwell can’t wait to welcome them.\n\n“I’ll make this very honest,’’ Bagwell said. “My honest opinion is that Barry Bonds is the best player I ever played against my entire life. Roger Clemens is the best (right-handed) pitcher. Man, they were just awesome. Their demeanor, the way they went about their business, is just amazing.\n\n“I respect them.\n\n“I’m a fan, put it that way.’’\n\nHow MLB owners once colluded to keep Hall of Famer Tim Raines off the field\n\nBarry Bonds and Roger Clemens will make the Hall of Fame soon, so you'll have to deal with it\n\nCertainly, no one ever questioned Rodriguez’s Hall of Fame credentials. Rodriguez, a 14-time All-Star and 13-time Gold Glove winner, might be the greatest all-around catcher since Johnny Bench. He appeared in the most games, 2,427, as a catcher, with more hits, doubles, total bases and runs than any catcher in history.\n\nYet suspicions of Rodriguez’s PED use (“Only God knows,’’ Rodriguez has said to the allegations), were largely ignored by the voters. Rodriguez, only the eighth Latin American player to reach the Hall of Fame, barely was elected with 76% of the ballots — receiving only four more votes than required — but still joined his hero, Bench, as the only catcher to be elected on the first ballot.\n\n“That means a lot,’’ Rodriguez said. “Johnny Bench was my favorite player growing up. I can’t wait until July to see him on the stage when I do my speech. It’s a dream come true.’’\n\nYet after watching Mike Piazza’s four-year delay before his election, he couldn’t help but wonder if he’d be penalized. Piazza is the finest offensive catcher in baseball history, but like Rodriguez, also was under suspicion of steroid use. Piazza has admitted to the use of androstenedione, but only before it became illegal.\n\n“I had trouble sleeping for three days,’’ said Rodriguez, 45, the youngest living Hall of Famer, “I’ll tell you that right now. I was very anxious for the whole situation. There was some big hopes, but we didn’t know what’s going to happen. It was very close.’’\n\nRaines’ Hall of Fame bid was sidetracked by a different type of drug: cocaine. Raines admitted to spending $40,000 a year on cocaine during his testimony during the Pittsburgh drug trials, which resulted in the suspensions of 11 major-league players. Raines was never suspended, only subjected to additional and random drug testing for the duration of his career.\n\nWhile Raines’ drug abuse tainted his career, his Hall of Fame legacy was damaged much more by Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson.\n\nWhile Henderson is widely considered the greatest leadoff hitter in baseball history — and Raines might have been the second-best — his career was hidden in Henderson’s shadows.\n\nIt took a decade for the Baseball Writers’ Association of America to realize Raines’ greatness. In his first two years on the ballot, he failed to garner even 25% of the vote and was still at 37.5% in 2011. But once it finally hit us, Raines easily slid into baseball immortality.\n\nReally, it was embarrassing the writers, including myself, overlooking this seven-time All-Star and four-time stolen base champ for so long. Sure, maybe he didn’t reach any magical milestones — falling 395 hits shy of 3,000 — but he’s the only player in history with at least 100 triples, 150 homers and 600 stolen bases. He also had the highest stolen-base percentage, 84.7%, of anyone in history with at least 400 attempts, eclipsing Henderson (80.8%).\n\n“A lot of people didn’t really know what Tim Raines did for 23 years,’’ Raines said. “I did a lot of things a lot of people actually in the Hall of Fame didn’t do. But now they’ve got these new stats. People look at you differently.\n\n“People didn’t really look at it that way back in the day. You looked at 500 homers, 300 wins, 3,000 hits. If you didn’t reach those criteria, it was hard for anyone to look at you like a Hall of Famer.\n\n“But the way the game has changed today, the way they looked at stats, it has changed a lot of people’s minds.’’\n\nAlong with our perspective on the steroid era, too.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter and Facebook\n\nGALLERY: 2017 Hall of Fame class", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/07/02/john-smoltz-the-1st-hofer-following-tommy-john-surgery/29642145/", "title": "John Smoltz the 1st HOFer following Tommy John surgery", "text": "AP\n\nWhen John Smoltz is inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in three weeks he'll be the first player enshrined following Tommy John surgery.\n\n\"That's pretty doubtful that he would be the last,\" said renowned orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews, who performed Smoltz's surgery. \"You can't believe how many are out there now that are pitching very successfully.\n\n\"It's quite an accomplishment to go through that and make the Hall of Fame,\" Andrews said. \"It's not going to be the easiest thing to reproduce, but I'm sure somebody will come along and duplicate that.\"\n\nThere will be plenty of candidates.

When they're young baseball players, they have fatigue factors and get hurt, and it shows up early on in their professional careers.\"\n\nAndrews says arm injuries will likely continue until parents and those who control youth sports manage the system differently.\n\nSmoltz, who went back to start after five years in the bullpen, said he never had a pitch limit.\n\n\"Everybody wants a piece of paper to work out the issues and how baseball should be played,\" he said. \"Everything's a number. Everybody's got the answer. I wouldn't say a word if it was getting better. It's getting worse. Ever since we discussed and became focused with the pitch count, it's been worse.\"\n\nMajor League Baseball has conducted a study on the cause of elbow injuries, and five teams have agreed to allow the pitchers they selected in the 2014 amateur draft to be used in a five-year study in affiliation with the American Sports Medicine Institute, which Andrews founded in 1987. The study will include every first-year pitcher in the five organizations, and findings will be shared among all 30 teams.\n\nSmoltz figures an uphill battle lies ahead.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what a big leaguer says, and to a degree it almost doesn't matter what the doctors are saying because they're giving the formulas for success and nobody's paying attention,\" he said. \"The business of baseball and youth baseball is so great the people feel like they're being swept up in a wave of 'I've got to catch up.'\"\n\nSmoltz says kids pitch too much, but don't throw enough.\n\n\"There's a difference. I'd play strikeout, we'd play backyard baseball.

He managed Detroit to the 2006 World Series in his first year with the Tigers, later advancing to the 2012 World Series and then to the 2013 AL Championship Series in his final season.\n\nOnly Lou Piniella — whose Reds defeated Leyland's Pirates in the 1990 NLCS — also came close to earning election Sunday, as he garnered 11 votes from the 16-person committee; 12 were required for election. Former league executive Bill White earned 10 votes while managers Cito Gaston and Davey Johnson, umpires Ed Montague and Joe West and executive Hank Peters each received less than five votes.\n\nLeyland, as gruff and old school a baseball man as one could imagine, was a true throwback whose penchant for smoking evoked visions of bygone eras. Yet Leyland consistently connected with and earned the trust of his players, all the way until his final season in Detroit, when he won 93 games at the age of 68. His 1,769 victories rank 18th all time and he won six division titles and three Manager of the Year awards.\n\nHis managerial stint helped fulfill a big league dream for a player who batted just .222 in a seven-league minor league career that peaked with a half-season of Class AA ball. Leyland never forget those humble roots, even as he managed a handful of all-time greats and future Hall of Famers, from Barry Bonds in Pittsburgh through Miguel Cabrera and Justin Verlander in Detroit.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\n\"Being not a very good player myself, I realized how hard it was to play the game,\" Leyland said Sunday night on a video conference. \"When you saw guys like Bonds and Cabrera and Verlander and (Max) Scherzer and (Gary) Sheffield, you marvel at how good these guys really are.\n\n\"I tried to teach them how to be a professional early on. I think young people, young players, are really searching for discipline. We all have our insecurities. Sometimes players do. I think they’re always looking for that leadership. I tried to impress upon them what it means to be a professional and how hard this game is to play.\n\n\"And how good they were.\"\n\nLeyland's big league managerial career began with an 11-year stint in Pittsburgh, where he helped revive the moribund Pirates and claimed three consecutive NL East titles. But the Pirates found only heartbreak in the NLCS, losing in 1990 to the Cincinnati Reds and in 1991 and '92 to the emerging Atlanta Braves powerhouse, the latter defeat coming on a crushing ninth-inning, Game 7 single.\n\nHis glory would come in 1997, when, frustrated by the Pirates' low-budget bleeding of talent like Bonds and Bobby Bonilla, he leapt to the expansion Marlins, who splurged on a star-studded roster in their fifth year in existence. It was also the third year of the wild card, and Leyland's Marlins upset the Braves in the NLCS before defeating Cleveland in the World Series — on a Game 7 ninth-inning single that eased some of the sting of Leyland's near-miss with Pittsburgh five years earlier.\n\nThat Marlins team was emblematic of the good fortune Leyland had throughout his career, with talented stars like Sheffield, Bonilla and Moises Alou. Yet it also included key role players like Craig Counsell and Jim Eisenreich and emerging youngsters like shortstop Edgar Renteria, who got the game-winning single in Game 7.\n\nAll benefited from Leyland's egalitarian approach.\n\n\"I cannot treat you better than the 25th player on this ballclub,\" says Leyland of his approach toward star players. \"I think veteran players respected that.\"\n\nThe 16-person committee included Hall of Fame players Jeff Bagwell, Tom Glavine, Chipper Jones, Ted Simmons, Jim Thome and Joe Torre and former MLB commissioner Bud Selig.\n\n\"I felt for all the managers not getting in,\" says Leyland. \"I’m hoping that their day comes.\n\n\"Today, I was the fortunate one.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2017/01/17/baseball-hall-fame-how-usa-today-sports-voted/96676540/", "title": "Baseball Hall of Fame: How USA TODAY Sports voted", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nAs the National Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2017 is announced this week, four USA TODAY Sports writers with a vote share their ballots:\n\nPeter Barzilai\n\nJeff Bagwell, Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Vladimir Guerrero, Edgar Martinez, Mike Mussina, Tim Raines, Ivan Rodriguez, Curt Schilling, Larry Walker\n\nI remain uncomfortable taking a stand against players for whom there is compelling evidence of performance-enhancing drug use, especially if the Hall of Fame and Major League Baseball won’t provide any meaningful guidance. But here’s another ballot with more than 10 players worthy of induction. So check the box for players who are clean — or aren’t blatantly not clean — and use the remaining spots for those we can’t be certain of. That’s how Bonds and Clemens get my vote for the second year in a row and why I can kick the can down the road on Manny Ramirez and Sammy Sosa.\n\n***\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nHall of Fame case: Manny Ramirez's ill-timed PED use will cost him\n\nAs voters soften on steroids, Rafael Palmeiro harbors Hall of Fame dreams\n\nHall of Fame case: Billy Wagner balances lower save total with dominance\n\nGabe Lacques\n\nBagwell, Bonds, Clemens, Trevor Hoffman, Guerrero, Raines, Rodriguez, Schilling, Gary Sheffield, Walker\n\nEdgar Martinez’s candidacy has mostly trended upward — he hit 43% last year and could reach 60% in this, his eighth year on the ballot. His supporters have grown more vocal, as well, so I feel compelled to address not voting for him. A .312 batting average, .418 on-base percentage and .515 slugging percentage over 18 seasons is remarkable. His career offensive WAR (wins above replacement) of 66 ranks 70th all time. He won two batting titles and finished in the top five in OPS five times. But save for 1992, Martinez spent the vast majority of his best seasons at designated hitter. In 18 seasons, he amassed 2,247 hits and 309 homers. If most of your legacy is carved out at DH, sublime counting numbers take on more importance — particularly given that Martinez’s greatness came in the most inflated offensive era in baseball history. Martinez was often overshadowed by Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr. Yet in the Mariners’ 116-win season of 2001, their first year minus both, Martinez ranked fifth among Seattle hitters in WAR. A great hitter who fell just shy of this voter's Hall of Fame ballot.\n\n***\n\nBob Nightengale\n\nBagwell, Bonds, Clemens, Guerrero, Hoffman, Fred McGriff, Raines, Rodriguez, Sheffield, Sosa\n\nThe most penalized player during the steroid era was McGriff. He barely survives on the ballot year after year, but if you take a close look, the man should be in the Hall of Fame. If not for the steroid era, I’m convinced he’d be in the Hall of Fame. McGriff, who hit 493 homers, surely would have eclipsed the magical 500 mark without the 1994-95 player strike. He is the only player in baseball history to be on the ballot with at least 475 homers, not linked to PEDs and not be in the Hall of Fame. If you’re into metrics, his OPS+ (accounting for league and ballpark) is better than that of Hall of Famers Dave Winfield, Eddie Murray and Tony Gwynn. He was the model of consistency with 10 seasons of 30 or more homers and eight seasons of at least 100 RBI. Enough whining about Edgar Martinez, who happens to have 184 fewer homers and 267 fewer RBI than McGriff.\n\n***\n\nJorge L. Ortiz\n\nBagwell, Raines, Hoffman, Jeff Kent, Guerrero, Rodriguez\n\nI don’t think there’s a right or wrong way to answer the PED question. My approach has been to vote for worthwhile candidates who have been suspected of PED use if there’s no paper trail linked to them or a compelling case that goes beyond conjecture. So I voted for Mike Piazza in the past and this year voted for Bagwell and Ivan Rodriguez. When guys have obvious Hall of Fame credentials but more persuasive evidence of PED use against them — Bonds, Clemens, Sosa and Ramirez — I have chosen to leave them off my ballot until their final year of eligibility, at which point I will give them serious consideration. Kent hit more home runs as a second baseman than anybody else, and he had eight seasons of 20 homers and 100 RBI, compared with two seasons for Ryne Sandberg. If you compare their career offensive numbers, Kent beats him in every meaningful category except for steals. Granted, he was not in Sandberg’s class defensively, but Kent was a solid second baseman with limited range.\n\nGallery: Players on the 2017 Hall of Fame ballot", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/12/27/following-bonds-clemens-drama-hall-of-fame-ballot-seems-a-bit-wanting/69754311007/", "title": "Following Bonds/Clemens drama, Hall of Fame ballot seems a bit ...", "text": "After last year’s hand-wringing exercise known as voting for baseball’s Hall of Fame, it was possible to be glad that we’d come to the end of a long road.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the vote, time would be up for Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, the players at the center of this tangled PED web of fact vs. fiction, innuendo vs. admission, official reports vs. anonymous sources.\n\nThe filaments from that web continue to stick to players up for consideration for Hall election, but at least there was some closure.\n\nThen the Contemporary Baseball Era Players Committee got into the act. Not even one year had elapsed, and there were Bonds and Clemens again, front and center on the ballot this veterans’ committee would consider. And the thought that kept popping up was, what will it mean if this group made up largely of Hall of Famers and baseball executives pushes back on the Baseball Writers Association of America decision and opens the door for Bonds and Clemens?\n\nThe committee, however, backed up the BBWAA’s call with a resounding “no,” only granting enshrinement to Fred McGriff, someone who was a mainstay on my ballot.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nThis seemed like a watershed moment for the Hall of Fame, which has come under fire — as has the whole voting process — for being tone deaf to today’s reality.\n\nTo me, the committee’s decision underscored one significant aspect to the Hall of Fame: It should be damned hard to get in. It should be an exclusive celebration of the best the game has to offer, and increasingly in our world we’ve come to understand that it must mean more than hitting a lot of home runs or striking out a lot of batters.\n\nWho you are matters. What you do matters. What people think of you matters.\n\nUnderstanding that the game is bigger than you matters.\n\nPerhaps one day the pendulum will swing back the other way. Down the road another committee will consider these stars, and the climate of the day might open the door at last.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nToday is not that day.\n\nToday it is time to move forward, to consider a new ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2023. The voting deadline is New Year's Eve, and the results are set to be announced Jan. 24.\n\nSadly, it is not an awe-inspiring list. The newcomers do not appear to have a first-ballot candidate among them. It happens. Twice in the past decade the BBWAA elected no one to the hall. I did not vote for any of the newcomers to the ballot.\n\nIt could happen again this time, although there are a few players — and I voted for each of them — who might hear their names called if support for them continues to grow.\n\nHeading the list are returning candidates Todd Helton and Scott Rolen. They are about halfway through their 10-year eligibility cycle, but neither has been especially close to election. Helton, as any Diamondbacks fan knows, was as tough an out as those Colorado Rockies teams had over his 17 years in Denver. Some think his production was inflated too much by the high altitude at Coors Field, but the splits were reasonable. He was a three-time Gold Glover with four Silver Slugger awards, and he was probably underappreciated nationally because his Rockies only made the playoffs twice in his tenure.\n\nAs for Rolen, he would be an excellent addition to a fairly small list of Hall third basemen. Rolen won eight Gold Gloves at the position and his offensive WAR (wins over replacement) was tied for 69th all-time — among all players.\n\nMy two other holdovers are Andruw Jones and Gary Sheffield, and both are languishing around 40% of the vote and probably are longshots at best.\n\nAs for the rest of the ballot, well, it's kind of dominated by a rogue's gallery including the likes of Manny Ramirez, Carlos Beltran and Andy Pettitte.\n\nFinally, a word or two about Alex Rodriguez, who will be carrying the torch for PED users for the rest of this decade, it would appear. This perplexing man with outsized talent and Cooperstown-worthy statistics has so much PED baggage it's hard to summarize. The pattern that develops, if you look the timeline of what is known as unchallenged fact (including his own admissions), is of a player who apparently was going to do whatever it took to artificially enhance his natural gifts, more that likely going all the way back to at least the midpoint of his 22-year career.\n\nThis is A-Rod's second year on the ballot. He received 34.3% of the vote last year. His numbers will tick up, inevitably, but I suspect he will incur the same fate as Bonds and Clemens, proving that, in the world of Hall of Fame voting, everything new is old again.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/09/07/baseball-hall-fame-franklin-delano-roosevelt-curt-smith-presidents-and-pastime/1200734002/", "title": "Author Curt Smith to Baseball Hall of Fame: Induct Franklin Roosevelt", "text": "Few sports debates can be as animated as who deserves to be in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nWhy not Tony Oliva? Or Roger Maris? Or — dare we go there — Barry Bonds or Pete Rose?\n\nFor author, University of Rochester English professor, and former presidential speechwriter Curt Smith, there is a glaring omission at Cooperstown's hallowed Hall. His choice: U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\n\"Everyone admits that he saved the game,\" Smith, who served as a speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, said in a recent interview.\n\nSmith's latest book, The Presidents and the Pastime: The History of Baseball & the White House, makes the case for FDR's entry into the Hall of Fame. And Smith has been traveling the country, making the case himself — speaking at the Hall of Fame, at the Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, and on prominent and popular sports and political radio shows, such as NPR'S Political Junkie with Ken Rudin. C-SPAN has aired his talk at the FDR Library.\n\nSmith's book not only highlights Roosevelt's connection with baseball, but also details how, with World War II erupting, Roosevelt helped ensure that baseball would continue for both the fans at home and the soldiers abroad who hungered for box scores.\n\nSmith's book winds through the entire presidential lineup, leading off with George Washington and a pastime of his that is believed to be a precursor of baseball. The book is chock-full of nuggets and anecdotes about presidents and first ladies who worshipped the sport and/or tolerated the sport. (Folks with enough political savvy to be elected president are also smart enough not to express disdain for America's sport. LBJ, for one, was not an admiring fan, but tried to play the part nonetheless.)\n\nAs a youngster in Caledonia, Livingston County, Smith followed baseball and voraciously read the World Book Encyclopedia. \"How many families had the World Book pre-Google,\" he said. \"I was drawn to the presidency and to baseball.\"\n\n\"I think it was inevitable that I write this book,\" Smith said. This is his 17th book, and most have focused on his passions for the country's chief executive and its national pastime.\n\nFor Smith, the research not only unearthed a bounty of heretofore largely unknown stories linking presidents and baseball, but also revealed FDR's significant role in keeping the sport alive while the country was embroiled in World War II. And, as it turns out, there was an earlier push to get Roosevelt into the Hall of Fame, but it was shot down by the conservative members of the Old-Timers selection committee who did not care for Roosevelt's politics.\n\nSome of the game's best, including Ted Williams and Stan Musial, served in World War II. A month after Pearl Harbor, baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis wrote to Roosevelt, questioning whether the commander in chief thought \"professional baseball should continue to operate.\"\n\nRoosevelt was so insistent that baseball continue, even with many of its known players likely to serve in wartime, that he responded with what he noted was \"solely a personal\" belief that the game must go on. He read his reply at a news conference.\n\n\"He understood America and he understood the game,\" Smith said. \"He knew baseball was important to the morale of the country.\"\n\nRoosevelt's letter became known as \"the Green Light Letter\" and hangs in the Hall of Fame. One columnist called it \"the most important document baseball has had since the original code of rules was written.\"\n\nJ.G. Taylor Spink, the publisher of the popular publication The Sporting News, in 1945 urged the Hall of Fame to enshrine Roosevelt. \"He preserved the life of the game at a critical juncture,\" Spink wrote.\n\nIn his book, Smith portrays a decision to add FDR to the Hall of Fame as a no-brainer that continues to elude the hall's powers-that-be. Writes Smith: \"You might think that putting FDR in a hall of fame enshrining baseball would be a given — even for such a motley maze as big-league mandarins — if for no other purpose than as a thank-you.\"\n\nYet, it has not happened. And, while Roosevelt's contributions to the game are remembered, the current leadership at the Hall of Fame maintains that the rules simply don't allow the enshrinement of one whose ties to the sport were not on the field or in baseball's managerial or administrative ranks.\n\n\"By rule, Hall of Fame election is limited to former baseball players, managers, umpires and executives,\" Hall of Fame spokesman and Vice President Jon Shestakofsky said in an email. \"Therefore, there is no avenue open to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to the Hall of Fame.\n\n\"However, Roosevelt and the 'Green Light Letter' are recognized within our walls. An enlarged copy of the 'Green Light Letter' is displayed for all visitors to see, along with an explanation of its historical relevance to baseball and American history. Additionally, the actual 'Green Light Letter' is a part of the Hall of Fame’s Library collection.\"\n\nSmith thinks that Roosevelt's case warrants a detour from the established rules. Without Roosevelt, he said, the game of baseball may not have survived the war.\n\n\"We would not be talking today about baseball were it not for Roosevelt,\" he said.\n\n\"I realize that inducting FDR would be a singular exception to the Hall of Fame’s rule,\" he said. \"However, Roosevelt merits it, being a singular exception. He was elected president four times, helped end the Depression, and, with Winston Churchill, helped win World War II.\n\n\"In a baseball sense, there are 317 plaques at the Hall of Fame hailing players, managers, executives, and umpires,\" Smith said. \"Not one includes the phrase 'saved baseball.' Roosevelt’s plaque would, and should.\"\n\nGCRAIG@Gannett.com\n\nBaseball and presidents\n\nAmong the nuggets of baseball-presidential connections in Curt Smith's The Presidents and the Pastime, published by University of Nebraska Press, are:\n\n• That George Washington's troops played \"rounders\" — a \"baseball antecedent from Great Britain\" — before the brutal winter at Valley Forge and that Washington himself was known to throw and catch \"a ball for hours with his aide-de-camp.\"\n\n• Abraham Lincoln was, according to a report, playing in a game in his hometown of Springfield, Illinois, in 1860 when friends arrived to tell him he had secured enough votes for the GOP presidential nomination. \"I am glad to hear of their coming,\" he reportedly said. \"But they will have to wait a few minutes while I have another turn at bat.\"\n\n• The current tradition of presidents throwing out a pitch to a player or catcher has changed in recent decades. Previously, presidents would throw the ball \"to or over the heads of players en masse, who dispersed to nab a prized souvenir.\"\n\n• Calvin Coolidge managed to dupe many people into thinking he was a baseball savant when, as Smith said in the interview, \"he was a baseball ignoramus.\" Instead, he was helped by his wife, Grace Coolidge, who had been a rabid fan since childhood and was an official scorer for her collegiate baseball team.\n\n• Richard Nixon's knowledge of baseball was encyclopedic and his joy for the game immense. At a 1969 All-Star gala, Nixon regaled a crowd with his knowledge of the players and anecdotes from the past about them. Hank Aaron remarked that Nixon \"knows more about baseball than some of the people in the game.\"\n\n• Years after his presidential loss in 1960, and before his 1968 victory, Nixon was in fact asked to head the baseball players' union. Nixon declined because he would have had to stay out of partisan politics and likely would not have run for president in 1968.

He didn’t play the game. He didn’t manage or coach. He was never the commissioner or even a team executive.\n\nBut perhaps no one is more responsible for turning the game of baseball into an $11 billion industry, making players, and yes, owners, richer than their wildest dreams.\n\n“Players are pleased that Marvin will now take his rightful and long overdue place in the Hall of Fame,’’ executive director Tony Clark said, “in recognition of the monumental and positive impact he had on our game and industry.’’\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nMiller, who was snubbed seven times on the Hall of Fame veterans’ committee ballot, requested years before his death in 2012 that the Hall of Fame committee to no longer consider him.\n\nHALL OF FAME:Ted Simmons, Marvin Miller elected by Modern Baseball Era Ballot\n\nCLASS OF 2020:Derek Jeter heads list of players on Baseball Hall of Fame ballot\n\nThe Hall of Fame kept ignoring his request, and kept placing him on the modern-committee ballot every three years, finally elected the man who was one of the most instrumental figures in the game’s history.\n\nIt’s unknown how the Miller family will react to the news, or whether they’ll attend the induction ceremony on July 26 in Cooperstown, N.Y. They were adamant in 2013 that they no longer wanted their late father on the ballot, with son Peter Miller emphasizing the family’s position to Hall of Fame baseball writer Murray Chass in 2013 before the sixth time he was bypassed.\n\n“No one in our family will attend or speak at any HOF ceremony regardless of the outcome of the HOF vote,’’ Peter Miller told Chass in an e-mail. “It’s important for union members and the media to understand why, so that the story does not get misrepresented as 'sour grapes,' personal pique, or anything of the sort.\n\n“My father felt that the essence of the honor, if any, was in celebrating the MLBPA’s accomplishments in changing Baseball from a management-dominated industry to one characterized by an equal labor-management relationship, a change resulting in a vastly more competitive game, fan interest, and increased wealth for all, including the owners of baseball clubs.\n\n“These changes were brought about by the concerted action of union members, the baseball players themselves. Although he enjoyed the recognition, my father did what he did not for fame and glory, but for justice and for equitable labor-management relations. To treat that as something incidental, as of lesser value than personal fame, is really to dishonor him and the players.\n\n“My father’s wishes, stated in writing, and reaffirmed to me in person many times, and for the last time within weeks of his death, were that he did not want to be on the HOF ballot.’’\n\nHopefully, there will be a change of heart by the Miller family. They need to be in Cooperstown to celebrate their father’s greatness and his rightful place in history.\n\nThey can condemn the Hall of Fame and attack everyone ever involved in the process that it took far too long for his election.

Here in front of my home crowd and the ovation that they gave me from right field all the way to home plate was amazing.\"\n\nRangers players crowded along the rail in their dugout to watch the ceremony, much like they had on July 30 to watch teammate Adrian Beltre get his 3,000th career hit — a double that came only moments after Rodriguez had completed his Hall of Fame induction speech in Cooperstown that day.\n\nRodriguez almost immediately acknowledged Beltre, telling the 38-year-old third baseman that if he had gotten that hit about 20 minutes earlier that it would have been mentioned at the Hall of Fame. But Pudge pointed at his plaque from Cooperstown that was on the field and told Beltre, \"This is waiting for you soon. You'll be there soon.\"\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nThe ceremony came before the Rangers’ 8-3 victory over the Houston Astros in a game that Beltre had three hits and drove in three runs. Both teams wore replica uniforms from 1999, the season Pudge was the AL MVP after hitting .332 with career highs of 35 homers and 113 RBIs.\n\nBefore Rodriguez entered the field from the team's bullpen in right-center field wearing a red Rangers polo, other players that wore No. 7 for the Rangers took part in the \"march of 7s\" from the left field corner. That group included Lenny Randle, Billy Sample and Eric Young, with the last in line being current outfielder Delino DeShields , who now wears No. 3 but wore No. 7 as a rookie two seasons ago.\n\nPudge joined MLB strikeout king Nolan Ryan, who was 44 when he pitched to the teenager catching his second career game, as the only Rangers players to have their numbers retired by the team. They are also the only players wearing the Texas \"T'' on their plaques in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n\"I did the best that I can to put a show for you guys,\" Rodriguez told the large crowd gathered for the ceremony that started more than an hour before the game.\n\nThe Rangers in 2005 retired the number of the late Johnny Oates, the manager who led them to their first three AL West titles over a four-year span in the late 1990s. MLB retired the No. 42 to honor Jackie Robinson in 1997. All four numbers are displayed on a facade in left field.\n\n\"Having that number there next to Nolan, Johnny and Jackie forever, is great to see that now every time I come to the ballpark,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nMORE:\n\nHall of Famers Ivan Rodriguez, Tim Raines: Small in size but not in stature\n\nBaseball Hall of Fame: Tim Raines, Jeff Bagwell and Ivan Rodriguez enshrined\n\nThe only other MLB players who have had their No. 7 jerseys retired are fellow Hall of Fame members: Mickey Mantle by the New York Yankees in 1969, and Craig Biggio by the Astros in 2008.\n\nRyan wasn't in attendance, but was among several people whose congratulatory messages were shown on the video board. Among the others were Johnny Bench, the only other catcher elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, fellow 2017 Hall of Fame inductee Jeff Bagwell and former President George W. Bush, one of the team owners when Pudge made his big-league debut as a 19-year-old for the Rangers in 1991.\n\nWhile Pudge played for six teams over his 21 seasons while being a 14-time All-Star and winning 13 Gold Gloves, he has always considered Texas as his baseball home . He played 1,507 of his 2,543 career games wearing No. 7 for the Rangers.\n\nAfter leaving the Rangers in free agency after the 2002 season, he was part of a World Series championship with the Florida Marlins in 2003 and played in another World Series during his five seasons in Detroit (2004-08). He ended the 2008 season with the Yankees and started 2009 with the Astros, who traded him to Texas on Aug. 18 that year. He finished his career with the Washington Nationals in 2010-11.\n\n\"I grew up here,\" Rodriguez said. \"I know that I played for five other organizations. ... I respect them the same, but when you're talking about the Rangers' organization, it's a little different.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/12"}]}

Best of luck!'\"\n\nThe moment of truth arrives at 8 p.m. EDT Tuesday with the debut of ABC's \"The Muppets\" starring Kermit, Gonzo, Fozzie Bear, Animal and the ever-fabulous Miss Piggy.\n\nShe's the host of a talk show produced by on-again, off-now boyfriend Kermit with a staff that sets its own standard of professionalism. Despite that, \"Up Late With Miss Piggy\" attracts guests that include Josh Groban, Laurence Fishburne and Reese Witherspoon and has caught the eye of a documentary film crew.\n\nThey've got plenty to cover: star tantrums (Piggy, of course), office romances (Kermit and an ABC marketing executive, Denise, who happens to be a pig; he likes pigs, the frog concedes) and the Muppets' off-set lives (Fozzie meets his human girlfriend's parents and encounters blatant species-ism).\n\nThe show aims for humor that can be appreciated on both adult and kid levels, its producers say, with a gentle reminder that these Muppets, save for Kermit, never mixed with their tamer \"Sesame Street\" relatives that include Cookie Monster and Elmo.\n\nThe jokes aimed at grown-ups likely will go over a child's head. Example: When the staff gathers for a meeting, house band member Zoot jumps up and introduces himself in apparent accordance with rehab protocol. No, he's told, it's not THAT kind of meeting.\n\n\"The Muppets\" is the crew's first regular prime-time TV gig since the short-lived \"Muppets Tonight\" aired in 1998, and it comes more than three decades after the 1976-81 success of \"The Muppet Show.\"\n\nThe puppets haven't been idle, of course, making TV movies and specials — including one with Lady Gaga — and big-screen hits \"The Muppets\" (2011) and \"Muppets Most Wanted\" (2014).\n\nBut Prady said he wanted to see the Muppets in a more authentic light and figured he had the credentials for the job: He started as a TV writer with Henson, the brilliant Muppets creator who was 53 when he died in 1990.\n\n\"Characters over time, without the boldness of the person who set them in motion, soften,\" Prady said. \"It's a natural thing and it comes from the best place, which is that these are beloved characters, let's protect them.\"\n\n\"But the Muppets, if you go back to 'The Muppet Show,' they were sarcastic, they were snarky, they commented on the world around them,\" he said.\n\nPrady saw the rise of mock-documentaries, among them \"The Office,\" as a way to achieve a Muppets renaissance. Henson put Kermit and pals to work on a variety show in \"The Muppet Show\" because the genre was a 1970s TV staple; why shouldn't a mockumentary be another ideal vehicle?\n\nWhen he brought the idea to Disney about 10 years ago they didn't share his enthusiasm for their newly purchased brand. He tried again, failed, then found a distraction: co-creating and producing (with Chuck Lorre) CBS' hit \"The Big Bang Theory.\"\n\nIt was a nudge from veteran Muppets performer and series producer Bill Barretta that sent Prady back to Disney a third time, and this time he scored.\n\n\"Part of knowing this would work is in the characters themselves, because this in a way was what they were built for, to try to be real and in the real world,\" said Prady, who developed the show with co-creator Bob Kushell (\"The Simpsons,\" ''Anger Management\"). Randall Einhorn is the director and a producer.\n\nPrady rejects the idea that the mockumentary concept he long nurtured could be stale, instead arguing that it's become entrenched as the sitcom form of today.\n\nWhatever the vehicle, the Muppets shine under the stewardship of performers who typically handle several puppets. They include Barretta (the Swedish Chef, Rowlf); Steve Whitmire (Kermit, Rizzo); Eric Jaconson (Miss Piggy, Fozzie); Dave Goelz (Gonzo, Zoot); David Rudman (Scooter, Janice) and Matt Vogel (Sgt. Floyd Pepper).\n\n\"It's the richest world of characters I've ever been a part of, other than maybe when I was writing for 'The Simpsons' back in their fourth, fifth, six seasons,\" said Kushell. \"That was an expansive, exciting world of characters.\"\n\nWhitmire, with the Muppets since 1978, says the series offers \"a nice little progression of who (the puppets) are. We've been talking for years about the idea of finding out more about their personal lives.\"\n\nAnd it's no holds barred, Prady told a TV conference in August: \"We've been given unfettered access.\"\n\n\"Yep,\" Kermit confirmed to reporters. \"I tried to fetter it, but it didn't work out.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2020/07/16/quarantine-entertainment-100-things-we-watched-read-and-listened/5429423002/", "title": "Quarantine entertainment: 100 things we watched, read and listened ...", "text": "USA TODAY Life Staff\n\nAt this point in quarantine, it can feel like you've watched every single TV show Netflix has to offer.\n\nIt's been four months since the coronavirus pandemic upended daily life. In those long days indoors, many of us have spent vast amounts of time entertaining ourselves at home, which means we're watching more TV, streaming more movies, blasting more music and reading more books. At least, it meant that for the USA TODAY Life staff, since we spend most of our time finding the best entertainment choices for our readers.\n\nTo entertain a group of entertainment reporters, a movie, TV show, book, album or podcast has to be more than just good enough. It has to stand out from all the pop culture we spend our time reviewing and writing about. So here are 100 things that managed to divert and distract us from the news at a difficult time (and a few that fell decidedly flat).\n\nMovies\n\n1. “13th”: I was not prepared for the visceral reaction I had when I watched this Netflix documentary. Directed by Ava DuVernay, this powerful film tackles the history and policies that have produced the current prison boom in the United States, from the enactment of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, to the present day prison system where African Americans are unfairly over-represented. It is a must-watch film. -Mary Cadden\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\n2. “American Psycho”: We’ve all been feeling a little “psycho” being locked up during stay-at-home orders, but nothing compares to the serial-killing tendencies of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a wealthy New York investment banker. -Jenna Ryu\n\n3. “Athlete A\": I’m a former gymnast and a current journalist, so when those two worlds collide, I’m all in. This documentary, chronicling how the Indianapolis Star broke the story of systemic abuse at USA Gymnastics, is triumphant and gut-wrenching in equal measures. It speaks to the power of a free press and the ability of the human soul to overcome tragedy. -Alison Maxwell\n\n4. “Bad Education”: A story of school administrators embezzling from a high-achieving, Long Island, N.Y., school system doesn’t sound like the most scintillating movie pitch, but Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney create compelling, entertaining characters in HBO’s darkly comic look at the corrupting effects of the American drive for success. -Bill Keveney\n\n5. “Barry Lyndon”: A grievously underrated 1975 Stanley Kubrick masterpiece. I spent three full hours exclaiming, “Look at that depth of field!” and “It’s like a painting!” to an empty room. I am cool and all the boys like me. -Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n6. Black-and-white movies: More time at home offers a chance to revisit film classics or finally get to ones you’ve heard about but haven’t seen. My random sampler includes: “The Best Years of Our Lives” (1946), which poignantly depicts the toll war takes on the winning soldiers; “A Face in the Crowd” (1957), which offers a sharp-eyed, early look at the demagogic power of television; and Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” (1964), a dark comedy about nuclear self-destruction famed for Peter Sellers’ three-role tour de force. -B.K.\n\n7. The “Bourne” film franchise: Matt Damon as an amnesiac spy with a devastating kill set delivers the thrills, even upon repeat watching. For a decidedly different action film set in Europe, try 1968’s “Where Eagles Dare,” an exciting if somewhat implausible World War II rescue adventure starring a fascinating duo: Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. -B.K.\n\n8. “Braveheart”: July 4th weekend felt like a good time to conquer this three-hour event of a movie, which lived up to its campy, bloody and epic reputation. -Kelly Lawler\n\n9. \"Dark Waters”: A must watch for anyone who loves a legal thriller or a movie based on a true story, about chemical contamination of a small town. -Morgan Hines\n\n10. “Disclosure”: Quarantine is an opportunity to educate oneself. The documentary, which counts Laverne Cox as an executive producer, traces transgender representation in TV and movies. -Erin Jensen\n\n11. Disney animated movies (a lot of them): After several weekend days spent in the wonderful world of Disney+, I have the following assessments: The “Frozen” music is mostly terrible, the live-action “Lady and the Tramp” is wildly underrated and we should go back to the glory days of 90-minute animated musicals like “Mulan” and “Aladdin.” - K.L.\n\n12. “Elf”: One day in lockdown, my pre-K daughter wanted to pretend it was Christmas. We decorated sugar cookies with red and green sprinkles, made Santa hats from construction paper and watched Will Ferrell prance around New York City in tights proclaiming, “The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.” -Jennifer McClellan\n\n13. “Emma”: Anya Taylor-Joy is perfectly cast as Emma, a wealthy youth with hubristic views on her matchmaking abilities. The chemistry between her and Johnny Flynn’s Mr. Knightley is undeniable and, like all great Jane Austen adaptations, peaks while they are dancing at a ball. -J.M.\n\n14. “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga”: If there was ever a time for a feel-good movie, it is now. And that movie is “Eurovision.” Inspired by the actual Eurovision song contest, and even featuring some of its past contestants and winners. The Netflix film is a perfect balance of sweet and slapstick. Stars Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams are everything.Well, almost everything. Dan Stevens steals quite a few scenes and there is, of course, the music of Abba. I laughed, I cried, I downloaded the film’s \"Song a Long\" and have it on constant repeat. -M.C.\n\n15. “Hamilton”: Having never seen the stage production, I’d always regretted not being able to watch Daveed Diggs rap 6.5 words per second while jumping off a table during “Guns and Ships.\" On Disney+, \"Hamilton\" was as good – if not better – than I expected. But it was the little things that stood out to me while watching the filmed performance of the Broadway musical: the use of the bullet as a character, that look on Leslie Odom’s face when he defiantly sings, “I am the one thing in life I can control” during “Wait for It.\" All in all, I’m satisfied. -Jayme Deerwester\n\n16. “Her”:\" Maybe watching a 2013 movie about a man falling in love with a Siri- or Alexa-like voice wasn’t the greatest idea during the height of quarantine and lack of human connection. But also, who cares? Get yourself some catharsis and watch a movie for which Joaquin Phoenix should’ve won an Oscar. -David Oliver\n\n17. “Hitch”: I rewatched the 2005 Will Smith film during quarantine, and it remains my favorite rom-com. Enough said. -M.H.\n\n18. “Inception”: Ten years after its release, I rewatched “Inception,” a movie I had never conceptually been able to understand until now (kind of). The 2010 Christopher Nolan film, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, follows a corporate espionage plan to infiltrate the dreams of a competitor. -J.R.\n\n19. James Bond movies: About halfway through an attempt to watch all of the Bond films, I mostly resent my parents for letting me watch “Austin Powers” before showing me what inspired the parody. -K.L.\n\n20. Orson Welles films (other than \"Citizen Kane\"): If you like “Kane” (1941), often voted the greatest film of all time, don’t miss two other Welles-Joseph Cotten collaborations: as director and star in 1942’s “The Magnificent Ambersons” and as actors in 1949’s “The Third Man,” which has the added bonus of zither music! -B.K.\n\n21. “Palm Springs”: Yes, the plot is just like Bill Murray’s “Groundhog Day.” I don’t care. This winning comedy starring Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti was a treat on Hulu, after bypassing theaters. The pair had great chemistry and the movie was sweet, funny and sort of thought-provoking, too. -Gary Levin\n\n22. “Showgirls”: I don’t know what it says about me that watching 1995's “Showgirls” (streaming on HBO Max) for the first time has been a highlight of self-quarantine. I love a movie that's so bad it’s good, and this is an all-timer of the genre. -B.V.\n\n23. \"The Surrogate\": This 2020 feature debut of filmmaker Jeremy Hersh tells a thought-provoking story of a woman (Jasmine Batchelor) who agrees to carry a child for her married gay friends, only to learn the fetus has Down Syndrome. It’s a complex and emotional film that deftly explores weighty issues of race, class and ability. -Patrick Ryan\n\nTV shows\n\n24. “13 Reasons Why”: I started this show back when it first made waves years ago, but after going back to the beginning and watching all four seasons during the pandemic, I highly recommend you don’t do the same (at least not when the world is already stressful enough). This Netflix series is packed with heavy and disturbing elements, so instead of providing an interesting escape, it turns into a depressing undertaking. -Sara Moniuszko\n\n25. “Better Call Saul”: With final-season production postponed by the pandemic, you’ve got time to catch up with AMC's “Breaking Bad” prequel, which might be the best spinoff series ever. Bob Odenkirk is great in the title role, but Rhea Seehorn’s Emmy-worthy performance was the jewel of the just-concluded Season 5. -B.K.\n\n26. “Big Little Lies”: I’m embarrassed to say it took me this long to watch HBO's incredible miniseries. Although a lot of the plotlines and themes are heavy, the series provides the perfect binge option that will keep you hooked. (And the twists and turns may even help you escape from the world’s problems for a bit.) -S.M.\n\n27. “Damages’’: Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are terrific in every season of FX's legal thriller. -Dawn Gilbertson\n\n28. “Dead to Me”: The Netflix series starring Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini will surely take you to the “Are you still watching?” screen. With twists and turns in every episode, we’re grateful they are renewing it for a third and final season. -Amy Haneline\n\n29. “A Discovery of Witches”: Witches and vampires. Good and evil. Love and hate. Supernatural power struggles and scientific discovery. This Netflix series (and book series on which it’s based) has it all (including Matthew Goode as a brooding, love-struck vampire). -J.M.\n\n30. “Dispatches From Elsewhere”: Created by Jason Segel (\"How I Met Your Mother\"), AMC's \"Elsewhere\" focuses on four diverse strangers, struggling through challenges in life, who unite to find magic in the world. It’s fantastical, surreal, mind-bending, and one of the few things that has made me smile during this dark time. -A.M.\n\n31. “Doc McStuffins”: When you become a parent, your bingeing takes a turn. But we admittedly love watching Disney Channel's confident Black doctor care for her toys even when we wish to never hear “time for a checkup, time for a checkup” ever again. -A.H.\n\n32. “Elementary”: I had always loved Sherlock Holmes-like detectives on shows like “Monk” and “Psych,” and enjoyed this CBS take on the most famous literary detective, played by Johnny Lee Miller. But the real reason I devoured all seven seasons was Lucy Liu's Watson. -K.L.\n\n33. “Expecting Amy”: Anyone who loves Amy Schumer's brand of honest comedy will enjoy this HBO Max docuseries, an unwatered-down recount of her difficult pregnancy, during which she suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, an extreme form of morning sickness, and attempted to tour and film a stand-up special. -E.J.\n\n34. “Felicity”: I adored J.J. Abrams’ college-set WB series, even if I was one of the fans who checked out after Felicity Porter’s (Keri Russell) ill-advised Season 2 haircut. Finally, I’m seeing this Felicity-Ben-Noel love triangle (Team Noel!) through to graduation. -Kim Willis\n\n35. “Five Came Back”: This documentary series on Netflix highlights the work of five Hollywood directors who, at the top of their careers, joined the U.S. military during World War II to document the many facets of the war. Modern-day directors analyze both their predecessors and the films. It's powerful on its own, and life-changing if paired with the documentary “Nazi Concentration Camps,” which shows some of the government-funded footage shot by the directors. -M.C.\n\n36. “Floor is Lava”: I started watching this Netflix competition show about an extreme version of the childhood obstacle game to be ironic, and now I can’t stop. -Hannah Yasharoff\n\n37. “Friday Night Lights”: An NBC show that I watched only sporadically the first time around, this combo of sports and soap, which followed Buzz Bissinger’s book and a movie, won me over. -G.L.\n\n38. “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” I rewatched “The Good Wife” and caught up on “The Good Fight,” and couldn’t help but fall in love all over again. Both are perfect ways to view how the world changed under both the Obama and Trump administrations, respectively – with smart writing and brilliant performances. Watching both series is like taking walks up and down a spiral staircase: Spinning around and around only to arrive somewhere new yet alarmingly familiar. -D.O.\n\n39. “The Great British Baking Show” My favorite form of comfort TV is this quaint British series full of soggy bottoms and delectable treats. I watched all the streaming seasons in the first few weeks of quarantine. -K.L.\n\n40. “Holey Moley” Come on. Sometimes, you just want to see a miniature-golf player knocked into the drink by a whirling windmill blade. If so, ABC has you covered. -B.K.\n\n41. “Jane the Virgin’’: This CW series (streaming on Netflix) has long been on my to-watch list and I loved it, even the over-the-top antics of Rogelio de la Vega (Jaime Camil). -D.G.\n\n42. “John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City”: John Mulaney’s performance in his Netflix stand-up special “Kid Gorgeous\" is as close to a perfect routine as I’ve seen. -E.J.\n\n43. “Justified”: I binge-watched six seasons of this FX gem on Hulu in less than a month, one of them in a single day. And now I desperately miss Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) and Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins). -D.G.\n\n44. “The Last Dance”: ESPN’s 10-episode documentary (streaming on Netflix July 19) is a great retrospective about the Chicago Bulls’ six NBA championships, but it also reveals much about the players – Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Steve Kerr and others – and about sports and culture in the 1990s. -B.K.\n\n45. “Little Fires Everywhere”: If you binged “Big Little Lies” and are looking for your next drama/mystery series, look no further than Hulu's “Little Fires,” starring Kerry Washington and Reese Witherspoon. What’s even better? It’s only one season, so no long commitment required! -S.M.\n\n46. “Lovesick”: This British show (Netflix) follows Dylan (Johnny Flynn), a perpetually in-love man who tests positive for chlamydia and must contact women he’s slept with to let them know. As he revisits past flames, he reveals a backstory that has consequences for Dylan’s present, when he’s in love with his best friend (Antonia Thomas), who’s engaged to someone else. But don’t let that description fool you: The show is hilarious and its characters nuanced and compelling. -J.M.\n\n47. “Mad Men”: AMC's take on the Madison Avenue advertising world is just as intoxicating now as it was when Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and company finished their run five years ago. Aside from the obvious Mid Mod eye candy, the show’s abruptly changing 1960s culture and depiction of a business constantly on the brink of collapse feel oddly timely amid the coronavirus crisis. -K.W.\n\n48. “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”: I’ll admit, I was late to the game with bingeing this feel good, award-winning Amazon series about a 1950s housewife turned aspiring stand-up comic. But what better time to catch up on all the shows I wished I watched than during a pandemic? Cheering on Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) as she uproots her life and starts anew felt like a fitting story for a time when many people are reflecting on the world and their priorities. -Charlie Trepany\n\n49. “Medici: Masters of Florence”: I’m a sucker for any kind of historical fiction, and binged through all three seasons on Netflix during time off, which provided entertainment and a new topic of interest. I spent a good deal of time Googling and reading up on the Medici family after various episodes to compare historical sources with the show. -M.H.\n\n50. “Money Heist”: This Spanish Netflix series is excellent. I thought I wouldn’t be able to get past watching a show dubbed into English, but the plot line is so exciting (and anxiety inducing) that I don’t even notice anymore. -Rasha Ali\n\n51. “Motown Magic”: I’d like to thank the creators of this Netflix kids show for allowing me to listen to The Temptations, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas and Marvin Gaye while my kids watch TV. -J.M.\n\n52. “Nate Bargatze: The Tennessee Kid”: To boost my mood during the current climate, I’ve been turning to beloved stand-up specials. Bargatze’s delivery in this Netflix special makes me laugh out loud! “Olivia?” -E.J.\n\n53. “The Office”: I was a fan of the British version starring (and co-created by) Ricky Gervais, but never quite cottoned to Steve Carell’s Michael Scott. But a pandemic binge-watch of NBC's nine seasons of this series endeared me to a stellar supporting cast (and there are so many of them!) and far more nuance than the UK edition could accomplish in its measly 14 episodes. -G.L.\n\n54. “Ozark”: When your days are spent indoors, a thriller like “Ozark” can bring some much-needed excitement. My family turned this on because we’d heard it was good and thought, “Why not?” Once we started watching, we couldn’t stop. -C.T.\n\n55. “Queer Eye”: The latest season of Netflix's “Queer Eye” dropped June 5 and has provided such a pick-me-up during the pandemic. Have I imagined what the experts – Bobby Berk, Jonathan Van Ness, Karamo Brown, Tan France and Antoni Porowski – would say to help me improve my life? Absolutely! -E.J.\n\n56. “Ramy\": This Hulu series has been on my “to watch” list for far too long, and I’m so glad I finally started. Star and creator Ramy Youssef’s semi-autobiographical dramedy, which follows a millennial Muslim man in New Jersey torn between his faith and wanting to fit in with American culture, is fun to watch and unlike anything else on TV right now. -H.Y.\n\n57. “Reconstruction: America After the Civil War”: As an alternative to cable news shows fixated on the controversy of the moment, often with little context, try history. PBS’ four-hour 2019 documentary from Henry Louis Gates is a great starting point to learn more about the history of racism, voter suppression and other topics that are just as relevant today. -B.K.\n\n58. “Say I Do\": So maybe you’re ready to release with a good cry? The couples featured in Netflix's “Say I Do” (and their devotion to each other) will have you bawling – in the best way. Each receive the wedding of their dreams with help from interior designer Jeremiah Brent, fashion designer Thai Nguyen and chef Gabriele Bertaccini. -E.J.\n\n59. “Schitt’s Creek”: This six-season Pop TV comedy (now on Netflix) is a riches-to-rags delight that has heart, charm and so many witty and quotable one-liners. Watching the Rose family navigate going from bazillionaires to living in a small town they once purchased as a joke was the perfect mindless diversion. As Alexis frequently said, “love that journey for me.” -A.M.\n\n60. \"Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker\": If quarantine has left you feeling less than motivated, this Netflix period drama chronicling the story of Madam C.J. Walker, whose fierce determination made her the first African American self-made millionaire, might just be the kick in the pants that you need. -A.H.\n\n61. “Snowpiercer”: Sure, the 2013 Bong Joon-ho sci-fi movie about class struggle was awesome, but TNT's new remake gives us Daveed Diggs as the world’s coolest post-apocalyptic homicide detective on a 1,001-car train bound for nowhere. -Brian Truitt\n\n62. “The Sopranos”: In the time it took Meadow Soprano to parallel park in the divisive series finale, I binge-watched David Chase's HBO mob masterpiece and am already itching to start it again. It's a funny, tear-jerking and often surreal exploration of family in a moral gray area, and Edie Falco as Carmela Soprano is the GOAT. -P.R.\n\n63. “Supernatural”: Worried that I was running through too many TV shows in quarantine, I came up with a solution: Watch one really, really long series. There are 15 seasons of CW’s (and formerly WB's) mystical drama (minus a few episodes in the final season yet to shoot because of the pandemic), and the brotherly ghost fighting has been more than satisfying. Bonus: I’m only nine seasons in. -K.L.\n\n64. “Treme\": Revolving around a national emergency, racial tensions and police corruption, David Simon's HBO series set in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina couldn’t feel more on-point right now. The show’s exhilarating, authentic music and conspicuously great food are pretty good coping mechanisms for COVID-19, too. -K.W.\n\n65. “Unorthodox”: I needed to be immersed in a TV show to distract myself from the increasingly tragic news about the pandemic, and this four-episode Netflix series, about a woman who escapes an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, certainly sucked me in. -K.L.\n\n66. “Upload”: This new Amazon comedy from Greg Daniels (“The Office”) offers a funny, insightful take on the benefits and dangers of technology as the consciousness of a dead man (Robbie Amell) is moved to a digitally created virtual afterlife. The complicated relationship forged with the very alive tech worker assigned to manage his afterlife (Andy Allo) is poignant and funny. -B.K.\n\n67. “We’re Here”: In this HBO series, three former competitors on “RuPaul's Drag Race” – Shangela Laquifa Wadley, Bob the Drag Queen and Eureka O’Hara – transform residents of small towns for a drag show, which (spoiler alert!) typically helps ignite an internal makeover as well. -E.J.\n\n68. “Yellowstone”: This popular Paramount Network drama has something for fans of Westerns and Kevin Costner. But what it really offers to viewers stuck at home is the most marvelous Big Sky, wide-open scenery, vistas of mountains and fields and streams from location shooting in the Rocky Mountain states. -B.K.\n\nBooks\n\n69. “And Then There Were None” by Agatha Christie: I had never read any of Christie’s classics, so I started with this one, which tops many best-of lists. It did not disappoint. The tale reads like a game of “Survivor” as visitors lured to an island die one by one. The twist at the end is worth the wait. -A.M.\n\n70. The Charlotte Holmes series by Brittany Cavallaro: The four mystery-filled novels center on teenagers John Watson and Charlotte Holmes, whose great-great-great grandfathers were quite the crime-solving duo. The kids are a formidable pair in that same vein, too, though they also have to navigate their own complicated family legacies and feelings about each other. -B.T.\n\n71. “The Cruel Prince” by Holly Black: I love young adult fantasy fiction, and Black has a compelling series about fairies, politics and finding your place in the world, starting with this novel, which I read in a single day. -K.L.\n\n72. “Death in Her Hands” by Ottessa Moshfegh: After thoroughly enjoying the emotion, humor and writing style of “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” I couldn’t wait for Moshfegh’s next book. Unfortunately, the story is a bit of a snoozefest, and Moshfegh gets a little too caught up in the inner workings of the protagonist’s mind. -A.M.\n\n73. “Ex Machina” by Brian K. Vaughan and Tony Harris: Not the slick sci-fi movie but the even better 50-issue comic-book series that marries “The West Wing” and superheroes. The mayor of New York City is a former masked vigilante who balances running the Big Apple with dealing with supervillains and interdimensional threats. -B.T.\n\n74. “The Fire Next Time” by James Baldwin: Esteemed writer Baldwin's book is split into two: The first part, a letter to his nephew about the history of race in America; the second, an essay on his experiences with religion and race. Baldwin's writing is beautiful and striking, and his prose will stick with you long after you reach the final page. -H.Y.\n\n75. “Fleishman Is in Trouble” by Taffy Brodesser-Akner: This was the first title that my quarantine book club read, and it proved a fruitful discussion starter. Conversation ranged from how much being a woman/man is part of one’s identity to whether it’s OK to grow together and apart in relationships. Much wine was happily consumed. -Carly Mallenbaum\n\n76. “Florence Adler Swims Forever” by Rachel Beanland: I reviewed this book and it was the first that entirely held my attention. I was so enthralled by the plot that I woke up thinking about it at 3 a.m. after the first afternoon of reading. -M.H.\n\n77. “Followers” by Megan Angelo: I came for the interesting premise of two women trying to game the social media influencer system; I stayed for the nail-biting commentary about the dangers of internet usage and the downsides to celebrity culture. -H.Y.\n\n78. “Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression” by Studs Terkel: The current economic climate is stressful and I thought I might read up on a similar time – the Great Depression. I have heard stories from my parents, who were born into the Depression. They have passed, but I found a great deal of additional perspective from the late author and historian Terkel, who compiled a book of experiences from a cross section of people, both socially and economically diverse, who lived through that dramatic period of history. -M.C.\n\n79. “How to Make a Plant Love You” by Summer Rayne Oakes: To supplement my quarantine gardening hobby, I picked up this highly recommended book on plant parenthood. More than a guide on how to not kill plants, the book ponders our relationship with nature, something I’ve been thinking about a lot from the confines of my apartment. -K.L.\n\n80. “Know My Name” by Chanel Miller: Miller, the survivor in the Brock Turner rape case formerly known as Emily Doe, tells her empowering story about reclaiming her name and healing after surviving sexual assault. -J.R.\n\n81. “Learn to Lucid Dream” by Dr. Kristen LaMarca: The internet has endless resources on how to lucid dream (should you be as interested as I am on the topic), but LaMarca’s book efficiently condenses all of the most effective practices into one book. So far, I’ve had two lucid dreams! -C.M.\n\n82. “A Little Life” by Hanya Yanagihara: Who knew someone could write 800+ pages of torture and never let up? A trigger warning disguised as a novel, this disturbing work is full of unrelenting trauma. I will discuss this book with you if you read it, for sure, but I can’t in good faith recommend it. To anyone. -D.O.\n\n83. “The Long Call” by Ann Cleeves: In the North Devon-set novel, Detective Matthew Venn investigates a murder that hits close to home: One that could possibly involve the church community he turned his back on years ago or his beloved husband, with whom he has made a new life. A serious page-turner that keeps you guessing. -M.C.\n\n84. “A Man Called Ove’’ by Fredrik Backman: I haven’t stopped recommending this beautiful book about a curmudgeon and his outgoing neighbors. -D.G.\n\n85. “Normal People” and “Conversations With Friends” by Sally Rooney: After binge-watching and falling in love with Hulu's “Normal People,” I went back to read the source material. I didn’t think I could love it more than the series, but I did. That prompted me to read Rooney’s earlier hit, “Friends,” which Hulu is also developing into a series. Book or series, Rooney’s meditations on the messiness of love will hook you. -A.M.\n\n86. “Red, White and Royal Blue” by Casey McQuiston: The queer romantic comedy novel I wish I had as a kid. The president’s son and the Queen of England’s grandson falling (literally) into a forbidden romance? Don’t walk – run – to read this. Surprisingly steamy to boot. -D.O.\n\n87. “The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company” by Robert Iger: I’m a Disney junkie, so I jump at the chance to learn about anything behind the scenes from the House of Mouse. In addition to providing an interesting look into Disney’s relationship with Pixar, Marvel and more, it has some great insight about how one of the world’s most recognizable CEOs got to where he is today. -H.Y.\n\n88. Ruth Ware’s books: Ware is the contemporary queen of the psychological crime thriller. Here’s my ranking of the books from best to great: “The Death of Mrs. Westaway,” “The Lying Game,” “The Turn of the Key,” “The Woman in Cabin 10,” “In a Dark, Dark Wood.” -A.M.\n\n89. “So You Want to Talk About Race” byIjeoma Oluo: Oluo’s book was written for many types of people, including white people working toward becoming effective allies. For that group, I can say that it’s an educational gift. -C.M.\n\n90. “War and Peace” by Leo Tolstoy: OK, so I still have 300 pages left, but I’m in the home stretch of this massive Russian tome. I plucked my dusty, unread copy off the shelf back in March, so when people asked what I did during the great plague of 2020, I could say I read “War and Peace.” -B.V.\n\nMusic\n\n91. “Chromatica” by Lady Gaga: This high-energy pop album was probably meant to be blasted at crowded clubs rather than in my living room with just me and my dog, but I’ll take my dance parties where I can get them. -C.T.\n\n92. “Dear Evan Hansen Original Broadway Cast Recording”: The soft pop score of this Tony-winning musical, with vocals from the great Ben Platt, helped get me into a work-from-home groove, unseating other Broadway cast albums in my recently played feed on Spotify. -K.L.\n\n93. “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” by Fiona Apple: Apple couldn’t have known the world she’d be releasing her fifth album into when she recorded it, but this primal scream of righteous anger is exactly what these plague times call for. “Kick me under the table all you want/ I won't shut up” is my new life motto. -B.V.\n\n94. “Hamilton Original Broadway Cast Recording”: What’d I miss? Five years of listening to this infectious blend of rap, R&B, jazz and good ol’ musical-theater standards, that's what. Spotify may think I have a problem. -B.T.\n\n95. “Let’s Dance” (2018 remastered) by David Bowie: I’ve head-bobbed my way through the opening hook of “Modern Love” about a hundred times since quarantine started, and it’s not getting old. When this classic Bowie album was released in 1983, we used to have family dance parties around the record player in our living room. Now I’m streaming it as I do burpees and push-ups inside my condo. It’s still perfect. -A.M.\n\n96. “RTJ4” by Run the Jewels: Rap duo Killer Mike and El-P wrote most of this album in 2019, well before the racial reckoning currently cascading across the U.S., but the lyrics are eerily prescient. Listening now is a powerful call to action, a message of urgency to fix so much that is broken. You’ll be singing earworm “Ooh la la” for days. -A.M.\n\nPodcasts\n\n97. \"Armchair Expert\": The weekly podcast by actor Dax Shepard and co-host Monica Padman isn’t exactly an escape from reality, but their conversations with celebrities, journalists and academics about deep things like addiction, racism and yes, even the coronavirus pandemic, are sure to stretch your mental muscles. And there’s no better time than now to try to improve upon ourselves. -A.H.\n\n98. “The Happiness Lab”: The show from Laurie Santos, the professor behind the super-popular Yale course about “the science of well-being,” is the soundtrack for my outdoor walks because it has a winning podcast combination: fascinating stories, science and self-help. -C.M.\n\n99. “The Office Ladies”: To keep myself from re-watching “The Office” for the billionth time, I instead turned to a weekly recap podcast that goes episode by episode, hosted by actresses Jenna Fischer (who played Pam Beesly) and Angela Kinsey (Angela Martin) with occasional cameos from the rest of the cast. -H.Y.\n\n100. “This Is Love”: The latest season of this audio series about romance and connection (which I listen to while I fold my laundry) is all about animals. Of course, I tear up over the episodes of a heroic guide dog and the goose with a human BFF. I tend to immediately retell the \"Love” stories to my loved ones. -C.M.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2022/06/21/usa-today-best-selling-books-last-10-summers/6849389001/", "title": "USA TODAY's best selling books of the last 10 summers", "text": "What does it take to become the book of summer?

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}]}

That would be Netflix's \"Blonde,\" a historical fiction drama about Marilyn Monroe (played by Ana de Armas) that polarized critics with its gratuitous nudity, sexual violence and seemingly anti-abortion stance. The film topped the nominations with eight, including worst picture, worst director (Andrew Dominik) and worst screenplay.\n\nDe Armas, who has picked up Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards nods for her performance, was excluded from the worst actress lineup.\n\n'Blonde' fact-check:Did Marilyn Monroe really have a threesome with Charlie Chaplin's son?\n\nTom Hanks, meanwhile, wasn't so lucky.

Well, it wasn't the first time.\n\nBefore another movie joins the hallowed ranks at Sunday's 95th annual Academy Awards (ABC, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT), we're rethinking past best picture winners and the films that should have conquered them.\n\n1942\n\nDid win: \"How Green Was My Valley\"\n\nShould have won: \"Citizen Kane\"\n\nPerhaps the most egregious mistake came relatively early in Oscars history, with John Ford's coal-country drama – which took five Academy Awards to a lone \"Kane\" screenplay win – getting the nod over Orson Welles' epic about an eccentric media mogul that is widely regarded as the best movie ever made.\n\n1953\n\nDid win: \"The Greatest Show on Earth\"\n\nShould have won: \"High Noon\"\n\nEven with a stellar cast – including Charlton Heston, Dorothy Lamour and Jimmy Stewart – \"Greatest Show\" is essentially a 152-minute commercial for the circus. They must have been clowning around because this category also included \"High Noon,\" one of the greatest Westerns of the genre's golden age with Gary Cooper as a cool lawman.\n\n1967\n\nDid win: \"A Man for All Seasons\"\n\nShould have won: \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"\n\nThat year's best picture win went to a rousingly successful Sir Thomas More biopic, along with a bunch of awards-season gold. But come on, \"Man,\" they should have gone for Mike Nichols' debut black comedy about marital strife. It's absolutely nuts, risky for its time, and features astounding turns from Richard Burton and especially Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n1974\n\nDid win: \"The Sting\"\n\nShould have won: \"The Exorcist\"\n\nBoth were huge hits that came in with 10 nominations, and Robert Redford and Paul Newman's ragtime-tinged con-man caper was the safe choice. \"The Exorcist\" was the true standout, a fright-fest masterpiece about faith and innocence that's scared the socks off folks for nearly 50 years.\n\n1980\n\nDid win: \"Kramer vs. Kramer\"\n\nShould have won: \"Apocalypse Now\"\n\nNot to take anything away from the wrenching look at divorce with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, but \"Apocalypse Now\" was unlike any war film that came before it, an operatic and grandiose episode that delved into the horrors, physical and otherwise, inherent on the battlefield.\n\n1982\n\nDid win: \"Chariots of Fire\"\n\nShould have won: \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"\n\nOne was a true-life story of Olympic athletes that we remember now mostly because of its catchy theme song. The other was a rip-roaring, two-fisted and hugely influential ode to the serial adventures of yesteryear – with an adventurous archaeologist on the hunt for the Ark of the Covenant – that took pop culture by storm. And a \"Raiders\" win would have been a game-changer for blockbusters.\n\n1986\n\nDid win: \"Out of Africa\"\n\nShould have won: \"The Color Purple\"\n\nThe epic romance with Robert Redford and Meryl Streep in colonial Kenya won over Oscar voters but not critics, who gave \"Africa\" mixed reviews. The Academy whiffed by not honoring a film with Whoopi Goldberg's Golden Globe-winning performance, Oprah Winfrey's high-profile Hollywood debut and Steven Spielberg's honest exploration of racism, sexism and domestic violence in the early 20th century.\n\n1990\n\nDid win: \"Driving Miss Daisy\"\n\nShould have won: \"Field of Dreams\"\n\nThe pairing of Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman in a heartwarming dramedy about an elderly white woman and her African-American driver took down \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"My Left Foot\" and \"Dead Poets Society.\" Good movies all around, but none as excellent as the corn-fed Kevin Costner fantasy that captured the wonders of baseball and, yes, dreams.\n\n1995\n\nDid win: \"Forrest Gump\"\n\nShould have won: \"Pulp Fiction\"\n\nTom Hanks literally running through history in the overly earnest \"Gump\" is what the Oscars, at least back in the day, lived for. Not so much Quentin Tarantino's genre mash-up \"Pulp Fiction,\" an ultraviolent, narratively complex cultural phenomenon that wasn't just the best picture that year but arguably of the entire decade.\n\n1997\n\nDid win: \"The English Patient\"\n\nShould have won: \"Fargo\"\n\nAnthony Minghella's romantic World War II drama is a fine film, though it tests viewers' patience over the course of three hours. On the other hand, \"Fargo\" spawned a TV series and a fandom for the Coen brothers' winningly quirky black comedy about murderous deeds and dimwits in snow-covered Minnesota.\n\n1999\n\nDid win: \"Shakespeare in Love\"\n\nShould have won: \"Saving Private Ryan\"\n\n\"Dunkirk\" and \"1917\" have also gone the route of putting the audience right in the middle of the horrors of war, but \"Private Ryan\" did it best – and with \"America's Dad\" Tom Hanks, no less. \"Shakespeare\" had an intriguing concept as a referential, experimental biopic but it has no business upending another Spielberg classic.\n\n2005\n\nDid win: \"Million Dollar Baby\"\n\nShould have won: \"The Aviator\"\n\nMartin Scorsese would end up getting his big Oscar win two years later for \"The Departed\" but it should have happened with \"Aviator.\" The Howard Hughes biopic, piloted by Leonardo DiCaprio's fantastic descent into eccentric madness, is a no-brainer over Clint Eastwood's above-average boxing drama with the super-downer ending.\n\n2006\n\nDid win: \"Crash\"\n\nShould have won: \"Brokeback Mountain\"\n\nPaul Haggis' interwoven all-star drama about racial tensions in L.A., plagued by mixed reviews and complaints of stereotyping, has caught flak for more than 10 years as an Oscar fail. And it is, especially considering Ang Lee's timeless and resonant \"Brokeback\" was sitting right there, with Jake Gyllenhaal and the late Heath Ledger as cowboys in a forbidden love affair.\n\n2011\n\nDid win: \"The King's Speech\"\n\nShould have won: \"Black Swan\"\n\nThe consensus at the time was that period drama \"King's Speech,\" with Colin Firth's George VI working through a troublesome stutter, pulled an upset on David Fincher's vaunted Facebook bio \"The Social Network.\" Yet flying above both was the polarizing \"Swan,\" Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman's weird and wonderful character study of an embattled ballerina.\n\n2019\n\nDid win: \"Green Book\"\n\nShould have won: \"BlacKkKlansman\"\n\n\"Green Book\" is a fine, well-acted movie but on a night where many Black voices were honored, the top prize went to a film about race relations from a white point of view. Spike Lee's \"BlacKkKlansman,\" however, would have been the ideal choice: an entertaining, thought-provoking cop drama that digs into America's racist past to mirror our own tumultuous times.\n\nRecommended reading for Oscars 2023:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/03/11/blonde-tom-hanks-elvis-razzie-awards-2023/11416507002/", "title": "'Blonde,' Tom Hanks in 'Elvis' win Razzie Awards for worst of the year", "text": "Razzies aren't a girl's best friend.\n\n\"Blonde,\" Netflix's exploitative drama about Marilyn Monroe, is the \"winner\" of worst movie at the 43rd annual Golden Raspberry Awards (aka the Razzies), which cheekily honor the year's most putrid performances and films.

Eddie Murphy has been entertaining millions since he was a teen; no Oscar. Harrison Ford is synonymous with the popcorn thriller; but no Academy Award.\n\nThe reasons for Oscar slights are often as simple as a popular actor being in a particularly competitive field: Bradley Cooper, Michael Keaton, Benedict Cumberbatch and Steve Carell all lost to Eddie Redmayne, who won best actor in 2015 for \"The Theory of Everything.\"\n\nTake a spin with us through this list of favorite actors who have yet to win an Oscar. Will any of them exit this group Sunday night? Tune in to see.\n\nColin Farrell\n\nColin Farrell first stood out two decades ago in his star turn opposite Tom Cruise in 2002's sci-fi thriller \"Minority Report.\" He's continued to dazzle ever since in everything from black comedies (\"In Bruges\") to TV reboots (\"Miami Vice\"). This year he gets his first Oscar nomination for his subtle performance in \"The Banshees of Inisherin.\"\n\nAngela Bassett\n\nIn 1994, Angela Bassett was nominated for best actress for her powerful turn as Tina Turner in “What’s Love Got to Do With It.” Three decades later, she's up again, this time for best supporting actress as Queen Ramonda in \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" and has already won prizes at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards.\n\nMichelle Williams\n\nMichelle Williams has five Oscar acting nominations, but her performances to date have gone unrewarded by the academy and the Screen Actors Guild. Could this year change everything? She's up for best actress for playing a character based on Steven Spielberg's mother in his memoir of a film, \"The Fabelmans.\"\n\nScarlett Johansson\n\nScarlett Johansson's two nominations in 2019 – for best actress in \"Marriage Story\" and supporting actress in \"Jojo Rabbit\" – so far have been the actress' only appearances on Oscar's radar.\n\nAntonio Banderas\n\nSpanish heartthrob Antonio Banderas was nominated for the first time for a best actor Oscar for his 2019 role in \"Pain and Glory.\" He also has been nominated for five Golden Globes without a win.\n\nSaoirse Ronan\n\nSaoirse Ronan's turn in \"Little Women\" brought the actress to the Oscar nominations list for a fourth time. She was also nominated for \"Atonement,\" \"Brooklyn\" and \"Lady Bird.\"\n\nGlenn Close\n\nGlenn Close has been nominated a whopping eight times, including for best actress in 2018's “The Wife.” She's widely considered to be one of the best actresses to never have won an Oscar.\n\nJohnny Depp\n\nAnother star who’s been nominated for an Oscar but never won: Johnny Depp. The actor and musician has been up for best actor three times. No telling how his recent legal troubles will impact his movie career, let alone his bid for the industry's biggest award.\n\nWillem Dafoe\n\nWhy, yes, Willem Dafoe was nominated for an Academy Award a few years back for “At Eternity’s Gate.” And nominated again the year before that, and two other times as well. He seems long overdue.\n\nBradley Cooper\n\nSince 2013, Bradley Cooper has been nominated for nine Oscars, including four as an actor: “Silver Linings Playbook,” “American Hustle,” “American Sniper” and \"A Star Is Born.” He's also been nominated in the best picture category for \"A Star Is Born\" and as a producer for \"Joker.\" But he's empty-handed so far.\n\nAmy Adams\n\nAmy Adams has heard another name called in her acting category six times. She’s also been nominated for seven BAFTAs, but never won one of those, either.\n\nSam Elliott\n\nSam Elliott, who made his film debut in 1969 in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” was nominated for his first Oscar in 2019 for supporting actor in “A Star Is Born.” But he didn't win.\n\nViggo Mortensen\n\nViggo Mortensen lost in his bid for an Oscar in 2019 for best picture winner “Green Book,” after losing in the actor category twice previously.\n\nAnnette Bening\n\nAnother four-time nominee, Annette Bening, who is married to Hollywood icon Warren Beatty, has yet to win an Oscar. Although the actress is still plying her craft, it remains to be seen if she will join Beatty as an Oscar winner.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer is someone you probably assumed had won an Oscar before. She’s been in the running for three awards, but hasn’t won any yet. But she's still happily on the big screen, most recently with Michael Douglas in \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\"\n\nTom Cruise\n\nTom Cruise seems to embody The Movies. Decades of films, many of them hits, have made him an ubiquitous presence on the big screen, including his magnetic performance in \"Top Gun\" and its sequel \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" While the movie is in contention this year for best picture, Cruise is not nominated for his title role, even after three previous acting nominations.\n\nRobert Downey Jr.\n\nRobert Downey Jr., has been Oscar-nominated for playing Charlie Chaplin and (believe it or not) for playing a method actor who wears blackface in “Tropic Thunder.” He hasn’t won yet.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal\n\nThough he continues to prove he’s worthy of awards recognition, Jake Gyllenhaal has never won an Academy Award. He’s been nominated once for supporting actor in “Brokeback Mountain.”\n\nMark Ruffalo\n\nIn the last dozen years, Mark Ruffalo has been up for three acting Oscars. So far, he hasn’t had the opportunity to give an acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson\n\nSamuel L. Jackson also doesn't have an Oscar. He's been in more than 100 films but has been nominated just once, in 1995 for \"Pulp Fiction.\"\n\nSigourney Weaver\n\nSigourney Weaver has been nominated for three Academy Awards, but has never won. She riveted audiences in \"Alien,\" and more recently played memorable roles in \"Avatar\" and its 2022 sequel.\n\nMichael Fassbender\n\nIrish actor Michael Fassbender has twice been in the running for an Oscar, both in 2014 as supporting actor in \"12 Years A Slave\" and in 2016 as best actor for his portrayal of Apple founder \"Steve Jobs.\"\n\nEdward Norton\n\nEdward Norton has garnered three Oscar nominations spanning decades, from 1997 to 2015. While his work has won him a Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild award, Oscar has remained elusive. He recently appeared as the villain in Rian Johnson's \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.\"\n\nSylvester Stallone\n\nSly Stallone charged out of the gates strong in 1976, thanks to his perfect screenplay and nuanced performance in \"Rocky.\" But no Oscar for either. In 2016, the academy tried once again to reward the action hero, this time with a supporting actor nod for the Rocky-derived film \"Creed.\" But nothing doing.\n\nNaomi Watts\n\nNaomi Watts is one of those actors who demands attention when she's on the screen. Oscar nods came her way twice, in 2004 for \"21 Grams\" and 2013 for \"The Impossible.\" She's only won one major award to date, a Screen Actors Guild cast award in 2015 for \"Birdman.\"\n\nWoody Harrelson\n\nThe former TV star (remember \"Cheers\"?) has been nominated for movie's highest honor three times, including for best actor for his role as pornographer Larry Flynt in 1996's \"The People v. Larry Flynt.\" Harrelson has worked non-stop ever since, but Oscar remains elusive.\n\nGet ready for Oscars 2023:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/01/09/twilight-razzies-stewart-pattinson/1819535/", "title": "'Twilight' finale leads Razzies worst-of list", "text": "AP\n\n'Breaking Dawn — Part 2' led the Razzies lineup with 11 nominations\n\nWorst lead-acting nods for Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson\n\nRazzie winners will be announced Feb. 23\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — The Twilight finale had better reviews than the franchise's previous four movies, but you'd never know it from the Razzie nominations singling out Hollywood's worst of the year.\n\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 2 led the Razzies lineup late Tuesday with 11 nominations, including worst picture, lead-acting slots for Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, and supporting-acting nominations for Taylor Lautner and Ashley Greene.\n\nOther worst-picture nominees are the naval action tale Battleship, the family flick The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure, Adam Sandler's raunchy dud That's My Boy and Eddie Murphy's comedy flop A Thousand Words.\n\nA spoof of the Academy Awards, the Razzies announcement came a little more than a day before Thursday's Oscar nominations.

Some migrants, including children, have been wounded by the wire after crossing the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass, Texas, when attempting to enter the state.\n\nMoses ruled that the order will be in effect pending the outcome of a hearing on Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's request last week that federal border authorities be barred from interfering with the state’s razor wire.\n\n\"The Court shall grant the temporary relief requested, with one important exception for any medical emergency that mostly likely results in serious bodily injury or death to a person, absent any boats or other life-saving apparatus available to avoid such medical emergencies prior to reaching the concertina wire barrier,\" Moses wrote in the court filing.\n\nThe state of Texas and the Biden administration have repeatedly clashed over illegal border crossings. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s administration has implemented several measures to block migrants from entering the state, including setting up the razor wire and placing large water buoys along the Rio Grande.\n\n'False sense of calm':How social media misleads Mexican migrants about crossing US border\n\nOrder in effect until November\n\nIn an 11-page document filed in federal court in Del Rio, Texas, Moses found that the state had met the required four-part test needed to be granted a temporary halt to the federal government's action.\n\nThe order has limited exceptions, such as medical emergencies, and only mentioned ware installed in Eagle Pass. The order takes effect until Nov. 13 and a hearing in the case is set for next week.\n\n\"Another win for Texas & our historic border mission,” Abbott said on X, formerly known as Twitter, in response to the ruling.\n\nTexas seeks to stop federal agents from cutting razor wire on border\n\nTexas sued the Biden administration on Oct. 24, seeking to prohibit federal agents from cutting the state's razor wire. In the lawsuit, Paxton accuses the federal government of “undermining” the Texas' border security efforts.\n\nIn the state's lawsuit and in the separate request for the temporary ruling, lawyers note that the wires are installed on private properties abutting the river that forms the Texas-Mexico border with the owners' permission.\n\nTwo days after the state filed its lawsuit, a member of the Texas Military Department assigned to the Eagle Pass area took photos of Border Patrol agents cutting and moving coils of wire, according to court filings.\n\nAccording to the court filing, the state military department employee said an agent operating heavy equipment “inserted pallet forks into the concertina wire barrier, lifted the barrier high enough to pull the fencing stakes that kept the fence in place out of the ground, and held it suspended in the air for approximately 20 minutes.”\n\nDuring that time migrants were able to pass through, the filing states.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying that border agents \"have a responsibility under federal law\" to protect migrants from being injured regardless of their legal status.\n\n'New normal':High number of migrants crossing border not likely to slow\n\nBiden administration, Texas feud over border crossings\n\nAbbott's controversial measures to block migrants from crossing Texas' border is part of a two-year effort, known as Operation Lone Star, in response to President Joe Biden's border policies. The initiative has been condemned by the Biden administration along with some Democrats and immigrant advocacy groups.\n\nAbbott has defended the initiative, blaming Biden for \"not doing his job\" at the border. In fiscal year 2023, more than 2 million apprehensions of migrants were recorded along the Mexican border, according to the latest Customs and Border Protection (CBP) statistics.\n\nOver the past two years, Texas has placed a floating border barrier and coils of lacerating wire along the American shoreline without federal approval. The state has also bused thousands of migrants to Democrat-led cities across the United States.\n\nTexas' aggressive border tactics has raised numerous humanitarian and environmental concerns. The razor wire has lacerated not only adults but also young children.

Its purpose was to prohibit border control agencies from holding migrants in \"congregant settings,\" like holding stations, where COVID-19 could spread rapidly. In effect, though, Title 42 gave the government the power to rapidly expel any migrant, without giving them an opportunity to make a case for staying in the country legally, including to seek asylum.\n\nThere have been multiple legal challenges to the policy.\n\nOn Dec. 19, the Supreme Court blocked a plan by the Biden administration to lift Title 42 restrictions on Dec. 21, as ordered by a lower court. On Dec. 27, the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in February on whether 19 Republican-led states, including Texas, can challenge a lower-court ruling that ordered the Biden administration to lift Title 42.\n\nLatest Title 42 update:El Pasoans troubled by National Guard tactics\n\nBut the Supreme Court canceled the case in February after the Biden administration said it would end the nation's COVID-19 emergency order, effectively ending the Title 42 expulsions authority and rendering the arguments moot.\n\nThe CDC officially rescinded the policy a year ago, in April 2022, saying it was \"no longer necessary\" after \"considering current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19.\"\n\nWhat is Title 42?\n\nThe name refers to Title 42 of the U.S. Government Code established July 1, 1944. The law grants federal authorities the power to deny entry of people and products into the country to limit the spread of a communicable disease.\n\nThe Trump administration invoked the authority in March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic, and the Biden administration has continued to use Title 42 expulsions as a method of border control.\n\n\"Title 42 is not an immigration authority, and the order has been used to supersede federal law at the border ‒ which is under Title 8 of the U.S. Code ‒ and abrogate legal rights that have been guaranteed to arriving migrants for decades,\" according to an explainer published by the nonpartisan National Immigration Forum.\n\nWhen will Title 42 end?\n\nThe use of Title 42 expulsions at the Southwest border is expected to end when the nation's COVID-19 emergency order expires May 11.\n\nOn April 1, 2022, the Biden administration announced its plans to rescind the Title 42 order. The policy was to officially end on May 23 but was caught in legal wrangling for months.\n\nHomeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement then that the department would process migrants according to \"standard procedure,\" placing them in removal proceedings. It's still unclear exactly how asylum-seekers and other migrants will be processed once Title 42 expulsions end.\n\nTitle 42 has been a political hot potato. President Joe Biden has faced criticism by Republicans for wanting to end the use of quick expulsions at the border and by Democrats for not ending the expulsions soon enough.\n\nIn the case canceled by the Supreme Court in February, Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri led a coalition of states, including Texas, in challenging the Biden administration's effort to lift Title 42, arguing that their states' health care, law enforcement and education systems would be overly burdened by an influx of undocumented immigrants if the public health restriction is lifted.\n\nHow is the Title 42 border policy used?\n\nThe Border Patrol has applied Title 42 differently in different border regions, depending on the resources available and the demographics of migrant groups. Enforcement of the order also varied under the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nUnder the policy, migrants who cross between ports of entry can be picked up by Border Patrol, processed and expelled ‒ sometimes within hours. Title 42 has been applied both to those migrants who seek to evade border agents as well as those who turn themselves in with Border Patrol to seek asylum.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nThe Border Patrol's ability to expel unauthorized migrants under Title 42 has been limited by which migrants Mexico is willing to accept, and how many, at different points along the border. The rate of Title 42 expulsions also can be influenced by the demographic makeup of who is crossing where.\n\nMigrants from Mexico, Central American nations, Cuba and Venezuela can be expelled to Mexico under an agreement between the U.S. and Mexico. Others, including Haitians, have been expelled to their countries of origin unless they have legal documents to reside in Mexico, in which case they can be sent back to Mexico.\n\nBorder agencies expelled unaccompanied migrant children for a time under the order during the Trump administration, but the Biden administration stopped the practice.\n\nIn El Paso, the expulsions have taken the form of the Border Patrol walking migrants to the top of an international bridge and instructing them to walk south into Juárez. In some cases, the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector transfers migrants for expulsion at border crossings in other parts of Texas and in Arizona.\n\nHow many migrants have been expelled?\n\nSince the start of the Title 42 policy, the Border Patrol has expelled migrants nearly 2.8 million times, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nTitle 42 allows for quick returns without repercussion, and that has encouraged some migrants to try again and again. Multiple crossings by migrants surged after the order went into effect.\n\nIn El Paso, the Border Patrol has leaned heavily on Title 42, where 63% of Border Patrol encounters have resulted in a Title 42 expulsion over the life of the policy, according to CBP. Between January and March, between two-thirds and 73% of encounters each month have resulted in expulsion.\n\nMexico permits Title 42 expulsions at some, but not all, of its border crossings.\n\nAcross the Southwest border, the use of Title 42 expulsions is much lower. From January to March, between one-third and 36% of encounters resulted in expulsion, in part, because Mexico doesn't accept expelled migrants in some locations.\n\nMore:Homeland Security: Nearly 20K Venezuelans subscribe to 'lawful pathway' pilot program\n\nJohn Moritz of the USA TODAY Network-Texas and John Fritze of USA TODAY contributed to this report.

Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters In pictures: El Paso sees surge in border crossings Prev Next\n\nDylan Corbett, the executive director of Hope Border Institute that assists with running some of El Paso’s shelters, warned Tuesday that he expects the Supreme Court decision “will extend the bottleneck at the border, create unsustainable pressure on border enforcement and lead to more deaths.”\n\nOfficials expect that lifting Title 42 will trigger an influx of migrants to the US-Mexico border. Even with the policy still in place, however, many migrants are undeterred, some choosing to cross the border illegally while others wait in crowded shelters, makeshift encampments or in the streets of Mexican border towns.\n\nAt least 22,000 migrants are staying in the Mexican border cities of Tijuana, Reynosa and Matamoros, city officials and advocates told CNN on Monday.\n\nPastor Timothy Perea, a lifelong El Paso resident who is volunteering to help arriving migrants said he expects to see more attempting the border crossing. “Brace yourself. It’s coming,” he said. “It’s a wave of people seeking a better life.”\n\nEl Paso braces for possible surge of migrants\n\nEl Paso has become a focal point in the growing humanitarian crisis at the border with as many as 2,500 migrants recently arriving from Mexico each day, according to city Mayor Oscar Leeser. City officials have declared a state of emergency as the community has become overwhelmed with the continued flow of asylum-seekers.\n\nWhile Title 42 still remains in effect as legal challenges play out in court, El Paso is developing a plan for handling a potential surge of migrants should Title 42 be terminated, Deputy City Manager Mario D’Agostino said Tuesday.\n\n“Some people talk about 10,000 to 15,000 people waiting in (Ciudad) Juarez to cross over. If those were to come all in a relatively short time frame, space would be difficult. We know transportation would be difficult,” D’Agostino said.\n\nTwo vacant schools in the city are being prepared to house migrants, D’Agostino said. One will be ready to use within two days, while the second won’t be modified for a few weeks, he added.\n\nShelters have also been set up at hotels and some church parishes have volunteered to house migrants, he said. About 1,000 beds have been set up in El Paso’s convention center, which housed more than 480 migrants overnight on Christmas Eve and 420 on Christmas Day, city spokesperson Laura Cruz-Acosta confirmed to CNN.\n\nBut the city is unable to accept migrants who don’t have documentation from Customs and Border Protection, according to Cruz-Acosta, who cited state and federal policies, which she said require migrants to have documentation at government-run facilities.\n\nIf undocumented migrants show up at the government-run shelters, she said, they will be connected with Customs and Border Protection to turn themselves in or referred to shelters run by NGOs.\n\nTwo local NGOs who are accepting undocumented immigrants in their shelters told CNN last week that their facilities are overcrowded, leaving them to close their doors to many seeking shelter even as temperatures dipped dangerously low over the weekend.\n\nLeeser told CNN’s Pamela Paul Tuesday that the situation at the border is “beyond Title 42.”\n\n“We can’t continue to go on in this manner with a broken immigration system that has to be fixed,” the mayor said. “It’s bigger than the United States. I have to work with the UN and countries around us to be able to fix it.”\n\nEl Paso has already been granted more that $10 million of federal funding to support the its efforts to handle the incoming flood of migrants.", "authors": ["Leyla Santiago Rosa Flores Elizabeth Wolfe", "Leyla Santiago", "Rosa Flores", "Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}]}

Russian Ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour Thursday that he didn’t “see any reason for those exercises that had been previously announced and will be conducted according to plan, to be a source of concern to anybody.”\n\nEstonian Ambassador to the US Kristjan Prikk told CNN Thursday that he thinks it is “highly likely” that Russia could use the exercises as a pretext to leave “a sizable military contingent” in Belarus.\n\n“They may rotate this contingent, may not declare it to be permanent, but it is possible that they are going to stay there. And this is something that changes the sort of defense calculus in our region considerably,” he said.\n\nPrikk also noted that Russia’s deployment of troops and equipment to Belarus “serves a dual purpose.” He noted that the southern part of Belarus gives Russia “a suitable staging ground” for threatening and potentially attacking Ukraine, noting that Russia “can even threaten and attack Ukraine without crossing the border from Belarus.”\n\n“With the air defense assets that they have deployed, the S-400 air defense missiles, and with the artillery and missiles…and long range artillery, they can, in fact, threaten Kyiv and some of the key vital infrastructure from Belarus,” he said.\n\nHe also noted that the other purpose “is to signal the West, NATO and to put some military coercion to NATO by having Russian troops in great numbers right across the NATO Eastern border, the areas bordering Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.”\n\nAnother European diplomat told CNN they find the buildup very concerning, both in terms of what it could mean for Ukraine but as an overall reflection that both the US and Europe “have underestimated, not to say largely ignored, the strategic and military consequences of the Russian de facto political and military takeover of Belarus, which has been ongoing since 2020 and is now being finalized, with their joint exercise as a highly symbolic crowning event.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler"], "publish_date": "2022/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-2-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/politics/what-is-nato-article-5/index.html", "title": "Here's what NATO's Article 5 is and how it applies to Russia's ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nRussia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has prompted a roiling debate about what US involvement should look like.\n\nUS officials have made clear that American troops won’t engage directly with Russian forces, and NATO members have pushed back on calls for a no-fly zone to be set up in Ukraine, warning that it could lead to a “full-fledged war in Europe.”\n\nThe situation could change quickly, however, if Moscow’s attack on Ukraine spilled into a NATO member nation and triggered a response based on the alliance’s Article 5 principle.\n\nBut what is Article 5, and how does it apply to the ongoing war in Ukraine?\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nWhat is Article 5?\n\nArticle 5 is the principle that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members. It’s been a cornerstone of the 30-member alliance since it was founded in 1949 as a counterweight to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe principle aims to deter potential adversaries from attacking NATO members. Article 5 guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance can be used to protect any single member nation. This is crucial for many of the smaller countries who would be defenseless without their allies. Iceland, for example, has no standing army.\n\nSince the US is the largest and most powerful NATO member, any state in the alliance is effectively under US protection.\n\nAccording to the NATO website, Article 5 specifically lays out:\n\n“The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n\nAny such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.”\n\nDuring the Cold War, the main concern was the Soviet Union, but in recent years, Russia’s aggressive actions in eastern Europe have been the focus of attention.\n\nHas Article 5 ever been invoked?\n\nArticle 5 has only been invoked once: After the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the US.\n\nBut NATO’s Article 5 principle stretches beyond attacks on the homeland. The alliance has also taken collective defense measures on several occasions, including deploying Patriot missiles in 2012 on the Syrian-Turkish border and bolstering its forces in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nNATO allies have also joined the US to fight in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.\n\nHow does Article 5 apply to Russia’s attack on Ukraine?\n\nSince Ukraine is not a member of NATO, the US is not compelled to protect the country the same way it would if a NATO member nation was attacked.\n\nBut many of Ukraine’s neighbors are NATO members, and if a Russian attack extended into one of those countries, Article 5 could trigger direct involvement from the US and other NATO members.\n\nWhat constitutes an attack on a NATO member nation?\n\nThe Article 5 language specifies that an “armed attack” on a member nation is what triggers collective action.\n\nBut what constitutes an “armed attack” is up to NATO members, and Russia’s aggressive posture has already prompted concern about the country’s willingness to potentially tempt a NATO response.\n\nFor example, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia told The Washington Post recently that a Russian cyberattack on Ukraine could lead to consequences beyond the intended “geographic boundaries” and affect NATO members.\n\n“It could end up bleeding into Poland or Romania or into the Baltic states and cause damage that would shut down hospitals, and potentially, you’ve got American troops there. If American troops in a truck crash because the lights were out, you could get very close to Article 5,” Warner, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, told the outlet.\n\nRussia’s attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant site – the largest in Europe – had prompted similar concern. While local authorities said there’s been “no change in radiation levels” in the area, what if there had been a radiation leak that spread into a NATO member nation?\n\n“That’s a question for the alliance to make,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told CNN earlier this month. “Specifically, I would just remind that Article 5 makes it clear that it’s an armed attack on a NATO ally triggers Article 5. … But how that’s interpreted – that would be really something for the NATO alliance to determine.”\n\nWhat are US officials currently saying about Article 5?\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reiterated the US’ and allies’ commitment to NATO’s Article 5, stating, “If there is any aggression anywhere, on NATO territory on NATO countries, we the United States, all of our allies and partners will take action to defend every inch of NATO territory. It’s as clear and direct as that.”\n\nThe comments from the top US diplomat echoed President Joe Biden’s pledge during his State of the Union address to “defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.”", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/europe/nato-sweden-finland-summit-explainer-intl/index.html", "title": "Sweden and Finland are on the cusp of joining NATO. Here's why ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSweden and Finland are set formally to end decades of neutrality and join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in a historic breakthrough for the alliance that deals a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe last major hurdle to the two nations’ entry to the bloc was removed when Turkey dropped its opposition on Tuesday.\n\nThat breakthrough came during a NATO summit in Madrid that has already become one of the most consequential meetings in the history of the military alliance.\n\nThe two countries are now expected to become full NATO members quickly, shoring up the bloc’s eastern flank within months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHere’s all you need to know about why the move happened, what comes next and why it matters.\n\nWhat are the latest developments?\n\nSweden and Finland both announced their intention to join NATO in May, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused a sudden shift in attitudes toward joining the bloc.\n\nThat announcement was welcomed by almost all of NATO’s leaders – but there was one significant obstacle. Turkey’s President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not looking at both countries joining NATO “positively,” accusing them of housing Kurdish “terrorist organizations.”\n\nUnder NATO rules, just one member state can veto a new applicant’s membership.\n\nHowever, a big diplomatic breakthrough between the three countries took place at the NATO summit in Madrid on Tuesday. Turkey signed a trilateral memorandum with Finland and Sweden, lifting its opposition and officially welcoming them to join the bloc.\n\n“In NATO, we have always shown that whatever our differences, we can always sit down, find common ground and resolve any issues. NATO’s open door policy has been an historic success,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told journalists in Madrid.\n\nOn Wednesday, NATO formally invited Sweden and Finland to join, kickstarting a multistage process that will end with both countries holding full membership.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday addressed the Madrid NATO summit, where a key diplomatic breakthrough has paved the way for Sweden and Finland to join. Manu Fernandez/AP\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nStoltenberg said Wednesday that he expects Sweden and Finland to become members of the military alliance quickly.\n\nThe invitation sparks a seven-step accession process. Key moments along that path include talks between NATO and the candidate countries. The candidates must formally accept the obligations of membership, and then current member states sign an Accession Protocol, before individually ratifying it back home.\n\n“We need a ratification process in 30 parliaments – that always takes some time but I expect also that to go rather quickly because allies are ready to try to make that ratification process happen as quickly as possible,” Stoltenberg explained Wednesday.\n\nAfter that, the candidate country is formally invited to accede to the Washington Treaty, the founding document of the alliance.\n\nNATO has an “open door” policy – any country can be invited to join if it expresses an interest, as long as it is able and willing to uphold the principles of the bloc’s founding treaty.\n\nThe ratification process usually takes about a year, from the signing of the Accession Protocol by existing members to the country joining the Washington Treaty.\n\nBut the war in Ukraine has added unprecedented urgency to Sweden and Finland’s membership, and the timeline could be accelerated accordingly.\n\nHow have leaders reacted?\n\nUS President Joe Biden praised the breakthrough with Turkey, saying it sent a clear signal to Russia that NATO was united and growing.\n\nSweden and Finland’s “decision to move away from neutrality and the tradition of neutrality to join the NATO alliance is going to make us stronger and more secure and NATO stronger,” Biden said. “We are sending an unmistakable message in my view… that NATO is strong, united, and the steps we are taking during this summit are going to further augment our collective strength.”\n\nBiden said the two Nordic countries’ accession was a sign Putin’s aims had backfired.\n\n“Putin was looking for the Finlandization of Europe,” he said, referring to the so-called Finlandization dynamic that saw Russia dominant over the foreign policy of its smaller neighbor for decades. “He’s going to get the NATOization of Europe, and that is exactly what he did not want, that’s exactly what needs to be done to guarantee security for Europe. And I think it’s necessary,” Biden said.\n\nThe move was met with delight across the countries that make up NATO’s eastern front, many of which have expressed concern that they could be next in Russia’s crosshairs if it is successful in Ukraine.\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said the step was “significant,” and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda called it “wonderful news.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Europe now at 1938 moment says fmr. NATO deputy commander 17:04 - Source: CNN\n\nWhat does NATO membership entail?\n\nThe reason most countries join NATO is because of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which stipulates that all signatories consider an attack on one member an attack against all.\n\nArticle 5 has been a cornerstone of the alliance since it was founded in 1949 as a counterweight to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe point of the treaty, and Article 5 specifically, was to deter the Soviets from attacking liberal democracies that lacked military strength. Article 5 guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance – including the massive US military – can be used to protect any single member nation, such as smaller countries that would be defenseless without their allies. Iceland, for example, has no standing army.\n\nFormer Swedish leader Carl Bildt told CNN didn’t foresee new big military bases being built in either country if they joined. He said joining the alliance would probably mean more joint military training and planning between Finland, Sweden and the 30 current members. Swedish and Finnish forces could also participate in other NATO operations around the globe, such as those in the Baltic states, where several bases have multinational troops.\n\n“There’s going to be preparations for contingencies as part of deterring any adventures that the Russians might be thinking of,” Bildt said. “The actual change is going to be fairly limited.”\n\nWhy haven’t Finland and Sweden already joined NATO?\n\nWhile other Nordic countries like Norway, Denmark and Iceland were original members of the alliance, Sweden and Finland did not join the pact for historic and geopolitical reasons.\n\nBoth Finland, which declared independence from Russia in 1917 after the Bolshevik revolution, and Sweden adopted neutral foreign policy stances during the Cold War, refusing to align with either the Soviet Union or the United States.\n\nSweden’s policy of neutrality goes back to the early 1800s, when the country steadfastly stayed out of European conflicts. Its King Gustav XIV formally adopted that neutral status in 1834, according to NATO, and Sweden declared a policy of “non-belligerency” during World War II – allowing Nazi troops to pass through its land into Finland, while also accepting Jewish refugees.\n\nSweden opted to maintain its neutral status after the war ended.\n\nFinland’s neutrality has historically proved more difficult, as it shared a long border with an authoritarian superpower.\n\nA Finno-Soviet treaty known as the Agreement of Friendship, signed in 1948 and extended on occasion through the decades, prohibited Finland from joining any military alliance considered hostile to the USSR, or from allowing a Western attack through Finnish territory.\n\nTo keep the peace, Finns adopted an arrangement sometimes called Finlandization, in which leaders acceded to Soviet demands from time to time. The term was coined during the Cold War and has been applied to other countries in which a superpower exerts control over smaller neighboring states.\n\nBoth countries’ balancing acts effectively ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Sweden and Finland joined the European Union together in 1995 and gradually aligned their defense policies with the West, while still avoiding joining NATO outright.\n\nFinnish infantry on skis fighting the Soviets during World War II.

Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nHow Russia’s invasion changed everything\n\nSweden and Finland have been inching toward the West on security issues since joining the EU shortly after the end of the Cold War. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically accelerated that process, pushing them to pull the trigger on NATO membership.\n\nIf the Kremlin was willing to invade Ukraine – a country with 44 million people, a GDP of about $155 billion, and armed forces of 200,000 active troops – what would stop Putin from invading smaller countries like Finland or Sweden?\n\n“Everything changed when Russia invaded Ukraine,” Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said in April. “People’s mindset in Finland, also in Sweden, changed and shifted very dramatically.”\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine in February, Finnish public support for joining NATO has leaped from around 30% to nearly 80% in some polls. The majority of Swedes also approve of their country joining the alliance, according to opinion polls there.\n\nHow has Russia reacted?\n\nRussia lambasted the May decision by Finland and Sweden to seek to join the alliance. Its Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said at the time that the move would be a “mistake” with “far-reaching consequences,” according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nThat followed similar threats from high-ranking Moscow officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said after the announcement that “NATO expansion does not make the world more stable and secure.” He added that Russia’s reaction would depend on “how far and how close to our borders the military infrastructure will move.”\n\nRussia currently shares about 755 miles of land border with five NATO members, according to the alliance. Finland’s accession would mean that a nation with which Russia shares an 830-mile border would become formally militarily aligned with the United States.\n\nThe addition of Finland and Sweden would also benefit the alliance, which would frustrate Russia. Both are serious military powers, despite their small populations.\n\nBut Putin has so far been more muted in his rhetoric than some of his officials. Last month he said that “Russia has no problems with these states,” adding that the expansion of NATO “does not pose a direct threat to Russia.”\n\n“But the expansion of military infrastructure into this territory will certainly cause our response,” he added at the Collective Security Treaty Organization in Moscow. “We will see what it will be based on the threats that will be created for us.”\n\nWhy is Russia so opposed to NATO?\n\nPutin sees the alliance as a defense against Russia, despite the fact that it spent much of the post-Soviet era focusing on issues like terrorism and peacekeeping.\n\nBefore Putin invaded Ukraine, he made clear his belief that NATO had edged too close to Russia and should be stripped back to its borders of the 1990s, before some countries that either neighbor Russia or were ex-Soviet states joined the military alliance.\n\nUkraine’s desire to join NATO, and its status as a NATO partner – seen as a step on the way to eventual full membership – was one of the numerous grievances Putin cited in an attempt to justify the invasion.\n\nIronically, his invasion has given the alliance new purpose – and increased its strength.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the GDP of Ukraine, which was $155.5 billion in 2020, according to the World Bank.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta Joshua Berlinger", "Rob Picheta", "Joshua Berlinger"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/europe/russia-ukraine-invasion-paths-map-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Russia has surrounded Ukraine from three sides.

Russia has created pressure points on three sides of Ukraine – in Crimea to the south, on the Russian side of the two countries’ border, and in Belarus to the north.\n\nHere are the three fronts Ukraine and the West are watching, and the recent Russian movements detected in each.\n\nEastern Ukraine\n\nMost attention has been paid to the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists have been in conflict since 2014.\n\nThe foremost assumption of those watching Russian movements is that Moscow could boost the military might it already possesses in the region, therefore making eastern Ukraine the easiest position from which to launch an invasion.\n\nSatellite imagery obtained by CNN shows that a large base at Yelnya, which held Russian tanks, artillery and other armor, has been largely emptied, with the equipment apparently being moved much closer to the frontier in recent days.\n\nLarge amounts of weaponry were moved to the base late in 2021 before disappearing – including some 700 tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and ballistic missile launchers. Social media videos since show some of that equipment on trains and roads much further south in the Bryansk region, which is close to Ukraine. The armor and vehicles are identifiably from the same units that had pre-positioned at Yelnya.\n\nStephen Wood, senior director at satellite imagery company Maxar, told CNN: “It looks to me like a considerable amount of the vehicles [tanks, self-propelled artillery and other support vehicles] have departed from the northeastern vehicle park; additional armored vehicles departed from the more central vehicle park.”\n\nMeanwhile, heightened activity in the Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts, which border northeastern Ukraine, has added to concerns.\n\n“We are seeing a massive influx of vehicles and personnel in Kursk,” Konrad Muzyka, an expert in tracking military movements with Rochan Consulting, warned on Twitter.\n\nPhillip Karber of the Potomac Foundation in Washington, who has also studied Russian troop movements in detail, told CNN this month: “Russia’s strongest offensive formation – the First Guards Tank Army, which is normally stationed in the Moscow area – has moved south 400 kilometers (250 miles) and is assembling in the optimum area for a rapid armored offensive on the Khursk-Kyiv invasion route.”\n\nBelarus\n\nConcerns have also grown over a vast build-up of Russian troops in Belarus, a country closely allied to Moscow that could provide another way into Ukraine.\n\nRussia and Belarus began 10 days of joint military drills on February 10, the size and timing of which has sparked fears in the West.\n\nMoscow’s deployment into Belarus is believed to be its biggest there since the Cold War, with “an expected 30,000 combat troops, Spetsnaz special operation forces, fighter jets including SU-35, Iskander dual-capable missiles and S-400 air defense systems,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on February 3.\n\nIt is also the largest exercise the Belarusian armed forces have conducted at any time of year, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed the purpose of the drills, called “Allied Resolve-2022,” included repelling “external aggression.”\n\nSome fear the build-up points to a Russian plan to surge towards Kyiv from the north. One European diplomat told CNN earlier this month that the massing of forces is a “big, big worry,” noting this would be the missing piece that Moscow would need to launch a quick attack on the Ukrainian capital.\n\nThe joint drills would also provide cover for a flanking movement through Belarus and into northern Ukraine, CSIS warns.\n\nMaxar's satellite images show that for the first time several tent encampments have been created at Rechitsa, in the Homel region of Belarus. Satellite image ©️2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nSatellite images released by Maxar in early February appeared to show that Russia’s military had advanced deployments at several locations in Belarus. The deployments are likely linked to the joint exercises, but other photographs show camps being established close to the border with Ukraine, hundreds of miles from where the exercises are taking place.\n\nTroops and equipment deployed to an area near the Belarusian city of Rechitsa – less than 30 miles (45 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine – appeared on February 14 to have departed, though it was not clear to where, according to the Maxar imagery.\n\nBut if Russia were to focus on the Belarusian border as its entry point to Ukraine, the route would be fraught with difficulties.\n\nRussian soldiers would have to negotiate the Pinsk Marshes, also known as the Pripet Marshes, one of Europe’s largest wetlands, which straddles the border between Belarus and Ukraine – a dense, waterlogged and densely forested terrain stretching across 104,000 square miles.\n\nThat region impeded Nazi forces during Operation Barbarossa, Germany’s doomed invasion of the Soviet Union, in 1941.\n\nAccording to the Institute for the Study of War, “the marshes can be difficult, in some places likely impossible, for mechanized forces to traverse when wet.”\n\nCrimea\n\nThe peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014 would provide a natural staging ground for any new operation, but it is unclear whether Moscow would attempt to launch a move into Ukraine from Crimea.\n\nAt least 60 helicopters have landed within the past few days at a previously vacant airbase at Donuzlav Lake on the northwest coast of Crimea, according to Maxar’s satellite images dated February 13. The arrival of the helicopters coincides with a major Russian naval exercise in the Black Sea, involving more than 30 ships.\n\nAnd large deployment of troops and equipment have been observed by Maxar, which assesses that more than 550 troop tents and hundreds of vehicles have arrived north of the Crimean capital, Simferopol.\n\nA more recent satellite image from Maxar shows troops and equipment at Oktyabrskoye airfield, Crimea, Ukraine, on February 10, 2022. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nA new deployment was identified by Maxar for the first time on Thursday near the town of Slavne on the northwest coast of Crimea, including armored vehicles.\n\nThose new deployments were observed on the same day that several Russian warships arrived in Sevastopol, Crimea’s main port. The Russian Defense Ministry posted images Thursday of six large amphibious landing ships at the port.\n\nUkraine’s Navy responded that “Russia continues to militarize the Black Sea Region, transferring additional landing ships to put pressure on Ukraine and the world.”\n\nUkraine’s naval forces “are ready for development of any scenarios and provocations, to defend the country from the sea,” it added.\n\nAny move into southern Ukraine could be aided by troops in Transnistria, the Russian-supported breakaway region of Moldova, where build-up has also been reported.\n\nCSIS analysts say Russian troops could attempt a coup de main on Odessa, a Ukrainian port city the northwest of Crimea, by “sailing its amphibious ships straight into Odessa’s port and moving directly into the city.”\n\nIt calls such a move “a high gain but also a high-risk operation.” Odessa is a well-populated city and urban combat there would favor those defending it, while Russian forces would need to eliminate Ukraine’s air defenses and then link up with troops arriving from the east of the country.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta Henrik Pettersson Eliza Mackintosh", "Rob Picheta", "Henrik Pettersson", "Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/rimpac-navy-exercises-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "RIMPAC, world's largest naval exercises, to include all 4 Quad ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nThe 2022 edition of the world’s largest naval war games, the Rim of the Pacific exercises, will feature key US partners from around the globe, including India, Japan and Australia – who have joined Washington in the Quad group – and five nations bordering on the South China Sea, one of the world’s most turbulent areas for military tensions.\n\nIn total, the exercises, based in Honolulu and San Diego, will see military units from 26 countries participating from June 29 to August 4.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nWhen the United States, Japan, Australia and India first resuscitated their informal dialogue from a decade-long hiatus in late 2017, China was confident it would soon fail.\n\n“It seems there is never a shortage of headline-grabbing ideas,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said dismissively of the grouping in early 2018, months after it convened its first working-level meeting in Manila.\n\n“They are like the sea foam in the Pacific or Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate,” Wang concluded.\n\nMore than four years on, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue – better known as “the Quad” – is far from dissipating. Instead, it has only grown in momentum, profile and clout.\n\nConvened around the mantra of promoting a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” the four countries have held two naval exercises since 2020. Their leaders have assembled three times since last year – including an in-person summit at the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, the four leaders will meet face to face again in Tokyo. Their summit will be a highlight of Joe Biden’s first trip to Asia as the US President, as he seeks to strengthen alliances and partnerships to counter China’s growing influence in the region.\n\nThe renewed activity has seen China’s initial scorn turn into alarm, with Beijing viewing the grouping as part of Washington’s attempt to encircle the country with strategic and military allies. Wang, the foreign minister, has decried the grouping as an “Indo-Pacific NATO,” accusing it of “trumpeting the Cold War mentality” and “stoking geopolitical rivalry.”\n\nLeaders from the Quad nations shown during their first in-person summit at the White House in September 2021. Sarahbeth Maney/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThat concern has only grown since the Ukraine crisis. Beijing’s backing of Moscow has further damaged its global image, leaving it more isolated on the world stage. And that is not helped by China’s insistence on a zero-Covid policy, in which stringent border restrictions are cutting the country off from a world that has largely moved on from the pandemic.\n\nWhile Biden travels the world to reinforce ties, his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping hasn’t left China in 25 months. Biden’s latest flurry of diplomacy, with stops in South Korea and Japan, has particularly irked Beijing.\n\n“The Indo-Pacific strategy cooked up by the United States, in the name of ‘freedom and openness,’ is actually keen on forming cliques,” Wang said Sunday as Biden wrapped up his trip to Seoul and headed to Tokyo.\n\n“It claims that it intends to ‘change China’s surrounding environment,’ but its purpose is to contain China and make Asia-Pacific countries serve as ‘pawns’ of US hegemony,” Wang added.\n\nBut experts stress that the Quad is not an Asian NATO and neither does it aspire to become one. Instead, they say its flexibility as an informal forum allows it to build more partnerships and expand areas for cooperation – including on the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework that Biden is expected to launch in Tokyo.\n\n“The Quad is trying to emphasize that it has a positive agenda, which is much more about delivering what the Indo-Pacific region needs – versus becoming an anti-China, NATO-like entity, which is a reputation that it’s been trying very hard to combat in the region,” said Kristi Govella, deputy director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund.\n\nThe driving force behind the Quad\n\nChina’s initial dismissal of the Quad was partly based on precedent.\n\nA previous iteration of the Quad – proposed in 2007 by Japan’s then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe – lasted barely a year due to a divergence of interests and pressure from Beijing. It crumbled in January 2008, when Australia announced its withdrawal from the grouping to pursue closer trade ties with China.\n\nBut the geopolitical and strategic calculus in the region has shifted drastically over the past decade. Under Xi, China has abandoned former leader Deng Xiaoping’s decades-old mantra of “hide your strength, bide your time.” Instead, it has pursued a more assertive foreign policy, readily flexing its economic muscle and military might.\n\nA year after Xi took office, China started building – and increasingly militarizing – artificial islands throughout the contested waters of the South China Sea. It has increased its military posturing toward Japan, sending Chinese coastguard vessels into waters around the contested Senkaku Islands (known as the Diaoyu Islands in China) and flying warplanes into the airspace above.\n\nA Chinese air strip is clearly visible beside structures and buildings on the contested Mischief Reef in the Spratly group of islands in the South China Sea, March 20, 2022. Aaron Favila/AP\n\nEarly in the pandemic, China imposed a flurry of trade sanctions on Australia after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19. And along its disputed Himalayan border with India, Chinese and Indian soldiers clashed in their deadliest conflict in four decades.\n\nThe tensions have driven these countries closer into the orbit of Washington, which under Biden has made the strategic rivalry with China a centerpiece of its foreign policy.\n\n“The biggest driver of the Quad’s revival is the growing assertiveness and aggressiveness of China,” said Yuki Tatsumi, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center.\n\n“Its behavior not only in the East and South China Seas but also in the Indian Ocean all the way down around the Pacific island area resulted in bringing Quad countries’ perception of China closer together.”\n\nAs Beijing grows more distant from the West and its allies, it has moved ever closer to Moscow – but their “no limits” partnership has become more of a liability for China as Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine draws global outrage.\n\n“Beijing’s backing of Moscow reconfirmed the image of China as the disrupter of the existing international order that the countries in this region all have benefited – and continue to benefit – from,” Tatsumi said.\n\nWhile the Quad has never explicitly mentioned China in public, it is hard to miss the thinly veiled references. Last September, when the four leaders met in person in Washington, they committed to “promoting the free, open, rules-based order, rooted in international law and undaunted by coercion” – a clear rebuke to China’s increasingly aggressive behavior in the region.\n\nIn response, Chinese diplomats have repeatedly lashed out at the Quad for “disrupting regional peace and stability.”\n\nBuilding “closed and exclusive small circles or groups is as dangerous as the NATO strategy of eastward expansion in Europe,” Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in March.\n\n“If allowed to go on unchecked, it would bring unimaginable consequences, and ultimately push the Asia-Pacific over the edge of an abyss,” he said.\n\nNot ‘Asia’s NATO’\n\nNATO’s swift and coordinated response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has likely alarmed Beijing, say experts, who suggest its leaders are watching Western reaction to Ukraine with Taiwan in mind.\n\nChina views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve unification. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at the highest they’ve been in recent decades, with the Chinese military sending record numbers of war planes near the island – a show of force that is not lost on other countries in the region.\n\nWhen the Quad leaders convened in March to talk about the Ukraine crisis, they agreed that “unilateral changes to the status quo with force like this should not be allowed in the Indo-Pacific region.”\n\nJapanese, Indian and Australian ships sail in formation during Malabar exercises in August 2021. Justin Stack/DVIDS U.S. Navy/AP\n\nBut Jean-Pierre Cabestan, an expert on Chinese politics at Hong Kong Baptist University, stressed that the Quad is not a formal alliance like NATO.\n\n“It can’t be Asia’s NATO. What structures the region’s security is a set of bilateral alliances concluded by the US after World War II – with Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines. So there’s not such a thing as NATO in east Asia,” he said.\n\nAnd unlike Japan and Australia, India is not a US ally – following a foreign policy tradition of non-alignment the country has adopted since independence.\n\nThere are structural differences too. Experts say in recent years the Quad has pivoted away from an overt focus on security issues to include more areas of cooperation, in an attempt to better address regional needs.\n\nAt their first virtual summit in March last year, the Quad leaders pledged to supply a billion Covid-19 vaccines across Asia by the end of 2022. The Quad has also formed working groups on climate change, technological innovation and supply-chain resilience.\n\nDuring his trip to Tokyo, Biden is expected to unveil the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework – a long-sought plan to step up US economic engagement with the region. Experts say the framework could provide momentum for closer economic cooperation among the Quad countries – such as in infrastructure and supply-chain resilience.\n\nIn the eyes of Beijing, these efforts will likely be seen as a direct challenge. On Sunday, Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, said while China is always happy to see proposals conducive to regional cooperation, it is opposed to attempts to create division and conflict.\n\n“Anyone attempting to isolate China with some framework will only isolate themselves. Rules made up to exclude China are bound to be abandoned by developments of our time,” he said.\n\nBut the Quad will need to demonstrate that it can deliver on its promises. Previous US attempts to boost economic ties with the region, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, have floundered, and the US will need to persuade potential allies and partners that it will stay committed to the region beyond Biden’s term.\n\nSusannah Patton, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, said the Quad had already exceeded many analysts’ expectations. “The Quad is a vehicle for (its members) to present a different vision of how the region should work, and to signal to Beijing that it won’t have things its own way all the time,” she said.\n\n“As for the future, how it evolves will in large part depend on China’s behavior. If China continues to undermine regional norms and coerce other countries, the Quad will respond.”", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/06/europe/russia-military-images-intl/index.html", "title": "New satellite images show advanced Russian military deployments ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nNew satellite images released by a US-based technology company appear to show that Russia’s military has advanced deployments at several locations in Belarus, a move likely to concern Ukraine and NATO amid fears that the Kremlin is planning an incursion into Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe deployments are likely linked to joint exercises between Russian and Belarus forces that are due to begin on Thursday.

To get it in your inbox, sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nRussia’s attacks on Ukraine’s power grid are targeting the entire population, casting people into darkness and cold, and pushing the US closer to sending the Patriot missile defense system long sought by Ukraine’s government.\n\nBut news, first reported by CNN, that the US is finalizing plans to send the system to Ukraine triggered a cryptic warning from Russia’s US embassy Wednesday of “unpredictable consequences.”\n\nSending the Patriot missiles would be seen as an escalation by the US, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova added Thursday.\n\n“Earlier, many experts, including those overseas, questioned the rationality of such a step which would lead to an escalation of the conflict and increase the risk of directly dragging the US army into combat,” Zakharova said at a briefing in Moscow.\n\nThe Patriot system is expensive and complicated and requires intensive training for the multiple people it takes to operate it, but could help the country guard against Russian attacks that have left millions without power.\n\nRELATED: Ukraine keeps patching up its power grid. But Russia’s barrage could force more Ukrainians to flee as winter bites\n\nAsked Thursday about Russian warnings that the Patriot system would be “provocative,” Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said those comments would not influence US aid to Ukraine.\n\n“I find it ironic and very telling that officials from a country that brutally attacked its neighbor in an illegal and unprovoked invasion … that they would choose to use words like provocative to describe defensive systems that are meant to save lives and protect civilians,” Ryder told reporters.\n\n“Despite Russia’s propaganda to portray themselves as victims, it’s important to remember that Russia is the aggressor here,” he said.\n\nHowever, he added, “The US is not at war with Russia, and we do not seek conflict. Our focus is on providing Ukraine with the security assistance it needs to defend itself.”\n\nRyder also said the US would amp up its training of Ukrainian armed forces with exercises in Europe.\n\nRussia’s growing nuclear rhetoric\n\nFrustrated on the battlefield and short of ammunition, Russian officials have seemed to embrace nuclear rhetoric in recent weeks.\n\nIn what may be a no less subtle message than calling the Patriot deployments provocative, Russia’s defense ministry shared video of the installation of a “Yars” intercontinental ballistic missile into a silo launcher in the Kaluga region for what Alexei Sokolov, commander of the Kozelsky missile formation, called “combat duty as planned.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin recently said the threat of nuclear war was growing and suggested his country could abandon its “no first use” nuclear weapons doctrine, under which Russia has said it would only use nuclear weapons to defend its homeland. Putin’s comments came after drone strikes hit military infrastructure deep inside Russia. Russia’s military blamed Ukraine for the strikes.\n\nAppearing this week on Russian state TV, Commander Alexander Khodakovsky of the Russian militia in the Donetsk region suggested Russia could not defeat the NATO alliance in a conventional war.\n\n“But we have nuclear weapons for that,” Khodakovsky said, according to CNN’s translation.\n\nWhat to know about the Patriot defense system\n\nThe Patriot system is a conventional long-range defense system the US has provided to multiple allies around the world.\n\nIt requires a relatively large number of personnel to be trained, according to CNN’s Barbara Starr and Oren Liebermann, who were first to report the US is close to sending the system to Ukraine.\n\nFrom Starr and Liebermann’s report:\n\nUnlike smaller air defense systems, Patriot missile batteries need much larger crews, requiring dozens of personnel to properly operate them. The training for Patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months, a process the United States will now carry out under the pressure of near-daily aerial attacks from Russia.\n\nThe system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles as well as some aircraft. Because of its long-range and high-altitude capability, it can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine.\n\nHalf of Ukraine’s power infrastructure destroyed\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has long sought more long-range missile systems from Washington and NATO allies. In a conversation with US President Joe Biden last Sunday, Zelensky thanked the US for its continued support and asked for more air defense help. He told Biden that “Russian missile terror” has destroyed about half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.\n\nIn an interview with The Economist published Thursday, Zelensky also rejected the idea recently suggested by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Ukraine seek to reclaim only land seized by Russia since February 2022 and not areas like Donbas and Crimea, which have been under Russian control since 2014.\n\n“This would not be a finale,” Zelensky said.\n\nAiding Ukraine without getting directly involved\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the French news outlet France 24 this week, before the Patriot missile development, that the alliance still has two main objectives: provide aid to Ukraine and also make sure that NATO forces don’t become directly involved and escalate the war.\n\n“We don’t have NATO troops on the ground. We don’t have NATO planes in the air over Ukraine. But we are supporting Ukraine in their right to defend themselves,” he said.\n\nHe said that despite Russia’s threats about nuclear weapons, there has been no detected change in Russia’s nuclear posture, but Putin’s rhetoric “is by itself reckless and dangerous.”\n\nSome other notable Russia and Ukraine storylines\n\nOld ammo. CNN’s Ellie Kaufman and Liebermann reported earlier this week on a US military official who says Russian forces have had to resort to 40-year-old artillery ammunition as their supplies of new ammo are “rapidly dwindling.”\n\n“You load the ammunition and you cross your fingers and hope it’s gonna fire or when it lands that it’s gonna explode,” said the official, speaking to reporters.\n\nThe effect of months of military aid. It’s a completely different scale, but CNN reported last month the US is running low on some weapons systems and munitions it provides to Ukraine. Look for that storyline to become part of the US aid debate after Republicans take control of the House of Representatives next month and promise more scrutiny of US aid for Ukraine.\n\nIn the trenches. CNN’s Will Ripley filed a video report from trenches and fortifications being built along Ukraine’s border with Belarus, where there is growing concern about Russia once again assembling troops.

The report said the military preparedness of major NATO members is so deficient that some would have difficulty fielding troops in an emergency.\n\nThe United Kingdom’s military has been “hollowed out to such an extent that the deployment of a brigade, let alone a division, at credible readiness would be a major challenge,” the report said.\n\nRussian prime minister says there's a new Cold War\n\nRinkevics said NATO needs to meet the security challenge posed by Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in April 2014.\n\nAt that time, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a new doctrine, “the Russian world,” which called for action anywhere on the planet where the interests of Russia or Russian-speaking people are in danger.\n\nSince then, Russia has seen NATO as a strategic adversary. In response, it launched a military buildup in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave in the mouth of the Baltic Sea that’s home to Russia’s Baltic fleet. Kaliningrad now houses Russia’s most advanced anti-aircraft missiles and ballistic missiles capable of reaching European capitals.\n\nRussia also has increased mobilizations near NATO’s borders, Rinkevics said. These include a helicopter base a few miles from Latvia's border and offensive drills on breaking NATO defenses and occupying Baltic countries, he said.\n\nUkraine unrest fits pattern of Russian invasion drills\n\nThese exercises typically culminate with the simulated use of nuclear weapons, according to a briefing provided to USA TODAY by the Potomac Foundation think tank.\n\nRinkevics said a lot of Russian exercises look like simulated nuclear attacks. Russian commanders evidently see nuclear weapons “not as theoretical but tactical, to prevent NATO countries from responding to fulfill their obligations under Article 5” of the NATO’s founding treaty, which calls for a mutual defense of all members, he said.\n\n“A clear message and response to that can only be that we take those issues seriously and deploy everything necessary for NATO defense,” he said.\n\nRussia's military steps have been accompanied by an onslaught of Russian propaganda aimed at creating doubts in Europe about the leadership of the European Union and its policies.\n\nRinkevics said Latvia sees membership in both NATO and the EU as key to its independence and security, but he said the migrant crisis, the rise of right-wing political movements in Europe, and a referendum by Britain in June on whether to leave the economic alliance has left him “worried about the state of the union.”\n\nLatvia is not waiting for NATO to harden its defenses, Rinkevics said. It has pledged to boost defense spending through 2018 and to increase the number of border guards, and it is considering building a fence along the border.\n\n“We need to work with all NATO allies to make sure the NATO summit (this summer in Warsaw) is used to strengthen all the defenses of NATO,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/27"}]}

Rescuers brought in a crane to stabilize the wreckage so they could safely continue the operation.\n\nPresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador expressed condolences and solidarity to the families of the victims and to residents of Tláhuac, the borough where the accident took place. He promised a thorough probe of the tragedy.\n\n“A hug to all the people of Tláhuac, to all those who are suffering from this accident,\" he said. \"There will be constant information and there is no impunity for anyone.\"\n\nStunning video from the scene shows the overpass collapsing on a heavily trafficked road, multiple vehicles apparently crushed under the enormous heap of debris amid a cloud of dust and smoke.\n\nMayor Claudia Sheinbaum said 21 died at the scene, while the others died at hospitals. Children were among the fatalities, Sheinbaum said. More than 70 people were also injured.\n\nSheinbaum said a structural review of the entire line and an in-depth investigation of the cause of the tragedy would begin immediately. The overpass was about 16 feet above the road in Tláhuac, a fast-growing borough on the city's southeast edge.\n\nMore:Daytime scenes at site of Mexico metro disaster\n\nHundreds of friends and family of the dead and the missing descended on the area as police cordoned off several blocks to allow for the complex rescue operation.\n\nJosé Luis Hernández Martínez, 61, crossed Mexico City every day on subway Line 12 between his home on the city’s south side and the body shop where he worked repairing mangled cars. The 61-year-old’s train had emerged from beneath the city and was jostling along the elevated portion far from downtown late Monday when two of its bright orange cars suddenly fell into a void.\n\nHernández Martínez was killed instantly, his son Luis Adrian Hernández Juarez said, one of 24 people who died in one of the world’s largest subway system’s worst accidents. More than 70 others were injured.\n\n“My father was recovered without vital signs, with trauma to his thorax, his brain, his feet, his knees,” Hernández Juarez said, gripping the death certificate. He said emergency personnel told him his father was crushed beneath other passengers. “It’s really terrible to see your father that way for the last time.”\n\nHernández Juarez planned to bury his father Wednesday as a string of funerals began across the city of more than 9 million people.\n\n“No one is going to give me my father back, even if they give me 10 million pesos,” Hernández Juarez said, while expressing concern that his mother had been left without a source of income.\n\nGisela Rioja Castro, 43, had been looking for her husband, 42-year-old Miguel Ángel Espinoza. She said that her husband always took that train after finishing work at a store, but he never returned home and had stopped answering his phone.\n\nRioja finally found him Tuesday at a morgue in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa. She described him as a hard worker, responsible and happy. She and their two children depended on him.\n\n“I want justice for my husband because a simple apology is not going to bring him back to us,” she said. “He was my love; he was everything to me. It hurts so much, so much, so much because of the way it ended.”\n\nLuisa Martínez sat outside city government offices in Iztapalapa on Tuesday afternoon awaiting the release of the body of her niece’s husband, Carlos Pineda, a 38-year-old dentist. Pineda leaves behind his wife and their two children ages 7 and 13.\n\n“He was the one who supported the family. Now they are left without income,” Martínez said. “They have to compensate us now. I don’t want it in a year or two years like all bureaucratic procedures.”\n\nThe city's commuter subway train system – Sistema de Transporte Colectivo– consists of 12 lines and almost 200 stations providing about 1.4 billion rides annually.

It runs underground through more central areas of the city and on elevated concrete structures on the city’s outskirts.\n\nMexican Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard was mayor from 2006 to 2012, when Line 12 was built. Allegations of poor design, construction, mismanagement and corruption emerged soon after Ebrard left office as mayor. The line had to be partly closed in 2013 so tracks could be repaired. A magnitude 7.1 earthquake that struck the area in 2017 rekindled concerns about track safety.\n\nEbrard called the accident a \"terrible tragedy.”\n\n\"My solidarity with the victims and their families,\" he tweeted. \"Causes must be investigated and responsibilities defined.

Hotels and restaurants cut back on staff in preparation for the inevitable drop in customers. Some even struggle during the winter months as their guests have been reduced drastically.\n\nThat won’t be the case this year, though.\n\nMore:Cedar City welcomes new Pioneer-style LDS Temple\n\nThe opening of the new Cedar City Latter-day Saints Temple will draw thousands of people to Festival City during the historically slow time of year. More than 150,000 people have already reserved tickets to tour the long-awaited temple during the three-week open house period that runs through Nov. 18. The 39,802-square-foot structure will serve more than 45,000 Mormons in 17 stakes in southern Utah and eastern Nevada.\n\nBoth temple and city officials have no way of knowing what fraction of that number are coming from out of town. That’s why business owners, law enforcement and officials are preparing for practically anything.\n\nRex Mcarthur, manager of the La Quinta and Clarion Inn & Suites in Cedar City, said both hotels saw a spike in reservations as soon as the open house dates were announced earlier this year. The weekend dates in both October and November are seeing an 18 percent increase in reservations in comparison to the same time last year.\n\n“150,000 visitors coming for the LDS temple alone when we’re only used to seeing approximately 350,000 come to this market in general is big,” Mcarthur said. “Almost one-third of what we’re used to seeing in an entire year will be coming during these last few months of this fiscal year.”\n\nThis is huge for both Mcarthur and his employees during the typically slower season. During a normal year, approximately 50 families would be laid off between the two hotels after USF shuts down. That won’t have to happen this year.\n\nWith this in mind, Jim Fontano – who owns the popular lunchtime spot the Brick House Café and is the founder of the fine dining option, Depot Grill – is preparing the staffs at both restaurants for anything. Like most other businesses, Fonato has opted not to scale down his staff for the winter season due to the temple opening. Brick House has already seen a major jump in patrons. Depot hasn’t had the same increase just yet, but the phone has been busy with future diners look to make reservations, Fontano said.\n\nThe fridge is packed full of food and both servers and cooks are being placed on-call just in case things become busier than anticipated.\n\n“We really don’t know what we’re going to get,” Fontano said.\n\nThe biggest concern for Cedar City Police is the influx of traffic to the formerly quiet residential neighborhood on Leigh Hill. Officers will be working overtime to provide traffic control as visitors make their way to the temple for their tour. The LDS Church will mitigate some of the traffic by having attendees park at a church on Cross Hollow Road before shuttling them directly to the temple.\n\n“It makes it tougher for everyone,” CCPD Sgt. Jerry Womack said. “There’s only one way in and one way out, so that does give us some unique challenges.”\n\nRepresentatives of the LDS Church met with city officials multiple times to keep them informed about each stage of construction, which allowed the Cedar City – Brian Head Tourism Bureau to start preparing early. Banners welcoming visitors and promoting local attractions have been installed along 200 North from Main Street to Cove Drive. A temporary visitor century will be opened near Exit 57 to provide travelers with information about the city, direct them to a good spot for a hike or point them to significant LDS heritage sites nearby, tourism bureau executive director Maria Twitchell said in an email.\n\nMore:Angel Moroni statue placed on Cedar City LDS Temple\n\nBusinesses along 200 North, historic downtown and the Providence Center have also been equipped with city maps and town guides.\n\n“This is an extraordinary event,” Twitchell said. “This isn't about religion, it’s about welcoming 123,000 plus visitors to our community.”\n\nThe increase of people in town will also lead to traffic congestion throughout the city.\n\n“There’s no way around the fact that that many individuals coming into town in that short period of time will impact our community,” Cedar City Mayor Maile Wilson said. “What we hope is both the visitors and our residents are patient and willing to just be kind and courteous.”\n\nMore:LDS Church announces first Cedar City Temple president\n\nIt’s impossible to predict how large of interest there will be in a temple opening until the open house tickets are released. To help prepare, the city looked to other cities that had recently hosted open houses, such as Payson and Provo. While there have been no specific threats, Womack said there are concerns about protesters.\n\n“We are expecting protestors, but the other areas didn’t get them in droves and they said they were respectful,” he said. “They can say their piece and we’re going to allow them to do that.”\n\nThe Iron County School District has considered re-routing school bus routes in the neighborhood due to concerns about protestors and traffic.\n\nBut not all the planning and preparations have been successful.\n\nIn March, Cedar City Councilman Fred Rowley launched a campaign urging community members, business owners and government officials to make Cedar City “sparkle” ahead of the temple opening. His letter called upon the city to re-paint street signs and clean up city-owned properties. He made a similar request to homeowners, urging them to clean their yards of debris and remove weeds from vacant properties.\n\nBut his pleas just weren’t heard by the community. While a handful of groups organized their own clean-ups of high traffic areas, Rowley didn’t see the grassroots efforts he had hoped would occur. The city also organized multiple volunteer events as part of the campaign, including a maintenance day focusing on improving historic downtown Main Street.\n\nThe councilman, who will be stepping down at the end of this year, was disappointed in the fact that only a small percentage of residents participated.\n\n“It (the temple opening) is something that has never happened before and I don’t think it will ever happen again,” he said. “It’s such a beautiful building and I hope the care that has been taken to construct it will inspire folks to make their own place look a little nicer too.”\n\nTickets to tour the temple are still available at templeopenhouse.lds.org. The open house will run through Nov. 18, with the dedication scheduled for Dec. 10.\n\nFollow reporter Bree Burkitt, @BreeBurkitt.

Organizers have also begun rationing ice sales.\n\nMany attendees appeared to remain in good spirits, playing beer pong in the muddy streets or splashing in the standing water. Techno continued echoing around the encampment, and spontaneous dance parties kept breaking out. Walking was almost impossible Saturday morning, but started to improve as the ground began to dry. Then it began raining again.\n\nGiven the conditions, which include forecast rain Sunday, it appears unlikely anyone will be permitted to drive out soon. Burning Man officials have not provided a comprehensive update on conditions, departure timing or even the multiple art burns scheduled for Saturday and Sunday. Longtime attendees said they can't remember a burn with this much rain.\n\nEarlier, organizers banned vehicle traffic from the roads Friday afternoon and kept the exit gates closed as Saturday morning. Even walking was treacherous as thick, slimy mud clung to shoes and anything else it touched.\n\nOrganizers on Friday and Saturday warned attendees to conserve their food and water, indicating the closures could be lengthy. The Burning Man radio station known as BMIR and a social media account have been providing updates to attendees.\n\nCell phone service is virtually nonexistent at the event, and only a few people have access to satellite Internet for updates. Burning Man attendees are expected to be completely self-sufficient for the duration of their stay, bringing in all the food, water and shelter they need.\n\nDawn brought a growing realization for attendees that they might not be going home as planned, given rain forecast for later Saturday into Sunday. And while Saturday morning is usually full of anticipation for the Man effigy burn, this Saturday arrived quietly.\n\nOnly a few people braved the muddy roads, trying to find their way back to their camps after a night of partying elsewhere.\n\nAfter using the portable toilets, Angelov Franco of Colombia hiked up the garbage bags on his feet and duck-walked across the muddy street toward his camp. This is his 13th burn, he said, and he's never seen anything like the mud. Still, he wasn't going to complain.\n\n\"This is going to be fun,\" he said. \"Hopefully the sun will come out after the rain.\"\n\nThe poor weather came just as attendance and activities were beginning to peak, and forced the cancellation of multiple large scale art burns Friday night.\n\n“No driving is permitted on playa except for emergency vehicles,” event organizers said in a 5 a.m. statement. “If you are in (Black Rock City), please shelter in place and stay safe.\"\n\nThey added separately: “If you are in BRC, conserve food and water, shelter in a warm space.”\n\nMORE COVERAGE:Burning Man is filled with wild art, sights and nudity. Some people bring their kids.\n\nOn Saturday night attendees are supposed to watch the Man effigy that looms over the encampment burn and explode with fireworks, followed Sunday by the burning of the Temple of the Heart.\n\nThe event officially ends Monday in a mass departure known as Exodus.\n\nBefore the event officially started Aug. 27, organizers closed the gates to early arrivals for several days after the remnants of Hurricane Hillary swamped the area.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2022/08/25/your-guide-to-150th-colorado-state-fair-in-pueblo/65420073007/", "title": "Here's your guide to the 150th Colorado State Fair in Pueblo", "text": "The annual Colorado State Fair will bring countless activities, performances, carnival rides and vendors to the state fairgrounds in Pueblo starting Friday, along with hundreds of thousands of visitors from across the state and beyond.\n\n“The fair only comes around once a year, and this time we’re really amping up the fun and attractions,\"said Colorado State Fair General Manager Scott Stoller, in a news release.\n\n“We cannot wait to see you all there!

Over a week later, the service is still going strong, with folks traveling from as far as Singapore to join.\n\nVideos of students participating in the nonstop prayer and worship service have made their way to social media, sparking international attention. As of Feb. 16, posts with the #AsburyRevival hashtag have generated 34.5 million views on TikTok.\n\nThe latestKentucky college revival is ending its two-week service\n\nNBC reports that students and faculty from 22 schools in Hawaii, Massachusetts, Illinois, Minnesota, Tennessee, Indiana and other states have made the trek to Asbury to join in on the religious experience. Travelers from Singapore and Canada are also expected to arrive soon.\n\nThe service experienced its largest crowd yet Feb. 14, with over 3,000 attendees, two-thirds of which were from out of state, NBC reports. The crowd was so large the revival had to expand to four additional facilities in the college town.\n\nOther schools have even started their own revivals and religious services, inspired by the events happening in Wilmore. Lee University in Tennessee, Anderson University in Indiana and Ohio Christian University near Columbus are among the schools to have joined the movement.\n\nYou may want to read:Ohio train wreck chemical spill nearing Kentucky border.

There isn't an official denominational emphasis, but \"the institution maintains its commitment to an evangelical Wesleyan-Arminian perspective,\" according to the university's website.\n\nWhat is a revival?\n\nIn Christianity, a revival has historically been a movement to reawaken the spiritual passion of a group, church or community. Attracting or converting new members to the religious group is also one of the main goals.\n\nAlthough revivals have evolved over the years, the roots of the spiritual gathering can be traced to Anabaptism, Puritanism, Pietism and Methodism from the 16th-18th centuries.\n\nSkeptics often view revivals as \"manifestations of superstition, hysteria and social contagion,\" per the Lexington Herald Leader. Others view them as reactions to major social events. But for believers, revivals are renewals of a person's faith.\n\nIs this the first revival at Asbury University?\n\nAsbury University is no stranger to revivals.\n\nOne of the most famous revivals in campus history occurred Feb. 3, 1970. That gathering, which also began as a morning chapel service, led to 144 hours of unbroken revival, according to the university website. Like the service currently taking place nearly 100 miles south of downtown Cincinnati, the 1970 revival also attracted national and international attention.\n\nThe 1970 and 2023 gatherings aren't the only spiritual revivals in Asbury's history.

Despite the late-night air continuing to cool after evening rainfall, there was no shortage of heat on the stage.\n\nThe hitmaker and CMA Fest TV special host had the crowd singing along to several songs, including \"I Hold On\" and \"Drunk on a Plane.\"\n\n\"There's gonna be some people really hurting at the airport tomorrow morning,\" Bentley said as he introduced the nearly 10-year old hit. Fans still knew every word.\n\nThe applause didn't run out of steam for Bentley's triumphant exit. The band lined up, arms around each other to stand for a moment, basking it in.\n\nAshley McBryde's star-making surge continues\n\nAshley McBryde's excellent 30-minute set was kicked off with her calmly stating \"Hi, I'm Ashley, these are my guys, and we're gonna sing some songs we made up.\"\n\nSuch overwhelming humility was okay five years ago when her stardom was emerging after her breakout hit \"Girl Goin' Nowhere.\" However, her critically-acclaimed 2022 album \"Ashley McBryde presents: Lindeville\" will be followed by her September 8 release \"The Devil I Know.\"\n\n\"I used to play in bars when I was 19,\" McBryde said introducing her forthcoming album's title track.\n\n\"Thanks, it's working out.

CMA Fest had not yet announced when gates would open as of 5 p.m.\n\nAny fans outside near the stadium or downtown were asked to take shelter. \"We expect strong winds & lightning for a least the next hour and a half with this next round of thunderstorms,\" read a statement from CMA's twitter account.\n\nFans find music while sheltering from weather threat\n\nShortly after the announcement that outdoor stages would not reopen for the evening, fans packed into Ole Red’s Spotify House to see Kimberly Perry, the CMA Fest’s 50th Anniversary Surprise Performance.Perry, formerly of the Band Perry, rocked the stage, singing a number of songs, including her hit song “If I Die Young,” played with a newer, darker beat that sent fans wild.\n\nPlenty of festival goers were still milling about on Lower Broadway as lightning strikes split the clouds and thunder roared overhead.

They were asked to find an open business or to go to the center as lightning threatened the area.\n\nMore:Strong to severe storms expected Sunday; CMA Fest stages closed due to lightning\n\nDavid Morris brings a different sound to the Reverb Stage\n\nThe camo pants, Garth brooks t-shirt wearing country rapper David Morris got the reverb Stage crowd in a frenzy with his \"Small town queen.\"\n\nMorris brought a different sound, fusing his classic country sounds with a modern pop twist. Morris played to the crowd of more than 100, asking where everyone was from.

The fans really saved me. You gave me purpose…you’re my family. You really are. You’re not just ‘fans.’”\n\nThe two discussed mentoring rising young women in the entertainment scene, remarking on the love they have for them.\n\n“Never let them tell you who you are,” Judd recounted telling a number of them. “I just felt love like a grandmother for them.”\n\nThough, Yearwood added, “We can’t let anyone tell us that we have less to offer just because we aren’t in our twenties,” she said, laughing. “I’ll give you a hot flash right now.”\n\nJudd also mentioned--to riotous response--that she's working on a new album that's \"a little bit sassy, a little bit sweet,\" that'll likely involve Yearwood. She remarked that she's \"at a place in my life\" where she doesn't want to \"just be ‘country.’\n\n\"I want to be country and everything,\" she said, referencing country artists who have grown and evolved through many genres, like Taylor Swift. \"I’m looking into what it feels like to be free. I believe you can do it all.”\n\nIn the final moments of the show, the two went on to harmonize for the crowd, leaving no doubt in the already-bewitched crowd who the queens of country are.\n\nTanner Adell: A mix between Shania and Beyonce?\n\nSwitching from a guitar to a bango, Tanner Adell tells the crowd not to be afraid to let the music move them.\"Our music is meant to move,\" she said\n\nFans proclaimed the artist as Shaniyonce, a blend of Shania Twain and Beyonce.The pop country artist has gendered more than 6.3 million streams from viral hit \"Love you a little bit.\"\n\nBlessing Offor takes the crowd to church\n\nIt was fitting Blessing Offor played the Vibes Stage on Sunday morning, because he took a crowd in Nashville to church.\n\nThe Nigerian-born singer moved to Connecticut when he was 10. The blind singer tickled the ivories on his keyboard, belting out a Sunday-appropriate song called \"Tin Roof.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I pray heaven is like Rain on a tin roof.\"\n\nPhones were in the air, the crowd swaying with the soulful music from Offor, making it the perfect sermon to open Sunday at CMA Fest.\n\nChristian Paul performs first CMA show day after wedding\n\nFor Tai Wossilek, Sunday was a vibe.\n\nWossilek paid extra attention to Christian Paul, a Jacksonville, Florida, native and Christian country artist who played the first show at the Vibes Stage.\n\nPaul addressed the crowd and shouted at Wosilek. The two married Saturday.\n\nBut have no fear, Paul will not be in the doghouse for playing a show a day after the two's nuptials.\n\n\"I actually encouraged him to play today, and it was amazing,\" Wossilek said.\n\nChase Matthew wakes up the Sunday crowd at Riverfront Stage\n\nFans gathered early and spread out on the lawn in the last of the mornings shade.One by one members of Chase Matthew's band trickled out onto stage under the back drop of heavy bass drums when he burst out into stage dancing and swinging his mic stand around and asking the fans to cheer along and participate in his songs.“Take your hats off if you love America,” he said as he burst into his songs “I love you always” followed up by “She’s Country.\"\n\nMust-see sets on CMA Fest Day 4\n\n10 a.m. - 11 a.m.\n\nRiverfront Stage: Nashville area native Chase Matthew is a high school dropout who has polished more custom classic car hoods and repaired more pickup truck engines than he's written country songs. However, he's also the descendant of four generations of preachers. \"What would a church service be like if the preacher got worked up and said damn a little more? Like a preacher, my job is to make sure that you leave my concert better than when you arrived,\" Matthew told The Tennessean. He has a new album coming, entitled \"Come Get Your Memory.\" \"County Line\" was his streaming-favored breakout and still deserves a listen.\n\n11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nReverb Stage: Tanner Adell is an adopted ex-Mormon transplanted from Kentucky to Manhattan Beach, California. That alone would make for a tremendous countrified fish out of water story. Add in her Tik-Tok acclaim and Adell arrives at CMA Fest as — if you're a digital-first fanatic of the genre — one of the weekend's most must-see artists. Her single \"FU-150?\" It sounds exactly like you'd expect — one listen, and it'll get stuck in your head all day long.\n\n1 p.m. - 2:30 p.m.\n\nReverb Stage: Enter any Music Row watering hole, mention the name of Big Loud-signed singer-songwriter Lauren Watkins and watch people's eyes alight with excitement. Her song \"Camel Blues\" revives cigarette smoking in the genre's female hard-luck heartbreak narratives. At the same time, \"Shirley Temple\" is a warning against believing the artist to be \"sweet and simple.\" More than anything, Watkins' set could be the weekend's most \"remember them when\" moments of the festival overall.\n\n2:30 p.m. - 5 p.m.\n\nRiverfront Stage: Ingrid Andress follows in a line of pop-ready female singer-songwriters who have experienced sustainable success in country music. \"Wishful Drinking,\" \"Lady Like\" and \"More Hearts Than Mine\" are unmistakably country because of the stories they tell. Though she lacks Southern vocal intonations, Andress' music — for the more progressive-minded listener in your CMA Fest party crew, will be greatly enjoyed as a slight breeze blows in off the Cumberland River during a heated afternoon\n\nFor more must see acts click here.\n\nWeather forecast for Sunday at CMA Fest\n\nThe severe weather outlook has once again increased.

Then, she and Kimberly Schlapman started into 2010's \"Little White Church.\" On Saturday evening, their seasoned and more impassioned than usual stylings allowed the lyrics \"no more calling me baby / no more loving like crazy\" to hit with an elevated level of emotional impact.\n\nAs well, songs like \"Better Man\" and \"Girl Crush\" resonated more profoundly than usual. There's a talent that only the most vaunted artists have wherein they're able to tap into the spirit of the audience and invoke that vibe into their offering.\n\nAnd yes, their cheeky favorites like \"Boondocks,\" \"Pontoon\" and \"Wine, Beer, Whiskey\" were all present, too. In 2020's \"Wine, Beer, Whiskey\" in particular, the mid-track genre changes allowing the song to have its inherent catchiness particularly connected on a breezy Saturday evening.\n\nJason Aldean delivers his familiar brand of 'blue collar' hits\n\nNissan Stadium reached its evening capacity as 23-time country chart-topper Jason Aldean took the stage for the third night of festivities at CMA Fest.\n\n\"Tattoos on This Town\" and \"Fly Over States\" were his first two selections of the evening.\n\nSongs like the latter discussing \"square cornfields and wheat farms\" fall well in line with the \"blue collar values\" he told The Tennessean were key to his latest single \"Tough Crowd,\" (from his forthcoming eleventh album) which celebrates his fanbase being comprised of tattoo-sporting, \"hard workin' nine to fivers,\" plus \"good ol' boys in cowboy hats\" and soldiers returned from foreign wars.\n\nThe night crowd gave its first huge ovation to Aldean's 2010 single \"Dirt Road Anthem.\"\n\nThough not a rap anthem by any means, the crowd rhythmically spoke and sang along with words extolling what Aldean referred to as \"country a**\" values as he performed his breakout hit.\n\nElle King: country music super star, or impromptu wedding officiant?\n\nElle King loves love and given the opportunity she wanted to celebrate it the best way she could think — marrying one couple and renewing the vows of another.\n\nPacked into the third floor of Acme Feed and Seed, King celebrated Indianapolis couple Katrina Robinson and Amy Strutton and Murfreesboro couple Carla and Jeff Loftus.\n\n\"I'm very happy for you guys. I love y'all. You give me hope,\" King said.\n\nThe ceremony, attended by hundreds of people, concluded with King singing \"Lucky\" from her new album \"Come get your wife\" which released in January.\n\nNashville pool party vibes with Dustin Lynch\n\n37-year-old eight-time country music chart-topper and Tullahoma, Tennessee native Dustin Lynch is an avid boater, surfer and wakeboarder. He's also fond of the music and influence of Kenny Chesney, plus has appeared at Luke Bryan's January-held \"Crash My Playa\" party in Quintana Roo, Mexico numerous times in the past decade.\n\nFinding him singing Jimmy Buffett's nearly half-century-old single \"Margaritaville\" on a stage overlooking the rooftop pool at downtown Nashville's Margaritaville Hotel on a Saturday afternoon during CMA Fest has a deeper significance, though.\n\nCountry music's pop-crossover potential is a hot topic in music industry--but that growth is not likely to occur on a festival stage. At CMA Fest, country music fans are typically more willing to sip a margarita, down a few shots of hard liquor, dip their toes in a pool and sing a pop classic more than anything else.\n\n\"I've done 'Pool Situation' parties for nine years at 'Crash My Playa,' then we had a successful Vegas takeover [in 2022],\" he said to The Tennessean. \"Nashville finally has the hotels and population willing to sustain [the 'Pool Situation'] concept -- I'd have probably done this a decade ago if I could [in Music City]. I think the time has arrived for this concept from an economic, cultural, social and music industry perspective.\"\n\nHis reason for ending the conversation? Little Big Town had arrived at the party and were prepared to perform their beloved, decade-old hit \"Pontoon.\"\n\n\"Mmmmm motorboatin',\" indeed.\n\nDreams realized at Willie Jones set\n\nCourtney Dabney has wanted to come to CMA Fest since was 13--and almost 20 years later, at 31, Dabney is realizing her dream at the Reverb Stage Friday afternoon.\"I had no money, I got a teaching job and saved,\" said Dabney, of Dallas, TX.\n\nDabney was among those in the crowd to see Willie Jones, a country music singer-songwriter from Louisiana, after her dad introduced her to his music.\n\nShe wasn't alone in her excitement--the fervor was palpable as audience members grooved and swayed with hands in the air, Bridgestone Arena glinting in the backdrop.\n\nJones rose to popularity after his role in season two of The X Factor, and promoted his upcoming album \"Something to Dance Too\" which debuts June 16, 2023.\n\n\"I love love, it nourishes the soul,\" he said, crooning to the crowd as he started singing the song \"Soul.\"\n\nBoot stompin' and hoof clompin': Metro Police keep the peace\n\nMetro Nashville Police Department officers deployed across the CMA Fest footprint -- on bikes, ATVs, motorcycles and horses -- to help keep the public safe throughout the weekend.\n\nJackson Dean thrills the crowd at Riverfront\n\nA sea of fans began to sway, shoulders moving, as 22-year-old \"Don't Come Lookin'\" singer Jackson Dean took the Riverfront Stage to perform a new song about dog named Carl.Boats surrounded the stage along the Cumberland River as one of country music's fastest-rising stars sang his song \"1971.\"\n\nRiverfront Stage at capacity\n\nRiverfront Stage is at capacity again, CMA Fest said.\n\nThe gates were closed shortly before 1:20 p.m. as Tenille Arts performed her set on the stage.\n\nThe gates will reopen as soon as the area clears out.\n\nFans head to food truck row for festival eats\n\nThe smell of smoked meat wafts through the air between Music City Center and the Country Music Hall of Fame, where more than a dozen food truck venders are keeping up with hungry and thirsty festivalgoers at CMA Fest, offering smoked meats and sweet treats.\n\nOfferings from Nashville’s Original Shaved Ice will keep you cool, and for a taste of the South, Music City Brisket offers a taste of smoked meats. Looking for something lighter? Try Califarmia, a farm-fresh California cuisine truck serving chips and guacamole.\n\nStaying hydrated and cooled off is important, and thanks to Franklin’s Fruit Tea, a Murfreesboro-based company, there is plenty of cool drink options. Owner Germayle Franklin said the truck will sell 250-300 gallons of drinks Saturday. The best seller? Liquid Gold, a small-batch blend of brewed black tea, oranges and lemons.\n\n“We’ve been trying to get to CMA Fest for years, this is our first time here,” Franklin said.\n\nJim Branham, a Northern Kentucky native, said between music, he and his wife needed some barbeque and a desert: peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream.\n\nLaura Veltz takes the stage for Songwriter Session\n\nLaura Veltz brought the humor to the Country Music Hall of Fame’s Songwriter Session. Grammy nominated Veltz has written songs for Maren Morris, Demi Lovato, Lady A, Kelly Clarkson and more.\n\nSinging “Rich”, Veltz asked the audience ahead of time if they were familiar with Maren Morris’ version. Despite more than a dozen people saying yes, when came time for the popular “ka-ching, ka-ching” line, no one took over the lyrics.\n\n“Come on you guys,” Veltz said pausing the song to chuckle. “Here’s a fun fact, that’s actually me saying that line on the track. So maybe I’ll set the tone and you can help me out.”\n\nThe audience got it right the second time.\n\nWhen asked by a fan why she doesn’t sing her own songs she gave a simple answer.\n\n“I don’t want to ruin how much fun this is,” Veltz said. “Being an artist is really hard work. I love to sing, and it's wonderful that I get to use that skill in the writing room.”\n\nK. Michelle aka Puddin gives first country music concert\n\nK. Michelle, aka Puddin, took festivalgoers to church thanking “Him for Jesus and my whiskey” before she launched into her single by the same name.\n\nThe Memphis born singer is transitioning from R&B to country music, with her first country music concert at Amp Stage at CMA Fest on Saturday. Before starting the next song on her set list, K. Michelle took a moment to represent her roots.\n\n“I’m a Tennessee girl, born and raised in Memphis,” she said. “The first tape I ever got was the Judd’s. They were the reason I wore my hair red and was dancing around.\"\n\nDarius Dennis came from Memphis to see K. Michelle -- and for Dennis, the concert means a little bit more: the singer is Dennis's godmother.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" Dennis said of seeing his godmother's first country show.\n\nCountry fans travel to Nashville from far and wide\n\nShawn Searle traveled 2,600 miles from Newfoundland, Canada to CMA Fest especially for the festival's 50th anniversary event. This is Searle's second time attending.\n\nSearle started his day with a first-time visit to the Amp stage on Saturday. Ready for a day filled with country music, Searle told The Tennessean that he's looking forward to the Nissan stadium show tonight to watch his favorite artist, Eric Church.\n\nMust-see sets on CMA Fest Day 3\n\n12 p.m. to 1 p.m. at Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum: Songwriter Laura Veltz is the pen behind Grammy-nominated songs “Better Than We Found It” (Maren Morris), “Speechless” (Dan + Shay), and “The Bones” (Morris).

At this ticketed event, the Hall and Museum state that \"fans get a chance to meet the minds behind some of country music's biggest hits, as they share the stories behind their work in an intimate performance setting, with audience Q&A.\n\n2:30 to 3:30 p.m. at Riverfront Stage: Jackson Dean's voice is a hauntingly inviting instrument that is resonating impressively well of late with mainstream country fanbases. His crunching, heavy and outlaw rock-styled country track \"Don't Come Lookin'\" topped Billboard's Country Airplay charts before the close of 2022, while his album \"Greenbroke\" continues to wow audiences.\n\n3:30 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. at Vibes Stage: Kasey Tyndall's a mother of a newborn who described her best plan for success as \"running on adrenaline and Jesus\" to stardom in a recent Tennessean interview. Add in the prominent influences of Avril Lavigne, Joan Jett and Alison Krauss, plus Brantley Gilbert, Miranda Lambert and Keith Urban to develop the musical Venn diagram that you'll expect to hear in her set.\n\nMore:CMA Fest 2023: Five must-catch performers on Saturday's lineup\n\nWeather forecast for Day 3 of CMA Fest\n\nPrepare for more sunshine as we head into day 3 of country music’s biggest party.

I wake up every day with a dream, and before I'm out of bed, it's happening,\" he said of his impressive surge in national renown.\n\nMiranda Lambert's 'Something Bad' gets a surprise 'Sk8er Boi' update\n\nInstead of Carrie Underwood, Miranda Lambert had other ideas for a collaborative partner on the rendition of her 2014 single \"Something Bad\" she just performed at Nissan Stadium.\n\nCanadian pop superstar Avril Lavigne.\n\nThe \"Sk8er Boi\" singer at a country festival?\n\nIt's not that far-fetched.\n\nDuring 2022's ACM Honors, Shania Twain was celebrated by Lavigne and Kelsea Ballerini making guest appearances.\n\nAs far as the previously-mentioned \"Sk8er Boi?\" Instead of another Lambert hit, Lavigne sang a 90-second snippet of her two-decade-old mega-hit.\n\nAlongside Leon Bridges performing his new Lambert collaboration \"If You Were Mine\" with the ten-time chart-topper surprises continue to stun the capacity crowd in attendance at Nissan Stadium.\n\nReba McEntire joins Cody Johnson, shocking the crowd\n\nCody Johnson, the rodeo outlaw-turned-CMA-award-winning superstar, likely surprised many of the tens of thousands in attendance at Nissan Stadium.\n\nHowever, those well cognizant of (and also having lived) the Western-to-country tradition -- like his special guest Reba McEntire -- were in no way surprised that emerging star Johnson didn't make his CMA Fest debut on Lower Broadway, but rather a boat ride across the Cumberland River away.\n\nYes, Reba McEntire sang her 1986 classic \"Whoever's In New England\" with Johnson at Nissan Stadium. Her unannounced appearance on the CMA Fest stage drew a collective, piercing shriek from a genuinely shocked crowd. As one would expect, the crescendo build from Johnson's mournful drawl to McEntire's soulful shot made it a dynamic performance worthy of a jet-engine roar of a standing ovation.\n\nTanya Tucker's resurgence continues at Nissan Stadium\n\nTanya Tucker's re-emergence as a country superstar has arrived at Nissan Stadium, igniting the filling home of the Tennessee Titans with honky-tonk energy.\n\nShe's both played an early evening set highlighted by tracks from her just-released album \"Sweet Western Sound,\" plus classic songs like her 50-year-old smash \"Delta Dawn.\" Moreover, she joined both Lainey Wilson and Elle King to sing a version of her 1978 hit \"Texas ('Til I Die).\"\n\nWearing two different all-white outfits while performing, her style and flair proved timelessly entertaining.\n\nWhile not the same concept as riding a horse down Lower Broadway or at the Grand Ole Opry, she's still swept into yet another iconic Nashville locale.\n\nAnd at the end of a stirring version of Delta Dawn, the crowd treated Tucker to a lengthy ovation as loud as those usually reserved for the night's headlining act.\n\nFew medical issues as temperatures rise at CMA Fest\n\nIt's been a quiet day at the medical tent next to Riverfront Stage.

However, her growth from country music superstar to an artist with a devoted fan club of thousands of die-hard, bell-bottom-clad fans is a tale that's emerging and worth telling.\n\nBefore playing her \"Bell Bottom Country\" album single \"Hillbilly Hippie\" to kick off a brief acoustic set with her bandmates, she told howMcBryde's support was invaluable at a critical career juncture.

He jokes that they have an icicle farm, and above-freezing temps are about as bad for growing them as lack of rain to a corn farmer. Another challenge is wind that races in from more than one direction.\n\nDan is Wisconsin site manager for Ice Castles, a Utah-based company that turns frozen water into a wintry wonderland of tunnels for crawling, thrones for perching and a maze of sometimes-narrow, twisting trails on 1.5 acres. What began as an empty Mt. Olympus Resort lot is slowly growing into a massive fortress with 10-foot-thick walls, two 50-foot slides, a domed room with waterfall, water fountain, light show and more.\n\nThe all-ice project turns the ground into a rugged and slick rink, for now. Workers strategically attach icicles — about 10,000 per day, when weather cooperates — and use chainsaws to pick axes for chiseling slot canyons, walkways and more. Icicles, with time, morph into walls and roofs whose color shifts from white to blue as the glaze thickens. Walkways are a bumpy mix of crushed ice and snow, although sunshine increases slipperiness. This is no place for a stroller, but maybe a small sled for the toddlers.\n\n“Most of this work happens in four weeks,” says Brent Christensen, regarding his patented process, used by site crews of 15 to 25 to create the surreal-looking castles. The Dells project is one of five this winter. Others are in Midway, Utah; Lincoln, N.H.; Stillwater, Minnesota, and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n\nBrent, the father of six children, built his first ice house for them in 2008. It had a wooden frame and was a mess, he says, but “it became a work of curiosity. I’d get up at 5 a.m. to try things, and I started thinking about how I might build something without a subframe.”\n\nOne year later, Brent was using icicles as a building material. “We could build something 20 feet high in a week,” he explains, and the ice castle he built was taller than his house in Utah. The level of attention from media and passersby was encouragement enough to think even bigger, so he found a resort to sponsor his work and it has grown from there.\n\n“The Dells kind of found us. We were exploring the area last summer — as far down as Chicago” and liked the notion that the area already had tourism traffic in winter because of indoor waterparks.\n\n“Lots of people think ice castles are structures made out of blocks of ice, symmetrical and with straight edges. Ours has more of a natural feel,” Brent says. “We capture the beauty that happens” as icicles form, drip and merge as weather dictates.\n\nWork in the Dells for Dan, from Ohio, began in late October with a refining of the castle design, then laying a network of water and electrical lines that are miles long. This is his sixth ice castle project, and “every site is different.”\n\nBefore the ice castles, his work involved outdoor adventure sports — dog sledding to rock climbing work. He was an English major at Ohio State University who made Shakespeare his thesis topic. While skiing in Silverthorne, Colo., he noticed a poster to recruit workers for an ice castle project there, and the rest is history.\n\nOn his Wisconsin team are local folks and others from as far away as Alaska, Puerto Rico and Colombia. If all goes well, which means a steady stream of freezing temps, the Dells ice castle opens to the public around Jan. 6. When we meet, the project is about 60 percent finished, and I’m wisely outfitted by Dan with a helmet and shoe grips before gingerly touring the work site.\n\n“The warm spell is a challenge,” he acknowledges. “We’ve definitely lost some of our work.” But like any experienced farmer, you can tell faith and fortitude prevail over these temporary obstacles.\n\nIce castle admission will be $9.95 to $18 ($6.95 to $12 for ages 4 to 11 years old). Prices vary by day of week and are cheapest when purchased online. Each ticket contains an entry date and timed slot for entry.\n\n“We expect it will be a very popular weekend attraction, and — believe it or not — we’ve gridlocked freeways because people hope to show up early, without a ticket,” Brent says.\n\nThe attraction is not for wobbly knees or fashionistas. All is outdoors, so dress sensibly and surefootedly, to less the chance of slipping or falling. Buying a ticket, by the way, means releasing the company from liability.\n\n“We always have people show up in high heels and it’s always a bad idea,” Dan says.\n\nLook for the attraction near Top Secret, an upside-down White House facade at 527 Wisconsin Dells Parkway. When the ice castle is ready for visitors, it will be open from noon or mid afternoon to 9 or 10 p.m., depending on the day. Closed on Tuesdays. icecastles.com/wisconsin-dells, 888-407-4054\n\n--\n\nVolunteer firefighters in Eagle River need 14-inch ice on Silver Lake before they begin cutting blocks to make their annual ice castle. Look for the 20-foot-tall castle off of U.S. 45 North downtown; completion is expected by Jan. 12. The tradition began in 1933, requires 700 hours of labor, begins with a LEGO design and is hard to miss — especially at night — because of castle lighting. eagleriver.org/about/ice-castle, 800-359-6315\n\nWindswept ice caves on Lake Superior at Apostle Islands National Lakeshore draw thousands of visitors when conditions are right during winter.

Film critic Claudia Puig and movie reporter Susan Wloszczyna discussed the Great Director Snubbing of 2013 (Affleck! Bigelow! Hooper!) and the close competition in the Best Actress category as well as answering readers' questions about Best Actor, Animated Features and the lack of Best Picture love for The Master.\n\nEnjoy the chat and submit your questions for next week below.\n\nJohn Elliot: Welcome to a special Thursday edition of USA TODAY's Movie Forum\n\nHappy Oscar Nomination Day, film fans\n\nI'm John Elliot, online producer for USA TODAY Movies and I will serve as your moderator. Joining me today is USA TODAY film critic Claudia Puig and movie reporter Susan Wloszczyna.\n\nHow this works - Each week we solicit questions, online, from our readers on certain movie topics.\n\nThis week, however, we're devoting the entire hour to this morning's Oscar nominations!\n\nSnubs, surprises, sure things…we'll cover them all! And we want your input too.\n\nSubmit your Oscar comments and questions below and we'll tackle them during the hour.\n\nSo let's get started…and let's start with the snubs and surprises\n\nAnd let's start with the snubbing-est, suprising-est category of all this year…The Directors! What happened there, Susan?\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: So yes - directors.\n\nWhen the Directors Guild announced their list earlier this week, all us pundits figured that major studio releases were going to rule what with Tom Hooper for Les Mis, Ben Affleck for Argo and Kathryn Bigelow for Zero Dark Thirty making the lineup.\n\nBut those wacky academy voters rewrote the script, didn't they. They wanted Benh -- as in Zeitlan of Beasts of the Southern Wild. And they wanted David -- as in O. Russell of Silver Linings Playbook. And an Austrian dude named Michael Haneke.\n\n\n\nWhat happened is the voters continue to embrace those little indie films that actually probably need their help but do not encourage people who saw Skyfall to watch the Oscar show.\n\nClaudia Puig: For sure the best director category looked like a list of missing persons. Hard to believe Quentin Tarantino and Kathryn Bigelow were left out. Ben Affleck might be the biggest shocker since there was so much early buzz about him and his film. So much for early momentum. Tom Hooper's omission was surprising, though he had his day with King's Speech I guess. Bigelow was no doubt hurt by the political controversy surrounding Zero Dark Thirty.\n\n\n\nTwo of the five nominees were not nominated for awards by the Directors Guild, which is widely considered a barometer for nominees and winners. Michael Haneke of Amour and Benh Zeitlin of Beasts of the Southern Wild were the surprise nominees, elbowing out DGA nominees Affleck and Bigelow.\n\nThe Academy's earlier than usual voting deadline might have been a factor since members turned in their ballots before the DGA nominations were announced.\n\nOne of the issues that's problematic when you have so many best picture candidates, though-- and this year there were 9--is that so many directors seem like worthy contenders. If a film is worth a best picture nomination, more likely than not its director is one of the key reasons it's as good as it is.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: I feel for Tom Hooper but many did bash his obsession with closeups and that he thought it was good idea to expose the public to Russell Crowe's two-note range.\n\nBut Affleck is the biggest head scratcher since he has been a SAG member probably before he could drive. I thought they loved director Ben and that he had paid for his J. Lo sins. At least Argo got 7 nominations,\n\nClaudia Puig: Agreed about Afffleck. Much as I liked Beasts, and thought Benh Zeitlin did a very good job, I would have given that slot to Ben Affleck. And Haneke is a very deliberate and calculated, even cold, director. He's meticulous.\n\nBut Tarantino was really snubbed in my book.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: I had mixed feelings about Django. It had its high points -- that blue fancy-pants suit worn by Jamie Foxx and the use of Jim Croce's I've Got a Name is classic QT. But it seemed a bit of a jangled mess -- or a djangled mess. And ooh that QT cameo.\n\nClaudia Puig: I thought it was pretty brilliant. Susan, do you think Kathryn Bigelow was hurt by the torture question and the accusations by Senators like McCain and Feinstein that torture was not used to track down Bin Laden? I know the radio talk shows have been focusing a lot on the accuracy issue.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Controversy and public discussion rarely hurts a movie. But she did not take a stand on the scenes of torture or other questionable methods depicted. She took the artist defense -- I am not advocating or criticizing. And I think that might have upset the liberal leaners in the academy.\n\nClaudia Puig: All the focus on whether or not torture was used may have just put a dent in the film's momentum by Academy members. Or maybe since she won so recently for The Hurt Locker, it's similar to the sense that she's had her day. Ditto for Hooper and The King's Speech? Then again, Spielberg has been nominated 6 times.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Spielberg is at a whole different level than his competition this year. The fact that he had a return to form with Lincoln begged to be rewarded. Hollywood needs someone who greenlights films so easily to make worthwhile films. So they encouraged him.\n\nClaudia Puig: Yes, Spielberg is pretty much in a class of his own. And he's the man to beat, as is Lincoln star, Daniel Day Lewis.\n\nI have to say I was happy to see Ang Lee get a nomination. The film hasn't seemed to get as much attention as some of the others, but obviously he's very admired by the Academy and his years-long efforts to turn a fairly unfilmable book into a movie were really honored. He's one of my favorite directors--despite the Hulk-- so I'm always happy to see him on the roster of nominees.\n\nJohn Elliot: How about the Best Actress category? No real surprises here BUT no clear front-runner either. We've got five nominees who have never won an Oscar, though three (Watts, Lawrence, Chastain) have been nominated before…SO, Claudia, who do you think walks away with the trophy?\n\nClaudia Puig: If I were king, the trophy would go to Emmanuelle Riva, the 85 year old actress who was so amazing as an elderly French woman facing her mortality. The scenes in which her face is twisted following a stroke seem frightening real. But I think the contest will be between three younger actresses--though not the youngest--9 year old Quvenzhane Wallis. For her just getting nominated is the big prize, as they say.\n\nBut I think it will be a contest between Naomi Watts, Jessica Chatain and Jennifer Lawrence, all former nominees and all very well liked and admired by the Academy. If I were to choose among those 3 I would go for Naomi Watts who does a fantastic job in a little-seen movie.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: No, no Naomi for me. At least this year.\n\nI see a clear divide between the two J's. Both are stunners, both have such great potential, both are versatile. and Lawrence already has two franchises going for her at age 22. But Chastain fascinates me and she is a big reason I found Zero Dark Thirty so riveting. She had all the steely silent determination of Eastwood but maintained her female essence in her reactions.\n\nClaudia Puig: While I think Chastain is a very talented actress and agree about the fascination and have really liked her in previous roles, I would not give her the Oscar for this role because for me her character felt like a robot, or a cardboard cutout. All we knew of her character was that she was driven. Zero Dark Thirty screenwriter Mark Boal didn't bother to give her a back story or much depth. I didn't buy a lot of her reactions--particularly the final scene, which I won't spoil for people who haven't seen it. But I would have liked to see more character development.\n\nI think Jennifer Lawrence is really amazing. She's only 22 and has made such wise choices in roles from Winter's Bone to this and of course Hunger Games. She'll have a long career, as no doubt Chastain will too.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: A robot? Do you think strong and silent male heroes are robots? Or stoic maybe. Mysterious. Not every female action hero has to come on like a Disney princess or Lara Croft. As for Lawrence, I am a big fan -- she can deliver a zingy speech like no one's business. But Chastain to me has much more to show. She really deserves the Oscar.\n\nClaudia Puig: I'm not a big fan of strong and silent anything--male or female. I do like stoic and mysterious and dedicated, etc. Stoic and mysterious is different from lacking any character dimension. I sure don't think every female action hero should be a Disney princess or God forbid, Lara Croft.\n\nBut give me Carrie on Homeland any day. There's character development! But I think we'll have to agree to disagree\n\nBut, I do think Watts is an under-rated actress and her ability to switch from mama bear to cool doctor in The Impossible is pretty astounding. She was determined and stoic, but also showed some emotion. And her chemistry with the boy who played her youngent son and with Ewan McGregor, who was also very good, is also impressive.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Ewan, Ewan, Ewan. To me he really hasn't had a good role that plays up his bad boy side since Trainspotting and Shallow Grave. He lost that edge some where along the line -- probably at the same time he picked up a light saber.\n\nClaudia Puig: I love Ewan too! But i thought he was great in Beginners last year, as the son of Christopher Plummer. Alas, not enough people saw that excellent film\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Remember Velvet Goldmine! Now THAT was Ewan McGregor, pantless and all.\n\nClaudia Puig: Oh yes I remember it well!\n\nJohn Elliot: You'll notice that the Academy didn't fill all ten of its possible Best Picture spots (it did pick nine however). Why is that? And who could have (or should have) snagged that 10th spot?\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Math is not my strong suit. There are websites devoted to the formulas the academy uses to weight the votes, stuff about now many No. 1's and No. 2's and such (that sounds like an Al Roker thing now that I think about it). Anyway, to me, why not fill all 10? Every time a movie is promoted as an Oscar contender, that is money to make more potential Oscar nominees. Moonrise Kingdom or Skyfall could have easily gone in there and made people happy.\n\nClaudia Puig: I guess the 10th for me would have been Skyfall or Moonrise Kingdom, the opposite ends of the spectrum. But I thought one of the reasons the Academy increased the number of best picture nominees was to include more audience favorites, the best of the blockbusters or popcorn fare. So, in that case it would have been good to see Skyfall or Looper or perhaps even The Avengers in that 10th slot. But the critic side of me can think of lots of indies that are equally deserving. Hello, I Must Be Going, Robot and Frank, Safety Not Guaranteed...I could go on....It's been a good year\n\nGuest asks:\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Best Actor? Any snubs there?\n\nClaudia Puig: I guess John Hawkes who played a guy in an iron lung seeking to lose his virginity would be considered a snub. Some might say Daniel Craig, who really is a great Bond.\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: John Hawkes was insanely good. He was not just a guy in an iron lung in The Sessions. He was funny, he was sexy, you understood why so many women found this guy incredibly attractive even if he couldn't even scratch his nose. Such a beautiful performance. Yeah, yeah, Bradley Cooper was bipolar. But he wore a garbage bag. John Hawkes got naked both physically and emotionally.\n\nClaudia Puig: Hawkes is always good. His role as Uncle Teardrop in Winter's Bone still sends a chill up my spine! I had the opportunity to meet him at an event once and I was scared to talk to him, that character was so indelible in my memory....\n\nOn second thought, another snub would be best actress nominee Emanuelle Riva's co-star in Amour -- Jean-Louis Trintignant. But that woudl have been a very big long shot.\n\nI think Jamie Foxx was quite good in Django. I think there were more omissions for best supporting actor::Javier Bardem in Skyfall, James Spader in Lincoln, Leonardo Di Caprio and Samuel L. Jackson in Django.\n\nJohn Elliot: Life of Pi got the second highest number of nominations with 11…but none of them were in the acting nominations. Does it have any chance of winning Best Picture?\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: The film hasn't stirred as much debate as Zero Dark Thirty, Django or even Les Mis, but there are people out there who love this film to death. I found it beautiful, enchanting and at times profound -- although around the time the lemurs showed up, I started to question where the ending was going having not read the book. But Ang Lee obviously has his supporters in the academy -- he and Spielberg are the only two DGA nominees that were honored by the Oscar voters too.\n\nBut supposedly without a best actor nominee, a film often has little hope of taking the top prize. Not that I think Silver Linings with four acting noms is going to have an easy time, either, being a comedy.\n\nClaudia Puig: I found it enchanting too and I think Life of Pi stands some chance, but Lincoln, Silver Linings and Argo stand better chances. I think the plethora of technical nominations it got shows how impressed the Academy is with it as a filmmaking achievement, but since actors are the largest branch of the Academy, i think they'll likely vote for Lincoln or Silver Linings -- both of which had a lot of acting nods -- over Life of Pi.\n\nGuest asks:\n\nDo you think anything was left out of Best Animated Feature?\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: No DreamWorks title. Three Disney releases made it in, though. ParaNorman, which I loved, made it in. The surprise, however, was the underseen The Pirates! Meanwhile, The Rise of the Guardians was left out. That might be because it was the last DreamWorks film distributed and promoted by Paramount. Maybe the handoff to Fox caused a lack of enthusiasm to build for it.\n\nClaudia Puig: Disney does dominate the animated category, not surprisingly. And not for the first time. It was a pretty good year overall for animation. While I'm happy that the dreadful Hotel Transylvania didn't make it in. I guess Rise of the Guardians could be considered an omission.\n\nMy personal favorite is Frankenweenie, since I'm a big dog lover and a huge fan of Tim Burton...But I also loved Wreck it Ralph and Brave and thought ParaNorman was entertaining, though less than those other 3. A question for our questioner: Do YOU think something was left out?\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: I am a Wreck-It Ralph supporter myself. I love that Disney made a Pixar film and Pixar made a more Disney-like princess film.\n\nMatty P from New Haven asks:\n\nWhy do you think The Master didn't get nods in Best Picture/Director?\n\nClaudia Puig: Hi Matty, I think The Master divided people, but the one thing most people agreed on was that Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman gave amazing performances. And the Academy added Amy Adams, who is also a wonderful actress.\n\nI'm a huge PT Anderson fan, but this was not my favorite of his films so I can't say I was very upset to see it left off the list. The acting was the key to that film, in my book, though it was beautifully shot\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: If The Master came out later in the year, it might have hung on. But that is the trouble with coming out in early September. The initial excitement over a new Paul Thomas Anderson film died out before the month ended. And The Weinstein Co. pinned their hopes on Django and Silver Linings instead.\n\nClaudia Puig: Timing is everything. I think Argo coming out as early as it did in the process and getting all that advance buzz for Ben Affleck might have hurt him as well.\n\nJohn Elliot: Well, it's time for us to wrap up unfortunately… We'll get our first possible Oscar winner predictors this Sunday during the Golden Globe Awards\n\nThank you Claudia and Susan. And a VERY big thank you to all our readers who participated and submitted questions.\n\nClaudia Puig: Thanks, readers, for your astute questions. Go see the Oscar nominees--and other movies too! And happy New Year to all!\n\nSusan Wloszczyna: Oh boy, we have what? Six more weeks or so to keep rehashing these theories. Hang in there folks.

It is never ending.\n\nJohn Elliot: Remember: you can submit your burning movie questions all week long, right here.\n\nCheck usatoday.com for or ongoing Oscar coverage and join USA TODAY online Sunday as we cover the Golden Globes live.\n\nThank you all for joining us for the USA TODAY Movie Forum!

And after record-low ratings in 2021, the old adage about the Lord helping those who help themselves comes to mind.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is surely feeling pressure to breathe some life back into ratings for the Oscars, and part of that plan has logically involved nominating movies that more people have actually seen. Yet despite expanding the best-picture category to 10 nominees, few of the major contenders in the nominations unveiled Tuesday morning meet that description – especially if it means having seen those films in theaters.\n\nBefore the nominations, producer Cassian Elwes – known for smaller-scale films like “Mudbound” and “Lee Daniels’ The Butler” – tweeted that it was “shortsighted” for the Producers Guild’s awards to overlook “the two terrific movies that saved the theatrical business this year,” “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and “No Time to Die.”\n\nIf you subscribe to that theory, the Oscars will be inordinately reliant on movies that have primarily reached audiences through streaming, with two Netflix titles, “Don’t Look Up” and “The Power of the Dog,” among the 10 nominees, joined by Apple’s “Coda,” and “King Richard” and “Dune,” which premiered simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max. (The last two are from Warner Bros., like CNN, part of WarnerMedia.)\n\nAs for the aforementioned movies that “saved the theatrical business,” “Spider-Man” – currently the fourth biggest domestic box-office release of all time – received a lone nomination for visual effects, while Daniel Craig’s final appearance as 007 was recognized for best song, sound and visual effects.\n\nGranted, the belief that popular movies are key to boosting Oscar ratings doesn’t always hold true, although the most-watched telecast ever remains the year that “Titanic” sailed away with best picture. Yet it seems undeniable that hit films broadly help, giving potential viewers more of a rooting interest in who and what wins.\n\nMindful of that, the Academy flirted with introducing a “popular film” category in 2018, seeking to add a more populist streak to the ceremony. After members shot down the idea for various (mostly logical) reasons, the organization opted to expand the best picture category to 10 movies, in part hoping that at least a few widely seen titles would sneak into the mix.\n\nSmaller movies, however, have generally prevailed. And part of the challenge that the Oscars and the movie business face has stemmed from the consumer pivot to streaming, a trend that was already growing before being dramatically hastened by the global pandemic.\n\nHidetoshi Nishijima and Tôko Miura in 'Drive My Car,' which received Oscar nominations for best picture and international film. Bitters End\n\nFor theaters worried about their future, the fact that people interested in catching up on nominees will find “The Power of the Dog” (this year’s most-nominated title, with 12) and “Don’t Look Up” on Netflix – along with others that earned major nominations, including “Tick, Tick … Boom!” and “The Lost Daughter” – won’t ease those concerns.\n\nBecause streamers generally don’t provide detailed viewing data, it’s unclear how many people have seen some of these movies, but they’re obviously being watched via those platforms in vast numbers. Witness the Billboard-topping songs from “Encanto,” a nominee for best animated movie, which took off once that title landed on Disney+.\n\nWhile blockbusters (other than the sci-fi epic “Dune,” a more modest box-office performer) remain scarce in the best-picture category, the Academy did recognize an international movie, Japan’s critical darling “Drive My Car,” as well as its director, Ryusuke Hamaguchi. That follows the historic best-picture win by “Parasite” two years ago.\n\nIn addition, the Danish animated documentary “Flee” registered an impressive showing, notching nominations in the animated, documentary and international film categories.\n\nThe Academy’s ongoing efforts to be more representative in terms of diversity and inconclusion continue to yield mixed results, with some notable oversights (see Ruth Negga for Netflix’s “Passing”) but major acting nominations for Denzel Washington (“The Tragedy of Macbeth”), Ariana DeBose (“West Side Story”), and Will Smith and Aunjanue Ellis (“King Richard”).\n\nInevitably, the omissions will receive as much attention as the nominees, but by now it should be clear that the Oscars can never please everybody, especially with 10 best-picture nominees and only five slots for directors.\n\nWhether that somewhat disjointed roster adds up to a menu that will lure back more viewers remains to be seen. But if the Academy does see ratings rebound, the hero will be streaming, not Spider-Man.", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "publish_date": "2022/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainment/movies/2016/02/27/oscars-racist-academy-members-chime/80948052/", "title": "Are the Oscars racist? Academy members chime in", "text": "Bruce Fessier\n\nThe Desert Sun\n\nDick Taylor has been a diligent Motion Pictures Academy member since 1988, when he was CEO of Hollywood public relations giant Rogers and Cowan.\n\nAs late as last week, with the Academy Awards voting deadline looming, the Palm Springs resident tried to view one last film in a theater to inform the final vote on his ballot. Like all Academy members, he gets free “screeners” to watch Oscar-nominated films on TV. But he likes to watch movies on the big screen because some films don’t translate well to television.\n\nSo it came as a shock last month when he received a letter from Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs, who is black, that excludes him from future Oscar votes because the Academy was changing its membership rules to become more inclusive.\n\nThe changes are intended to double the number of Academy women and ethnic minorities by 2020 to hopefully remedy a problem illustrated last month by the Academy's vote for an all-white slate of best acting nominees. That compounded a backlash to last year's vote when the acclaimed Martin Luther King biopic, “Selma,” was nominated for Best Picture and received an Oscar for Best Original Song, but didn’t get any nominations for its black actors and director. Actors such as Jada Pinkett Smith and husband Will Smith announced they’d boycott Sunday’s Academy Awards, which has been branded on Twitter as #OscarsSoWhite.\n\nDirector Spike Lee, who accepted an honorary Oscar from the Academy in November, says the problem in Hollywood is the lack of diversity among executives and studio heads. He also said he'd skip the Oscars.\n\nThe new rules keep the voting rolls manageable by stipulating that members must have worked on a film in the past 10 years or any three 10-year periods to be eligible to vote. And therein lies Taylor's problem. He hasn’t done movie publicity in three 10-year-periods and hasn’t worked on any film in the past 10 years, having devoted much of his time to event producing and philanthropy.\n\nStudy finds a 'whitewashed' Hollywood\n\nSo he’s an Academy member denied the right to vote. And that stings.\n\n“Making this a big issue over diversity, it doesn’t work for me,” said Taylor, 69. “I don’t believe I’m a bigot. The performances that were nominated this year, I agree with. I don’t think we vote for the awards based on who’s black, who’s brown, who’s Asian. I didn’t overlook any black actor or screenwriter or anything else because they were black. I voted for who I thought was best in the category. That’s what you’re supposed to do, I think.”\n\nBut new studies and an overwhelming number of people on social media says it's time to make the Academy Awards and Hollywood more diverse. Social engagement measuring platform Postano reports the #OscarsSoWhite movement has generated almost 1.5 billion media impressions over the past 30 days.\n\nUSA Today reported Monday that the Oscars may continue to be oh so white in 2017. Its study of 184 movies slated to be released this year by 14 studios revealed “a dearth” of women and minorities in major roles or behind the camera. A USC study of Hollywood diversity also released last week found that just 3.4 percent of film directors were female, and only 7 percent of films had a cast whose balance of race and ethnicity reflected the country's diversity.\n\nThe Asian Pacific American Media Coalition, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, the NAACP Hollywood Bureau and the American Indians in Film and Television have formed a Multi-Ethnic Media Coalition and launched a new effort to convince studios to be more inclusive.\n\nThe USC study suggests setting target goals for Hollywood to become more inclusive. Stacy L. Smith, one of the study's authors and founding director of the Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative at USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, reiterated Lee's charge that the focus should be on the people who approve, or \"greenlight,\" films to be made.\n\nDarrien Michele Gipson, national director of the Screen Actors Guild organization, SAGindie, says it's unfortunate that people who fit Taylor's description will be excluded from voting to make Hollywood more inclusive. But necessary.\n\n\"I certainly feel for those people who are finding themselves on this cutting edge, but the fact remains that we have to reflect the world as we know it now and, if you’re not active, maybe you’re missing something. I think it’s wonderful that he’s trying to see everything. I don’t think that’s true of everyone.\n\n\"But it’s not that (the Academy) is deciding these people are bigots or racists or anything like that. That’s not the line. The line is understanding what the films are doing and what they mean right now. There are unconscious biases in well-meaning people. If you have every intention and every well-meaning, that’s fantastic. But you may not know how groups of people feel today if you’re not directly associated with them. If you are outside looking in at a group of people, you are deciding how they feel and how they act and what’s considered good, bad or otherwise from your position. And that is always fraught with danger. It’s unfortunate. It’s definitely going to take out some people that are really fantastic, smart and still very connected. But, it’s going to have to happen.\"\n\nThe new studies, Gipson said, reveal what minorities in Hollywood have known instinctively about this \"post-racial\" age. Despite all the advances since Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for playing a maid in the 1939 Civil War epic, \"Gone With The Wind,\" the playing field for women and minority actors in Hollywood is still is still largely segregated.\n\n\"What we got are a series of statistics that illuminate what we already see and feel, but couldn’t necessarily convince anyone else of,\" Gipson said. \"It’s a little bit like having a discussion about racism. It doesn’t always have to be so overt. It’s a feeling. Then the feeling gets bigger and it becomes more obvious. There’s always a lot of ‘Things will change. Things are getting better. Post-racial.’ Now, when everybody says the world is so much better, you can show that the statistics do not support (that). The reasoning behind everything hasn’t changed and that’s the problem. We cannot sustain momentum without fundamental change.\"\n\nThe reason things haven't changed, Gipson asserts, is because the makeup of the \"higher-ups\" hasn't changed. Lee asserted in November it was easier for a black person to become President of the United States than chief of a Hollywood studio or network.\n\n\"They will not give the same amount of money to women as they will to men, and they certainly give even less to people of color,\" Gipson said. \"So how can you compete in a market to make a great film worthy of a nomination for an Academy Award when everybody else is making it for $50 million and you are struggling to make that film for $2 million?\"\n\nGipson is reticent to say Hollywood is racist. She calls it \"more of an unconscious bias\" – people not being as open to new cultural experiences as they should be to make Hollywood inclusive.\n\nLocal industry professionals think along the same lines.\n\nFred Williamson, a Palm Springs resident who began his acting career almost 50 years ago on “Julia,” the first TV sitcom starring a black actress, knows there's racism in Hollywood. But that's not the word he uses to explain the dearth of minority actors, directors and producers.\n\n\"I think ignorance comes into play,” he said. “I don’t think it’s racial. It could be racial because here (in Hollywood), we’ve got BET Awards. They make it more racial than anybody else. They’ve got BET Awards only for blacks to win. Then they’ve got Essence Awards where only blacks can win. I mean, that’s just as much racism as the Academy Awards.”\n\nFilm academy pledges to double female, minority members\n\nBlaxploitation movement fades\n\nWilliamson has been through efforts to promote equality – or eliminate racism – in the motion pictures industry before. He’s one of the pioneers of the blaxploitation movement of the early 1970s, along with “Shaft” star Richard Roundtree, Jim Brown and Bernie Casey, who all still play in his annual celebrity golf tournament in Indio.\n\nWilliamson began starring in these action films at a time when Hollywood was threatened economically by the fledgling independent film movement and white culture was so dominant. Williamson began producing and directing these genre films – celebrated by Quentin Tarantino in his 1997 film “Jackie Brown” – after the NAACP, Southern Christian Leadership Conference and National Urban League formed a Coalition Against Blaxpoitation and studios began backing away from them. Williamson said that resulted in fewer opportunities for black actors.\n\n“The movies I started doing in the 1970s was to show Hollywood there’s a black audience out there and if you feed them and give them the kind of films they want, they will come to the show,” Williamson said.\n\n“That was my purpose and it worked because I was lining them up around the block and giving (the studios) all the competition they needed from my little $2 million and $3 million films, which were grossing, percentage-wise, better than some of the bigger films. A lot of films they were making – $50 million, $75 million – weren’t making any money. They needed to make some films that made money. So, it lasted for four years. They started calling it 'black exploitation,' which, I never really understood.”\n\nGipson said the negative backlash had to do with an era in which civil rights was more about eliminating legal segregation than including blacks in business.\n\n\"What he’s talking about was probably very true at that time and it has a lot to do with desegregation and the undermining and lessening of black-owned businesses,\" she said. \"I don’t think that’s where we are right now.\n\n\"Where we are right now is it is statistically shown that when women and people of color are at the helm of their own projects, their film, cast, crew, everyone is more inclusive. So the ‘new’ thing is that, when you put a woman in charge of her film, be it producer and director, you will have a better mix of people on that film and people will give jobs to more women and the same thing happens with people of color.\"\n\nWilliamson has continued to star in and produce his '70s brand of action films. He recently wrapped “Atomic Eden,” in which he plays a mercenary hired to find an atomic weapon left in one of Hitler’s bunkers before the bad guys get it. But Williamson’s films generally fly under the mainstream radar, getting sold in film markets connected to the Cannes and Berlin film festivals, or the American Film Market in Santa Monica, ensuring his movies will play before audiences worldwide.\n\nHe proudly says his films always make money. But he dances around the word “racism” while discussing white mainstream resistance to black action films.\n\n“You want to call it black exploitation, that’s fine,” he said. “But you have to call Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson films white exploitation because we were doing the same thing. If you don’t do that to their films and you call mine black exploitation, then I don’t fully understand what you mean because (upon making black action films), now the audience is happy. They have equal films they can watch. The films are making money. The actors starring in the films are making more money than they ever did before. So everybody is happy.\n\n“But, after Universal and Paramount and MGM got their light bill paid, they didn’t make any more. ‘Shaft’ cost about $5 million, but it made $25 or $30 million and that was enough to get them out of debt. Once they did that, they moved away.\"\n\nWant to win your Oscar pool? Here are your winners\n\nWilliamson: Limited opportunities\n\nWilliamson, a 77-year-old former NFL star, is recognized by millennials today for his role in the Tarantino-written cult vampire film, \"From Dusk Till Dawn,\" or the film version of \"Starsky & Hutch.\" He says the problem now is he gets lumped into the same category as the few other well-known black actors over age 60.\n\n“When they get a script in Hollywood and, on page 32, it says ‘black man enters the room,’ to them, that means Denzel Washington, Samuel L. Jackson or Morgan Freeman,” Williamson said. “That’s what they think. They don’t know other black actors other than the ones they’ve seen constantly in film. They don’t think outside the box because they don’t see the box. They don’t know what’s in the box. We’re back to ignorance.”\n\nHebe Tabachnik, an Argentine world cinema programmer for the Palm Springs and Seattle film festivals, resists the word “racism” for the antipathy it engenders.\n\n“When you use that word, you start putting people in opposite places and against one another,” she said. “I try always to bring people together. I like to empathize with things that are being done to address these issues. And, if you look at the word racism, it is global. The Academy is just nominating films and people vote the best of what they see. They shouldn’t have anything else in their minds. I’m a juror at many festivals and I wouldn’t like to have someone telling me you have to select this or that 'just because.' I hate that.”\n\nTabachnik believes the Academy is trying to become more inclusive and sees progress being made.\n\n“This year, there are a lot of Latinos nominated behind the scenes,” she said. “The more obvious is Alejandro Iñárritu or (Emmanuel) Lubezki, the ASC nomination for best cinematographer (both for “The Revenant”). But there are other categories – of course in the foreign languages, short films and editing. What I like about what’s going on now is we’re talking about it. The Academy’s talking, you’re talking, USC is conducting studies and we’re finally thinking about it.”\n\nOscar nominations add luster to film festival\n\nTabachnik credits civil rights organizations and film festivals for advancing films that could promote positive change.\n\n“Organizations like the National Organization for Latino Producers, they are doing their job in terms of trying to push diversity in television and in movies through their works and connections with studios and TV companies,” she said. “The same thing with IFP – Film Independent – each of these organizations, their mission is to create these new grounds. There is a lot to be done.”\n\nShe, too, believes the focus on inclusion should be on the studio chiefs that greenlight films with diverse stories, casts and production crews.\n\n“I don’t want to say it’s a monopoly, but it is,” she said. “It’s a reality we all live in and I think the emergence of new platforms and new ways of getting the content to the audience in different ways, that is shifting things. But the economical factors are so huge. Films are costing (upwards of) $250 million for the studio and I’m not excusing them. But while people keep consuming certain content and they do not do the same thing with other films, this will remain something we won’t be able to change. And the reality is there are not many blacks on screen, there are not many Latinos, there are not many women.”\n\nBut she thinks the Hollywood diversity issue is just part of a larger problem that spans the globe.\n\n“We're talking about awards and eventually that's just a tiny part of what's going on,” she said. “Where does the problem begin? It eventually (begins with) we as a society. But maybe because I come from a different country, I've seen this in many places – in Europe, Latin America. The problem is bigger and, if you ask me, it's something that starts in elementary school or before in the home. It has to begin with acceptance, with understanding. Maybe for once, we should start thinking differently about how we view ourselves instead of dividing ourselves in terms of color or how we dress or how we pray and be more inclusive. It's bigger than just not having blacks or Natives or Latinos on screen. I don't think we can be naive that this is an Academy problem.”\n\nThe inclusion of women and ethnic or racial minorities around the world complicates the efforts to diversify Hollywood films viewed around the world.\n\nLooking for a place to watch the Oscars? We can help.\n\n“One of the things that's heart-wrenching as a programmer and having the privilege of being in contact with film from all over the world,\" Tabachnik said, \"is it is sometimes so discouraging to see that (rights) we live with and cherish is not the case in so many other places in the world. More basic rights are not granted the way we believe they should. In so many places, women do not have the right to vote or the right to choose who to marry or own property or drive a car. We don’t even think about that, and that was a fight also (here) at some point and we overcame that.”\n\nInternational film festivals such as Palm Springs and Seattle bring those conditions to the attention of filmgoers because diversity is one of their primary missions. But the Motion Pictures Academy is so Western-centric, it still labels all films not released in English as “foreign language films.”\n\nTaylor recognizes the value in attracting more young people to the Academy. But he sees every foreign language nomination and wouldn’t consider voting for a film based on predisposition toward a country, its race or ethnicity. Daniel Berger, president of Oscilloscope Laboratories, producer of the Oscar-nominated Colombian film, \"Embrace of the Serpent,\" criticized some Academy members Friday for not even watching his film at a time they are crying for more diversity.\n\n“I believe people are people no matter where they come from. And movies? You can judge them on all kinds of levels,” said Taylor. “I think what is now called a ‘foreign’ film can be put up against films from this country. There are some brilliant things that are done in European and Eastern countries.\n\n“It seems to me we can all be on one level. Whether you’re reading subtitles or you’re hearing things in English, it’s still a movie. It still has a plot. It still has actors. I’d love to see things one day on an even keel. I think it would be healthier for everybody.”\n\nReporter Bruce Fessier covers film, music and the creative class for The Desert Sun.

Some were on the bubble yet had a fighting chance (Robert De Niro, Adam Sandler), others were a complete shock (Jennifer Lopez).\n\nRegardless, they won't be competing for gold glory during the 92nd annual Academy Awards ceremony airing Feb. 9 (ABC, 8 p.m. EST/5 PST).\n\nHere are the most glaring Oscar nomination snubs:\n\nOscars 2020:The Academy Awards will have no host again for 2020 ceremony\n\nWho's up for an Oscar?See the complete list of nominees\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nLopez was widely predicted to receive a best supporting actress nod for her role in \"Hustlers,\" especially after bringing home Screen Actors Guild, Critics' Choice and Golden Globe nominations. Her exclusion from the Oscar nominees list brought an immediate outcry on social media.\n\nLopez's snub also made waves with director Tyler Perry.\n\n\"I'm upset man,\" Perry told TMZ Monday. \"J.LO didn't get nominated. Are you kidding me?\"\n\n\"She should've gotten nominated,\" he added.\n\nLupita Nyong'o\n\nNyong'o didn't give just one performance in Jordan Peele's horror film \"Us,\" she gave two, as sharply contrasting characters Adelaide and her evil doppelganger, Red. But Academy members denied the actress a second nomination, after Nyong'o won best supporting actress for 2013's \"12 Years a Slave.\"\n\nNicole Kidman\n\nKidman earned rave reviews for playing Gretchen Carlson in the Fox News drama \"Bombshell.\" While Charlize Theron was nominated for her lead role as Megyn Kelly, and Margot Robbie nabbed a nod for supporting actress, Kidman's role was overlooked.\n\nRobert De Niro\n\nThe legendary actor seemed to be a lock for his return with director Martin Scorsese in \"The Irishman,\" a film named for his hitman character Frank Sheeran. But after missing out on Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations, it became clear that the two-time Oscar winner's critically praised role had been overshadowed in a crowded actor field. His co-stars Joe Pesci and Al Pacino received supporting actor nominations.\n\nEddie Murphy\n\nMurphy made a major splash in 2019, led by his role as real-life movie legend Rudy Ray Moore in \"Dolemite Is My Name.\" A Golden Globe win likely would have pushed him into Oscar contention, but Murphy surprisingly lost to \"Rocketman\" star Taron Egerton. On Monday, Murphy came up short for Oscar's best actor nomination.\n\nWho did receive Oscar nominations:'Joker' leads with 11 nods, including best picture\n\nAdam Sandler\n\nSandler earned rare critical raves, and was nearly unrecognizable in his role as a charismatic, scheming New York City jeweler on the lookout for the next big score in \"Uncut Gems.\" Sandler campaigned hard and longtime fans were hoping the comedian could earn his first Oscar nomination. But \"Sandman gets no love from the Academy,\" Sandler pointed out Monday on Twitter.\n\nThe bright side: \"Sandman can stop wear suits,\" he added, giving congrats to those who did get nominated, including Kathy Bates.\n\nBates, who was nominated for best supporting actress for her role in \"Richard Jewell\" played Sandler's mother in 1998's \"The Waterboy.\"\n\n\"I love you my Bobby Boucher!!!\" she replied in a tweet. \"You was robbed!! But Mama loves you!!!\"\n\n'Frozen II'\n\nOscar viewers are going to have trouble letting this one go. The animated sequel to “Frozen,” which has seen mixed reviews, but made $1.37 billion at the global box office, was denied a best animated movie nomination. The movie's song “Into the Unknown” did earn a best song nomination.\n\nAwkwafina\n\nThe \"Crazy Rich Asians\" star showed emotional depth as a grieving granddaughter dealing with the terminal illness of her beloved grandmother in \"The Farewell.\" Awkwafina made Golden Globes history as the first Asian actress to take best actress in a musical or comedy. But she missed out on an Oscar nomination.\n\nBeyoncé\n\nBeyoncé's original song \"Spirit\" from \"The Lion King\" soundtrack was left off the list for best song, negating the possibility of a Beyoncé performance at the Oscar ceremony.\n\nGreta Gerwig\n\nThe \"Little Women\" director was overlooked in a male-dominated field of directors (\"The Farewell\" director Lulu Wang was also passed over). Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's beloved novel did score a nomination for best picture and for best adapted screenplay, along with stars Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh, for best actress and supporting actress, respectively.\n\nGerwig discussed her directing snub, as well as the future for female filmmakers, in an interview with The New York Times published Monday.\n\n\"You want to see the work acknowledged on the largest stage possible, and there is so much beautiful work done by female writers, producers, directors, creators,\" she said. \"But in terms of it all moving in the right direction, that’s all we can do: continue to make the work, make the work, make the work.\"\n\nShe added: \"There have been great strides and we’ve got to keep going: keep writing, keep making, keep doing. It’s all there.\"\n\nIn a Deadline article published Monday, \"Little Women\" star Saoirse Ronan says she was “scratching (her) head a bit” when Gerwig wasn't a directing nominee.\n\n“I’m really happy that the Academy recognized (Gerwig) for Adapted Screenplay and Picture, and I feel like if you’ve been nominated for best picture, you have essentially been nominated for best director,” she said. “But to me, Greta, since she started, has made two perfect films, and I hope when she makes her next perfect movie, she gets recognized for everything, because I think she’s one of the most important filmmakers of our time.”\n\nFlorence Pugh, who also stars in the film, told the outlet Gerwig's snub was “a big blow, especially because she created a film that is so her and so unique and it’s just come out of her, and it’s been a story she’s wanted to do for so long.”\n\nShe added: “I think everybody’s angry and quite rightly so. I can’t believe it’s happened again, but I don’t really know how to solve it. I don’t know what the answer is, other than we’re talking about it.”\n\nTaron Egerton\n\nThe \"Rocketman” star wowed as Elton John in the musical biopic and took home a Golden Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy. But unlike Rami Malek, whose Freddie Mercury role in “Bohemian Rhapsody” went on to win the best actor Oscar in 2019, Egerton did not garner a nomination. Egerton's duet with John, \"(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again,\" an original number written by John and longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin, was nominated for best song.\n\nJamie Foxx\n\nFoxx earned a SAG nomination portraying Walter McMillian, a wrongfully convicted death row inmate championed by lawyer Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) in \"Just Mercy.\" But his supporting role in the inspirational film, based on a true story, was passed over.\n\nWillem Dafoe\n\nDafoe has become an Oscar mainstay, with two acting nominations for beloved art-house movies in the past two years (\"At Eternity's Gate\" and \"The Florida Project\"). But Dafoe's quest for a three in a row was halted after his role as a boisterous lighthouse keeper struggling to keep his sanity in \"The Lighthouse\" crashed into the rocks during nominations.\n\nZhao Shuzhen\n\nThe Chinese actress was the anchor in Wang's critically acclaimed \"The Farewell.\" Shuzhen has earned Independent Spirit and Critics' Choice nominations for her role as Awkwafina's grandmother in the drama but didn't get a best supporting actress Oscar nomination.\n\nChristian Bale\n\nFour-time Oscar nominee Bale has taken home the Oscar once with a 2011 best supporting actor win for \"The Fighter.\" His role as eccentric, stubborn British engineer and race driver Ken Miles in director James Mangold's \"Ford v Ferrari\" had Bale cruising toward contention again. But Academy voters pulled out the red flag on his efforts.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/ai-art-fair-winner-controversy/index.html", "title": "AI won an art contest, and artists are furious | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nJason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now, his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.\n\nIn August, Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image, titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”), was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.\n\n“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it,” Allen, 39, told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.\n\nIn August, Jason M. Allen's piece \"Théâtre D'opéra Spatial\" — which he created with AI image generator Midjourney — won first place in the emerging artist division's \"digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography\" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. Courtesy Jason M. Allen\n\nAllen’s winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.\n\nThe definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.\n\nMidjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord, while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation, and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.\n\nThe newness of these tools, how they’re used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.\n\nThis came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.\n\n“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics,” one Twitter user wrote.\n\n“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’,” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”\n\nYet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.\n\n“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions,” he said.\n\nYou can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds, but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.\n\nFirst, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said. Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.\n\nAllen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.\n\n“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it,” Allen said.\n\nCal Duran, an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition, said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney, he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still, he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category, he said, calling it a “beautiful piece”.\n\n“I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way,” he said.\n\nAllen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/06/05/stream-these-20-compelling-movies-tv-shows-racism-america/3135829001/", "title": "So you want to learn about racism in America? Stream these 20 ...", "text": "Hello, and welcome to your first of many lessons in learning about racial inequality in the United States.\n\nIn June 2020, protests sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police erupted nationwide and had many Americans searching for resources to understand why Black folks are upset, angry, tired, fed up, sad and emotionally drained.\n\nSix days into 2021, Congress was set to formally declare Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 presidential election when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. Four people were killed, the National Guard was deployed and more than 50 people were arrested.\n\nThe police response to each of these protests was starkly different as many civil rights leaders and people on social media pointed out. While Black Lives Matter protestors clashed with law enforcement and were met with tear gas and rubber bullets, pro-Trump supporters, mostly white, stormed a federal building and the crowds of law enforcement were notably absent.\n\nWhile some have turned to books to learn about the prison industrial complex and white fragility, using pop culture as a learning tool can be a little less intimidating.\n\n\"People may feel like if they like a certain rapper or watch a certain show that means they're not racist, but it's deeper than that,\" says Todd Boyd, chairman for the study of race and popular culture at the University of Southern California. \"Pop culture has to be understood in the proper historical and political context – otherwise, it's just images detached from anything substantive.\"\n\nThink of it like watching the movie version instead of reading the 500-page literary classic you were assigned in high school – you'll get the big picture, albeit missing some key details. So make sure you're supplementing your pop culture knowledge with autobiographies and works of nonfiction as well, recommends Darnell Hunt, director of UCLA's Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies.\n\nWith the help of pop culture and film experts, we've compiled a list, by no means exhaustive, of TV shows and movies you can stream to help you on your journey in understanding the jarringly different life Black Americans live because of racism.\n\n\"There are lots of ways to be Black, so I want you to be able to see the funny parts of it, the horrible parts of it, the scary parts of it and to just immerse yourself in stories that have Black people as their center,\" says Arienne Thompson, adjunct lecturer in journalism at Georgetown University and former USA TODAY pop culture journalist.\n\nMovies\n\n'Do the Right Thing' (1989)\n\nThis is the quintessential movie about police brutality. \"It's a hot summer in New York City and these racial tensions are bubbling up and then climax and the conclusion of the movie is so wrenching,\" Thompson says. \"It's terrible for anyone to watch and especially for us to see a Black body abused that way onscreen.\"\n\nSpike Lee's film is also on Boyd's list: \"It's about racial conflict, police brutality, chokehold. ... It was prophetic if you think about the killing of Radio Raheem, and how that mirrors exactly what people are responding to right now,\" he says.\n\n'Fruitvale Station' (2013)\n\nSome films are just too traumatic to watch more than once – if you can even get through them that one time. For Thompson, this is one of them. The Ryan Coogler film tells the story of Oscar Grant (Michael B. Jordan), a 22-year-old Black man who was shot to death by police at an Oakland, California, metro station. Thompson calls it a modern-day \"Do the Right Thing.\"\n\n\"There was a young Black man sitting next to me and crying during the movie and I'll never forget that,\" Thompson says.\n\n'Moonlight' (2016)\n\nThis Academy Award-winning picture shows the grief and trauma of Black men through an entirely different lens than police brutality while also highlighting the Black LGBTQ community.\n\nOscar watch:Inside the magic of 'Moonlight'\n\n\"It's about seeing the wholeness of Black people and the wholeness of Black men and how they can surprise you by not being who you think they are,\" Thompson says.\n\n'Dead Presidents' (1995)\n\nWhile there are many Vietnam war movies, none focus on the Black veteran experience like Albert and Allen Hughes' \"Dead Presidents,\" Boyd says.\n\n\" 'Dead Presidents' is about Black soldiers in Vietnam and particularly the struggles they face when they return home, but it's also about what sort of world they enter when they come back home,\" Boyd says.\n\n'In the Heat of the Night' (1967)\n\nThis film came at the height of Sidney Poitier's career, several years after he became the first Black star to win best actor at the Oscars (for \"Lilies of the Field\").\n\n\"There's a moment in the film when one of the racist Southerners slaps him and he quickly slaps him back. I call it the 'slap heard 'round the world,' \" Boyd says. \"So instead of standing there, taking the slap and turning the other cheek, he fights back.\n\n\"That scene is really satisfying because it ties to the politics of the late '60s after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. – a lot of people are no longer willing to be so peaceful.\"\n\n'Get Out' (2017)\n\nJordan Peele's directorial debut turns white supremacy into a horror flick.\n\n\" 'Get Out' is the personification of that meme like 'I wish people loved Black people as much as they love Black culture,' like that's literally what the movie is about,\" Thompson says. \"That these white people would pay to become Black and to take on these attributes of blackness that they want, that they covet.\"\n\n'13th' (2016)\n\nAva DuVernay's documentary explains the prison industrial complex and is timely as it spans from the 1800s through to Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nIt explores why this is an issue in our society, discusses private prisons and the politics behind that, Boyd says.\n\n'To Sleep With Anger' (1990)\n\n\"It's really a film about a Black family in Los Angeles and one of their old friends from down South shows up unexpected and disrupts their life,\" Boyd says. \"You never see a Black family represented in such a humanistic way. It's funny, it's interesting, it's just a unique film in that it represents just a regular Black family.\" The film stars Danny Glover.\n\n'The Hate U Give' (2018)\n\n\"The Hate U Give\" is based on Angie Thomas’ 2017 young-adult novel and takes on themes of Black Lives Matter, police brutality and Black identity and puts them in the thought-provoking story of a Black girl growing up \"in a Black inner-city community and going to a white private school across town,\" Hunt says.\n\n\"It's important especially if you have young people in your home and in your family to show how early the trauma and the grief can start for some of us,\" Thompson says.\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird' (1962)\n\nThis classic tale, which won three Academy Awards, is a good place to start.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is adapted from Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name and follows the story of Atticus Finch, a white lawyer (Gregory Peck) who represents a Black man (Tom Robinson) accused of raping a white woman.\n\nMore:Books about race flying off shelves, climbing best-seller lists following the death of George Floyd, protests\n\n\"If that's the first movie that you watch, I want that kernel of rage at what happened to (Robinson) to take you through all the way to 'Boyz n the Hood' and 'Fruitvale Station,' \" Thompson says.\n\n'Malcolm X' (1992)\n\nLee's \"Malcolm X\" stars Denzel Washington as the activist and is based on Alex Haley and Malcolm X's \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X.\" The film takes you through monumental events in his life, from his criminal history to joining the Nation of Islam to his assassination.\n\n\"If you're serious about being anti-racist and an ally, consider this the foundation of your history lesson. You have to know what we've gone through and what we've overcome and what we still need to knock down to understand what's happening today,\" Thompson says.\n\n'Let the Fire Burn' (2013)\n\nBoyd recommends this documentary that depicts the police bombing of the MOVE organization (a Black liberation group) in Philadelphia in 1985..\n\nThe standoff between the organizers and Philadelphia police resulted in the death of 11 people, including children, and displaced many others.\n\nTV\n\n'Insecure' (2016)\n\nIssa Rae's hit series shows a different side of the Black experience. It follows young black professionals living in Los Angeles who navigate friendships, relationships and microaggressions in the workplace.\n\nIt's not explicitly about racism, says Hunt, but it uses South LA and Crenshaw neighborhood as a \"character of sorts.\" It also gives viewers a look at \"regular Black life,\" while naturally highlighting the reality of racial tensions that Black people face on a daily basis.\n\nMore:How Issa Rae's 'Insecure' navigates the workplace with style\n\n'The Wire' (2002)\n\nDavid Simon's \"The Wire\" got recommendations from both Hunt and Thompson, who both call it one of the best TV shows they've seen. The critically acclaimed police series stars Idris Elba, Dominic West and John Doman and tackles themes like drug wars and the education system.\n\n\"It kind of lays out structural racism, the impact of the educational system. It kind of gives you a pretty comprehensive picture of the overwhelming conditions in the Black community,\" says Hunt.\n\n'A Different World' (1987)\n\nWhile the entire series addresses race, Thompson recommends these two episodes: \"Honeymoon in LA\" (Parts 1 & 2). Whitley (Jasmine Guy) and Dwayne (Kadeem Hardison) go on their honeymoon during the Los Angeles riots in 1992 and the series shows how they experience those events in a fictional way.\n\nThis \"Cosby Show\" spinoff follows Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) as she attends a historically Black university. It also stars Jada Pinkett Smith at the start of her acting career.\n\n'Dear White People' (2017)\n\nThis Netflix series, based on Justin Simien's movie of the same name, follows a group of Black students at a predominately white university. One student, Samantha White (Logan Browning), starts a podcast directed at white students. The series explores colorism within the black community, class and activism, among other themes.\n\n\"It's a comedic and satirical look at the way Black people are viewed and the way they have to compose themselves when they're in largely white environments,\" says Hunt.\n\n'Watchmen' (2019)\n\nThe superhero comics series was adapted into a politically-relevant drama about race and the criminal justice system.\n\nMore:How HBO's 'Watchmen' embraces the political bent, bonkers spirit of seminal '80s comic\n\n\"It opens with the Tulsa race riots and it's kind of like this inciting event that frames what the characters are dealing with,\" Hunt says. \"Race and policing is a backdrop, even though it's fantastical, it's still dealing with those issues in a very allegorical way.\"\n\n'When They See Us' (2019)\n\nAva DuVernay's Netflix miniseries tells the story of the wrongful conviction of five Black and Latino teenagers (dubbed the Central Park Five) for the 1989 assault on a female jogger in New York's Central Park.\n\nAll five were exonerated in 2002 when serial rapist Matias Reyes confessed he was the sole attacker.\n\n\"It's quite revealing and actually features footage of the current president and his stance on the young Black men at the time,\" Hunt says.\n\n'Luke Cage' (2016)\n\nThe Marvel TV series stars Mike Colter, a Black man who stands up for what’s right, even when he’s being shot at and his neighbors sometimes would rather he not stir up trouble.\n\n\"Another superhero kind of fantasy show, but again it's rooted in race and set in Harlem,\" says Hunt. \"It deals with some of the issues that community has faced over the years and they kind of weave that into the narrative and why it is people do what they do.\"\n\n'Black-ish' (2014)\n\nKenya Barris' \"Black-ish\" is a more straightforward, explanatory series about race that follows an upper-middle-class Black family living in a predominately white neighborhood navigating microaggressions from fellow neighbors, colleagues and friends.\n\nThompson recommends the \"Hope\" episode if you're short on time, which is about the shooting of an unarmed Black teen.\n\n\"Watch this episode, watch 'Do the Right Thing' and it'll give you that very entry-level groundwork for what we're talking about and what we're yelling about and what we're in the streets about,\" says Thompson.\n\nContributing: Grace Hauck, Deborah Barfield Berry, Jenna Ryu, USA TODAY\n\nMore:Looking for books about racism?

Jennifer McClellan could make history in special ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nVirginia Democrats will choose a nominee on Tuesday for the special election to fill the term of the late Rep. Donald McEachin, who died in November just weeks after winning reelection.\n\nDemocrats in the 4th Congressional District are holding a “firehouse primary” – or one that’s conducted by the party organization, instead of by election officials – across a handful of pop-up voting locations in the Richmond-area district.\n\nThe nominee will enter the February general election as the favorite in what has been a reliably Democratic district, and the outcome of the election isn’t likely to affect the balance of power in the US House, which Republicans are set to control in January.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, who finished third in the 2021 gubernatorial primary, has the support of Democratic Party leaders and groups ranging from the political arm of the Congressional Progressive Caucus to the moderate-backing Democratic Majority for Israel PAC. If elected, she would be the first Black woman to represent Virginia in Congress.\n\nVirginia Sen. Tim Kaine campaigned with McClellan, a close ally whose wedding he officiated, over the weekend and members of the Commonwealth’s Democratic congressional delegation have all endorsed her, as have Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and other local officials. Democrats will not know their nominee until Wednesday, at the earliest, when the counting of ballots begins.\n\nThe coalescing around McClellan was influenced in part by the campaign of scandal-plagued state Sen. Joe Morrissey. His feuds with the party establishment may be part of his appeal among some disenchanted partisans, but his critics point to a more damaging history, including his resignation from the state House in 2014 after a misdemeanor conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor – a 17-year-old part-time staffer at his law office with whom he had sex and exchanged nude photos. He was in his mid-50s at the time, but has argued, according to a local report, that he believed the woman was 18. (Morrissey has since married the woman and they have several children.) Morrissey has also been stripped of his law license – twice – and remains disbarred following a 2019 state Supreme Court decision to uphold its revocation.\n\nMorrissey attacked the state party for holding the primary on a Tuesday instead of a Saturday, saying it would limit voter turnout. In announcing his run, Morrissey called himself a “worker bee” while highlighting his work on criminal justice reform.\n\nVirginia doesn’t have party registration, so the primary will be open to all voters in the district, provided they sign a pledge to support the Democratic nominee in the general election. Republicans chose their candidate, Leon Benjamin, in a weekend vote.\n\nBenjamin has run for the seat before, having lost to McEachin earlier this year and in 2020.\n\nUnder Virginia state law, there’s no state-run primary for this special election, so the parties are responsible for selecting their own nominees.\n\nThe district’s Democratic committee chairwoman cheered the “firehouse” voting method as a way to increase participation in the process.\n\n“A Firehouse Primary allows as many candidates and voters to participate in the democratic process as possible,” Alexsis Rodgers said. “The Fourth Congressional District Democratic Committee is committed to holding a smooth, transparent, and expedient process to select a nominee.”\n\nRepublican Gov. Glenn Youngkin last Monday set the date of the special election for February 21, creating a quick turnaround as the parties need to formally select their candidates by December 23.\n\nWith just a week to campaign, a host of Democrats jumped into the race. McClellan and Morrissey are the leading contenders, largely because state Del. Lamont Bagby decided to drop out to help clear the way for McClellan, a fellow leader of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus. Bagby’s support largely shifted to McClellan.\n\nMcClellan, who has served in the state legislature since 2006 and succeeded McEachin in the state Senate, spoke about her legislative experience and her work in the capitol with the late congressman in her announcement speech last week.\n\n“This is a bittersweet day for me as I continue to mourn a friend but hear the call to carry on his legacy and carry my servant leadership to Washington,” McClellan said.\n\nVirginia Democrats lost the governorship and the House of Delegates in 2021 and control only a very narrow majority in the state Senate. If McClellan were to win the congressional special election in February, her vacant Senate seat could weaken Democrats’ ability to block Republican bills – like potential restrictions on abortion.", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg Ethan Cohen Melissa Holzberg Depalo", "Gregory Krieg", "Ethan Cohen", "Melissa Holzberg Depalo"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/18/when-is-new-hampshire-primary-election-2024/72254188007/", "title": "New Hampshire primary election 2024: When is it?

Or maybe just \"none of these.\"\n\nConfused? You're not the only one.\n\nTens of thousands of Nevada GOP voters are discovering Trump's name is absent from the primary ballots they're receiving in the mail.\n\nInstead of running in the Feb. 6 primary, Trump is participating in party-run caucuses two days later. Only the caucus results count toward selecting the state's 26 Republican National Convention electors, but state law still requires a primary.\n\nVoters can participate in both contests but candidates had to pick one or the other.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nNevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar said even his own friends are calling him up to complain, though his office has been alerting voters about the dueling contests for months, sending out postcards, posting signs and speaking to the media.\n\n\"It's one of those things where people aren't paying attention until now,\" he said. \"I don't know what else we could do.\"\n\nWhy does Nevada have both a caucus and a primary election?\n\nNormally, states hold either government-run primary elections or party-run caucuses, but not both.\n\nUnder a 2021 state law, Nevada is required to hold presidential primary elections as long as there are at least two candidates for a party's nomination.\n\nBut Republican Party officials ‒ many of whom participated in a 2020 effort to subvert the presidential election results in Trump's favor ‒ decided last year to hold a binding caucus. They also tried unsuccessfully to stop the state from holding the primary.\n\n\"Why is there a caucus? Because the state Republican Party thinks that will help Trump,\" said Dan Lee, an associate professor of political science at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.\n\nWhat did the Nevada Republican Party say about having caucuses?\n\nIn a statement, the Nevada GOP said it considered the primary election a waste of taxpayer dollars, and that party business should be funded and conducted by the party itself. Caucus supporters say they're the best way to test a candidate's appeal to the party faithful and require candidates to demonstrate they can organize and turn out voters.\n\n\"Simply put, candidates who participate in an illegitimate process cannot expect to earn legitimate delegates to the Republican National Convention,\" the party said.\n\nTo learn more:When is the next presidential election? Everything to know about Election Day 2024.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis was participating in the caucuses until he dropped out earlier this month, while former Vice President Mike Pence chose to run in the primary until he dropped out at the end of October. Like Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator who also ended his campaign, Pence will still appear on the primary ballot because the ballots were finalized before he quit the race.\n\nHow are the Nevada caucuses and primary different?\n\nBecause party officials get to set their own caucus rules, Nevada GOP officials are requiring in-person participation and ID verification at the caucuses, which they argue provides better election security and saves taxpayer funds.\n\nIn a taxpayer-funded primary election, run by Aguilar's office and county clerks, voters can cast their ballots by mail or in person. It's also open to military members serving overseas.\n\nAguilar said primary elections are typically considered more inclusive than caucuses because more voters can participate, instead of only those able to attend on Feb. 8. And it's typically easier for a candidate to qualify for the primary ballot.\n\nWhy did Haley decide to run in the Nevada primary?\n\nBecause Trump supporters control the Nevada GOP, Haley never stood a chance of winning the caucuses, which tend to draw the most die-hard party supporters, Lee said. Instead, Haley likely hopes she'll win enough votes in the primary to show she has broad support.\n\nAlso, candidates who wanted to participate in the caucus had to pay the state party $55,000 or host a fundraiser on its behalf, making it an expensive proposition for candidates lacking Trump's massive fundraising apparatus.\n\n\"In these early states, it's not about winning delegates per se. We're all small states, so it's about setting, or meeting and exceeding expectations to help build momentum,\" Lee said. \"It's easier to cast a wider net by running in the primary ‒ she was doing it to try to build a narrative, to display her support among primary voters. Early on in the race, everyone is just trying to be the runner-up to Trump.\"\n\nWhat are Republicans saying about the dueling Nevada caucus and primary?\n\nGov. Joe Lombardo and Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony have both said they plan to caucus for Trump and vote for \"none of these candidates\" in the primary.\n\nTrump is set to visit Las Vegas on Saturday for a \" commit to caucus\" rally.\n\nGiven the situation, Lee, the UNLV professor, said it's possible Haley could lose the primary even though Trump isn't in it: \"It could be the case that 'none of these candidates' gets the most votes.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/11/07/election-day-2023-live-updates/71408643007/", "title": "2023 election replay: Ohio backs abortion measure, Democrats win ...", "text": "Americans from coast to coast voted in Tuesday's off-year election, making their voices heard on controversial ballot measures, competitive governor's races and more.\n\nDemocrats won several victories Tuesday night, after Kentucky Gov.

The deciding seat was called just before midnight Tuesday.\n\nTheir success means Youngkin will have an uphill battle with his proposed 15-week abortion limit, which Democrats in the state already blocked in January. Candidates on the left made abortion a top campaign message in 2023, and the final outcome could be a bellwether for 2024.\n\nHeather Williams, interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Monday that Democrats would consider winning just one chamber “a huge win.”\n\n“With this victory, Gov. Youngkin has been denied a governing trifecta and our newly elected majority stands ready to defend Virginia from Republican extremism,” Williams said in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\nThe House of Delegates majority has yet to be called, though Democrats currently lead in that chamber as well.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMember of ‘Central Park Five’ elected to NYC council\n\nYusef Salaam, one of the \"Central Park Five\" who was exonerated for a 1989 attack on a jogger, won election Tuesday to be a member of the New York City Council.

Officials aim to earn your trust in 2024\n\nWASHINGTON − Ahead of another election cycle that is already shaping up to be contentious, federal and state election officials are in the midst of campaigns of their own to reassure wary voters about the integrity of casting their ballots.\n\nThey are recruiting poll workers, certifying voting machines and hosting lessons on how election systems work in community centers, classrooms and libraries.\n\nThe steps are needed, experts say, to restore voters' confidence in a system that, despite some flaws and outspoken election deniers, was mostly trustworthy and secure in the first place.\n\nThose fraud claims, in part, gave rise to calls for major overhauls of election systems in some states led mostly by Republican lawmakers. Some, particularly voters of color, were already skeptical of a system with a history of discrimination that hasn't always been open to them. New laws to restrict access has fueled that mistrust, experts said.\n\nMuch of the work of assuring voters will fall to local elections officials, experts said. Americans have more trust in their local election systems, which they’re more familiar with, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\n\"People know their local election officials. They know when they go to city or town hall that they trust the people that work there,'' said Rob Rock, Rhode Island's deputy secretary of state. \"It's really important to make sure that people understand the process.''\n\n–Deborah Barfield Berry and Terry Collins\n\nRead the story:Fearful of voter fraud?

Michelle Lujan Grisham, said it was \"very unlikely\" those orders would not be extended past April, since New Mexico health officials expect cases of COVID-19 to peak in the state sometime in May.\n\nIn the event that in-person voting moved forward, Chávez and Bosson asked how voters and poll workers would be kept safe while operating in an environment requiring election judges, poll workers, and translation services, and whether personal protective gear or disinfectant would be made available.\n\nMore: COVID-19: Petition seeks release of New Mexico prisoners\n\nDylan Lange, counsel for Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, told the court that no more than five people would be present at a service center, allowing for physical distancing and limiting the number of people interacting at any time.\n\nGretchen Elsner, representing the Democratic Party of New Mexico, argued that — unlike the November general election — the relief sought by county clerks would not extend an advantage to one of New Mexico's three major parties over any other.\n\nNew Mexico is a closed party state, meaning voters must be affiliated with a political party in order to participate in primaries.\n\nProceeding with normal election procedures during a pandemic, on the other hand, would be a violation of voters' rights, Elsner argued.\n\nNakamura wondered why delaying New Mexico's primary, as other states have done, was not a better option for preserving voters' rights without having to divert from the election code. Lange replied that Toulouse Oliver's office regarded that alternative as a more significant disruption than simply mailing absentee ballots to voters.\n\nCoronavirus : New Mexico sees five more deaths from COVID-19\n\nNew Mexico enacted a law in 2018 requiring that all special elections be conducted by mailed ballot. Five other states conduct all of their elections by mail, with Oregon being the first state to transition entirely to voting by mail in 2000.\n\nA unanimous ruling\n\nThe justices recessed shortly before 4 p.m. and, after deliberating nearly 2 hours, ruled that the election code specifically prohibited mailing ballots to voters for the primary election, but there was no prohibition against mailing applications for absentee ballots to registered voters.\n\nNakamura noted that, since in-person voting poses a \"substantial health risk\" in light of the pandemic, absentee voting would be the preferred method for voters to exercise their franchise.\n\nThe court announced it would order county clerks to mail those applications to voters, and that any in-person voting would need to comply with the governor's executive orders and the DOH's public health orders.\n\nDemocrats, Republicans react to ruling\n\nIn a statement following the ruling, state Democratic Party chair Marg Elliston accused the GOP of attempting to suppress the vote and putting poll workers' health at risk.\n\n\"We will continue to do everything possible to help our fellow New Mexicans make their voices heard, including encouraging voters to fill out their absentee ballot applications,\" she said.\n\nMore: Why hospital staff is being reduced amid pandemic\n\nThe state GOP, on the other hand, said the ruling will \"protect the health and wellness of voters across New Mexico while preserving the integrity of the election.\"\n\n“This decision by the Court ensures that the health and safety of every voter and worker is protected, while making sure that our election will not be susceptible to fraud,” GOP chairman Steve Pearce wrote in a statement. “We are pleased that the Justices recognized this and that we can proceed with a fair and free election in a safe environment.”\n\nDoña Ana County Clerk responds\n\nMinutes after the ruling, Doña Ana County Clerk Amanda López Askin was somber but said elections would proceed in accordance with the high court's decision.\n\n\"I can comfortably say that not just myself but 27 clerks across the state are deeply disappointed,\" López Askin said. \"However, we respect the Supreme Court's decision and we will move forward in administering the election as we have been advised to; and are hopeful that people will really turn to absentee voting to exercise their constitutional right to vote.\"\n\nDoña Ana County was the focus of widespread attention in the 2018 elections when a higher than usual number of absentee ballots determined the outcome of an election for New Mexico's second congressional district.\n\nSince that election, López Askin said that legislation passed in 2019 allowed county clerks to begin processing and verifying absentee ballots as early as 14 days before election day when the county receives more than 10,000 applications for absentee ballots.\n\nThe challenge for June 2, she said, was that her office would now be responsible for staffing voting locations while complying with public health guidance regarding COVID-19 contagion, including keeping poll workers and county staff safe.\n\nStory continues below\n\nMeanwhile, she said the absentee ballot process required additional steps of her office and of voters.\n\n\"There's the initial mailing of the application, the voter completing the application correctly, returning it to us, and then us issuing a ballot which would then require them to return it to us correctly,\" she said.\n\nLópez Askin encouraged voters to visit http://www.NMVote.org to verify their registration and request an absentee ballot online.\n\nAlgernon D'Ammassa can be reached at 575-541-5451, adammassa@lcsun-news.com or @AlgernonWrites on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/18/how-do-caucuses-primary-elections-work/72244264007/", "title": "How do caucuses and primaries work? Presidential nomination ...", "text": "The 2024 election season kicked off last week with a frost-bitten start as Iowa Republicans headed to their caucus in freezing weather. Former President Donald Trump cruised to a notably early and wide victory, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis narrowly edged out Nikki Haley for second place. In another twist, DeSantis dropped out of the race less than 48 hours before the New Hampshire primary.\n\nThe contest, which has the power to reshape a presidential race, is just one of several caucuses held throughout the election. But what makes a caucus different from a primary? And how does a primary end up ultimately factoring into the general election?\n\nUSA TODAY is answering all your questions about how the country votes and why it matters.\n\nHow do primaries work?\n\nThe primary elections, a precursor to the general contest, help determine which candidates will be nominated by their respective parties to battle it out in November for the White House.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nVoters are not directly electing a candidate, however. They're choosing delegates that will represent them at the national party conventions, which are set to take place this summer.\n\nEach state is given a specific number of delegates. Some states have a winner-take-all system, meaning the candidate with the most votes in a given primary gets all the delegates.\n\nOther states, however, opt to split up the delegates by the percentage of votes each candidate receives. That's known as proportional allocation. The mathematical details of that division can vary by state and party.\n\nThe Republican National Committee mandates that states with elections before March 15 use the proportional allocation method and allows for states to establish a minimum percentage of the vote up to 20% for a candidate to receive delegates.\n\nWho's running for president in 2024?Every remaining Republican and Democrat\n\nHow do the conventions work?\n\nAfter Americans vote in primaries and caucuses across the country, delegates head to the party conventions.\n\nDelegates are generally tied to a certain candidate ahead of a party's convention. That's because voters, through primaries and caucuses, have already reflected which candidate they want the delegate to support.\n\nOn the GOP side, a small number of states allow for \"unbound\" delegates, who can cast a vote as they choose. On the Democratic side, there are also \"unpledged\" delegates, but they don't participate in the first round of voting if it is a contested convention − one in which no candidate has a majority of delegates going into the event.\n\nIf a candidate fails to secure a majority on the first round of voting at a convention, it becomes known as a \"brokered convention.\" In this rare case, the convention moves to additional rounds of voting, where rules for delegates can change.\n\nWhat about an open vs. closed primary?\n\nIf a state has an open primary, voters cast ballots for whichever candidate they prefer, regardless of party registration. A Republican can vote for a Democrat and vice versa.\n\nA partially open primary allows voters to jump the party line, but they must first publicly declare new party affiliation.\n\nIn a closed primary, voters can choose only among the candidates running in their registered party. A partially closed primary allows a political party to decide before each election cycle whether voters not affiliated with any party can cast a ballot for their party's nomination.\n\nCalifornia and Washington use a \"top two\" format, in which all candidates are listed together, and the two receiving the most votes move on to the general elections. Alaska uses the same system but with the top four candidates.\n\nPrimary vs. caucus\n\nWhile a primary election is run by state and local governments, a caucus is run by political parties. A traditional primary election resembles the general election, with voting via private ballot.\n\nA caucus, however, involves voters dividing themselves into groups based on the candidate they prefer and arguing for others to join them. At the end of the caucus, the number of members in each group determines how many delegates that candidate gets.\n\nWhich states have a caucus?\n\nThe number of states that hold caucuses is much smaller than the number of states that opt for a primary. In some states, the type of contest varies based on party.\n\nDemocratic caucuses:\n\nIowa\n\nWyoming\n\nIdaho\n\nVirgin Islands\n\nGuam\n\nRepublican caucuses:\n\nIowa\n\nNevada\n\nVirgin Islands\n\nIdaho\n\nMissouri\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nAlaska\n\nUtah\n\nHawaii\n\nWhen is the primary in my state?\n\nThe primary schedule can get confusing, especially as the election cycle heats up.\n\nFor a rundown on when voting begins in your state, check out our rundown on the Republican and Democratic primary schedules.\n\nWhich House seats are up for election?:Races to watch in 2024\n\nJust Curious for more?

The date also means candidates vying for the New Hampshire’s 22 delegates have less than 10 weeks to win over its historically independent-minded voters.\n\nFor some onlookers, the announcement comes as little surprise. New Hampshire is required by state law to hold that first-in-the-nation primary, and, after Iowa Republicans announced in June their Jan. 15 caucus, many predicted New Hampshire would hold its primary a week later.\n\n“New Hampshire has held the first-in-the-nation presidential primary election for over 100 years,” Scanlan said Wednesday. “In today's society, it seems that we're quick to eliminate traditions and ignore them. But years from the people of this country will really be glad we still have this one.”\n\nA Democratic shuffle\n\nWhile not unexpected, Scanlan’s decision does put the last nail in the coffin for Granite State Democrats in their battle with the Democratic National Committee over its reshuffled primary calendar.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nLast year, in a move to elevate more diverse voters, the DNC ripped New Hampshire of its first-in-the-nation status, forcing the state party to move its primary to Feb. 6, on the same day as Nevada, or risk losing critical delegates. The updated calendar also moved South Carolina's Democratic primary to Feb. 3, ahead of New Hampshire and three weeks before the Palmetto State's Feb. 24 GOP contest.\n\nNew Hampshire’s GOP-run legislature has refused to change the state’s election laws to accommodate the DNC, and Scanlan previously said there was “no chance” he would break the state's tradition of going first.\n\nNow that the primary date officially defies the DNC calendar, New Hampshire Democrats are likely to lose many of their 2024 delegates to the national convention, and so will any candidate who participates in the election.\n\nThat includes Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who launched a longshot bid challenging President Joe Biden last month in New Hampshire, despite warnings that he would not be eligible to win delegates in the state.\n\nBiden opted not to file in New Hampshire, citing the potential penalties. As a result, his supporters in the state have launch a write-in campaign, urging Democrats and independents, who can cast a ballot in either party primary, to vote for the president anyway.\n\nNew Hampshire's Democratic Party will not be involved in the write-in effort. After Scanlan's announcement, Party Chair Ray Buckley addressed the legacy of first-in-the-nation in a statement, saying: \"For more than 100 years, presidential candidates of both parties have come to the Granite State time and again because, no matter who they are, where they come from or how much money they have, they know they will get a fair shot from Granite Staters.\"\n\nChoosing the date\n\nScanlan, a Republican, previously told USA TODAY he was intentionally waiting to announce the date of the primary until after the filing window closed Oct. 27, because of the state's dispute with the DNC.\n\nHe also likely wanted to ensure other states did not pre-empt New Hampshire’s contest, said Jim Splaine, a longtime New Hampshire politico and sponsor of the law mandating the state's first-place status.\n\n\"He could wait another month if he needed to,\" Splaine said. \"But he's patiently waited ... checking with the other states to make they aren't going to play hopscotch with their dates.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Scanlan expressed concern over Iowa Democrats’ proposal to use absentee ballots in their caucuses – a move he argued would effectively turn the format into a primary.\n\nThose worries were alleviated in October when Iowa Democrats announced they would comply with the new Democratic calendar, which also stripped them of their early-voting position. Democrats in the Hawkeye State will begin mailing presidential preference cards to voters Jan. 12 but will wait to announce the results until March 5, or Super Tuesday.\n\nWhile Iowa Democrats plan to hold in-person meetings on Jan. 15, the same day Republicans caucus in the state, all their presidential voting will occur exclusively through the mail, the party said.\n\nScanlan last month described the plan as a “positive” step toward “preserving the traditional positions of the Iowa Caucuses and New Hampshire Presidential Primary.”\n\nA sprint to the finish\n\nWith the primary date officially set, the countdown begins for candidates and election officials alike who will spend the next two months furiously preparing for a smooth election day.\n\nThis year, 24 candidates will appear on the New Hampshire GOP ballot – including the qualifiers for the third GOP debate last week and a slew of smaller contenders. Republicans like former Vice President Mike Pence and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who filed to appear on the ballot but dropped out before the contest, could also pick up votes.\n\nOn the Democratic side, voters will have 21 candidates to choose from, including Phillips.\n\nBut the candidates don't appear phased by the now fast-approaching primary deadline. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said the date “doesn’t really matter” after a town hall last week.\n\n“No one's been here more than me,” Christie, who announced his campaign at Saint Anselm College, said. “It’s not like I'm running out of time to make an impression.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/03/24/kansas-could-have-state-backed-presidential-primary-in-2024-donald-trump-ron-desantis/70041194007/", "title": "Kansas could have state-backed presidential primary in 2024", "text": "With a potentially contentious 2024 race for the Republican presidential nomination waiting in the wings, lawmakers and party officials are considering whether to authorize a rare presidential primary in the state, a move that hasn't happened in Kansas in decades.\n\nLegislation to allow for the one-time, state-funded primary is being considered in the Statehouse, with prominent Republicans and, potentially, the state Democratic Party on board with the idea.\n\nKansas Republican Party Chair Mike Brown, elected last month on anti-establishment platform, didn't weigh in on the bill during a hearing Thursday and didn't return a phone call seeking comment.\n\nMore:Amid tensions, Kansas Republican Party departs from status quo to tap Mike Brown as chair\n\n\"I think democracy is worth the cost,\" Helen Van Etten, Brown's vanquished rival in the race for state GOP chair, told the Senate Federal and State Affairs Committee.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSuch a move would be a departure from tradition in Kansas. Only twice in the past 45 years have state and local election officers administered a presidential primary.\n\nInstead, Kansas has held caucuses in recent years, which are organized and funded by the state's main political parties, rather than state government and take on a slightly different format than a primary election.\n\nDemocrats in 2020 conducted their election entirely by mail ballot during the COVID-19 pandemic and also used ranked-choice voting. Republicans opted not to hold a caucus at all amid former President Donald Trump's re-election bid.\n\nBut while proponents of the idea believe it will make voting in the primaries more accessible, the idea carries a multimillion dollar price tag.\n\nAnd some questions the wisdom of a state funded election that would only benefit voters registered with a particular political party.\n\n\"There is so much potential for looking at this,\" said Davis Hammet, executive director of the voter engagement group Loud Light. \"But how this bill is designed is just very problematic and, I think, irresponsible and, as written, is essentially a $5 million bailout of the Republican Party.\"\n\nHopes are a Kansas presidential primary would improve voter turnout\n\nPresidential primaries present a fundamentally different arrangement than partisan primaries, where Kansans are used to selecting their party's pick for Congressional, statewide and legislative races.\n\nUnder a state-funded primary, the state would administer the election and then hand the final results off to one or both of the two major political parties, who will calculate the number of delegates that the various candidates would receive at their conventions.\n\nUnder a 1981 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, states can't order parties to conduct a primary. Accordingly, the bill allows Democrats and Republicans to opt to retain the current caucus model.\n\nMore:2024 presidential race looms. Here's how Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo are polling in Kansas.\n\nBut allowing state and local election officials to handle the primary could result in a more accurate vote count, as well as a higher turnout, experts say. Many counties, including Shawnee, only have one Republican caucus site, meaning a flood of GOP voters descend on that location, leading to potentially long waits.\n\nWhile caucuses are confined to a narrow timeframe on a set day, a primary election would have a wider window for ballots to be cast and would also allow for advanced in-person or mail voting.\n\nIn 2016, three-and-a-half times as many voters participated in the August GOP primary election as in their presidential caucus held in March, despite the fact that the party had a competitive race for the presidential nomination at the time.\n\nDavid Soffer, a former GOP legislative candidate and Orthodox Jew, noted that many religions could not participate at the typical caucus time, held at midday on Saturday.\n\n\"For our community, it is important that we are able to vote,\" he said.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of cost.\n\nUnder the previous system, parties would have to bear the cost of organizing their caucuses or primaries. For Democrats, that expense in 2020 was nearly $800,000 and Kansas Democratic Party Chair Jeanna Repass said it would likely only rise in 2024.\n\nThe party, she added, is currently planning on holding a primary, with at least one candidate, Marianne Williamson, announcing plans to challenge President Joe Biden. Repass said she is open to the bill, though she wants to see what the final version of the legislation might look like.\n\n\"At this point, I genuinely believe it is more important to functionally hold a primary,\" Repass said in an interview. \"What I would like to do is see where the committee lands.\"\n\nIs a presidential primary worth the money for Kansas?\n\nBut Bob Beatty, professor of political science at Washburn University, said there was a reasonable counter-argument that conducting a primary with state backing wouldn't be the best bang for taxpayers' buck.\n\nThe election would fall on March 19, when the presidential election might well be decided. An earlier date is difficult, as the parties restrict states that don't historically have early primaries or caucuses from doing so.\n\n\"The calculations were if Kansas is doing this in March, which it usually was, it's a waste of money because it's just not going to have much of an impact\" Beatty said. \"So, in terms of states getting value for their money in terms of candidate visits and all that sort of thing, the earlier the better because there's always a chance the nomination is sewn up early.\"\n\nThe exact cost is unknown, but Clay Barker, deputy assistant secretary of state, said it was a multimillion dollar price tag. Further complicating matters is that many counties have already formulated a budget for 2024 — minus the cost of an additional election.\n\nIndependent voters would not be able to vote in the primary and unaffiliated residents would not be able to declare an affiliation on Election Day, as they can currently in other primaries.\n\nThe 2024 presidential primary would also include a number of changes from how elections are typically run, including the elimination of the three-day post-election window for advanced ballots to arrive at the county elections office.\n\nAnd Hammet, of Loud Light, said it was wrong for lawmakers to consider such a major change to election administration with only a couple of weeks remaining in the legislative session.\n\n\"That should be a serious conversation,\" he said. \"That should have begun at the beginning of the year, not on a tight timeframe.\"\n\nA competing proposal from Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, would hold the presidential primary on the same day as state and local primary races, likely at some point in May or June.\n\nCaucuses could raise questions about election integrity, Tyson said, but she argued her plan made the most sense to save the additional costs on taxpayers.\n\n\"We'd be saving taxpayer money and being frugal and making it easily accessible every election,\" Tyson said.\n\nThe legislation comes as lawmakers have considered a range of bills to restrict voting, such as permanently ending the three-day window for mail ballots to arrive and banning ballot drop boxes.\n\nMore:Kansas lawmakers advance bills to restrict ballot drop boxes, mail voting amid GOP split\n\nRick Piepho, the Harvey County clerk, was neutral on the bill, though he questioned whether counties would ultimately be reimbursed for their costs.\n\nBut he found it ironic that legislators who had cast doubt on the integrity of election administration in Kansas now wanted those same officials to handle the presidential primary.\n\n\"It does make sense that you want to use the trained election officials to do (the presidential primary),\" he said. \"But there is some irony that we have been under attack and our systems have been under attack and they want to use those systems for this.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/06/29/arizona-voting-laws-face-challenges-court-primary-election-nears/7751254001/", "title": "Arizona voting laws face challenges in court as primary election nears", "text": "Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this article misstated how ballots missing signatures previously were \"cured\" and misstated the number of elections voters have to miss to initiate removal from the Active Early Voting List.\n\nLawsuits that could result in last-minute changes to how Arizona elections are conducted await rulings as the voting season nears.\n\nOne challenge was partially resolved in a ruling last week, when a federal judge rejected a challenge to a new law that shortens the time voters have to verify their signature on mail-in ballots.\n\nBut three other prominent cases, including a challenge that the vote-by-mail system is unconstitutional, are still in the courts with no resolution, even as early ballots have been mailed to overseas voters and as the Aug. 2 primary nears.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}]}

Preliminary estimates predict jaw-dropping state budget holes that some education funding experts warn could cost in the range of 300,000 teaching jobs.\n\nBack-to-school poll:1 in 5 teachers are unlikely to return to reopened classrooms\n\nDistricts are scrambling to respond to a double whammy: a reduction in money from states and an increase in costs to operate safely as the pandemic wears on.\n\n\"It's a major challenge,\" said Gerald Hill, superintendent of West Bloomfield. \"We have increased costs due to social distancing, due to all of the (personal protective equipment), due to unusual transportation requirements and additional deep cleaning requirements. If we’re cut by 20%, but it’s costing us 20% more to operate, we’re at a 40% cost difference.\"\n\nA $3 trillion House bill backed by Democrats in early May included nearly $1 trillion for states and local governments, but Republicans are balking. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday lawmakers would decide in the next few weeks whether there would be another relief bill, according to CNBC. Even if there is, McConnell signaled it would have to be narrower in scope than what the House passed.\n\nTime is running out; many state and school district fiscal years begin July 1. Around the country, school boards and grassroots groups pressure lawmakers to send more stabilization funds before then.\n\n\"Schools are instrumental to restarting the economy,\" Hill said. \"It makes very little logical sense to delay another round of funding.\"\n\nFunding may drop up to 30%\n\nBecause states and school districts can't pass budgets that aren't balanced – unlike the federal government, which can operate with a deficit – school leaders are preparing for dramatic cuts to staff and services in the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nWhen schools reopen:Scheduled days home, more online learning, lots of hand-washing\n\nMichigan expects a $3.2 billion state budget shortfall, including a $1.1 billion deficit in the school aid fund, Hill said. That could translate to a $700 drop in the roughly $9,200 West Bloomfield receives per student this year – and potentially another $700 drop next year if there's no federal intervention.\n\n\"I've been in education for 50 years, and I have never seen this level of financial complication,\" Hill said.\n\nThough the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act passed at the end of March included $13.5 billion for school district budgets, that money could be used only for costs related to the pandemic, not to plug budget holes.\n\nWest Bloomfield received $253,000 for its 5,700 students. The money helped pay for a new computer system to aid with online instruction.\n\nMore money went to high-poverty districts. On average, school districts nationwide got about $286 per student, said Michael Griffith, a senior researcher at the Learning Policy Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that provides research on education.\n\nDistricts will need $230 billion – and up to $305 billion – to stabilize their budgets and avoid massive layoffs, according to Griffith's calculations.\n\nConsider: In the recession that started around 2008, K-12 schools received $64 billion in federal aid, about five times as much as they've seen for the pandemic, Griffith said. Revenue, which dropped about 8.6% during the Great Recession, is predicted to plummet as much as 15% to 30% this time.\n\nCoronavirus act funding:How does it compare with 9/11, financial crisis recovery bills?\n\nEven with the higher level of federal aid during the recession, the nation saw losses of about 120,000 K-12 teaching jobs, Griffith said, setting up the possibility of even greater job losses this time.\n\n\"Without additional federal dollars, we’re going to see pretty massive cuts,\" Griffith said. \"If schools get nothing more (from the federal government) than the CARES Act now, we could see two to three times that loss in teaching positions.\"\n\nPressure on lawmakers to act\n\nAcross the country, school boards are passing resolutions that call on federal lawmakers to support a new round of money for schools, and community groups also sound alarms.\n\nIn Philadelphia, where the school system projects a $38 million shortfall, district leaders encourage state residents to contact state and local lawmakers each Thursday with calls and letters to maintain funding for schools.\n\nMore than 60 superintendents of large districts signed a letter calling for an additional $200 billion in federal relief for K-12 schools.\n\n\"I think it’s political suicide for congressional Republicans and the Trump administration to not provide more aid to state and local governments,\" said Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education policy think tank in Washington.\n\nAfter all, Petrilli said, an election is coming up, so another relief bill is likely; what's uncertain is how much will be in it for schools.\n\n\"There’s no guarantee federal money is coming through or how big it’s going to be, so it’s smart to plan for cuts,\" Petrilli said.\n\nRick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said that to some degree, districts always want more money. He said it's important to watch what safeguards are attached to any new federal money, such as requiring districts to prove that they're actually using it to bolster instruction.\n\n\"I think there's a legit case that some new funds are needed,\" he said. \"But what is the public getting for its money?\"\n\nHula hoops and pool noodles:Reopened Montana school offers peek at what fall might bring\n\nStates face biggest hits\n\nStates that rely heavily on sales taxes will be hit hard by the crisis. Griffith said he worries about states that rely on declining oil revenue. New Mexico, for example, projects cuts to its state budget of 22% to 32%.\n\nFlorida was among a number of states that passed a budget before the pandemic hit, which means lawmakers will have to adjust it to account for cratering sales tax revenue. Florida doesn't collect income tax, and sales taxes are usually bolstered by a thriving tourism industry. But after Disney World, Universal Studios and cruise lines shut down, that money dried up.\n\nIn April, sales tax collections in Florida were down by $598 million – or 24% below expectations, according to a state report. That makes up the largest part of the budget and provides most of the money for education in the state.\n\nIn Broward County Public Schools – Florida's second-largest school district with more than 268,000 students – analysts are preparing scenarios for accommodating a 10%, 15% or 20% cut in money from the state. District officials worry they could look at a $146 million shortfall.\n\n\"As a school system in one year, we’ve never experienced a $146 million budget cut,\" said John Sullivan, Broward's director of legislative affairs.\n\nThat figure looms despite $30 million in savings achieved through a hiring freeze on 134 positions, cutting all department budgets by 10% and eliminating all travel. Some of that is the kind of budget tightening districts pursue nearly every year. Other measures, such as the hiring freeze in Broward County, are in response to financial worries brought on by the coronavirus.\n\nMost districts don’t have the flexibility to deal with these financial headwinds, not after having to race to put together feeding and online instructional programs for students no longer attending school, said Michael Casserly, head of the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents large, urban districts.\n\n\"The combination of that leanness plus the unexpected costs they're having to incur is a perfect storm in combination with these expected revenue shortfalls,\" Casserly said. \"I don’t know how Congress or anyone else expects us to handle this through the usual cost-cutting.\"\n\nBack-to-school costs: $20M for masks\n\nIn Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine announced the need to cut $775 million from schools, universities, Medicaid and state government offices to balance the state's budget by the end of the month. Those cuts include $300 million from what would usually be sent to schools.\n\nLike many districts, Ohio's must spend more money on certain pandemic-related items. Columbus City Schools officials predict they'll need to spend an additional $20 million this year on disposable face masks for students and staff, $10 million on hand sanitizer and $25 million on more computers so every child can connect to their studies from home on specified days.\n\n\"As we add these theoretical numbers up, we’re getting into the hundreds of millions – and that’s not even addressing what’s happening with teaching and learning,\" said Scott Wortman, spokesman for Columbus City Schools.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed cutting 8% of what school districts got last year under the state funding formula – totaling about $6.4 billion, according to EdSource, an education news site.\n\nIn response, superintendents from six of California's largest districts warned Newsom and lawmakers that they may not be able to open on time if the governor's proposed cuts go through.\n\n\"The notion that schools can continue to operate safely in the fall with a decreased state budget is not realistic,\" the letter said. \"We cannot in good conscience risk the health and safety of our students and staff by returning to the classroom prematurely and without funding for the necessary precautions given the continued lack of a national testing program and a lack of clear understanding of the impacts of coronavirus on young people.\"\n\nEducation coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

That means the state cut, while detrimental to every district, would be disastrous to Rochester, because the state money represents a higher proportion of RCSD's operational funds when compared to other districts.\n\nRCSD estimated a potential effect of more than $130 million in the current school year. By comparison, it had to cut $81 million from the 2020-21 budget last year in perhaps its most challenging budget season ever.\n\nIn response, Superintendent Lesli Myers-Small announced an immediate 20% cut to its own budget. No details on the cuts have been released, but such a reduction could only be accomplished with school closures and hundreds of layoffs.\n\n“It’s not cutting to the bone; there’s no more skin, no more fat, no more bone,\" School Board President Van White said. \"We’re cutting to the marrow now. ... We cannot tell people we can cut another 20% and everything will be OK.\"\n\nUsing New York state's basic measure of total district spending, a 20% cut would actually mean a 21% cut in RCSD's overall budget. In Pittsford and Brighton, meanwhile, it would mean a budget cut of less than 5%.\n\nIf the 20% cut were kept in place throughout the 2020-21 school year — an unlikely scenario, but not implausible — RCSD's per-pupil spending would be lower than that of 10 other Monroe County districts including wealthy ones like Pittsford, Brighton, Honeoye Falls-Lima and Penfield.\n\n\"These cuts are going to affect all our students (in Monroe County),\" Rochester school board member Amy Maloy said. \"But with the bulk of our funding coming from state aid and 20% is getting cut — I don't think it's rocket science to see the effect that's going to have.\n\n\"It comes down to an unfair formula for funding our urban districts. And it's tragic.\"\n\nOther districts have not yet reacted as drastically as Rochester. That is in part because the effect will not be as pronounced, and in part because they have fund balances to buy them time and RCSD does not.\n\nGreece, for example, stands to lose about $100 million, or 11% of its budget. Assistant Superintendent of Finance Romeo Colilli said the district can wait until early October before beginning \"serious discussions\" about cuts.\n\nInequitable effects of COVID\n\nThe pending 20% reduction in state aid is just one of several ways in which COVID-19 and the resulting fiscal stress has fallen most heavily on New York school districts serving the most vulnerable students.\n\nRochester and Buffalo have both announced they will start the school year fully remote, the result of daunting logistics across dozens of schools as well as increased health risk for the mostly Black and Latino students they serve.\n\nThat decision led RCSD to lay off more than 100 paraprofessionals this week. Superintendent Lesli Myers-Small said it was because their jobs in prekindergarten classes would not be supported through state funding, though the state did not confirm that.\n\nRCSD dedicated a great deal of energy in the spring and summer to distributing thousands of computers and internet hot spots to students and providing hundreds of thousands of meals, the consequence of a child poverty rate over 50% in the city. Suburban districts did not face the same magnitude of challenge.\n\nRochester students are at a disadvantage in online learning as well. Thousands of them experience homelessness during the year and a disproportionate number have disabilities, adding an extra layer of difficulty.\n\nParents in Rochester are less likely to be able to work from home and help teach their children; they are more likely to be classified as \"essential workers\" in health care or service industry jobs that increase their risk of contracting the virus.\n\n\"This crisis, as with everything in public education in the city, is really a community crisis,\" said Stephanie Townsend, Director of Research and Analytics for ROC the Future. \"It is not simply up to the district to solve this.\"\n\nROC the Future's member organizations have met to think of \"tangible supports\" to offer city children, Townsend said, particularly around providing safe places for students to do their work, including at city libraries.\n\nAdvocates react\n\nSeveral statewide educational groups called on Gov. Andrew Cuomo this week to raise taxes in order to blunt the effect on urban districts in particular.\n\n\"Rochester is only the first district to announce the consequences of New York State withholding aid; districts across the state are facing the same impossible calculations right now,\" Alliance for Quality Education Executive Director Jasmine Gripper said in a statement.\n\nThe state Education Department and Board of Regents, meanwhile, directed their lobbying at the federal government.\n\n\"Such a large cut is untenable and would have long-term negative consequences for our children with the biggest impact on our Black and Latino families, children and low-income communities,\" they wrote in a statement.\n\nThe existing disparity in Greater Rochester was reinforced Thursday with the release of an updated \"Hard Facts\" report by ACT Rochester.\n\nThe report traces persistent inequality in all areas of life for non-white residents, with education among the most prominent.\n\n\"For every deficit indicator – poor health, poverty, unemployment, rent burdens – African Americans and Latinos have rates that are meaningfully higher than Whites,\" the report found. \"For every asset measure – educational testing results, income, and homeownership – African Americans and Latinos have outcomes that often are dramatically lower than Whites. ...

But his remarks were met with contempt from some members of Congress.\n\n“It’s your fault!” several Republicans shouted.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nBiden says VA working to end 'the silent scourge of suicide'\n\nBiden said when he first appointed Denis McDonough to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, the country was losing up to 25 veterans a day to “the silent scourge of suicide,” and continues to lose 17 per day.\n\n“The VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need,”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nMilitary suicide:Amid suicide crisis, the Army says it will rush mental health providers to Alaska\n\nBiden calls for higher teacher pay\n\nBiden hasn't touched much on education issues during the address but did take a moment to outline several priorities on that front. Among them: expanding access to preschool and raising teacher pay.\n\nIn 2021, teachers made less than 77 cents on the dollar compared with other college graduates. Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far. In some states teachers make less than $50,000 on average.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nTeacher shortage:Amid crippling teacher shortages, some schools are turning to unorthodox solutions\n\nBiden urges lawmakers to protect abortion rights\n\nBiden called on lawmakers to “restore” abortion rights after the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.\n\n“The vice president and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient safety,” Biden said, noting that states across the country have implemented abortion bans and restrictions.\n\n“Make no mistake about it.

Tsay, who is in attendance, received a standing ovation from lawmakers as Biden acknowledged him.\n\n“He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons once and for all.”\n\nMass shootings typically lead lawmakers to call for such actions but it’s unlikely that a ban will pass in a divided Congress with many Republican lawmakers who have vowed that they will not waver on gun control.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'Still too high':Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin orders independent panel to study military suicide\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene yells at Biden multiple times\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a fervent opponent of Biden who has called for his impeachment, yelled at him twice during the State of the Union address.\n\nThe first time came as Biden said Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare – an accusation that Greene refuted when she stood up yelled “Liar!”\n\nGreene later yelled, “China spied on us!” near the end of Biden’s speech.\n\nShe also yelled to “close the border” and “it’s your fault” when the president talked about the fentanyl crisis.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nHeckling lawmakers:Marjorie Taylor Greene, other Republicans spar with Biden over Social Security, Medicare\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden on Tyre Nichols’ death: ‘Something good must come from this’\n\nBiden used his speech to pay tribute to Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBiden called for more police training and more resources to reduce violent crime, along with more investments in housing, education and training.\n\nNoting that Nichols’ mother and stepfather were seated in the first lady’s box, Biden urged lawmakers to commit themselves to making the words of Nichols’ mother come true: “Something good must come from this.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTyre Nichols killing:7 more Memphis police employees under investigation in Tyre Nichols' death, city attorney says\n\nBiden invokes Uvalde massacre in call for gun reform\n\nIn a call to action on gun violence, Biden invoked his trip to Uvalde, Texas, after the Robb Elementary School shooting where 19 students and two teachers were killed.\n\n“Do something, do something. That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde, I met with everyone.” Biden said, then pointing to the bipartisan gun reform law he signed. “Thank god we did.

Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table. We remember them, and we remain vigilant,” he said.\n\nBiden said it was important to remain vigilant and monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.

That’s because the enhanced CTC, which parents could also opt to receive in installments rather than waiting to receive it in a lump sum payment when they file their taxes, expired.\n\nThe enhanced CTC increased payments from $2,000 per qualifying child to $3,600 for children ages 5 and under and $3,000 for children ages 6 through 17. This year it will go back to $2,000 for qualifying children of all ages.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden vowed to “restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.”\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nChild tax credit this year:How much is the Child Tax Credit for 2023?

McCarthy said Republicans aren’t going to cut those programs, but Democrats say the math will force those cuts if the GOP demands lowered government spending.\n\nBiden in his speech said Republicans want to cut the programs, to which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled “Liar!” as other members booed the president.\n\n“OK, so we agree,” Biden said. “Social Security and Medicare is off the books.”\n\nBipartisan cheers returned to the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nMedicare:Medicare launches plan to negotiate prices for the costliest drugs. Here's what to know.\n\nBiden takes credit for deficit cuts\n\nBiden celebrated the government’s deficit cuts seen under his administration in his State of the Union address.\n\n“For the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history,” Biden said. The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?:Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said. The law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year.\n\nHe also promised to veto any attempts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCredit fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nBiden tangles with GOP lawmakers over Social Security and Medicare\n\nBiden got into an unusual back and forth with Republicans over whether GOP lawmakers want to end the automatic continuation of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhen some vocally protested, Biden responded: “Anyone who doubts it, contact my office. I’ll give you a copy of the proposal.”\n\nWhen the protests continued, Biden said he wasn’t arguing that all Republicans back reviewing entitlement programs every five years.\n\n“But it’s being proposed,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMedicare debate:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nCheers and boos for Biden\n\nProgressive members of the House, known as “the Squad,” cheered as President Joe Biden pushed for fair taxes and called out low tax rates for billionaires.\n\n“You tell ‘em, Joe,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nHe also had plenty of jeers from the Republican side of the chamber when he slammed former President Donald Trump’s fiscal record and accused the House GOP of trying to cut Social Security and Medicare. The latter attracted loud boos.\n\nRep.

Biden then announced, “new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.”\n\n“American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables,” he said. “And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.”\n\nBiden’s message echoes former President Donald Trump’s prior State of the Union addresses where he boasted about initiatives to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the years.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nInsulin costs:Medicare caps insulin costs at $35 a month.

Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens.

That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements.

Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep.

Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov.

Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name? Bill Clinton ... then-future President Bill Clinton.\n\nSanders will give the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n5 big questions for the SOTU:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden and China: Spy balloon likely to be addressed\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/01/23/what-is-work-life-balance-worth/72316362007/", "title": "New survey: Workers would take 20% pay cut for work/life balance", "text": "A recent survey by Ford Motor Co. found that 52% of employed people globally would be willing to take a 20% pay cut for a better work/life balance.\n\n\"It shocked us. I’ll be honest,\" said Jen Brace, chief futurist at Ford who coordinated the 2024 Trend Report and its findings. \"A 20% pay cut is a big deal,\" she said, noting that \"If you look generationally, and if you look in the U.S. in particular, you saw our younger generations being even more willing to give up money for a better quality of life.\"\n\nHere's the percentage of people in the U.S. willing to take a 20% pay cut, by age group, according to the survey: Generation Z (born between 1997-2012) was 56%; millennials (born between 1981-96) was 60%; Gen X (born between 1965-80) was 43%; and baby boomers (born between 1946-64) was 33%.\n\nThe survey – conducted via 16,086 online interviews in August and September with people 18 years and older in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States – also found that 77% of respondents prioritize a balanced life over advancement at work.\n\nWhat is the American Dream anymore?How younger workers are redefining success\n\nWork-life balance demand:Zillennials search for something widely desired\n\nThe latest findings show a significant value of time over money among groups of all ages, Ford said. This is the first year the study has presented a question about a potential pay cut in exchange for working less.\n\nWhile looking at work/life balance, people express having more anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and stressed out about the state of their mental health, Brace said.\n\n\"It's a shift,\" she said. \"They're saying, 'I'm not willing to give up all these things in my life. I'm not willing to put my family time on hold for work. I want to focus on me, on things I think will be more valuable.' It's a shift we're seeing generationally.\"\n\nFord uses trend data to support and inform business decisions, including marketing, strategy, vehicle design and product development. For example, if workers are willing to pass up a promotion at work for less stress or more family time, that affects how talent is retained.\n\nCaring less about money\n\nAmericans are just now catching up to the European idea of leisure being more valuable than higher income, which doesn't actually impact a company's productivity, said Mauro Guillen, a professor at the Wharton School of Management at the University of Pennsylvania. But it does keep the workforce healthier and happier, he told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n\"People who have a stable job with a company have come to the realization that there are other things in life beyond just making a ton of money, especially for women,\" he said. \"Some people would say we're in a post-materialist world.\"\n\nStill, that's not all, he said: \"People have been burned in the last 20 years, several times. You work very hard to save and then the stock market takes a hit ... with all this volatility, who knows what's going to happen. So why should I save for the future? Let me just enjoy life now.\"\n\nDiane Pacom, a sociology professor emeritus from the University of Ottawa in Canada, said the mindset of the current workforce has changed completely. And, again, women are a driving force, she said.\n\n\"Women approach work in a different way than men, most prioritizing the way they relate to their families. This is a huge change,\" Pacom told the Free Press. \"We see women more and more as the ones who have the biggest influence on our rapport with work now. Their presence in society is more accepted and more powerful.\"\n\nShe said, \"The good life for women is not related to work only. They expect to have time for the kids, time for a love life, time for traveling.\"\n\nShifting attitudes\n\nThese themes also help Ford better understand and connect with consumers, the company said.\n\nFindings show that the vehicle is like \"the new dinner table,\" Brace said. \"When it comes to connecting with your family, sometimes the vehicle is the best place to do that. You've got a captive audience when you're all in the same space.\"\n\nRespondents are also expressing a desire to get outdoors more often, how they'd like to reprioritize their time and take care of themselves, Brace said. \"A lot of our vehicles are geared for that, getting out there and experiencing nature. \"\n\nChanging social attitudes and field research inform design, innovation and marketing campaign themes.\n\nFor example, Lincoln introduced a new wellness app in 2020 to assist with meditation and ease anxiety. And the 2021 Ford F-150 includes a foldout desktop in the front seat, among other features. Vehicles are designed years in advance, so forecasting shifts in human behavior is essential.\n\nAnxiety, EVs and parenthood\n\nThe job of the futurist is to track social, technological, economic, environmental and political trends and shifts happening among consumers and society at large. This story touches on just a few of the key findings.\n\nWellness: Survey responses indicate that people around the world are feeling anxious and trying to take action to find inner peace. The global data showed that:\n\n◾ 44% of people are putting themselves before what others want or ask of them.\n\n◾ 48% of people are cutting toxic relationships out of their life.\n\n◾ 83% of adults agree that for children to be prepared for adulthood, mental health is more important than academic success.\n\nSustainability: Fewer people say they're changing their behavior to actively fight climate change with 75% in 2023, down from 78% in 2020. People indicate they'll embrace change if it's convenient, the report showed.\n\n◾ 47% of people believe others should drive EVs to help fight climate change, yet only 4% of them do.\n\n◾ 35% of people believe others should drive hybrid vehicles to help fight climate change, yet only 8% of them do.\n\nParenting: The term family is changing. No longer do the majority of individuals view family as being married or having kids, Brace said. Many adults say that their ideal life in the next 10 years looks like having pets more than having children.\n\nThese changing attitudes are a byproduct of more awareness about medical realities, Guillen said. \"Stress kills. Anything that helps reduce stress, people will go for it.\"\n\nJason Moser, a clinical psychologist who teaches at Michigan State University, said he is not surprised by the study results, which he is seeing among college students now.\n\n\"Mental health is definitely in the public consciousness way more than it has been. The COVID pandemic pushed into sharp relief the notion of mental health, social contact, isolation, what it meant to be sad, not being able to connect with people.\"\n\nBabies vs. pets\n\nAnd planning for more pets than babies is a reality, he said.\n\n\"Pets are less expensive than babies. You don't have to worry as much,\" he said, adding, \"It's cheaper and the burden of responsibility is not as high.\"\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-618-1034 or phoward@freepress.com.

Then it ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nIn early March, after two ultra-fast delivery startups shut down in New York City in a single week, a self-proclaimed pioneer in the space appeared to see an opportunity for some media attention.\n\nGetir, a Turkish startup founded in 2015, had recently raised $768 million in funding valuing it at $11.8 billion, “cementing its position as a decacorn” even in the face of a “volatile” market, according to a representative for the company at the time. The representative suggested a reporter discuss with Getir’s CEO the future of the industry amid the “disappearance” of two smaller competitors.\n\nTwo months later, Getir slashed 14% of its global workforce, or nearly 4,500 employees, according to multiple reports at the time.\n\nThe sudden shift reflected the broader turbulence in this sector. Buoyed by billions in venture capital and a surge in demand earlier in the pandemic, a long list of on-demand companies promised to deliver ice cream, toilet paper, vodka or even a single apple in as little as 10 minutes. These startups opened offices and micro-fulfillment centers in cities across the country and rapidly recruited couriers.\n\nThen the music stopped. Soaring inflation, rising interest rates, fears of a looming recession and a war in Ukraine forced much of the tech industry to rethink expenses. Perhaps nowhere was that pullback as severe as this flashy, and very costly, corner of the on-demand industry — an industry which was born out of the Great Recession of 2008 and had never experienced a prolonged downturn.\n\n“It’s the model we saw with Uber a decade ago of heavily prioritizing growth over profits to be able to rapidly seize first-mover advantage,” said Alex Frederick, a senior analyst focused on emerging technology at PitchBook, a data analytics company. This model “requires high burn, high capital investments to continually expand into new markets, attract customers and retain them,” he said. Now, investors may have less appetite for it.\n\nGorillas, an ultra-fast delivery startup founded in Germany, launched in the US in May 2021. Bernd von Jutrczenka/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nThis year, Fridge No More and Buyk have shut down operations completely; Jokr said it would shut down its US operations and hone in on its Latin America business; and Gopuff, Gorillas and Getir have each had at least one round of layoffs. Combined, at least 8,250 jobs have been lost, according to a tally by CNN Business based on a combination of press coverage, publicly available information and confirmations from some of the companies. Many of those impacted worked as couriers, or the frontline workers essential to delivering on the missions of speed and convenience.\n\nThe fallout has created whiplash for some of the many workers who bet on it. One of the thousands of employees laid off by Getir told CNN Business that they had felt a sense of security because of something they said they’d heard expressed inside the seven-year-old company: It had never undergone layoffs.\n\nThe worker, who joined in late 2021 as Getir was building up its US presence in Boston and Chicago, said that while they’d rationally understood it’s common for startups to lay off employees, or even to fail, they believed Getir would be the exception. “I really believed they just didn’t do layoffs and thought they were going to be a very different startup,” said the former employee, who asked their name to be withheld for fear of retaliation. “I believed the dream they were selling. I’m disappointed.”\n\nIn an e-mailed response to CNN Business, Getir CEO Nazim Salur said his company “decided to extend the runway” through layoffs “because of the deterioration of market conditions.” Salur added: “Layoffs are something we try not to do unless it is absolutely necessary. This is the first time in Getir’s seven-year history that Getir has gone through a workforce cut of this magnitude.”\n\nHe declined to provide additional details on the round of cuts in May, including what portion of its US business was impacted. The company said it’s the first instance of widespread layoffs as opposed to specific store closures.\n\nLike Getir, the ultra-fast delivery startups that remain have largely indicated the cuts are intended to help them weather the economic downturn. As they adjust, however, other businesses appear to be eying opportunities to gain a footing in the market, and perhaps change how it operates.\n\nThe rise and stumbles of 15-minute delivery startups\n\nWhen Gopuff, considered the first to leverage its own stores to fulfill ultra-fast deliveries, was founded in 2013, Uber and the app-based gig economy were only a few years old. Gopuff’s original pitch was to offer hookah deliveries and later food to college students with sudden cravings.\n\nLess than a decade later, Gopuff was valued at $15 billion, and then reportedly raised a convertible note at a valuation cap of up to $40 billion. It was also operating in more than 1,200 cities and capturing the attention of a more established gig company, Uber, in the form of a partnership. Gopuff had 450 micro-fulfillment centers spread across college towns and major cities to supply its customers with everything from food to alcohol and medicine almost instantaneously. As of March 2022, it had 15,000 employees.\n\nBut in a memo to investors in July, it outlined a number of changes it was making, including a second round of layoffs in a matter of months and closing 76 micro-fulfillment centers, to prepare for the next two years by which time it projects it can be profitable. It said that it is preparing for “what could be a much more significant macro-economic downturn than we are experiencing currently.”\n\nGopuff, founded in Philadelphia in 2013, is the most highly-valued of the ultra-fast delivery startups. Thomas Urbain/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“The instant commerce industry that Gopuff created is at an inflection point,” the company said in the memo, a copy of which was viewed by CNN Business. “Gopuff was among the last hyper-growth tech companies to raise a significant round in the previous economic environment and among the first to cut costs to focus on and optimize unit economics,” the company said, referring to the revenue and costs associated with each delivery.\n\nEven with the cuts at Gopuff and other startups, some industry watchers have doubts about the long-term viability of their main offerings, especially in a more sober economic environment.\n\nBrittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who has advised a number of companies in the space and previously worked in strategy at Amazon, told CNN Business that the premise of 15-minute delivery is a “gimmick.”\n\n“It hooked people, it generated a lot of publicity, it became something of an oddity,” he said. “The goal was to get consumers to ask, ‘Why is it I can get my groceries in 15 minutes, but I can’t get cosmetics and shoes and apparel and things like that [in 15 minutes]?’”\n\n“That’s where the next phase of growth was going to be,” he added. Then came the downturn and fears of a recession. “Investors collectively said, ‘How in the world are we ever going to make money investing in this?’”\n\nA slower path forward for some\n\nAs some of the biggest names in the ultra-fast delivery sector stumble, others are looking to gain ground.\n\nInstacart, which in May filed paperwork to go public, debuted an ultra-fast delivery offering for certain customers of Publix in Miami. Instacart declined to share metrics on the partnership, but a company spokesperson said it has seen interest in the Publix offering, which is called Publix Quick Picks. A Publix spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn December, DoorDash began offering an ultra-fast delivery option in New York City from a DashMart, one of the stores it opened in 2020, and has since begun expanding.\n\nMeanwhile, more under-the-radar companies haven taken what they say are intentionally slower and more methodical approaches to ultra-fast delivery. Paul Stellatos, who has been running grocery stores in the Chicago area for two decades, told CNN Business his company, Go Grocer, had been developing an app to offer quick deliveries from its stores – without VC-backing. That process took many months, during which time Gorillas and Getir were taking the market by storm.\n\nGetir, a Turkish startup founded in 2015, launched its US operations in November, 2021. Angel Garcia/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“We were just kind of sitting back and saying, ‘Okay, Mr. Gorillas or Mr. Getir, how are you planning on making money capturing the audience and getting a sticky customer, somebody who is gonna order more than once?” said Stellatos, who said that Go Grocer leverages workers from companies like DoorDash and Uber to deliver orders from its stores. “I’m really a stickler on money because we don’t have the opportunity of burning cash. We can only be profitable.”\n\nVitaly Alexandrov, the CEO and founder of San Francisco-based startup Food Rocket, which offers 10- to 30-minute grocery deliveries with an emphasis on fresh food, said it has just six retail locations in San Francisco and Chicago to date.\n\n“It’s not because we’re a super slow company,” said Alexandrov, who noted Food Rocket grew out of the remnants of his earlier business focused on restaurants that shuttered due to the pandemic. “It’s because we tried to build a really sustainable business model. It couldn’t be scalable without such huge losses.”\n\nAlexandrov said the extra time of 30-minute deliveries allows for more “sustainable unit economics” because it provides more opportunities to group several deliveries for a single worker. Food Rocket, which has raised $30 million to date, is hoping to raise a new round of funding by the end of the year. “We still believe that people love to get everything super-fast,” added Alexandrov.\n\nOne of the most valuable companies in the world apparently thinks so, too.

He said the company “will notify impacted employees” on Thursday. Licht said at the conclusion of the cuts he will “follow up with more details.”\n\n“It will be a difficult time for everyone,” Licht candidly said in his memo.\n\nCNN declined to say on Wednesday how many employees precisely would be impacted by the layoffs.\n\nThe layoffs come as media companies are being battered by brutal economic headwinds that have taken a bat to the advertising sector. Licht noted in October, when he signaled large cuts were coming, that there is “widespread concern over the global economic outlook” and that CNN “must factor that risk into [its] long-term planning.”\n\nOther media organizations have also cut costs as they work to best position themselves for the stormy economic climate. Disney (DIS) said last week the company needed to restructure, and AMC Networks (AMCX)announced Tuesday that it would cut 20% of its staff. Social media companies such as Facebook (FB)-parent Meta, which also rely on advertising revenue, have also executed layoffs in recent months.\n\nCNN, which still posts profits in the hundreds of millions of dollars, was spared from the cuts that wreaked havoc on the industry during the pandemic. Prior to this year, the last major cuts to occur at the organization were in 2018 when less than 50 people lost their jobs as the company restructured its digital business.\n\nThe cuts to the organization also come after CNN’s former parent company, WarnerMedia, merged earlier this year with Discovery, creating a media juggernaut laced with billions of dollars in debt and a need to slash costs across the board. The merger had just been completed in April when the company announced it was shuttering streaming service CNN+ a month after it was launched\n\nDavid Zaslav, chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, the company that was formed when WarnerMedia and Discovery became one, has promised investors that he will find more than $3 billion in savings in the combined organization.\n\nAfter Licht took over as head of CNN, he conducted a months-long review of the business. That review led to him identifying changes that should be made, Licht said in October. Some of those changes have already been implemented, as CNN has made smaller cuts to parts of its business in the last several months.\n\nLicht said in his all-staff memo on Wednesday that employees affected by this week’s cuts will be notified “through an in-person meeting or via Zoom, depending on your location.”\n\n“In those meetings, you will receive information specific to you about notice period or any severance that would apply, and your anticipated last day,” Licht said. “I want to be clear that everyone who is bonus eligible will still receive their 2022 bonuses, which are determined by company performance.”\n\nLicht acknowledged that the cuts will “affect both our departing colleagues and those who remain” and promised to provide employees “resources designed to support” them.\n\n“Let’s take care of each other this week,” Licht said.", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}]}

We'll continue to add to this list in the weeks ahead. These are the area restaurants that have closed their doors as a result of loss of business from COVID-19.\n\nJeff & Sheryl's\n\nThe restaurant at McNary Golf Club in Keizer will soon be under the operations of the golf club itself.\n\nPreviously called The McNary Restaurant and Lounge, independent operators Jeff and Sheryl McDonnell reopened the space under the name Jeff & Sheryl's in early 2019.\n\nThey operated for a year before coronavirus arrived in Oregon. Now, they've announced plans to close. Reached by phone Saturday, Feb. 27, Sheryl McDonnell credited the uncertain future of the banquet and events business as a major factor in the decision.\n\n\"There's just no end in sight,\" she said. Looking at the case counts of coronavirus infections, \"you could see the writing on the wall.\"\n\nMcDonnell said, \"if we had a couple more years under our belt, we might have made it.\"\n\nMcNary Golf Course will officially take over the operation of the restaurant beginning April 1. Representatives from the golf club were not available to speak to future plans for the restaurant space.\n\nRogue Farms Tasting Room\n\nThe Rogue Farms Tasting Room in Independence announced Feb. 26 it will not reopen for the 2021 season and will remain closed indefinitely.\n\nAn innovative project when it opened in 2008, the tasting room was a casual bar on a working hop farm where Rogue Ales & Spirits grows hops, marionberries and other fresh ingredients used in its seasonal brews.\n\nIn a prepared statement posted to the brewery's social media pages, brewery president Dharma Tamm said \"while we will miss hosting everyone on the lawn, mounting challenges from the pandemic and rising costs have made it apparent that our best option is to close the tasting room and Revolution Garden and focus on continuing our relationship with Coleman Agriculture to grow and supply hops to the brewery.\"\n\n\"We will miss our regular customers and will forever cherish the memories made on the farm. We promise to continue to make and distribute world-class products to our fans around the world and hope you’ll come see us in Newport, Portland, and Astoria.\"\n\nSushi J Restaurant & Bar\n\nLi Chen, a former sushi chef at Momiji on South Commercial in Salem, opened his first restaurant, a colorful, casual Japanese spot named Sushi J (his wife's first initial) in Dallas in 2018. The restaurant was one of few places in the Dallas area to go for sashimi and one of the only places to find Japanese preparations udon or yakisoba, pork tonkatsu, and hamachi kama, succulent baked yellowtail collar.\n\nChen announced plans to close the restaurant via social media and confirmed the closing was \"mostly\" due to the impact of the pandemic. The restaurant's final day of service was Feb. 6.\n\nStill open:Which Salem-area restaurants are reopening for indoor dining?\n\nPressed Coffee\n\nMateasa and Kirk Bathke closed their downtown Dallas cafe and venue Pressed Coffee after service on Dec. 31, 2020. The couple purchased Pressed from previous owners in March 2019.\n\nWithout being able to operate normally, offering trivia, live music and open mic nights, business was too slow to keep going.\n\nThey're deciding whether to liquidate the business entirely or try to reopen in the future in a space with a smaller footprint.\n\nBonJapan 86 Yaroku\n\nMuneaki Sugie has closed BonJapan86 Yaroku, his four-year-old restaurant at 990 12th St. SE.\n\nBonJapan was unusual in Salem's dining landscape in that it focused on Japanese food, but not sushi. Known for \"ofukuro no aji\" or Japanese comfort food, guests celebrated Sugie's bento boxes, tempura, Japanese curry, udon and rice bowls.\n\nThe small eatery often felt like a one-person restaurant; Sugie acting as host, server and chef all at once. He said he hopes to open a food truck in the future, but no plans have been finalized. The restaurant closed at the end of November.\n\nOthers are reading:Indoor dining returns and restaurant owners breathe a tentative sigh of relief\n\nSizzler\n\nIn late September Sizzler USA, the casual steakhouse chain known for its salad bar, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The 62-year-old restaurant chain has closed numerous locations, including the one in Salem at 1151 Lancaster Drive NE. Sizzler locations in Albany, Springfield and Roseburg also have closed.\n\nThe company is currently undergoing restructuring practices meant to reduce its debt. A Dec. 11 business filing with Oregon's Secretary of State by Sizzler USA Restaurants Inc. indicates the company plans to continue operations in the state of Oregon, though does not specify particular operating locations.\n\nA company representative confirmed while the chain plans to reopen some Oregon locations, Salem will not be among them.\n\nKyoto Japanese Restaurant\n\nA Salem destination for sushi and teppanyaki since the early 1980s has closed.\n\nKyoto Japanese Restaurant, 1610 Lancaster Drive, held its final service Nov. 8.\n\nOwners Sue and Sam Koizumi have operated the business for 37 years.\n\n\"It's hard,\" said Sue. \"We're lucky we could make it this long.\"\n\nThey closed the restaurant for three months at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though they reopened over the summer, pandemic operating precautions were particularly difficult for them to manage because of the style of the restaurant.\n\nIn teppanyaki meals, a cook prepares a meal for a large party of guests on a flat top grill built into the table itself. It's a style of dining that lends itself to birthdays and other celebrations, which is part of what made adapting to coronavirus recommendations so difficult.\n\nAt a table built to seat eight, Sue said, they were serving parties of two or four, and \"we only have seven tables.\" Phased reopening requirements prohibited seating guests at their sushi bar. These factors combined, said Koizumi, \"that's not enough business.\"\n\nThey made the decision to close without announcement or celebration and are in the process of cleaning and clearing out the restaurant space.\n\nCould they reopen after the pandemic is resolved? It's more likely, Koizumi said, this closure means retirement.\n\nWatch:Craving wings? Fly on over to these Salem restaurants\n\nThe Ritz Diner\n\nThe Ritz, a longstanding diner at 135 Lancaster Drive SE, ceased operations after service on Oct. 30.\n\n\"I didn't plan to close,\" said operator Adam McCormick, but \"the day just came I had to admit I can't do this anymore.\"\n\nState filings list Vince Imes as the owner, but McCormick said the business was in the midst of an ownership transfer to him.\n\nImes also owns Vince Imes Printing in Lincoln City and Coastal Care Homes, a business associated with Sunshine Home Adult Care in Depoe Bay. Imes did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMallory Ramey, McCormick's fiancee, launched a crowdfunding campaign on Go Fund Me with the goal of raising $75,000 to reopen The Ritz.\n\nThe bulk of the resources would go toward paying back rent, largely deferred since March, as well as paying back bills to vendors and utility providers, McCormick said, with a cushion of about $8,000 to help the business go forward.\n\nMcCormick said he hasn't taken a paycheck from the business since March, instead prioritizing payroll and payments to suppliers.\n\nHe has worked at The Ritz since 2010, both as a cook and manager, and had begun making cosmetic improvements to the business before the pandemic began.\n\nEven though business was good, he said, \"once rent comes due again, I'll never be able to catch up.\"\n\nBirdie's Bistro\n\nBirdie's Bistro has announced plans to close for good.\n\nShana and Toy Schmidt founded Birdie's Bistro in Keizer in 2012 in the River Road space that is now Gyro Stop. Katrina and Aaron Beale bought the restaurant and moved it to the Equitable Center in December 2017.\n\nIt has been a favorite daytime destination for many, beloved for its salads, sandwiches and pastries, especially among the downtown breakfast and lunch crowd. The restaurant's last day of operations was Oct. 18.\n\nShawerma Owok\n\nShawerma Owok, a red food truck across from the Roth's Vista location on Liberty Road and Commercial Street in South Salem was a favorite quick lunch option for some reporters, yours truly included.\n\nIt was one of few places locally specializing in Middle Eastern sandwiches, platters and salads, all crowned with a swizzle of pungent garlic sauce. Open since summer 2017, the truck was a mother-son venture of Amal Idris and Mohammad Hasan.\n\nThey closed the businesses temporarily in March and April, at the start of the pandemic.\n\n\"We reopened in June, but it wasn't worth it,\" Hasan said, because they were still paying rent on the space and sales were slow.\n\nIn a late September post to the business' Facebook page, they announced plans to close and they've since listed the truck for sale.\n\n\"We feel sorry for our customers,\" Hasan said, \"but corona was too hard on us.\"\n\nPolk County restaurant inspections:Bartender started work without washing hands\n\nThe Portland Press\n\nThe Portland Press, Brandon and Aaron Appel's gluten-free waffle sandwich spot announced plans to close via social media on Sept. 15. They attributed the closure to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the wildfires in the community impacting air quality.\n\n\"Words cannot express our gratitude for Portland Press supporters and fans. You really showed our little family-owned restaurant some love, Salem,\" they said in a post to the restaurant's Instagram page.\n\nThe Portland Press was the first vendor to sign on to open inside the food hall a year ago. Keizer food truck operator Troy Campbell will open Uncle Troy's BBQ in The Portland Press location.\n\nMore:Smooth and Portland Press out, Uncle Troy's BBQ in at Fork Forty Food Hall\n\nRed Ginger\n\nA Keizer destination for Thai food for a decade, Red Ginger closed without announcement over the summer. Owners Amanda Singharaj and Perry Sinasone could not be reached for comment.\n\nState business filings indicate that Kelly Cepeda registered El Vaquero Santa Maria BBQ for the 4907 River Road N address in the first week of July. The new business specializes in a style of barbecue from the central coast of California. It opened on Sep. 11.\n\nSalem Ale Works\n\nAfter seven years of \"putting the ale in Salem,\" Jake Bonham and Justin Ego closed their brewery Salem Ale Works at the end of August.\n\nTypically, Bonham said, 80% to 90% of the beer S.A.W brewed was sold directly to the person drinking it in the brewery's 25th street taphouse.\n\n\"That's what our model was built on,\" Bonham said, but \"in March we were looking to make a pivot as best we could.\" The brewery had just begun canning their beers before the pandemic necessitated closing the taproom, and they switched from draft sales to entirely canned beers.\n\nBonham said they hoped reopening under Phase 1 guidelines would reinvigorate taproom sales.\n\n\"As we got into late July and we were looking at our sales numbers,\" Bonham said, \"we were coming to the end of what is normally peak beer season. Looking out into fall and winter without any sort of change, we just didn't really see a way forward.\"\n\nRead More:Salem Ale Works will close, citing slow sales since phase one of COVID-19 reopening\n\nFirepit Wandering Kitchen\n\nRebecca and Ryan Fineran closed their mobile food business, Firepit Wandering Kitchen, over the summer. Since they opened in 2017, the truck moved around town frequently, popping up at various offices, dispensaries, wineries and bars.\n\nBeloved for meaty burgers, sausage sandwiches, tacos and more, Firepit also had a steady presence at Salem's bottleshop Barrel & Keg. In January, they opened a third location at Salem Ale Works helmed by former Table Five 08 cook Quinton Soto.\n\nRebecca Fineran said slow sales and the vulnerability of the pandemic were major factors in their decision to cease operations entirely.\n\nBossi's BBQ\n\nMegan Bossi, Salem's barbecue queen, served her final brisket, nacho cheese and jalapeño sandwich at Beehive Station on July 31. Bossi launched her barbecue business last fall, popping up in Dallas before moving her cart to Salem early this year. The cart gathered fans quickly, especially of the loaded pulled pork nachos.\n\nThough she has been able to operate steadily through the pandemic, the rising costs and fluctuating availability of the meat have cut into the food cart's margins. That, said Bossi, combined with the announcement that Salem-Keizer Public Schools would begin the first nine weeks of the upcoming school year using distance learning in place of in-person instruction, made continuing cart operations unfeasible.\n\nUntil now, Bossi has been able to juggle childcare and distance learning for her kids, but faced with the start of school, \"there's no possible way I can do that,\" Bossi said, \"It's just been one thing after another.\"\n\nBossi hopes to return to barbecue at some point in the future but, at the moment, she's hoping to sell her barbecue cart and find work in another field.\n\nTable FIVE 08\n\nThe six-year-old High Street restaurant beloved for its modern takes on steakhouse classics, Asian flavors and creative cocktail program has closed.\n\nThe restaurant's last day was July 9. Longtime Table FIVE 08 bartender Rob \"Drinkenstein\" Melton confirmed coronavirus as the reason behind the closure.\n\n\"It overtook us. It got too far out in front of us.\"\n\nThe restaurant is the first in downtown Salem to permanently close because of coronavirus. Co-owners Steven Freeburg and Jason Freeburg announced the closure on the restaurant's Facebook page. The storefront remains vacant.\n\nCourtyard Cafe\n\nTony and Tori Garcia had big dreams when they bought Dallas' Courtyard Cafe in the fall of 2019. They made substantial cosmetic renovations to the breakfast and lunch space and reopened in December.\n\nWhen coronavirus arrived in Oregon, however, the couple realized they didn't have the resources yet banked to maintain the cafe operations amidst the pandemic. They listed the restaurant for sale.\n\nTony Garcia said they hope to revisit the possibility of opening another restaurant sometime in the future. After Courtyard Cafe closed, Tino Land and Augustin \"Jay\" Razo opened a third Azuls Taco House location in the Dallas storefront.\n\nMore:Slowed by a loss, Azuls Taco House plans third location in Dallas\n\nStay up to date on all Salem-area food and restaurant news.

The Chicken Shack Keizer opened in the former El Patron space in September.\n\nChicken Time:A first look at The Chicken Shack in Keizer, opening this week\n\nRoberts Crossing\n\nRoberts Crossing, a Salem destination for date-night dining and holiday celebrations for a decade, was the first restaurant to publicly announce a closure after Oregon reopened under Phase 1 restrictions.\n\nOwner Jeff Glodt said the restaurant's higher-priced menu made it more vulnerable than his other two restaurant locations: Grain Station Brew Works in Monmouth and McMinnville.\n\nAnother factor was that Roberts Crossing frequently hosted special events and private parties, a segment of the food service industry that is effectively gone for the moment.\n\nNews:Roberts Crossing is closed, first Salem restaurant closed by impact of coronavirus\n\nEmily Teel is the Food & Drink Editor at the Statesman Journal.

The eatery had been a local icon for 47 years. Steve Solomon, a Chicago native, opened both Leonardo’s 706 and Leonardo’s By the Slice in 1973.\n\nLeo’s announced its temporary closure on April 3 expressing its concerns for the safety of the restaurant staff and customers and later closed for good.\n\n“We probably never would have retired were it not for the pandemic,” Solomon said.\n\nThe restaurant was best known for its deep pan pizza and Italian cuisine.\n\nLeonardo’s By the Slice\n\nResidents knew Leonardo’s By the Slice at 1245 W. University Ave. would close eventually, after it was announced that the University of Florida Foundation purchased the property and planned to put a music building in the area. The restaurant's lease was later extended until summer 2020, then to June 2021, but Leo's By the Slice couldn't handle the hit brought by COVID-19, co-owner Brian Johnson said.\n\nBy the Slice opened in 1973, where it served up inexpensive pizza slices to hungry college students and other residents and visitors day and night.\n\nThe restaurant permanently closed Dec. 16.\n\nLarry’s Giant Subs\n\nBrothers Larry and Mitch Raike founded Larry's Giant Subs, which serves deli-style sandwiches, in 1982 in Jacksonville. The first Gainesville location opened in 1999.\n\nSarah Whitfield, who owned the University Avenue location since 2016, said there were up to as many as five Larry's locations in town. The one at University Avenue would be last to go.\n\nLarry’s location near midtown bars and across from campus made for a favorite spot for college students between classes, going home after studying or in need of food after a night out.\n\nThe shop stayed open until 3 a.m., meaning that Larry’s could still serve after most places closed.\n\nWhitfield said part of what made Larry's special in Gainesville was the staff's friendly and welcoming personality.\n\nLarry’s closed its doors in May. Even on the last day, customers were greeted with an enthusiastic \"Hey! Welcome to Larry's!\"\n\nThe Swamp\n\nGainesville mourned the loss of its historic restaurant The Swamp, which closed its doors on June 30 and was torn down in July.\n\nThe Swamp Restaurant will be rebuilt a few blocks away from its original location, in Gainesville's Innovation District at 1026 SW Second Ave., in an almost identical building. Although it will not be across from Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, the Second Avenue location is less than a mile away.\n\n“It was an incredibly difficult decision to leave 17th and University,” said owner Ryan Prodesky.\n\nCommunity residents have continued to voice concerns about apartment complexes running establishments out of the area, pointing out that future students will miss out on a unique and local experience.\n\nThe Swamp Restaurant looks forward to throwing big game-day parties in the fall of 2022. Prodesky said he looks forward to the return of the large front yard. The new location has more space, and he said it’s likely to be even bigger.\n\nDaybreak Pleasant Street\n\nOn Oct. 1, after months of silence, Daybreak Pleasant Street’s owners announced its indefinite closure due to COVID-19.\n\nMichael Sneed, who co-owns the restaurant with his wife Patty Sneed, said their original plan was to reopen the restaurant in June. However, as the spread of COVID-19 worsened, Sneed said profit was not worth the risk of getting his employees or patrons sick and he didn't believe indoor dining could be done safely.\n\nDaybreak was nestled in a quiet Gainesville neighborhood in a 1911 building. The couple originally opened the eatery to emphasize the importance of eating good local food.\n\nWhenever Gainesville sees the other side of the pandemic, the Sneeds say they will look for a newer property with more parking and a bigger dining space ― to open a second location.\n\n\"Daybreak, I'm hoping to make it bigger and better,\" Sneed said.\n\nFrancesca’s Trattoria\n\nThe Italian Restaurant, which opened at 4410 NW 25th Place in 2008, served its last customers on Aug. 15.\n\nRestaurant owners Frances and Michael Khey, the chef, announced the closing on Facebook.\n\n\"I wanted to reach out to our followers and loyal patrons and let you know that it has been our honor and pleasure to cook and serve your meals but more importantly, you became our friends and an extension of our family,\" the Kheys wrote. \"We love the Gainesville community and have received so much love and support from all of you these last 12 years.\"\n\nFelipe’s Mexican Taqueria\n\nPreviously located on University Avenue, Felipe’s closed its doors on Nov. 1.\n\nAfter four years in Gainesville, the eatery could not withstand the devastation brought on by COVID-19. However, residents will not forget the buy-one-get-one-free margaritas on Fridays, Latin Nights and its booth in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.\n\nIn addition to two other Florida locations in Naples and Fort Myers Beach, Felipe's Taqueria also has restaurants in Louisiana, Massachusetts and Maryland.\n\nTaco Del Mar\n\nMost recently, Taco Del Mar, a Baja-style Mexican quick-service restaurant at 8181 NW 38th Lane, closed permanently on Dec. 31.\n\nZoe Haraden, one of the restaurant’s owners, said the Gainesville location has been open for about eight years, but business never bounced back to pre-pandemic levels after March.\n\nHaraden said the closure of college campuses in town during the spring definitely brought down business. Taco Del Mar sits across the street from Santa Fe College’s campus.\n\nCivilization\n\nCivilization was one of Gainesville’s first vegetarian restaurants. Located at 1511 NW Second St., the restaurant was a Gulf Oil truck garage in the early 20th century, but has been an established eatery since 2009.\n\nBefore its closing in May, Civilization offered takeout to try and stay afloat but the revenue was not enough to maintain its operation.\n\n“After many sleepless nights and thinking long and hard, we have come to the unhappy conclusion that the Civilization we know and love has very little chance of succeeding in the changed future, and so we have decided we must close for good,” said the Civilization website.\n\nNow open:First new eateries of 2021 open: Peruvian, Middle Eastern and more\n\nHowever, the website post hinted at the possibility of reopening in a new location once the pandemic passes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2022/01/06/first-columbus-restaurant-closes-2022/9115328002/", "title": "First Columbus restaurant closes in 2022", "text": "The Corner Bakery Café closed its Polaris location this week.

Even if I was waiting tables five days a week, I would still be in a break-even situation, and I don't see this changing for six months. It's not worth it for me and my family.\"\n\nAnother factor was that Roberts Crossing frequently hosted special events and private parties, a segment of the food service industry that is effectively gone for the moment.\n\nPrior to the impact of coronavirus, said Glodt, Roberts Crossing was going strong. \"We were not on the way out at all before this, not even close.\n\n\"It's not the service, it's not the food, it's strictly the economics of COVID.\"\n\nIn a mid-pandemic economic model, special occasion restaurants like Roberts Crossing are more vulnerable because of the menu and the style of service they provide. More casual restaurants can serve more guests casual food more quickly. Margins are better on a burger than on a steak, and guests expectations of service are different.\n\nDoes this mean that other fine dining restaurants are more vulnerable? \"Absolutely,\" he said. For Glodt, these factors made Grain Station the more sustainable model of the two.\n\nSaturday was the final night of service at Roberts Crossing. They are redirecting staff to the two Grain Station locations and Glodt is working to keep perspective.\n\n\"We got to build a tremendous amount of relationships there — how lucky are we to get ten years to do that?

All four of us have been through multi-generations of The Striker. We’ve been through different phases and times of The Striker and we also have seen the clientele and the people and how much The Striker means to Portsmouth,” he said. “It’s far beyond being just a restaurant.”\n\n'Chef Boot Camp':The Striker owners to debut in spring 2021\n\nThe Striker’s ownership applied for a grant from the $28.6 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund, established via the American Rescue Plan Act that was signed into law by President Joseph Biden on March 11.\n\nMacDonald said The Striker applied for a grant early on in the process, waiting around for a call that never came. The business, debuting new menu options and a slight makeover to its interior over the winter, reopened on Thursday, April 1, watching as surrounding restaurants applied and received the RRF grant they so desperately hoped to receive after applications opened on May 3.\n\nShould The Striker have received federal funding, MacDonald said, the restaurant could have operated comfortably for upwards of two years.\n\n“We needed some help and unfortunately we made it so close, so close,\" MacDonald said. \"But it goes to show that just because the (COVID-19) restrictions were lifted doesn’t mean that there weren’t repercussions for what’s gone on the last year and a half.”\n\nOverseen by the U.S. Small Business Administration, the RRF received over 372,000 applications from battered food and beverage service owners across the country. By the time applications closed on May 24, the SBA had been asked if they could dole out $76 billion to businesses grappling with the pandemic nationwide, The Striker included.\n\n“It’s (expletive) sad, man. No one wants this ... we love this place, we put our heart and soul into it,” he said.\n\nHad The Striker received an RRF grant, MacDonald said they could have comfortably staffed their team without having members work overtime or experience burnout, as well as opened seven days a week and offered brunch. Though not constrained by current financial hardships, MacDonald said the closure is occurring with the premonition that money will be lost in the future.\n\nThe Striker announced its decision with a “heavy heart” on Facebook Tuesday, prompting restaurant patrons past and present to comment on cherished memories and condolences for the town’s sudden loss. Some recalled The Striker's memorable lobster macaroni and cheese, first drinks after moving to the city being sipped at the restaurant, favorite bartenders and musical acts that have graced the restaurant over 47 years.\n\n“It’s really hard losing a business, but it’s really hard letting down the public,” MacDonald said.\n\nSaturday evening will be The Striker’s last night open for business, and the Facebook post encouraged readers to “come in one last time and have a good time if you so please.”\n\nA musician and freelance writer for Seacoast Media Group, Max Sullivan will play his final performance at The Striker this Friday night with his band, the Max Sullivan Group. He first began playing there last July and has since played at the iconic location several times a month.\n\nHe expects a packed crowd and a night that will be emotional for restaurant regulars and for himself. “When I saw this post, I was heartbroken,” he said.\n\nA few weeks ago, MacDonald got married and naturally headed over to The Striker to celebrate following his wedding. Live music was a must, so Sullivan was asked to perform - an experience that sticks out as a top memory in the year since he began playing there.\n\nSullivan called The Striker “a real bar with real people,” noting the hospitality of The Striker’s ownership exceeded typical experiences he’s had playing at other establishments. Before a recent gig, Sullivan was given a hamburger by ownership, and three burgers were set aside for his band at the conclusion of their performance.\n\n“Most places love you, but they really just were really giving to the musicians. They were really eager to do that,” he said.\n\nMacDonald thanked The Striker’s patrons for supporting the restaurant through the pandemic and throughout the years. Since the announcement caught fire on Facebook, he said he’s received a flood of messages about the closure and has listened to people share stories of their time spent there.\n\nIt's his hope that one day, the business can be revived.\n\n“We hope The Striker name doesn’t disappear forever, that’s for sure. As for now, we can’t maintain it, unless we get a phone call from the federal government saying, ‘We’ve got a check for you,’” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2017/12/13/farewell-these-restaurants-closed-coachella-valley-2017/933281001/", "title": "10 restaurants that closed in the Palm Springs area in 2017", "text": "If there is something we love in the Coachella Valley, it’s food.\n\nAnd this year, the food scene came with a few surprises as we were forced to say goodbye to some our local favorites.\n\nThe restaurant scene in the desert is ever changing, and it can be difficult to keep track of all the openings and closings going on from west to east.\n\nSo, let's take a look back at some of the local restaurants that closed in 2017:\n\nSaying sayonara in Palm Desert\n\nPalm Desert recently said goodbye to a classic Japanese restaurant near El Paseo this year, and we wish we knew what happened.\n\nMatsuri Japanese Restaurant, located at 73759 Highway 111 in Palm Desert, closed permanently sometime this fall, according to a Yelp post by user Shawn A. on October 24.\n\nThe restaurant’s phone has been disconnected and upon visiting the location, the only thing left is a sign on the door that reads “Restaurant is closed for business.

They had no plans to reopen the Chinese restaurant in another location.\n\nChina Jo’s held a four and half star rating on Yelp and was regaining popularity earlier this year once it partnered up with Desert Rolled Ice Cream, offering the trendy dessert.

Garcia-Colson said the problem led to the restaurant not being able to continue without making some changes in management.\n\nAt the time the restaurant closed, Garcia-Colson said she was looking at possibilities to reopen the restaurant at the same location. While there is no reopening date in sight, we might not have said goodbye to dish forever.\n\nDish held a four star rating on Yelp and opened October 1, 2012, in it’s original location in Cathedral City.

They disconnected their phone number, deleted their website, removed the furniture from the establishment and posted a sign on the door that read the place was closed “due to deep cleaning.”\n\nAt the time, The Desert Sun reached out to the restaurant via Facebook and they confirmed that “unfortunately Appetito had to close its doors,” and did not provide additional information.\n\nAppetito opened in 2014 and was quickly named one of Palm Springs’ “Best New Restaurants” by The Hollywood Reporter.

However, it stayed open until December 2 allowing fans to say goodbye.\n\nOwner Donovan Funkey said the decision to close came after months of uncertainty. Their lease hadn’t been renewed since the building had been sold, and staying in limbo, waiting to be told to leave by the landlords was no longer an option.\n\nBar Palm Springs held a three and a half star rating on Yelp and was a popular hangout for valley locals and tourists, alike.\n\nMore:Say it ain't so: A popular downtown Palm Springs lounge is closing its doors this week\n\nAnd then there are those that closed... for a bit\n\nWhile not as sad as the ones we said goodbye to for good, this year also saw some restaurants taking some time off for different, sometimes stressful reasons.\n\nVillage Pub in downtown Palm Springs made headlines when it closed for a little over a month this year after having its liquor license revoked in August.\n\nAccording to the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the first reason for the suspension was an Oct. 22, 2016 incident when an employee \"battered a patron, in or about the licensed premises, causing serious bodily injury.\" The second reason was reported around the same time and involved the restaurant \"employing a person in a managerial capacity who was not qualified\" for the position according to ABC standards.\n\nVillage Pub management used the time off to renovate the bar and opened back up at the end of September.\n\nMore:After suspension and controversy, Village Pub is 'back from rehab' and reopens with a mission\n\nThe Block Sports Bar & Grill in Cathedral City was on the news several times this year because of attacks that occurred at the establishment, one of them resulting in a death.\n\nThe Block closed down August 10, shortly after the fatal shooting, when officials said the business license had expired and owners had failed to respond to a notice of renewal.

If you need me, I'll be at the garage.\"\n\nSaid Fallon: \"I'm really excited to host a show that starts today instead of tomorrow.\"\n\nNBC is plotting the move as a generational shift as Leno, 62, gives way to Fallon, 38. David Letterman is 65, and ABC in January moved Jimmy Kimmel, 45, a half-hour earlier to go head to head with Leno and Letterman. Yet Leno remains the top-rated show, and NBC Universal officials likened the handoff at the No. 1 show to Leno's replacement of Johnny Carson in 1992.\n\nThe difference is that Carson voluntarily retired, while Leno would have remained at Tonight as long as NBC would have him. Leno's current contract expires in September 2014, but the network smoothed the way for the transition, got Leno on board, and the two hosts even teamed up for a jokey video that aired Monday night, suggesting there were no hard feelings.\n\nLeno was displaced once before, in 2009, when NBC shifted Conan O'Brien into the Tonight Show, fulfilling a promise it had made the red-haired comedian five years earlier. But after several months, when O'Brien's ratings faltered and an experimental primetime Leno show failed, NBC reversed course, O'Brien bolted, and Leno returned to Tonight.\n\nMayor Michael Bloomberg weighed in on the move to NYC — and the jobs that move could bring: \"We couldn't be happier that one of New York's own is bringing the show back to where it started,\" he said in a statement.\n\nCNN talk show host Piers Morgan tweeted: \"Hope people stop sniping now and give (Leno) the send-off he deserves.\" Bravo's Andy Cohen tweeted, \"MAZEL to the great @JimmyFallon.\" And actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt tweeted to Fallon, \"Congratulations ... so, so happy + excited for you.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/11/17/conan-end-june-obrien-segue-weekly-hbo-max-series/6326917002/", "title": "Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show gets June finale date, special ...", "text": "Conan O'Brien, capping a 28-year career in late-night TV, will end his nightly TBS talk show on June 24, WarnerMedia announced Monday.\n\nNext month's \"Conan\" finale was initially revealed last fall, with Monday's follow-up announcement promising a lineup of special guests in the final weeks, although no names were shared.\n\nThe finale of the late-night series (Monday through Thursday, 11 EDT/PDT) will run for an hour, double the length of an episode in the show's current form, and \"will look back on the past 11 years of this iteration of O'Brien's lengthy late-night career.\"\n\nFans shouldn't worry about O'Brien disappearing, however. After \"Conan\" ends, the host, 58, will pivot from his current perch at TBS to a weekly variety series on HBO Max, which WarnerMedia has made a top priority. It will be \"a departure\" from his current talk-show format, the company says.\n\nThe November announcement capped speculation that had percolated since 2017, predating the new streaming service.\n\n“In 1993, Johnny Carson gave me the best advice of my career: ‘As soon as possible, get to a streaming platform,’\" O'Brien joked in a statement last fall. \"I’m thrilled that I get to continue doing whatever the hell it is I do on HBO Max, and I look forward to a free subscription.\"\n\nO'Brien, a Harvard-educated former \"Simpsons\" writer, began his late-night career in the 1993 with \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien.\" But his lifelong quest to fill \"The Tonight Show\" shoes of the legendary Johnny Carson proved short-lived, when NBC gave him the show, replacing Jay Leno, only to pull the rug out in January 2010. O'Brien left and landed at TBS, and is the longest-tenured late-night host.\n\nIn 2019, his show was reduced to a half-hour format, a precursor to its eventual demise, and in October he said his Los Angeles set had been burglarized.

If the landing is successful, HAKUTO-R will also become the first commercial spacecraft ever to make a controlled landing on the moon.\n\nThe mission is taking a low energy route to the moon and is due to arrive around April 2023. Once there, the rover will spend one lunar day (equivalent to 14.75 days on Earth) on the surface, conducting its main operations. It will spend a second lunar day conducting secondary operations, to check whether the rover will survive the moon’s tough nighttime environment, before decommissioning.\n\nScheduled to touch down in the Atlas crater the northeast part of the moon, the rover has been designed to withstand the lunar night, when temperatures can reach as low as -183°C, or -297.4°F.\n\nThe Rashid Rover, named after the late Sheikh Rashid Al Saeed, the former ruler of Dubai, will analyze the plasma on the lunar surface and conduct experiments to understand more about lunar dust.

The spacecraft embarked on a journey that is expected to last slightly over a month before landing on the moon’s surface later in August.\n\nApplause and cheers swept through mission control at Satish Dhawan Space Center, where the Indian Space Research Organization’s engineers and scientists celebrated as they monitored the launch of the spacecraft. Thousands of Indians cheered outside the mission control center and waved the national flag as they watched the spacecraft rise into the sky.\n\n“Congratulations India.

It entered the lunar orbit but lost touch with its lander that crashed while making its final descent to deploy a rover to search for signs of water. According to a failure analysis report submitted to the ISRO, the crash was caused by a software glitch.\n\nThe $140-million mission in 2019 was intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits and were confirmed by India’s Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008.\n\nSomanath said the main objective of the mission this time was a safe and soft landing on the moon. He said the Indian space agency has perfected the art of reaching up to the moon, “but it is the landing that the agency is working on.”\n\nNumerous countries and private companies are in a race to successfully land a spacecraft on the lunar surface. In April, a Japanese company’s spacecraft apparently crashed while attempting to land on the moon.

The manned U.S. Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s were closer to the moon's equator. Those sites were chosen because they had fewer craters and emphasis was placed on astronaut safety.\n\nCan’t see our graphics? Click to reload.\n\nWhy is water ice on the moon so important?\n\nThe moon’s south pole is an area that has never been directly explored, though orbiting spacecraft have throughly photographed and mapped the region.\n\nInterest has increased in the lunar south pole because it has water in the form of ice inside large craters. Some of these are known as Permanently Shadowed Regions because they haven't seen direct sunlight for billions of years.\n\nThe water, which could be extracted and used for drinking, breathing and for rocket fuel, makes the area a prime target for long-term exploration of the moon and beyond, NASA says.

After a two-month journey, the spacecraft should land on the moon Feb. 13, 2019, to plant an Israeli flag and to collect scientific data.\n\n\"After eight challenging years, I am filled with pride that the first Israeli spacecraft, which is in its final construction and testing phases, will soon be making its way to the moon,\" said South African-Israeli billionaire and president of the SpaceIL, Morris Kahn, in a statement. \"The launch of the first Israeli spacecraft will fill Israel, in its 70th year, with pride.\"\n\nThe moon launch is the product of SpaceIL's participation in Google's Lunar XC Prize competition that initially promised a $20 million prize for the first non-governmental organization to land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon by 2014. Israel joined the competition set on joining the ranks of the United States, Russia and China in reaching the moon.\n\nNo organization could meet this deadline, however, and the competition ended in March with no winner.\n\nSpaceIL was created in 2011 by three engineers, Yariv Bash, Kfir Damari and Yonatan Winetraub and partnered with Israel Aeronautics Industries. The group continued its work after the competition ended in hopes to \"fulfill the dream of reaching the moon,\" according to SpaceIL.\n\nThe plan is for the small spacecraft to latch on a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX company from the Florida launch point in December. It will then disconnect from the Falcon over 37,000 miles above earth to enter an orbit, expand and get captured by the moon's gravity.\n\nThe organization runs on private donations to support its $95 million project, with $88 million needed for the spacecraft's construction.

The first crewed mission, a three-month stay by three other astronauts, was completed in September 2021. The second, Shenzhou-13, saw three astronauts spend six months in space for the first time.\n\nSix months is the standard mission duration for many countries – but it is an important opportunity for Chinese astronauts to become accustomed to a long-term stay in space and help prepare future astronauts to do the same.\n\nSix space missions have been scheduled before the end of the year, including another crewed mission, two laboratory modules and two cargo missions.\n\nThe team aboard Shenzhou-14 will help with the docking, setting up and testing of the two laboratory modules Wentian and Mengtian, which are set to launch in July and October.\n\nThe modules will be assembled into a T-shaped structure, along with the Tianhe core cabin – the main living space for the astronauts – which will be expanded from 50 cubic meters to 110 cubic meters, the CMSA said. The astronauts will also conduct two to three spacewalks.\n\nAt the end of the Shenzhou-14 mission, another three astronauts are expected to rotate and live with the crew for five to 10 days, bringing the number of Chinese astronauts in space at the same time to a record six.\n\nOnce construction is completed, the Tiangong space station is expected to last for 15 years.

But the chaos of China’s Cultural Revolution stopped the nation’s space effort in its tracks – and progress was postponed until the early 1990s.\n\nSpace administrators picked two classes of astronauts in 1998 and 2010, laying the path for a rapid acceleration in space missions. Aided by the economic reforms of the 1980s, China’s space program quietly progressed until the launch of the first crewed mission in 2003.\n\nThe government has since invested billions of dollars into the space program – and the payoff has been evident. China successfully landed an exploratory rover on the moon in December 2020 and one on Mars in May 2021.

China hopes to become the third nation, after the USA and the former Soviet Union, to achieve a difficult \"soft landing\" on the moon, whereby the spacecraft and equipment remain intact. An earlier Chinese orbiter made an intentional crash-landing on the moon.\n\nThe spacecraft, bearing China's red, five-starred flag, will become the first to visit the moon since the last Soviet unmanned mission there in 1976. One new feature is a ground-penetrating radar to measure the lunar soil and crust. The mission represents the second stage of China's slow but steady lunar program. In phase three, China will send another robotic probe to gather lunar samples, possibly by 2020. A manned mission could then follow.\n\nWhile China's space achievements appear to imitate those of the USA and Soviet Union in decades past, they stir considerable pride and nationalism within China, whose government stresses its use of indigenous technology, and peaceful aims in space.

Legend and literature abound in China's real space program, where the space station that saves the day in Gravity is called the Heavenly Palace, lunar spacecraft are named after moon goddess Chang'e, and the lunar rover is named after her pet rabbit.\n\nWhile China's citizens cannot choose their leaders, they were able to participate in an Internet poll that chose the \"Jade Rabbit\" name.

The crash killed five crew members on the Coast Guard plane, but despite a fire that largely consumed the Japan Airlines Airbus A350, all passengers and crew aboard the commercial flight were able to evacuate safely.\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

No one was injured in the incident, and the flight made a safe emergency landing back at Portland International Airport.\n\nIn a statement on Boeing's website, the aircraft company says: \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers. We agree with and fully support the FAA's decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane. In addition, a Boeing technical team is supporting the NTSB's investigation into last night's event. We will remain in close contact with our regulator and customers.\"\n\nBut the involvement of the 737 Max airplane – previous safety concerns about the aircraft led to it being grounded for nearly two years – suggests there could be repercussions for the already troubled airplane fleet.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has sent investigators to Portland to investigate the incident involving the Boeing 737 Max 9, Flight 1282 bound for Ontario, California.\n\nPlane crash:'Saved by the Bell,' 'Speed Racer' actor Christian Oliver killed in plane crash with 2 daughters\n\nBoeing 737 Max 9 aircrafts grounded by FAA, Alaska Airlines\n\nThe FAA said its Emergency Airworthiness Directive, affecting about 171 airplanes worldwide, would require inspections taking four to eight hours. \"Safety will continue to drive our decision-making as we assist the NTSB's investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282,\" the agency said.\n\nBefore the FAA made their decision, Alaska Airlines had announced that it would be grounded its fleet of 65 Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes. But on Saturday, shortly before the FAA statement, Alaska Airlines said in a post on X that inspections had been done on more than a quarter of its 737 MAX 9 aircraft with \"no concerning findings.\" Flights on the fleet will return to service after successful inspections.\n\nSince the aircraft is used by other airlines including United Airlines, Copa Airlines, Aeromexico and Turkish Airlines – according to data from Cirium, an aviation analytics company – other international agencies will be interested in any findings, too.\n\nUnited Airlines released a statement to USA TODAY saying: \"United has temporarily suspended service on select Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft to conduct an inspection required by the FAA. We are working directly with impacted customers to find them alternative travel options.\"\n\nUSA TODAY spoke with Shem Malmquist, instructor at college of aeronautics at the Florida Institute of Technology, about the Alaska Airlines grounding.\n\n\"To the extent that they need to do anything, the question is: Do they need to ground all the airplanes and look at other ones or can they look at this and say, this was just this particular configuration?\" said Malmquist, a current Boeing 777 captain and experienced accident and safety investigator. \"Until they've looked at it nobody is going to be able to give you a truthful answer.\"\n\nWhat happened to the Boeing 737 Max 9 jet on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282?\n\nAlaska Airlines Flight 1282 was at about 16,000 feet shortly after takeoff when an exit door plug, a section of the fuselage, blew out. The crew reported a \"pressurization issue,\" according to the Federal Aviation Administration. One of the pilots declared an emergency and asked for clearance to descend to 10,000 feet (3 kilometers), the altitude where the air would have enough oxygen to breathe safely.\n\n\"We need to turn back to Portland,” the pilot told controllers in a calm voice that she maintained throughout the landing process.\n\nPassenger Kyle Rinker described to CNN how \"it was really abrupt. Just got to altitude, and the window/wall just popped off and didn’t notice it until the oxygen masks came off.” He posted a picture on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe Alaska Airlines plane apparently had \"plugged\" a section of the plane that could be used as an exit door, with another cabin piece without a door, Malmquist said. The number of exit doors needed on a plane is based on the seating configuration, with more exits required as the number of passengers accommodated rises.\n\nWithout an exit door there \"it's a bit lighter ... and it is a pretty big advantage to do that,\" Malmquist said. If it's determined that this configuration caused the incident, other airlines may not have to cancel any other flights, he said.\n\nWhat could the Alaska Airlines incident mean for other airlines?\n\nAlaska Airlines and investigators will look at whether the incident was caused by \"that configuration or is it a general, larger problem,\" Malmquist said. \"If it's a larger problem it's a big mess because that means it could open other doors or other windows. If it's just the plug windows, that greatly narrows the scope.\"\n\nAny other airline that uses a similar configuration – plugging that exit door – \"is probably going to be proactive,\" he said. \"Airlines that are operating a different configuration may take more of a 'wait and see' (approach). They are going to be watching it closely.\"\n\nWhat is the history of the Boeing 737 Max?\n\nThe aircraft involved in Friday's incident is a new addition to the Alaska Airlines fleet, having received its certification just two months ago, The Associated Press reported. It had flown 145 flights since entering commercial service on Nov. 11, according to FlightRadar24, another tracking service. The flight from Portland was the aircraft’s third of the day.\n\nThe Max is the newest version of Boeing’s venerable 737, a twin-engine, single-aisle plane frequently used on U.S. domestic flights.\n\nThe plane, which went into service in May 2017, has had controversy. Two Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people, resulting in a near two-year worldwide grounding of all Max 8 and Max 9 planes. The planes returned to service only after Boeing made changes to an automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.\n\nLast year, the FAA told pilots to limit use of an anti-ice system on the Max in dry conditions because of concern that inlets around the engines could overheat and break away, possibly striking the plane.\n\nAnd in December, the company told airlines to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.\n\nMalmquist is concerned these continued issues come as a result of Boeing's concern for costs over safety, as the company has offered senior engineers and other employees to retire. \"In the entire process, there's a strong incentive to reduce costs and I think that although people who are in management realize that experience matters in management they don't necessarily realize that also equally applies to all the other various areas,\" he said.\n\nWhat rights do passengers have when an airline grounds its fleets?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Transportation's air consumer website, Alaska Airlines has committed to several remedies for passengers affected by \"controllable\" cancellations.\n\nThose commitments include rebooking travelers on the airline or a partner airline at no additional cost.\n\nPassengers can be given meal, meal cash or vouchers by Alaska Airlines when a cancellation forces them to wait more than three hours for a new flight. They can also receive hotel accommodations, and transportation to and from the hotel, from Alaska Airlines if affected by an overnight cancellation.\n\nPassengers can receive credit, travel vouchers or frequent flyer miles if the canceled flight results in them waiting three hours or more from the scheduled departure time.\n\nBut, according to the DOT website, passengers cannot receive compensation from Alaska Airlines if a cancellation causes a person to wait more than three hours from the departure time.\n\nWhat should travelers learn from the incident?\n\nIn the near-term, if you are traveling soon, check to see if you are traveling on this type of airplane. \"I would consider seeing if you can switch,\" Malmquist said. \"I would see what I can do to take a slightly later flight. That seems to me the logical thing.\"\n\nAnd anytime, travelers should learn to fasten their seatbelts when on a flight. \"I don't ever sit down without my seatbelt buckled,\" Malmquist said. \"More likely, you will hit some turbulence for whatever reason that's not expected and you go flying into the ceiling. That can happen, too.\"\n\nAlso he suggests making sure you have your shoes on during takeoff and landing. If there's a quick evacuation, Malmquist said, \"you don't want to be running across the pavement (without shoes). There might be glass and who knows what else?\"\n\nContributing: Zach Wichter, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2024/01/08/boeing-737-max-alaska-airlines-investigation/72149530007/", "title": "What to know about Boeing 737 MAX jets after Alaska Airlines incident", "text": "An Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, made a dramatic emergency landing late Friday night after a piece of the fuselage burst off at 16,000 feet.\n\nAll the passengers and crew onboard deplaned safely in Portland – surely shaken up – but the flight, which was operated by a Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet, represents just the latest high-profile issue for that troubled narrowbody program.\n\nHere’s where things stand as we head into the week.\n\nWhat happened to Alaska Airlines flight 1282?\n\nShortly after taking off from Portland, a mid-cabin door plug separated from the fuselage.\n\nThe plug was in place because some manufacturers configure their planes in a way that requires more emergency exits onboard. Alaska’s seating configuration did not require that extra exit, so the door frame was blocked instead.\n\nAccording to the airline, some passengers had injuries that required medical attention after landing, but they have all since been cleared.\n\n“This is a very serious event,” Anthony Brickhouse, director of the Forensic Crash Lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told USA TODAY. “We’re very lucky this happened at 16,000 feet instead of 35,000 feet. The results could have been catastrophic.”\n\nHad the incident happened at a higher altitude, Brickhouse said the decompression likely would have been more violent and could have led to more significant structural damage to the aircraft.\n\n“We could easily be talking about a fatal accident if this had happened at 35, 36,000 feet,” he said.\n\nAre Boeing 737 MAX planes still flying?\n\nSome are, but not all. There are two variations of Boeing 737 MAX jets in operation right now: the MAX 8 and MAX 9. A smaller MAX 7 and larger MAX 10 are also expected to enter service this year, pending final regulatory approvals. The plane involved in Friday night’s incident was a MAX 9, and the Federal Aviation Administration has since ordered the grounding of some aircraft of that variant pending inspections of the affected area of the fuselage.\n\nThe order affects about 171 planes worldwide. Alaska Airlines and United Airlines are the main operators of the MAX 9 in the U.S. and expect the grounding to significantly impact their operations in the coming days.\n\n“The 737-9 MAX grounding has significantly impacted our operation. We have canceled 170 Sunday flights and 60 cancellations for Monday, with more expected,” Alaska Airlines said in a statement Sunday night. “Cancellations will continue through the first half of the week, and we encourage guests with travel plans to continue to check their email and alaskaair.com for updates.”\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement on social media that the Department of Transportation prioritizes safety and he supports the FAA’s grounding decision.\n\nUnited Airlines confirmed in a statement to USA TODAY on Monday that it has discovered issues with some of its MAX 9s already.\n\n\"Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug – for example, bolts that needed additional tightening. These findings will be remedied by our Tech Ops team to safely return the aircraft to service,\" the statement said.\n\nWhat problems have Boeing 737 MAX planes previously had?\n\nBoeing’s 737 MAX jets have had a series of issues since entering into service. Two MAX 8 planes, one operated by Lion Air in Indonesia and one by Ethiopian Airlines in Ethiopia, crashed within about six months of each other, killing 346 people between them. Both crashes were attributed to an automated flight control software known by its acronym MCAS, which Boeing developed to compensate for the new generation 737’s changed aerodynamics compared to previous versions of the jet.\n\nThe crashes resulted in the worldwide fleet of 737 MAX being grounded for more than a year and a half, from March 2019 to November 2020.\n\nCruising Altitude:Learn more about airplane layouts and seating configurations\n\nWhat can you do if your flight is affected?\n\nBoth Alaska and United are offering flexible rebooking policies if your flight is affected by the current grounding order.\n\nCheck with your airline and keep an eye out for notifications if you think your travel could be impacted.\n\nHow can you find out what kind of plane is scheduled to operate your flight?\n\nAirlines typically show what kind of planes are scheduled under flight details when you go to book, and in your reservation once your ticket is confirmed. MAX jets sometimes show up as 737-8 and 737-9 (not to be confused with 738 and 739, which typically represent an older, less troubled generation of the narrowbody).\n\nTrip search engine Kayak also allows users to search for flights by aircraft model, including differentiating between MAX 8 and MAX 9 jets.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nWhat’s happening with the Alaska Airlines flight investigation?\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has taken over investigating the incident, but it will take a while before an official report and accounting of the incident is published.\n\nIn the meantime, officials said the door plug that separated from the aircraft was found in the backyard of a teacher in Oregon.\n\n“They’re gathering facts and information so that they can do analysis. They’re looking at the aircraft itself. They’re going to be looking at that piece that was found in the backyard,” Brickhouse said. “The investigation is well underway.”\n\nBrickhouse said one of the key questions investigators will seek to answer is whether the issue that occurred on Friday was caused by a problem with the specific aircraft involved in the incident, or if it’s a broader problem affecting Alaska’s entire fleet of MAX 9s or all MAX 9s regardless of operator.\n\n“The NTSB is investigating and normally it can take over 12 months to complete an investigation, but if they find something in the next few days that is critical to the safety of flight, they’ll make an immediate emergency recommendation,” Brickhouse said. “The planes will remain grounded until they can be inspected and once they are inspected and can pass certain criteria, I would expect them to be back in the air,” though he added it’s unclear how long that might take.\n\nIn a statement, the FAA said it has approved a procedure for the inspections.\n\n\"The FAA’s priority is always keeping Americans safe. In that spirit, Boeing 737-9 aircraft will remain grounded until operators complete enhanced inspections which include both left and right cabin door exit plugs, door components, and fasteners,\" the statement said. \"Operators must also complete corrective action requirements based on findings from the inspections prior to bringing any aircraft back into service.\"\n\nWhat are some of the limitations to aircraft incident investigations?\n\nEvery aircraft accident and incident investigation is different. Still, investigators typically rely on physical evidence, like the door plug in this Alaska Airlines case, as well as some onboard machinery known as the black boxes – or cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders.\n\nOne of the limitations of cockpit voice recorders is they typically only record about two hours’ worth of audio, which can lead to unanswered questions if the incident occurred after a longer flight.\n\nBrickhouse said that even though this incident took place just minutes after takeoff, the cockpit voice recorder continued recording after the plane landed, and by the time investigators retrieved it, all of the audio from the incident had been overwritten.\n\nHe added that the NTSB has been pushing the FAA for years to require longer-duration recorders on commercial aircraft, and said that this incident clearly demonstrates the value of that suggestion.\n\nIs flying still safe?\n\nYes.\n\nDespite two high-profile incidents this year – the Alaska Airlines decompression over the weekend and Japan Airlines’ fiery crash earlier last week – flying is still seen as a very safe way to travel. Five members of the Japanese Coast Guard were killed when the Japan Airlines jet struck their plane on the runway at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, but there have been no fatalities on commercial jets so far this year, despite the shocking images that have come out of the incidents.\n\nBut Brickhouse said passengers also have a role to play in their safety.\n\n“From a passenger safety point of view, this event clearly illustrates, along with the Japan Airlines accident last week, it’s really important to listen to the safety briefing,” he said, adding that it’s a good idea to stay buckled up as much as possible while flying. “Regardless of what that light is telling you, always keep your seatbelt buckled.”\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

Investigators will examine the 63-pound, 48-by-26-inch plug to determine why it separated from the plane.\n\nTwo cellphones, believed to be from the plane, were found nearby.\n\nAuthorities also are examining an auto pressurization warning light, which lit up on three previous flights − on Dec. 7, Jan. 3 and Jan. 4 − to see whether it played a part in the incident. Alaska Airlines restricted the jet from flying to Hawaii so it could land quickly if the warning light reappeared.\n\nWhat happened aboard the aircraft?\n\nFlight 1282 left Portland International Airport for Ontario, California, at about 5:07 p.m. local time Friday. Occupants heard a bang about six minutes into the flight when the fuselage section ripped away.\n\nPassengers later described a loud, chaotic and violent scene of wind howling through the plane.

Crew and passengers donned oxygen masks.\n\nThe FAA grounded more than 170 Boeing 737 MAX 9 jets for inspection after the incident. Alaska Airlines and United Airlines are the main operators of the MAX 9 in the U.S.\n\nWhat is an aircraft door plug?\n\nBoeing uses door plugs to cover unused emergency exits on most of its 737 MAX 9 jets. The door plug is visible from outside the plane but looks like a regular partition and window from the inside.\n\nBoeing constructs its 737s with emergency exits behind the aircraft’s wings. That’s in accordance with federal law, which says planes must be built to allow evacuation of all passengers within 90 seconds even if half of its exits are blocked.\n\nAirlines can choose either door plugs or emergency exits when they configure seating arrangements on the aircraft. Boeing's 737 MAX 9 can be fitted with up to 220 seats.\n\nFederal law requires MAX jets with more than 200 seats to have the extra emergency exits in use. Planes with fewer seats can use door plugs. The option has been an industry standard for years.\n\nFlight 1282 has 189 seats and carried 171 passengers and six crew.\n\nFour bolts hold the door plugs in place. The plugs have hinges at the bottom and can be unbolted and swung open about 15 degrees from the outside.\n\n______\n\nCONTRIBUTING Emily DeLetter, Zach Wichter and Suhail Bhat, USA TODAY\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; National Transportation Safety Board; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/01/23/boeing-737-max-9-faa-inspections/72311142007/", "title": "Boeing 737 jets should get door plugs checked: FAA", "text": "The FAA is expanding safety inspections of Boeing 737 door plugs beyond the company’s MAX 9 models to the older and larger fleet of 737-900ER jets.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is advising airlines to \"visually inspect mid-exit door plugs to ensure the door is properly secured,\" in a safety alert issued Sunday.\n\nThe announcement comes in the aftermath of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, a MAX 9 jet that lost a mid-cabin door plug shortly after takeoff on Jan. 5. The plug is a fuselage panel that covers an unused door opening.\n\nThe 900ER jets aren't part of the MAX fleet, but they have the same door plug design as the MAX 9s.

And today is Tuesday, January 9th, 2024. This is The Excerpt. Today, the latest problem surrounding a Boeing aircraft. Plus a Texas hotel explodes. And finding a remote job might be getting harder.\n\n♦\n\nAn Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California made a dramatic emergency landing late Friday night after part of the plane side burst off at 16,000 feet. All passengers and crew deplaned safely after the emergency landing. Shortly after taking off, a mid-cabin door plug separated from the fuselage, the main body section of an aircraft. Experts say the incident could have been catastrophic had it happened at a higher altitude. It's the latest incident for Boeing 737 MAX line of planes. The Federal Aviation Administration is grounding nearly 200 737 MAX 9 jets following the incident. And United Airlines and Alaska Airlines both said they found loose parts on numerous grounded MAX 9 planes. Previously, two Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019 killing hundreds of people. All the planes were grounded worldwide for nearly two years until Boeing made changes to an automated flight control system.\n\n♦\n\nAt least 21 people were injured after an explosion yesterday rattled a hotel building in Fort Worth, Texas according to authorities. One person was in critical condition and another four were seriously injured, according to a medical spokesperson. The Fort Worth Fire Department said the smell of gas spread throughout the city's downtown area and investigators are confident the blast was some kind of gas explosion. Photos of the explosion showed windows and debris blown out and scattered across the street. The blast took place at a historic building that dates back to 1920.\n\n♦\n\nFinding a remote job is getting harder, especially if you want a high earning one. But remote work isn't going away altogether anytime soon. I spoke with USA Today money reporter, Bailey Schulz, about the latest numbers. Bailey, thanks for hoping on.\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nYeah, thank you for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Bailey, what does research show about the recent dip in remote and hybrid job postings? And how is this dip especially prominent among high paying jobs?\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nSo after seeing a spike in hybrid and remote job opportunities during the pandemic, DAD does show that these numbers are going down. So there's a new report that just came out recently that shows that this is especially prevalent among high paying jobs with the number of six figure hybrid job postings down nearly 70% at the end of 2023 compared to the previous quarter. The Ladders, the career site behind this report says that the dip comes as companies want their highest earners back in the office. And then when you have experts looking at the overall dip in remote work and hybrid work, they say that this might be a sign of the cooling labor markets with jobs that are typically remote-friendly, posting fewer jobs overall.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nInteresting stuff. So what sectors are seeing the biggest dips in remote work openings right now?\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nYeah. So this report we have from career site Ladders shows that there was a dip in high paying hybrid job postings across all sectors. But this decline was especially prevalent in healthcare where the number of hybrid jobs went from making up about 11% of postings in the third quarter of last year to closer to 4% in the fourth quarter.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat reasons do experts give for these dips, Bailey?\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nExperts have points of both the cooling labor market, which means fewer job postings overall and also companies push for employees to return to the office for work.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd you did write that remote work is clearly not going away anytime soon. What can we expect for these types of positions in the coming years?\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nYeah. So we know that the overall work from home numbers have been dropping from their peak back in 2020, but the interesting thing is that these numbers have sort of tapered off and have remained flats for the most part through 2023. So experts are saying we might even see a rebound in work from home numbers as companies adjust to work from home trends.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat advice do experts give for finding remote work going forward?\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nSo there's a lot of competition for these positions and experts say that people looking for remote jobs should, one, schedule time every week dedicate to the job search, but also make sure that those goals and their search is realistic. So don't spend every second of your free time sending applications and also be prepared to hear the word no. Another tip is to set up alerts on various job sites to stay on top of these new job postings and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGreat advice. Bailey Schulz covers money for USA Today. Thanks as always, Bailey.\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nYeah, thank you for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA congressional budget deal could deflate an IRS effort to pursue wealthy tax cheats. President Joe Biden added nearly $80 billion in new IRS funding to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. That money was supposed to be set aside to collect unpaid taxes from the wealthy and to improve the agency's customer service among other uses. But Congressional Republicans have been chipping away at the windfall and in a bipartisan budget agreement announced on Sunday the IRS would lose $20 billion of the new funding this year, according to a Politico report. Republican lawmakers have pushed for IRS cuts arguing that a campaign of audits would hurt small businesses and regular Americans. Biden himself and Republican then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy previously agreed to reduce the appropriation by $20 billion last spring.

Though Jack said that he was fine, Bartlett said that he had redness and scratches on his skin, which could have been caused by windburn.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later the plane made an emergency landing in Portland.\n\n\"After only the first few minutes of chaos, the plane was under control and we knew we were descending back to PDX,\" wrote Bartlett. \"I never felt like we were going to crash.

I’ve had the chance to cover the airplane program at virtually every outlet I’ve written for since those first crashes, and so when I saw the news about Alaska Airlines flight 1282 – which lost a door plug midflight on Friday evening – I knew it was another chapter for both the plane and me.\n\nThe MAX is the company’s bestselling jet of all time, but it’s been a thorn in the company’s side. There’s steep competition for efficient single-aisle planes with Airbus, Boeing’s main competitor and manufacturer of the equally popular A320 family of planes. New efficiencies in recent generations of the Airbus led Boeing to develop the MAX in the first place.\n\nSeeing this latest MAX incident left me wondering first whether the plane was safe, and then, whether its reputation would ever recover.\n\nExperts assure me the answer to both questions is yes.\n\n“The immediate response by the (Federal Aviation Administration) and the manufacturer and the airlines was to instantly ground those particular models of aircraft that have this type of configuration,” Laura Einsetler, a pilot for a major U.S. airline and author of the Captain Laura blog told me. “Once this situation is remedied and they can find the cause, the root source cause, the fact that the safety record has been so good to this point, it’s not a concern of mine that the aircraft will continue to be very safe and secure for passengers and crew.”\n\nEinsetler is qualified to fly Boeing 737 MAX planes, though she’s working on 757 and 767 aircraft.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst and managing director at Aerodynamic Advisory, said he’s confident the issue with MAX jets will be addressed quickly and have little impact on customer confidence.\n\n“The question most people ask these days is how quickly can they resume ramping up MAX production and I don’t think this will be a major crimp in that,” he said. “At the end of the day, airlines are keeping the faith.”\n\nEven so, it felt like a good time to take stock of the 737 MAX’s history. And I’ll confess that in the back of my mind, I still wonder if the jet’s reputation will ever really recover.\n\nThe FAA announced on Tuesday that the affected planes would remain grounded indefinitely as inspection and remediation procedures are ironed out.\n\nBoeing 737 MAX development\n\nAirbus announced a more efficient version of its popular A320 single-aisle family, the A320neo, in 2010. Airlines, constantly looking for cost savings in a tight-margin business, were eager to try out the jet and orders began stacking up. That put Boeing behind its main competitor, leaving them with a decision: should they produce another generation of their bestselling 737 or start fresh with a new design, rather than relying on an airframe developed as a workhorse in the 1960s?\n\nUltimately, the question came down to cost. It was cheaper to stretch and redesign the existing plane than to start from scratch, and faster development was a competitive advantage. So, Boeing unveiled its plans for the 737 MAX, an update to its venerable family of short-to-mid-range jets. The MAX would have larger, more efficient engines and be able to accommodate more passengers than earlier generations of the 737. But those bigger engines posed a problem for Boeing. They changed the aerodynamics of the plane, which could have wiped out some of the efficiencies Boeing was hoping to deliver.\n\nDifferent aerodynamics mean different flying characteristics and different flying characteristics meant that pilots could be required to undergo costly training to fly the newest 737s. To stay competitive, Boeing needed to make the new jets fly like their older cousins. If pilots had to get retrained, the cost-savings of keeping the 737 going would likely be erased, or at least greatly eroded.\n\nThe development of MCAS\n\nTo keep the newest 737s feeling familiar to pilots, Boeing developed software called the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or MCAS. It automatically compensated for the changed aerodynamics of the new jets. But Boeing applied to the FAA to leave any mention of the system out of the pilot manual, and that application was approved. The plane was flying for more than a year before most pilots even knew MCAS existed.\n\nLion Air 737 MAX crash\n\nThe first major incident for Boeing’s 737 MAX family was the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 on Oct. 29, 2018. The MAX 8 operating that flight plunged into the Java Sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nBoeing initially hesitated to identify MCAS as a contributor to the crash, but some details of the system’s performance emerged within days of the incident. By early November, the team I was working on at The Times was reporting on how flight control software may have contributed to the crash.\n\nEven so, the plane kept flying.\n\nEthiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash\n\nMonths later, on March 11, 2019, another 737 MAX 8 crashed shortly after takeoff. Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 was heading from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Nairobi, Kenya, when MCAS again activated shortly after takeoff, pushing the plane to the ground and killing all 157 people on board.\n\nThe FAA did not ground the U.S. fleet of MAX jets until March 13, but that order ultimately stayed in force until Nov. 18, 2020.\n\nWarning signs at Boeing\n\nWhile the planes were grounded, a trove of internal Boeing documents was released. By that time, I was writing for The Points Guy and still covering the story.\n\nAmong the revelations: Lion Air had specifically asked Boeing to include a training mandate for the new aircraft, which Boeing officials still feared could tarnish the program.\n\nIn an instant message between employees that was distributed in a June 2017 email, more than a year before the fatal Lion Air crash, one Boeing worker said, \"Now frigging Lion Air might need a sim to fly the MAX, and maybe because of their own stupidity. I'm scrambling trying to figure out how to unscrew this now!\"\n\nWhat caused the crashes\n\nIn both MAX crashes, MCAS was identified as a key cause. Flaws in its design, including relying on data from only one sensor and the decision not to notify pilots of its existence, all but doomed the Lion Air and Ethiopian flights.\n\nWhen the MAX family of jets returned to the skies in November 2020, regulators assured the public that the planes were safe and that issues with MCAS had been rectified, but many travelers swore they would never fly the plane.\n\nThe latest 737 MAX incident\n\nFor Boeing, Alaska Airlines flight 1282’s explosive decompression was surely an unwelcome development.\n\nWhile the safety record of the MAX has been fine since it returned to service in 2020, the cloud of the plane’s early career disasters continues to shadow the program.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the plane involved in Friday’s incident was a MAX 9, a slightly larger version than the MAX 8s that operated the infamous Lion Air and Ethiopian flights.\n\nThe issue on Friday has been identified as a poorly installed plug over a spot that could accommodate an extra emergency exit in certain aircraft configurations. Early inspections by U.S. airlines have already revealed similar faults in other MAX 9s, suggesting that it was only a matter of time before a flight experienced this kind of failure.\n\nThe FAA has ordered airlines to stop flying some of their MAX 9s until the jets can be inspected and any door plug issues remedied, but I have to imagine that even if the planes soon return to the skies, Boeing executives may continue to worry about what other shoes may yet drop on this family of aircraft.\n\nGraphics by Karl Gelles, Ramon Padilla, George Petras, Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

Plant capacity had already been cut after a nearby coal mine was flooded and authorities urged residents to save energy to avoid brown-outs.\n\nPrime Minister Aleksandar Vucic told a press conference that new wave of flooding on the Sava River will hit Sunday evening.\n\n\"Our primary concern is to protect the power plant,\" said Vucic. \"We are doing all we can.\"\n\nThousands of volunteers responded to government's appeal to build up flood defenses along the Sava. Bused in from all over the country, the volunteers worked around the clock, stacking up sandbag barricades with soldiers and emergency crews. The town of Sremska Mitrovica was a particular concern.\n\n\"You can feel the solidarity everywhere. People are doing everything they can. I am seeing children and older people shoveling sand and carrying sandbags and no one finds this labor hard,\" said volunteer Marinko Trivunovic.\n\n\"I'm proud of the fact that I'm from Belgrade and I've come here to help these people to save their homes. By saving this city, we're saving the whole country,\" said volunteer Nemanja Radovic.\n\nInternational help poured into the two nations. A Russian team joined the rescue efforts in Serbia. Rescue teams from Luxembourg, Slovenia and Croatia were already in Bosnia, and others from the U.K., Austria and Macedonia were expected.\n\nResidents in both countries mobilized through Facebook or other social media, collecting tons of food, blankets and clothing for the crisis-hit areas.\n\nFrom the Italian Open in Rome, Serbia's best tennis player, Novak Djokovic, appealed for flood volunteers on his Twitter account.\n\n\"Support for everyone!

Ross and her husband spent the afternoon checking on neighbors and attempting to keep nearby culverts clear of debris. The Cathedral City Fire Department also came to the park this afternoon to help evacuate several people out of their homes who couldn’t get past the rushing water in the road.\n\n“It’s a senior citizen mobile home park, many of our people are in their 80s.

Larson Foundation Trauma Center. In one photo, an abandoned golf cart sits submerged in water.\n\nBut Lee Rice, the medical center’s public information officer, said that none of it has affected any patient care areas of the hospital.\n\n“Fortunately, it hasn’t had any impact on our patient care areas,” Rice said. “So, it’s business as usual for us.”\n\nOnline videos showed the inside of Eisenhower with a small amount of water in the back hallways, with towels on the floor to absorb the moisture.\n\nRice said that some of the flooding has merely forced Eisenhower to divert ambulances to another section of the hospital that has not experienced the effects of the ongoing rainfall that has come with Tropical Storm Hilary.\n\nEisenhower is in its slower time of year, which is typical during the summer months, Rice said. She added that it has helped Eisenhower avoid any serious challenges during the storm.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Eisenhower closed urgent care facilities in Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and La Quinta but left Emergency Department services open and available to the community as needed.\n\n—Andrew John\n\nCenter of storm nears Coachella Valley\n\nAt 5 p.m., the National Hurricane Center reported the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was located 25 miles south-southwest of Palm Springs and moving north at 23 mph.\n\nAs Hilary moved closer to the Coachella Valley, strong winds have picked up.

The school said it is anticipating some minor damage caused by flooding and leaks.\n\nCollege of the Desert will also be closed on Monday, although classes for the new semester are not set to begin until next week. College of the Desert \"currently has a lot of water and debris on site,\" and the Palm Desert campus has also \"experienced some water intrusion in key areas.\"\n\nSchool officials are asking everyone to remain off campus, and \"no business will be conducted at any location, with the exception of COD’s Maintenance Team and Campus Safety Team, who will help assess the damage and determine any challenges to student or work spaces.\" Regular business is expected to resume on Tuesday.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio and Erin Rode\n\nStorm shelter at Desert Mirage High School\n\nDesert Mirage High School in Thermal is being used as a temporary storm shelter, according to the Coachella Valley Unified School District.\n\nThe shelter is open to the public and includes a dedicated reception area and a cooling zone. The district said it expects the shelter to be open until Monday or Tuesday afternoon, with more information to be sent out as the storm continues.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nPalm Springs declares local emergency\n\nPalm Springs City Manager Scott Stiles has declared a local emergency because of the storm, city spokesperson Amy Blaisdell said.\n\nShe said the declaration opens up access to extra resources, such as funds for repairs from storm damage and more flexibility with emergency purchases.\n\nCity law gives the manager the authority to proclaim a local emergency, but it must be ratified by the city council within seven days or it becomes invalid.\n\nMore road closures across valley\n\nMore roads are closing across the Coachella Valley as police advise residents not to drive. Closures were being announced frequently; below is only a partial list:\n\nPalm Springs: Police announced the closure of two more roads in Palm Springs. Farrell Drive was closed between Ramon Road and Mesquite Road.\n\nEl Cielo Road was also closed at Mesquite Avenue, while the Dinah Shore Bridge is closed from Palm Springs to Cathedral City. Golf Club Drive is also closed at the Whitewater Wash.\n\nIndian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino were already closed at the washes.\n\nCathedral City: Cathedral Canyon Drive and Dinah Shore Drive were also closed by Cathedral City Police. Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive was already closed.\n\nEast valley: 66th Street was closed between Van Buren Street and Jackson Street. Box Canyon Road from Interstate 10 to the All American Canal was closed in the Mecca area.\n\nEven in areas where roads weren't fully closed, conditions were treacherous. Just after 4 p.m., two of the three eastbound lanes of Highway 111 were closed due to rocks in the road at the Cathedral City-Rancho Mirage border.\n\nPalm Springs Police Lt. Gustavo Araiza advised residents to avoid travel in the city unless absolutely necessary and to drive with extreme caution if they must.\n\n“We don’t need collisions tying up resources,” he said.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio, Jay Calderon\n\nNewsom, Palm Springs officials discuss storm preparedness, bridge request in Sunday visit\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom stopped in Palm Springs on Sunday as Tropical Storm Hilary wrecked havoc on the Coachella Valley. He met with Palm Springs city councilmembers and staff in the city’s emergency operations center.\n\nNewsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California on Saturday to support the Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nThe city posted photos of the visit on its Facebook page Sunday, explaining that city staff updated the governor on the city’s storm preparations while Newsom offered “whatever assistance he could provide to the city.” The post noted that Newsom had been “instrumental in bringing Oakland Urban Search and Rescue and Swift Water California OES Task Force teams to Palm Springs,\" where they were going to be used to assist with rescues during the storm.\n\nThey also discussed the city's request for an elevated bridge on North Indian Canyon Drive over the Whitewater Wash. The Coachella Valley Association of Governments has been trying to secure funding for such a bridge, which would reduce the need for rain and wind-related closures.\n\nPhotos show Newsom adding his name to the Emergency Operations Center sign-in sheet during his visit. Palm Springs Mayor Grace Garner, City Councilmember Lisa Middleton, City Manager Scott Stiles, Police Chief Andrew Mills and Fire Chief Paul Alvarado are pictured meeting with Newsom during the visit.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nUpdated rain totals: Palm Desert sees 1.18 inches by 2 p.m.\n\nHeavy rain has moved through the Coachella Valley and brought soaking rains that have flooded many streets and intersections. Here are the latest rain totals from the National Weather Service as of 2 p.m., with rain still falling.\n\nPalm Desert 1.18 inches\n\nCathedral Canyon 1 inch\n\nThermal airport 0.91 inches\n\nPalm Springs Airport 0.89 inches\n\nLower Tahquitz Creek 0.86 inches\n\nFlash flood, severe thunderstorm warning issued for some Coachella Valley cities\n\nThe National Weather Service in San Diego has issued Flash Flood Warnings for most of the Coachella Valley until 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nSome locations that will experience flash flooding include Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, Indio, Coachella, Thermal, La Quinta, Mecca and the Santa Rosa Mountain.\n\nAt 1:51 p.m., doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated heavy rain falling across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 to 1 inch in 1 hour. Hourly rainfall rates in Palm Desert have exceeded 0.75 inches per hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\n\nAt 1:40 p.m., doppler radar indicated heavy rain across the warned area. Rainfall rates of three-quarters of an inch per hour are occurring.\n\nFlash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly. The weather service warns life threatening flash flooding is possible from heavy rain, particularly of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.\n\nMotorists should turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary: Heavier rain, winds forecast for Palm Springs area Sunday\n\nThe Coachella Valley remains under a tropical storm warning on Sunday morning, and a flood watch is in effect until 5 p.m. on Monday. Light rain is falling at Palm Springs International — as of 8 a.m., 0.32 inches had fallen since midnight — and the temperature is a cool 78 degrees with 88% humidity and 6-mph winds out of the southwest, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBut more rain, and heavier wind, is on the way. Thunderstorms are in the forecast throughout the day, with an additional two to four inches of rain expected in the valley, along with wind gusts of up to 40 to 50 mph. Temps are expected to top out at 86 degrees.\n\nNWS Meteorologist Adam Roser said the biggest threat in the Coachella Valley is \"definitely flash flooding.\"\n\n\"Many of the mountain roads going into the valley are very vulnerable,\" he said. \"As are any of those that go over those washes and things like that.'\n\nRoser said most of the rain will fall in heavy bands that could potentially produce 2 inches of rain an hour in the afternoon. There also remains a small chance of tornadoes in the valley, he said.\n\n\"WIth tropical storm systems, any tornadoes are usually weak and brief, but the storm prediction center does have around a 5% chance of a tornado occurring in the area,\" he said.\n\nThe rain and wind will likely be finished by the time most people are waking up on Monday morning, Roser said.\n\n— Kate Franco, Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nHow much rain has fallen so far?\n\nSo far, Tropical Storm Hilary has brought a light but steady rainfall to the Coachella Valley, but weather forecasts advise the rain should become heavier on Sunday afternoon and evening.\n\nAs of noon, official National Weather Service rain totals included 0.40 at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.46 in Thermal at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport, 0.46 in Thousand Palms and 0.36 in Palm Desert.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHilary makes landfall over Baja California\n\nThe now-downgraded Tropical Storm Hilary made landfall along Mexico's Baja California coast Sunday as concerns mounted over the storm causing what could be deadly flash flooding in the border city of Tijuana, Southern California and places as far north as Idaho that rarely get such heavy rain.\n\nHilary hit the coast in a sparsely populated area about 150 miles south of Ensenada.\n\nThe storm has already caused flooding in places across Mexico’s arid peninsula and threatens to unleash torrential rains on mudslide-prone Tijuana, where many improvised houses cling to steep hillsides just south of the U.S. border.\n\nForecasters warned the storm could cause extreme flooding, mudslides and even tornadoes. Parts of the U.S. Southwest could be hit with once-in-a-century rains and there is a good chance Hilary could break all-time records as the wettest known tropical cyclone to douse Nevada, Oregon and Idaho.\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Pacific time, Hilary was located about 215 miles south-southeast of San Diego, the National Hurricane Center reported. Hilary had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and was moving northwest at 25 mph.\n\nThe Mexican cities of Ensenada and Tijuana, directly in the storm’s path, closed all beaches and opened a half-dozen shelters at sports complexes and government offices.\n\n—The Associated Press\n\nEvacuation order near Banning\n\nRiverside County has issued an evacuation order north of Banning and near the Morongo Reservation as the worst of Tropical Storm Hilary's impacts approach.\n\nThe county's emergency management department announced the order late Sunday morning for the Mias zone in the Apple/ElDorado burn scar.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSplash House says it will carry on amid storm\n\nOrganizers of Splash House said the Palm Springs pool party and music festival will go on Sunday despite Tropical Storm Hilary's expected inundation of the Coachella Valley and the rest of Southern California.\n\nEarlier in the weekend, the festival had been moved inside at the three hotels where it's held, which are miles apart.\n\n\"We're gonna keep it real with you — we're not big fans of today's projected weather,\" organizers wrote in an Instagram post about 10 a.m. Sunday. \"But we are big fans of keeping this party going safely. Let's take things inside and close out this weekend in unprecedented style!\"\n\nEvents will be at the Renaissance, Margaritaville Resort and Saguaro Palm Springs hotels between about 1 p.m. and 9 p.m., according to an online schedule.\n\n\"Shuttles with run as planned between hotels,\" the Instagram post said, without addressing the possible heavy rain — predicted to be as much as two inches an hour at times Sunday afternoon.\n\nLocal and national officials, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have advised people to stay indoors and off the roads during the storm.\n\nLater, organizers seemingly acknowledged the storm could make it hard for festival attendees from out of town to drive or fly out as scheduled. They posted a list of hotels that were offering late checkout and discounted rates for extending stays.\n\n—Eric Hartley\n\nMost flights canceled out of Palm Springs on Sunday\n\nAhead of the anticipated impacts from now Tropical Storm Hilary, a majority of airlines have canceled flights in and out of Palm Springs International Airport on Sunday.\n\nAs of 9 a.m., only five of 15 flight arrivals through 6 p.m were still scheduled. United, American and WestJet all canceled flights into the airport. Southwest Airlines canceled its entire Sunday schedule at the airport a day earlier.\n\nDelta’s flight from Salt Lake City to Palm Springs that arrives at 12:18 p.m. Sunday was one of the few still scheduled.\n\nEight of 10 evening flight arrivals into Palm Springs were still scheduled, as were several evening departures, but airport officials cautioned anyone flying to check ahead with their airline before arriving at the airport.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary within striking distance of Baja early Sunday\n\nThe National Weather Center in Miami said in the most recent advisory at 2 a.m. that Hurricane Hilary was about 30 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 385 miles from San Diego, California. The maximum sustained wind speed remained unchanged at 85 mph while spreading “heavy rains” northward over the peninsula.\n\nMeteorologists warned that despite weakening, the storm remained treacherous. Forecasters said the storm was still expected to enter the history books as the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, bringing flash floods, mudslides, isolated tornadoes, high winds and power outages.\n\nElizabeth Adams, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service San Diego office, said rain could fall up to 3 inches an hour across the desert and mountains surrounding the Coachella Valley and beyond from late Sunday morning into the afternoon. The intense rainfall during those hours could cause widespread and life-threatening flash floods.\n\nOne person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalia, on the peninsula’s eastern coast, when a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream. Rescue workers managed to save four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege township.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether officials considered the fatality related to the hurricane, but video posted by local officials showed torrents of water coursing through the town’s streets.\n\nThe forecast prompted authorities to issue an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, urging residents and beachgoers to leave the tourist destination 23 miles off the coast.\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nHurricane Hilary: Storm drops 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Sunday\n\nAs of 7 a.m. Sunday, rainfall totals since midnight were 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.41 inches at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in Thermal and 0.29 inches in Thousand Palms, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nRain totals so far Sunday in Palm Springs area\n\nPreliminary precipitation data from the National Weather Service's San Diego station shows 24-hour rain totals as of 5 a.m. Sunday in the Coachella Valley vary from 0.86 inches in Thermal to 0.04 inches in Indio Hills. Palm Springs International Airport reported 0.18 inches of rain so far.\n\nThermal: 0.86 inches\n\nMorongo Valley: 0.39 inches\n\nDesert Hot Springs: 0.31 inches\n\nPalm Springs International Airport: 0.18 inches\n\nPalm Desert: 0.16 inches\n\nIndio Hills: 0.04 inches\n\n— Kate Franco\n\nRoad closures in Palm Springs, Cathedral City\n\nPalm Springs: Indian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino will be closed at the washes until further notice in preparation of potential flooding due to Hurricane Hilary, the Palm Springs Police Department announced late Saturday.\n\nCathedral City: Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive has been closed, city officials said Saturday.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declares State of Emergency\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California Saturday to support the Hurricane Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nHeavy rainfall and high winds were expected to last through Monday. At the governor's direction, there were currently more than 7,500 boots on the ground deployed to help local communities protect Californians from the impacts of Hilary.\n\nThe governor also signed an emergency proclamation in San Diego while visiting with California National Guard troops. He met with first responders and local officials, including San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. He was also in touch with federal officials, including the White House.\n\nThe Emergency Medical Services Authority has assets on standby, including California Medical Assistance Teams to augment local capacity, aid in evacuations and support medical needs in communities impacted by flooding. The EMSA was ready to assist with Ambulance Strike Teams as necessary to support local communities. The Flood Operations Center is activated and has prepositioned flood-fight materials should they be needed.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSandbag availability low, exhausted in some valley cities\n\nSand and sandbags are no longer available at local fire stations in Palm Desert as of Saturday afternoon. Instead, residents can find these resources at the Palm Desert Civic Center, 43-900 San Pablo Ave., Palm Desert.\n\nRancho Mirage ran out of sand at its distribution site at the Rancho Mirage Library & Observatory parking lot, so many people took their empty bags to a nearby empty lot to fill them with sand straight from the ground. Empty sandbags are still available for Rancho Mirage residents at Fire Station 69 at 71-751 Gerald Ford Drive. Proof of Rancho Mirage address is required.\n\nIndian Wells announced mid-afternoon on Saturday that sandbags are no longer available from that city, and residents are encouraged to seek supplies from local home improvement stores, instead.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nHurricane Hilary: How experts say you should prepare\n\nTwo Palm Springs emergency officials have some advice for valley residents on how they can prepare their homes and themselves for the storm. The officials are Capt. Nathan Gunkel of the city fire department and Daniel DeSelms, Palm Springs’ emergency management coordinator.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nThey said residents should make sure they have enough food and water to make it through a few days, including food that can be eaten if the power goes out.\n\nThey also recommended preparing for the power outages by charging their cellphones and making sure they have flashlights and batteries on hand. DeSelms said he generally recommends using flashlights rather than candles because of the fire risks that come with candles.\n\nIn general, they said residents should be prepared to remain at home for multiple days as it will likely be unsafe to go out during the storm and roads could potentially remained closed or impassable even after it passes.\n\nGunkel recommended that residents make sure they know how to get out of their neighborhoods in the event the city does need to evacuate, keeping in mind that roads like Indian Canyon Drive and Gene Autry Road will likely be impassable. However, he said people should remember it is impossible to anticipate which other roads may be closed.\n\nTo protect your home:\n\nBoth DeSelms and Gunkel recommend residents make use of the free sandbags Palm Springs and other cities and agencies are providing, particularly if their homes have ever experienced flooding in the past. It often makes sense to place sand bags in front of the front door or other places where water might pool, Gunkel said.\n\nDeSelms also said those with leaky roofs can put a tarp over them. However, he cautioned that it is important to try to make sure the tarp will be secured enough to withstand the strong expected winds.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/962266/how-burning-man-descended-into-chaos", "title": "How Burning Man descended into chaos | The Week", "text": "More than 70,000 festival-goers were left stranded this weekend after heavy rain turned Burning Man into a mudbath.\n\nA “mass exodus” was expected this morning as conditions eased enough to allow people to start leaving, said the BBC.

But after it was hit by the remnants of Hurricane Hilary, organisers closed the entrance and exit gates and told the tens of thousands of attendees to conserve food, fuel and water.\n\nThe muddy conditions also obstructed the ability of organisers to move heavy equipment, including for fire safety, said the Burning Man Traffic social media account.\n\nAt first, many revellers “took the boggy conditions in their stride – dancing in the mud and holding karaoke parties”, said the BBC. But by Sunday the “sense of exhilaration had been replaced by a growing air of exasperation, with people increasingly keen to leave”.\n\nThe portable toilets at the site are usually cleaned “multiple times a day”, but specialist trucks had not been able to reach the site since the rain started on Friday, said the New York Post.\n\nAn unnamed Los Angeles-based doctor told Insider that dirty toilets and bad weather had put stranded revellers at risk of Covid-19, food poisoning and other hygiene-related bugs. “The port-a-potties are probably going to start overflowing,” he said, “and that’s gonna mix with the mud and the rain, and it’s going to possibly spread infectious diseases.”\n\nAs some understandably panicked, others put a brave face on it. “Survival mode, here we go,” Max Spooner, who was walking the grounds with a mattress strapped to his back, told USA Today.\n\nOthers chose to attempt the six-mile hike to the nearest highway, where organisers had previously said shuttle buses would be available. One of the hikers, the former Obama administration official and Supreme Court lawyer Neal Katyal, wrote on Twitter that the walk was “incredibly harrowing”.\n\nThe site is “far from major cities”, said The New York Times, as “the nearest is Reno, Nev., which is more than 100 miles away”. To get to Burning Man, people must either make it to the “two-lane rural highway that leads to the festival’s gate or fly into its small, temporary airport”, it added, noting that “both were still closed on Sunday”.\n\nMore rain expected\n\nOfficials revealed on Saturday that one person had died at the festival. The following day, Burning Man Communications said in a statement that the death was “unrelated to the weather”. The Pershing County Sheriff’s Office is still investigating the cause of the death.\n\nMeanwhile, said the US Bureau of Land Management, “more rain is expected over the next few days” and “conditions are not expected to improve enough” to allow vehicles to enter the site.\n\nBurning Man is a “celebration of self-expression that culminates in the ceremonial burning of a towering 40ft effigy”, said Sky News. But organisers said they had postponed the event’s traditional finale to Monday evening.\n\nThe organisers have also released a “2023 Wet Playa Survival Guide”, said SF Gate, which attempted to assure those stranded at the site that “we have done table-top drills for events like this” and “we will all get out of this, it will just take time”.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Devika Rao", "Rafi Schwartz", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Felicity Capon", "Harriet Marsden", "Jo Davey"], "publish_date": "2023/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/08/18/hurricane-hilary-friday-path-map/70616204007/", "title": "Hurricane Hilary projected path headed for California.

He said Los Angeles, Anaheim, Santa Barbara and San Diego could see about 4 inches of rainfall while desert areas like Palm Springs and the Sierra Nevadas face the potential of 4 to 8 inches.\n\nHilary is expected to weaken into a Category 3 hurricane by late afternoon Saturday, and diminish into a tropical storm by Sunday afternoon.\n\nResidents brace for Hilary with sandbags\n\nEmergency response workers across Southern California were handing out sandbags in preparation for the potential of severe flooding. From Seal Beach to the Coachella Valley, residents were picking up supplies after the National Hurricane Center's unprecedented tropical storm watch.\n\nWorkers were also re-enforcing sand berms, built to protect low-lying coastal communities such as Huntington Beach against winter surf.\n\nForecasters said Hilary could bring more than a year's worth of rain to the Palm Springs area, about 5 inches.\n\nThe National Park Service planned to close vulnerable areas of Joshua Tree National Park, east of Los Angeles, on Friday evening, and suspend all back country camping, while other national parks were also at risk of flooding.\n\nHILARY'S IMPACTS:Flood risks to Zion, Joshua Tree, Death Valley national parks\n\nHilary forecast to bring heavy rain, flooding to Southern California\n\nHilary could be the first tropical storm to make landfall in California since 1939, according to federal weather officials. Last year, Tropical Storm Kay doused Southern California with heavy rain and flooding without making landfall.\n\n\"The combination of heavy rainfall, the potential for flash flooding and strong winds could very well make this a high impact event for Southern California,\" Samantha Connolly, a National Weather Service meteorologist in San Diego, wrote in a Thursday morning forecast.\n\nHurricane tracker:Updates on the path of every storm\n\nHow much rainfall could Hurricane Hilary bring?\n\nHilary is expected to bring a risk of flash flooding and heavy rainfall in southern California, southern Nevada and western Arizona, the hurricane center said. Here's the weather service rain forecast for California, in inches.\n\nCoast/Valleys: 2-2.5\n\nMojave Desert: 3-5\n\nMountains: 4-10, with up to 12 inches on the eastern mountain slopes\n\nLower Deserts: 4-7\n\nThe most rainfall ever recorded during the month of August in San Diego was 2.13 inches in 1977, the weather service said Thursday.\n\nCould climate change bring hurricanes to the West Coast?\n\nHurricanes need two things to stay energized: warm water and favorable winds. The California coast typically benefits from cooler water that flows southward along the coast and winds tend to either shear the tops off hurricanes or push them westward out to sea. Given its history, a hurricane landfall in California is not impossible, but highly unlikely for two reasons: the cold ocean water and upper-level winds.\n\nScientists aren't yet sure how human-caused climate change might specifically affect the frequency or intensity of hurricanes.\n\n\"Sea surface temperatures are generally rising as the climate warms, which could provide more 'fuel' for any hurricanes that do form,\" said Kim Wood, an associate professor in the Department of Geosciences at Mississippi State University.

It was the second highest rainfall total for that length of time in that area and most since 1932.\n\nAnother area of Dallas had 15.16 inches, the according to the NWS.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for Dallas and Tarrant counties continue until 8 p.m. CT Monday, the NWS said.\n\nDallas Fire-Rescue tweeted that the agency has responded to 195 high-water rescues around the city from 6 p.m. Sunday to 1:37 pm Monday, while the Fort Worth Fire Department said it had conducted 174 investigations/rescues.\n\nHundreds of traffic accidents also have been reported, according to the Dallas Police Department.\n\nNearly 15 million people from northeastern Texas into northern Louisiana and far southern Arkansas are covered by flood watches from the same system that unleashed heavy rain and flash floods this weekend in parts of the Southwest.\n\nParts of Dallas got an entire summer’s worth of rain between Sunday afternoon and Monday afternoon, according to the NWS. That rate is only expected once in 100 years, on average. Dallas also got over 3 inches of rain in just one hour overnight – a roughly a 1-in-50-year rainfall rate, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates.\n\nDallas County Judge Clay Jenkins declared a state of disaster in the county in response to the flood damage and is requesting state and federal assistance, according to a tweet he posted to his official account.\n\nAn unidentified 60-year-old woman was killed by the flooding in Dallas County when her vehicle was swept away by the water, Jenkins said.\n\nHer car was “presumably” swept off the road and was discovered as the water receded, according to Mesquite Fire Department Chief Russell Wilson.\n\n“I’ve never experienced anything like this in my entire life,” said Brittany Taylor, who moved to her Dallas apartment just two days before Monday morning’s flooding left most of her belongings ruined by the flood.\n\nTaylor woke up around 3 a.m. to the sound of the torrential rain and couldn’t fall back asleep owing to the sound of leaking, she told CNN.\n\n“All the cardboard boxes started collapsing, so a lot of my belongings started crashing into the water. I lost a lot of my stuff,” she said, adding her renter’s insurance doesn’t cover flood losses.\n\nFast-rising water trapped vehicles around 3 a.m. on Interstate 30 in Dallas, said Cassondra Anna Mae Stewart, who took video of the dark, watery scene.\n\n“I was able to back up on a ramp to get off the highway,” she said. “I took an alternate route home … although most streets are flooded down there as well.”\n\nAround that time, “trained weather spotters reported major flash flooding ongoing across Dallas with numerous roads and cars submerged, including Interstate 30 at Interstate 45 near downtown Dallas,” according to a flash flood warning statement issued at 3:21 a.m.\n\nMon Lun pulls a strap to his water stalled car Monday before towing it out of receding flood waters in Dallas. LM Otero/AP\n\nThe influx of storm water caused the Dallas sanitary sewer system to overflow in several locations, the Dallas Water Utilities Department said in a news release. The water supply is not damaged, the city said, and crews are performing cleanups at each overflow location.\n\n“Although there is no danger to the water supply, the public is reminded to avoid contact with waste material, soil or water in any of the affected areas,” the city said, adding that people in impacted areas who are using private drinking water supplies should only use boiled or distilled water.\n\nOther major cities in Monday’s flood watch zone include Austin, Texas, and Shreveport, Louisiana. The region is under a moderate – Level 3 of 4 – risk of excessive rainfall. Rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour have been observed as storms move slowly across the area, creating the potential for up to 3 to 5 inches of rainfall.\n\nThe soaking weather pattern is expected to continue spreading active showers an thunderstorms across eastern Texas and into the Lower Mississippi over the next few days, which may result in more flash flooding, according to the NWS.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nA sign of ‘climate whiplash’\n\nThe Dallas-area deluge comes in concert with a “flash drought” that has developed over this extremely dry year across Texas. Exceptional drought – the highest designation – is present over Dallas and Tarrant counties and blankets more than a quarter of the state.\n\n“Over the last half-year, rainfall deficits of 8 inches to locally over a foot have affected areas of central Texas near and south of Dallas/Ft. Worth to the Gulf Coast,” the Drought Monitor summary said Thursday.\n\nBut those rainfall deficits will be essentially erased after Monday in Dallas, though large deficits will still remain for other areas of Texas.\n\nHuman-caused climate change has increased the potential for this sort of weather whiplash, in which dramatic swings in periods of drought and high precipitation can occur more often.\n\nA larger share of precipitation in recent years has come during “intense single-day events,” and the likelihood of sudden shifts from severe drought to heavy rain will become more common on a warming planet, scientists say. Indeed, nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1996.\n\nRainfall over land has become more frequent and more intense with every degree of warming since the 1980s. It’s because warmer air can hold more water, causing storms like Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in 2017, to not only produce storm surges and damaging winds but also cause more intense inland deluges.\n\nMonday’s rainfall has pushed this month to the third-wettest August on record for the Dallas-Fort Worth area, with more than 7 inches in all so far – the most rainfall seen in the month since 1915.\n\nAhead of the Texas flooding, rain persisted Sunday in parts of Arizona and New Mexico following floods in prior days in parts of the Southwest.\n\nMotorists escape flooded vehicles early Monday in downtown Dallas.

Another victim was in the vehicle. Brewer believes that the drivers were caught by surprise.\n\n\"We do not think anybody drove into it,\" he said. \"Within minutes the road went from passable to having 4 to 5 feet of raging water.\"\n\nFire crews responding to a utility pole that was struck by lightning happened to be in the area as the heavy rains started and were able to start rescuing trapped vehicles, three of which firefighters saw swept away in the fast- moving water, Brewer said.\n\nEleven vehicles were trapped in the creek, he said.\n\n\"As a witness to that, in my 44 years, I've never seen anything like it.

Clouds shrouded the peak of the 2,640-meter (8,712-foot) mountain but it was mostly sunny around the volcano on Friday.\n\nMeteorologist Aldczar Aurelio said Tropical Storm Fung-Wong, which made landfall in northern Cagayan province with top winds of 62.5 miles per hour, enhanced the seasonal southwest monsoon winds and clouds from the Indian Ocean and Australia and dumped heavy rain over the capital area.\n\nHe said 10.5 inches of rain fell on the capital within a 24-hour period ending early Friday. The volume was more than half the amount of rainfall that caused massive flooding in the capital in 2009, the worst in 40 years.\n\nGovernment offices in the capital and 15 provinces were closed and the Philippine Stock Exchange suspended trading.\n\nManila Mayor Joseph Estrada said residents of a number of slum communities were evacuated to safety.\n\n\"Our anti-flood infrastructure has been neglected for a long time,\" Estrada said. \"You go abroad and you see big houses of the rich along clean rivers.

Peak behind the curtain of this tween pop ...", "text": "Depending on your proximity to tweendom, you might be well-acquainted with a record label known as \"KIDZ BOP.\" Genre-birthing in itself, KIDZ BOP has been around since 2001, providing the country's young people with remixed alternatives to popular radio singles.\n\nThe music produced is not only family-friendly but it's also sung by kids − literally. Plucked from national casting calls to record albums, perform on tour, and appear in advertisements for the KIDZ BOP brand, some of the artists are as young as 12 years old.\n\nKIDZ BOP has sold over 23 million albums and remained on Billboard's Top 100 Artists chart for over a decade. Here's a peek behind the brightly colored curtains at what makes music's adolescent-powered hit machine tick.\n\nWho is the KIDZ BOP CEO?\n\nKIDZ BOP has a president, rather than a CEO. Current KIDZ BOP president Sasha Junk has been with the company for 13 years. When we caught up over the phone in late April she had plenty to say about the brand's enduring success.\n\nDuring her tenure, Junk has overseen the launch of the brand's touring division and an important partnership with Live Nation. She has also watched the business transform with the music industry itself. “When I started we were making the transition from KIDZ BOP being a physical CD product to streaming,” she says.\n\nFor a label perhaps most recognized for its CD covers, that shift may seem startling. Junk says it opened up a lot of doors. The “barrier to entry was less” she explained.\n\nWho are the KIDZ BOP kids?Read our full length profile.\n\nWho founded KIDZ BOP?\n\nKIDZ BOP was founded by Craig Balsam and Cliff Chenfeld in 2001. Each had three kids, Junk says, and while on the birthday party circuit, they started to notice a lack of music for school-aged kids.\n\nThere was stuff for preschoolers, like the Wheels on the Bus, but the five to eight-year-olds didn't have much. To bridge that gap, Balsam and Chenfeld used their label Razor & Tie to launch KIDZ BOP.\n\n“They came up with the concept of taking pop music and having kids record it … and it worked,” Junk says.\n\nWho owns KIDZ BOP?\n\nKIDZ BOP Enterprises LLC is part of Concord Music Group, which also includes labels like Fearless and STAX Records.\n\nWhy doesn't KIDZ BOP get sued?\n\nThe name of the game at KIDZ BOP is covers. Sure, the profanity has been papered over (sometimes rather colorfully), but the melodies are the same. So how are they not being hit with lawsuits constantly?\n\nAnyone can record anything, Junk says, as long as you are paying mechanicals and publishing, a form of royalty checks, on it. \"We’ve been established for so long that we have really great relationships with the publishers,” she explains.\n\nHow old are the KIDZ BOP kids?\n\nThere is a range of ages, though most of the artists are in their preteen years. Among the current crop, the youngest member is 12 years old while the oldest is 14.\n\nB.I returns with 'TO DIE FOR': K-pop soloist reflects on inspirations, emotions and growth\n\nWho is the oldest kid in KIDZ BOP?\n\nThere is no real age limit, Junk says.\n\nTypically they cast performers between the ages of 10 and 12 and they stay on for a few years. That way they age out by the time they are 13 or 14, occasionally 15. “There’s no hard and fast rule we’re just looking for the most talented kids that we can find,” she explains.\n\nWhat age should kids listen to KIDZ BOP?\n\nThe target demographic for fans is five to nine years old, Junk says, so it works best when the performers are a bit older but not too far off.\n\n“We are aspirational but attainable,” she says. As opposed to watching another pop star on stage, who may be in their 30's, fans at a KIDZ BOP concert \"can relate and identify with that kid on stage.” It brings their star power back down to earth.\n\nWho is the most famous KIDZ BOP kid?\n\nAn ensemble this famous was bound to have spawned at least a few music legends over the years.\n\nAs it turns out, Zendaya — now a two-time golden globe winner — is a KIDZ BOP alumni. Former Disney star Ross Lynch who is now making a name for himself playing serial killers was also once a KIDZ BOP star. Becky G, whose song 'Shower' became the ultimate synth-pop earworm, also first cut her chops at the KIDZ BOP music factory.\n\nNot all the KIDZ choose a life of entertainment though, according to Junk. “We’ve had kids decide that they just want to go back and be a regular kid,” she says. She's written several college letters of recommendation for former members and watched them go on to get married and have kids (or ahem, KIDZ.)\n\nMosquito bites: Why they itch and why mosquitos bite some people more than others\n\nDo KIDZ BOP singers go to school?\n\nYes. The kids have a team of teachers who are with them for all parts of the process: recording, touring, music video shoots, etc.\n\n“I’d like to think that they get a really great education, it’s really one-on-one,” Junk says. The young performers switch to online school once they are cast, but have a teacher to guide them along. They typically start each day with classes, Junk explains, and are required to keep their grades up to remain in the troop.\n\nHow popular is KIDZ BOP?\n\nPretty popular. The SiriusXM-dedicated KIDZ BOP channel has over 34 million subscribers, and the brand has been sitting atop Billboard's Kids Artists chart for over a decade.\n\nIn what can be a somewhat volatile industry, Junk attributes KIDZ BOP's enduring success to the universal appeal of pop music. “I think it just boils down to, KIDZ BOP is fun,” she says, \"it taps into something that’s sort of universal.”\n\nIt's for the hairbrush singers, Junk argues, singing at the top of their lungs to the radio in the back of the minivan.\n\nHow many KIDZ BOP albums are there?\n\nThere have been 74 total albums released since 2001. The label releases on average four albums a year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/03/24/gwyneth-paltrow-testifies-ski-collision-trial-utah/11528117002/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow pressed on stand about ski collision, Taylor Swift", "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow is speaking her side of the story.\n\nThe celebrity wellness CEO and \"Shakespeare in Love\" star took the stand Friday in Utah after being sued for a ski crash in 2016, referred to as a \"hit and run.\"\n\nPaltrow is on trial, which began Tuesday, after being sued for $300,000 by Terry Sanderson in 2019, who claimed she seriously injured him during a crash on the beginner slopes at Deer Valley Resort in Park City in 2016. Paltrow filed her own lawsuit against Sanderson seeking \"symbolic damages in the amount of $1, plus her costs and attorney’s fees to defend this meritless claim,\" her lawsuit states.\n\nSanderson also claims Paltrow left him on the mountain without help. Paltrow has denied the allegations and in a counterclaim said it was Sanderson who crashed into her.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow says Terry Sanderson 'categorically' crashed into her\n\nWhile on the stand, Paltrow said she \"was not engaging in any risky behavior\" the day she alleges Sanderson crashed into her from behind on a beginner ski slope.\n\nSanderson's lawyer Kristin Vanorman pressed Paltrow to provide a moment-by-moment account of the incident, during which the actress recalled that, while the crash was happening, she thought for a brief moment she might be getting sexually assaulted.\n\n“That was a quick thought that went through my head when I was trying to reconcile what was happening,\" Paltrow said, saying she heard Sanderson groan and felt a man's weight pressing into her backside during the crash. \"My brain was trying to make sense of what was happening.”\n\nPaltrow noted Sanderson's skis came forward in between her skis during the collision. She also confirmed she yelled an expletive at Sanderson following the crash, adding she felt \"upset\" at the time.\n\n\"I apologize for my bad language,\" she said, to which Vanorman replied, \"You’re small but mighty. Actually, you’re not that small.”\n\nPaltrow also denied the account provided by Greg Ramone, a ski friend of Sanderson who previously testified he saw Paltrow hit Sanderson in the crash.\n\n“I don’t believe he saw what he thinks he saw,\" Paltrow said of Ramone's testimony. \"He said he was 40 feet away and color blind. I don’t know how he can be positive about what he saw.\"\n\nThroughout questioning, Paltrow maintained Sanderson collided into her, saying, \"Mr. Sanderson categorically hit me on that ski slope, and that is the truth.\"\n\nPaltrow says she feels 'very sorry' for Sanderson but she didn't hit him\n\nVanorman also inquired about Paltrow's relationship with singer Taylor Swift, who won $1 in damages in a 2017 groping case.\n\n“Are you good friends with Taylor Swift?\" the attorney asked Paltrow, to which the actress replied: \"I would not say we are good friends. We are friendly. I’ve taken my kids to one of her concerts before, but we don’t talk very often.” The line of questioning was eventually halted by an objection, to laughter from the courtroom.\n\nLater, Paltrow's lawyer Steve Owens asked Paltrow if she has empathy for Sanderson and his health issues, despite his lawsuit against her.\n\n\"You know, I really do,\" Paltrow said. \"I feel very sorry for him. It seems like he’s had a very difficult life, but I did not cause the accident so I cannot be at fault for anything that subsequently happened to him.\"\n\nPaltrow's legal team said she sustained a 'full body blow' in the crash\n\nIn opening arguments on the trial's first day, both sides presented their clients as conservative skiers who were stunned when a skier above them crashed into them.\n\nPaltrow's legal team, including attorney Steve Owens, told jurors that Sanderson was the one who crashed into her — a collision in which she sustained what they called a \"full body blow.\" Owens noted that members of Paltrow's group checked on Sanderson, who assured them he was fine — an interaction Sanderson doesn't deny but said in court filings that he can't remember.\n\nPaltrow is seeking \"symbolic damages in the amount of $1, plus her costs and attorney’s fees to defend this meritless claim,\" her lawsuit said.

It claims Ticketmaster forces concertgoers to exclusively use its site and controlled all registration and access to Swift’s “The Eras Tour.”\n\nThe Swifties are seeking a penalty of $2,500 for each violation, which could add up, based on the millions of angered fans who did not receive tickets.\n\nThe lawsuit also claimed that since Ticketmaster has agreements with the large stadiums in the tour, Swift “has no choice” but to work with Ticketmaster due to the size of her fan base. It also alleges that Ticketmaster profits off the resale of tickets in the secondary market by adding a service fee to its fan-to-fan exchange.\n\n“Ticketmaster is a monopoly that is only interested in taking every dollar it can from a captive public,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nPre-sale tickets for “The Eras Tour” frustrated Swift fans across the country in a debacle that stayed in the headlines for weeks. In November, “Verified Fans” were sent a presale code — but when sales began, heavy demand snarled the website and millions of Swifties could not get their hands on a ticket. Presale tickets for Capital One card holders brought similar frustration — and then Ticketmaster canceled sales to the general public, citing “extraordinarily high demand” and “insufficient remaining ticket inventory.”\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the company “intentionally and purposely mislead TaylorSwiftTix presale ticket holders by providing codes to 1.4 million ‘verified fans,’” despite the shortage of seats. Ticketmaster said more than two million tickets were sold on the first day of sales for her upcoming tour — the most ever sold for an artist in a single day.\n\n“Millions of fans waited up to eight hours and were unable to purchase tickets as a result of insufficient ticket releases,” the lawsuit said. “Ticketmaster intentionally provided codes when it could not satisfy demands.”\n\nThe 26 Swifties suing the ticketing company are located across the country, from Utah to North Carolina. CNN has reached out to Ticketmaster for comment. Jennifer Kinder, an attorney representing the plaintiffs in the case, said it is waiting acceptance by the clerk.\n\nTaylor Swift spoke out in a heartfelt post about the ticketing “mistakes,” writing on Instagram that there were a “multitude of reasons why people had such a hard time” getting tickets, and said the experience was “excruciating” for her to watch.\n\nIn a blog post that has since been taken down, Ticketmaster said its “Verified Fans” system, a mechanism aimed at eliminating bots by giving presale codes to individuals, couldn’t keep up with the intense demand. Roughly 3.5 million people signed up for the program to buy Swift tickets, its “largest registration in history.” That unprecedented demand, combined with a “staggering number of bot attacks as well as fans who didn’t have invite codes” drove “unprecedented traffic” to its site, Ticketmaster said, and, essentially, broke it.\n\nTicketmaster apologized to Swift and her fans for the “terrible experience” some had trying to purchase tickets and said it would work to “shore up our tech for the new bar that has been set by demand” for Swift’s tour.\n\nThe ticketing debacle drew the ire of several lawmakers, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, head of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, who wrote an open letter to Ticketmaster’s CEO, saying she has “serious concerns” about the company’s operations.\n\nIn addition, the Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Live Nation, a source told CNN, to determine whether the company has a monopoly in the market for concerts, including ticket purchasing.\n\nLive Nation responded Saturday in a statement posted to its website, saying it “takes its responsibilities under the antitrust laws seriously” and “does not engage in behaviors that could justify antitrust litigation, let alone orders that would require it to alter fundamental business practices.”\n\n– CNN’s Frank Pallotta and Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/06/12/anita-baker-babyface-concert-backlash/70315456007/", "title": "Anita Baker says Babyface fans are bullying her over scrapped tour ...", "text": "Indianapolis Star\n\nAnita Baker is asking Babyface to call off fans she said are bullying and threatening her.\n\nBaker says fans of the R&B songwriter-producer have been threatening her, as a result of him not performing during a May show on her Songstress tour.

Town,” Baker tweeted Monday.\n\nBaker's response comes a week after she alluded to the dustup over Babyface not performing at a May 10 New Jersey stop on her The Songstress tour.\n\nThe tweets picked up after Babyface’s NPR Tiny Desk concert performance hit the internet Friday.\n\nThe night of the New Jersey concert, Babyface took to social media to tell fans he was asked not to take the stage at the Prudential Center so that headliner Baker could perform her full set after the show got off to a late start.\n\n“I am truly sorry to my fans who have been waiting for us to hit the stage this evening at @PruCenter. I was asked not to perform in order to give Ms. Baker her space and time to perform her show in its entirety. My band and I are extremely saddened we didn't get to perform for y'all tonight,” he posted on Twitter.\n\nLoads of people – fans and celebs – responded with criticism of Baker, notably singer-songwriter Stephanie Mills.\n\n“We have got to be better than this! I am saddened by the fact that you have to make this statement,\" Mills tweeted May 10. \"One would think as older artist who are considered 'Iconic' and or 'Legendary' we would treat each other with respect and dignity. @Babyface We can tour together.”\n\nLater, Babyface told People magazine in a statement May 11 that his set was cut due to technical issues, explaining that production crews were unable to get a video screen running in time for his performance.\n\n\"As advanced as technology is today, we are sometimes at its mercy. The video wall was unfortunately not working that day and time wasn't on our side,\" he said. \"I am incredibly sorry to the fans and have nothing but love and respect for Anita.\"\n\nFolks though were still expressing disappointment in the May 10 show in their reviews as recently as early June, according to the official Ticketmaster website. Many assumed that Babyface, with his deep catalog over a 40-year career, was co-headlining with the R&B/Soul diva.\n\nBorn Kenneth Edmonds, Babyface has 12 Grammys and 50 nominations, including wins for producer of the year from 1996 through 1998. The 64-year-old musician has produced or written hits for the likes of Michael Jackson, Boyz II Men, Usher, Beyoncé and Madonna. His LaFace Records label, co-founded with L.A. Reid, launched the recording careers of Toni Braxton, TLC, Usher, P!nk and Outkast.\n\nBut the tour, which kicked off in February and runs through December, is Baker's in observance of the 40th anniversary of her first solo breakthrough album.\n\nBaker, 65, wants Babyface to set the record straight. She told her Twitter followers Monday that \"this false narrative of a co-headliner is creating unrealistic expectations and aggression from his fans towards me.”\n\n“Not PR worthy, to simply say, maybe promoter/others said performance slot has passed,\" Baker wrote in a prior tweet Sunday. \"Alert the industry blogs and media and say Anita Baker is responsible... Her name will get attention. Industry bloggers will intimidate and bully her into fearful silence.”\n\nBaker said she was tweeting to salvage her reputation, as she doesn’t do press. “I’m praying the truth reaches my global fan base and my reputation is restored,” she wrote.\n\nOutside of the follow-up statement and a post thanking her at a subsequent concert stop, Babyface has not commented on Baker’s social media activity or responded to those who have been critical of her regarding his May 10 absence.\n\nBabyface and Baker have a past legal dealing after he sued her, but Baker previously told followers that had been settled and there were no hard feelings between the performers.\n\n“My company defended and prevailed against the lawsuit filed, (not by Babyface, but by his reps. at the time),\" Baker tweeted June 6. \"Kenny, came to me years ago, in the spirit of community and we put it all behind us and came together, in love, peace, music and community and forgiveness.”\n\nWatch:Babyface delivers soulful performance, honors Whitney Houston in NPR Tiny Desk Concert\n\nFrom 2014:Lawyer says Anita Baker owes him money", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/08/01/former-lizzo-dancer-arianna-davis-of-indianapolis-others-sue-artist/70509439007/", "title": "Indianapolis woman, others sue Lizzo; accuse pop star of weight ...", "text": "Three former dancers for Lizzo, a Grammy Award-winning artist known for her message of body positivity, have filed a lawsuit against the singer, accusing her of weight-shaming, sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment.\n\nAmong other accusations, one plaintiff in the lawsuit, Arianna Davis from Indianapolis, claims Lizzo pressured her to engage with nude performers at a club in Amsterdam, called attention to her weight, and forced her and other dancers to re-audition for their spots during a 12-hour rehearsal in which Davis soiled herself rather than leave the stage and risk losing her job.\n\nDavis claims she was forced to perform the rest of her re-audition in see-through clothing, transparent shorts with no undergarments, and in front of male crew members, according to the lawsuit.\n\n'Oh my God. I like her':Indy native Arianna Davis makes it pop on Lizzo's new TV show\n\nThe complaint was filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court and a copy of the 44-page document was shared with IndyStar by a representative with the plaintiff's attorney, Ron Zambrano, a partner and Employment Litigation Chair at West Coast Employment Lawyers.\n\n“The stunning nature of how Lizzo and her management team treated their performers seems to go against everything Lizzo stands for publicly, while privately she weight-shames her dancers and demeans them in ways that are not only illegal but absolutely demoralizing,” Zambrano said in a news release.\n\nIndyStar was unable to reach a representative for Lizzo or her production company late Tuesday evening.\n\nThe lawsuit names Lizzo, whose real name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson, along with her production company Big Grrrl Big Touring, Inc., and Shirlene Quigley, captain of Lizzo’s dance team.\n\nThe plaintiffs include Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams and Noelle Rodriguez, who allege sexual, religious and racial harassment, disability discrimination, assault and false imprisonment, among other accusations, according to a news release.\n\nDavis and Williams were both fired by Lizzo's production company while Rodriguez resigned.\n\nDavis meets Lizzo competing on reality show\n\nIn March 2021, Davis and Williams met Lizzo while preparing to be contestants on her reality TV show, “Lizzo’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls” to compete for a chance to join the artist’s live performances.\n\n'Absolutely surreal':Lizzo backup dancer Arianna Davis brings the heat at hometown show\n\nSeparately, Rodriguez was hired in May 2021 to perform in Lizzo’s “Rumors” music video and remained on as part of the dance team, a news release stated. Filming of the reality TV show began in August 2021. During one episode, contestants of the show were told they would be required to participate in a nude photo shoot, which distressed Davis.\n\n“Ms. Davis broke down in tears on set while struggling to choose between a once-in-a-lifetime career opportunity and putting her body on display against her will,” the lawsuit states. “This experience foreshadowed the sexually charged and uncomfortable environment Lizzo’s employees would be forced to endure.”\n\nDavis and Williams were later selected for the dance team.\n\nFormer Lizzo dancers claim pop star's behavior at Amsterdam strip club made them feel uncomfortable\n\nIn February, the plaintiffs claim they were subjected to a hostile work environment and sexual harassment after performing a show with Lizzo in Amsterdam.\n\nAccording to the suit, Lizzo invited the dancers to a club called Bananenbar, where patrons are allowed to interact with completely nude performers who use bananas during their show. While it wasn’t a requirement to spend time with Lizzo, the plaintiffs said they felt obligated out of fear of losing their jobs.\n\nThe suit claims Lizzo invited cast members to take turns touching the nude performers, and pressured Davis to touch the breasts of one of the nude women performing at the club. Despite Davis repeatedly saying she did not want to participate, she claims Lizzo led the room in a chant goading Davis into action.\n\nAs the chanting grew louder, Davis acquiesced, the suit claims, out of fear her future on the dance team would be harmed otherwise. When asked on two occasions by members of the production team's management if Davis was OK, she first responded, \"Kind of,\" then later, \"No.\"\n\n“Plaintiffs were aghast with how little regard Lizzo showed for the bodily autonomy of her employees and those around her, especially in the presence of many people whom she employed,” the complaint states.\n\nIndianapolis dancer claims she was weight-shamed by Lizzo\n\nThe suit claims that on April 21, Lizzo and choreographer Tanisha Scott accused Davis of not being committed to her role on the dance team, which Davis alleges were \"thinly veiled\" comments about Davis' weight. Davis claimed Lizzo called attention to her weight at the South by Southwest music festival, according to the lawsuit.\n\nA week later, Williams was fired by Lizzo's production manager in a hotel lobby \"under the guise of budget cuts,\" the lawsuit claims. On May 3, Davis was fired after recording a meeting the dancers had with Lizzo about their performances, the complaint states.\n\nDavis claims she made a recording of the meeting to review Lizzo's notes for the dance team. When Lizzo learned of the recording, she became furious, according to the lawsuit. Davis said Lizzo gathered the dance team together in a room and hurled expletives, promising to go from person to person until someone confessed to making the recording.\n\nThe suit says Davis admitted to making the recording and explained it was for note taking due to an eye condition she suffered under stressful situations, adding that she had already deleted the recording. Lizzo castigated Davis and fired her on the spot, according to the lawsuit.\n\nBothered both by Williams' and Davis' termination, Rodriguez immediately resigned, at which point Lizzo became angry, according to the suit.\n\n“Lizzo aggressively approached Ms. Rodriquez, cracking her knuckles, balling her fists, and exclaiming, ‘You’re lucky. You’re so f***ing lucky!’ Rodriguez feared that Lizzo intended to hit her and would have done so if one of the other dancers had not intervened,” the complaint states.\n\nThe suit claims neither security nor management did anything to de-escalate the situation and as Lizzo left the room, she raised her middle fingers and yelled a slur.\n\nThe suit claims Davis was falsely imprisoned by Lizzo's security team immediately after her termination, with security telling Davis she wasn't allowed to leave the room until they searched her phone for the recording. Davis did not want her cellphone searched, but relented in order to leave.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking damages that include emotional distress, lost and unpaid wages and attorney's fees.\n\nMore news:Planned Parenthood, hospitals began Indiana abortion ban Tuesday.

The photo in question shows Mueller with his hand behind Swift, just below her waist, at the pre-concert event. Swift and Mueller are both smiling in the picture.\n\n\"If you look at that photograph, his hand is not underneath Miss Swift's skirt, and her skirt is not rumpled in any fashion,\" said Mueller's lawyer, Gabriel McFarland.\n\nSwift's lawyers have called the image \"damning\" proof that Mueller inappropriately touched her.\n\nSwift, who has countersued Mueller, was present Tuesday in court as an eight-member jury was selected to hear her civil trial.\n\nThe pop star's mom, Andrea Swift, grew emotional in court, crying as opening statements got underway, causing the singer to often look her way, swallow hard or whisper to her lawyer.\n\nMueller's lawyer began Tuesday with an opening statement telling the jury that inappropriate touching is offensive and wrong but that \"falsely accusing someone of inappropriate touching is equally offensive\" and wrong.\n\nDuring his testimony, Mueller said that he wants to vindicate himself and recoup lost earnings after being fired from his dream job over the claim.\n\nHe said he was earning $150,000 under a two-year contract that began six months before the concert.\n\nIn his opening statement, Swift's lawyer Douglas Baldridge was resolute about what occurred before the 2013 concert. \"That's the one and only story we have to tell you — that Mr. Mueller grabbed her rear end,\" Baldridge said, also emphasizing the age difference between Mueller, then 51, and Swift, then 23.\n\nBaldridge asked jurors: “What’s wrong with this picture? A woman gets assaulted, a woman reports it, and she gets sued.”\n\nIn a twist, Mueller also testified Tuesday that one of his station bosses, Hershel Coomer, told him that he had met Swift earlier before the show and that \"he told me that he had his hands on her butt.\"\n\n\"I thought he was just telling me one of his stories,\" Mueller said.\n\nBut under aggressive cross-examination, Mueller couldn't explain why he didn't tell a boss investigating the incident about the exchange with Coomer.\n\nSwift's lawyer also repeatedly asked Mueller if he could grasp \"any reason, incentive or motive for Miss Swift\" to make up the allegation or be involved in two years of litigation.\n\n\"I cannot,\" Mueller replied, conceding at one point that supervisors had discussed the possibility of letting him go even before the encounter with Swift.\n\nSwift has said she is positive it was Mueller who groped her. Coomer is expected to testify at the civil trial.\n\nSwift’s attorney also said Tuesday that Mueller gave seven accounts of what happened and destroyed taped conversations about it with his bosses who fired him.\n\nThe attorney says Swift is seeking a symbolic $1 in her counterclaim and isn’t trying to bankrupt Mueller. He says she’s showing others that “you can always say no.”\n\nWhat you need to know about Taylor Swift's groping trial\n\nOutside the federal courthouse, cameras caught Swift's fans gathering, some since dawn, to scoop up tickets to sit inside the courtroom once the trial began.\n\nSwift's publicist, Tree Paine, was seen striding into the courthouse. Many lawyers were spotted, but not Swift, who later appeared in court with her hair in a bun and wearing a demure black dress.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Swift and Mueller were seated at separate tables with their lawyers. As on Monday, Mueller had his back turned to Swift.\n\nThe case stems from an encounter the two had during a photo shoot at a meet-and-greet in Denver in 2013. He was fired by his radio station after being accused of inappropriately touching Swift's \"bare bottom\" during the photo shoot.\n\nTwo years later, he sued Swift, her mother Andrea and her management team, denying he groped her and accusing them of slander and getting him fired.\n\nSwift then countersued him, accusing him of groping her, and denying that she did anything to get him fired.\n\nAfter two years of hearings and depositions, and no sign that either side would agree to resolve the matter out of court, the case has finally come to trial, which is expected to last nine days.\n\nAs is customary in civil trials, potential jurors had to fill out a long questionnaire in which they were asked about whether they are fans of either Mueller or Swift, whether they had ever seen Swift in concert, downloaded or purchased her music, or attended the 2013 concert in question.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/10/06/mass-production-concert-scholarship-fundraiser-plainfield-ct-high-school/69534372007/", "title": "Plainfield's Mass Production to play folk, pop and rock music for fans", "text": "PLAINFIELD — More than a half-century after playing their first gig inside a Moosup church, the \"MassProduction\" group is preparing to once again belt out its crowd-pleasing mix of contemporary, folk and spiritual music for a charitable cause.\n\nInside the Plainfield High School auditorium on Monday, more than a dozen members of the group – vocalists, brass, percussionists and guitarists – took the stage for one of their bi-weekly rehearsals leading up to an October show which will serve as a scholarship fundraiser.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}]}

John Carney signed Delaware House Bill 290 on Wednesday, Feb. 16. The story below appears as it was originally published on Jan. 31.\n\nYou can now get to-go alcohol from restaurants in Delaware regardless of a global pandemic, thanks to a new bill.\n\nThe legislation by House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, a Rehoboth Beach Democrat, makes drive-thru and takeout alcohol sales officially legal – and permanent.\n\nLawmakers passed the bill on Thursday. Gov. John Carney plans to sign the bill into law once his legal team reviews it, according to his spokesperson Jonathan Starkey.\n\nOriginally, the law was temporary under Carney's pandemic emergency orders and expected to expire in a couple of months.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nNow, people in Delaware can buy alcohol for takeout, curbside or drive-thru at any restaurant, brewpub, tavern, taproom or other business with a liquor license forever, according to the bill.\n\nCustomers have to buy at least $10 of food to get a to-go drink.\n\nThe bill limits sales to one 750-milliliter bottle of wine, six servings of beer and mixed cocktails. The drink has to be in a sealed container, such as with a lid or cap, in an attempt to prevent people from drinking while driving. Openings for sipping or straws are not allowed.\n\nRestaurants will not be required to sell alcohol to-go as a result of the bill.\n\nThe bill was a result of lobbying efforts by the restaurant industry, according to Delaware Restaurant Association President and CEO Carrie Leishman. It was also popular with the public, especially since eating takeout with a to-go cocktail has become the norm due to COVID-19, she said.\n\n\"It is a small win, not only for the restaurant industry who struggled so much during the pandemic but also the consumer,\" she said. \"The pandemic showed us that we need to have a little fun.\"\n\nThe only lawmaker to not vote for the bill was Rep. Paul Baumbach, a Newark Democrat, who abstained from voting on Thursday. He said he does not think curbside alcohol sales are justified once the pandemic is over because people can drink inside a restaurant and buy it at a liquor store.\n\n\"This was an accommodation, as the public health benefits clearly outweighed the public safety disadvantages, during the pandemic,\" Baumbach wrote in an email. \"Where is the justification to permit curbside delivery of alcohol after the pandemic?\"\n\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, Carney issued an emergency order that temporarily allowed to-go sales to help restaurants stay afloat when customers were barred from dining inside to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOriginally, the General Assembly extended that order through March 2022.\n\nFAKE VACCINE CARDS MAY RESULT IN PRISON:Here's why Democrats filed a bill to outlaw fake vaccination cards in Delaware\n\nCARNEY'S SPENDING PLAN:9 things to know about Gov.

The measure failed to ban any weapons, but it includes funding for school safety and state crisis intervention programs. Many states – including California, Delaware and New York – have also passed new laws to help curb gun violence, such as regulating untraceable ghost guns and strengthening background check systems.\n\nThe year 2022 is the second-highest year of mass shootings in the United States on record, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit tracking gun violence incidents across the country.\n\nThere have been at least 647 mass shootings through December 31 this year. The country saw 692 mass shootings in 2021, the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014.\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nThere is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings, according to a January study published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit focused on gun violence prevention.\n\nNot everyone agrees increased gun control is the answer. Some Americans advocate for their right to keep and bear arms, enshrined in the Constitution, while others argue gun control measures save lives and do not infringe citizen rights.\n\nAmid the debate, some lawmakers have forged ahead with passing gun control laws.\n\n“States continue to lead on gun safety, passing new and innovative policies that we will work to replicate across the country while continuing to secure significant investments in community violence intervention programs,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, which killed 20 children and six educators.\n\n“This progress and our electoral victories in November shows that the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than ever and sets the stage for continued progress in the new year,” Watts continued.\n\nHere is a summary of the state and federal laws approved in 2022:\n\nFederal legislation\n\nOn June 25, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act after the House and the Senate approved the measure. The package represents the most significant federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he signed the bill.\n\nThe package includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs, which can be used to manage red flag programs, as well as for other crisis intervention programs such as mental health, drug and veteran courts.\n\nRed flag laws, approved by the federal measure, are also known as Extreme Risk Protection Order laws. They allow courts to temporarily seize firearms from anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe legislation encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which would provide a more comprehensive background check for people between 18 and 21 who want to buy guns.\n\nIt also requires more individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income to register as Federally Licensed Firearm Dealers, which are required to administer background checks before they sell a gun to someone.\n\nThe law bars guns from anyone convicted of a domestic violence crime who has a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law, however, allows those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia was ranked the top state in the nation for gun safety in 2021. It has the strongest system in the nation for removing firearms from people who become prohibited from having them, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in July signed a package of five bills on gun safety after they were passed by the California State Senate.\n\nOn July 1, Newsom signed AB 2571, which prohibits the gun industry from marketing firearm-related products to minors, as well as AB 1621, which further restricts ghost guns, including the parts used to build them.\n\nOn July 12, the governor signed AB 1594, legislation establishing a firearm industry standard of conduct to promote “safe and responsible firearm industry member practices,” the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is AB 2156, signed on July 21, which cracks down on the manufacture of firearms by prohibiting any person, regardless of federal licensure, from manufacturing firearms without a state license. It also prohibits unlicensed individuals from using 3D printing to manufacture any firearm or precursor part.\n\nThe last bill, signed on July 22, is SB 1327. It allows private citizens to bring civil action against anyone who manufactures, distributes, transports or imports assault weapons or ghost guns, which are banned in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis signed House Bill 22-1086, or The Vote Without Fear Act, on March 30.\n\nThe law prohibits a person from openly carrying a firearm within any polling location or central count facility.\n\nIt also bans individuals from open carrying within “100 feet of a ballot drop box or any building in which a polling location or central count facility is located,” while election activity is in progress, according to the legislation. Violations are punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine, up to 364 days imprisonment in the county jail, or both.\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney on June 30 signed a package of gun safety bills including legislation to prohibit assault weapons, regulate high-capacity magazines and strengthen background checks.\n\nThe Delaware Lethal Firearms Safety Act of 2022 prohibits the manufacture, sale, offer to sell, transfer, purchase, receipt, possession or transport of assault weapons in Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, according to HB 450.\n\nThe package also includes legislation to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase or possess a firearm from 18 to 21, ban the use of devices which convert handguns into fully automatic weapons and hold gun manufacturers and dealers “liable for reckless or negligent actions that lead to gun violence,” the bill states.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed two bills to address secure storage of firearms and regulating ghost guns.\n\nOn May 18, the governor signed HB 4383, which prohibits individuals from selling or possessing ghost guns and ensures all firearms are serialized, allowing law enforcement to better trace them.\n\nPritzker later signed HB4729 on June 10, which requires the Department of Public Health to develop and implement a two-year public awareness campaign focused on safe gun storage, which includes sharing information about safe gun storage, the bill says.\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced on April 8 he would allow Senate Bill 387, which bans the sale or possession of ghost guns, to become law without his signature, noting it doesn’t go far enough in taking “decisive action to hold violent criminals accountable.”\n\nThe bill, which took effect on June 1 after bipartisan support, expands the definition of “firearm” to include an unfinished frame or receiver. It requires the Secretary of State Police to maintain a system to register firearms imprinted with serial numbers and “prohibits a person from purchasing, receiving, selling, offering to sell, or transferring an ‘unfinished frame or receiver’ or a firearm unless imprinted with specified information,” the bill states.\n\nThe law also requires the governor to allocate $150,000 in the annual state budget to fund registration proceedings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on July 5 signed seven gun safety bills, six of which were part of his Gun Safety 3.0 package he introduced to the state legislature in April 2021.\n\nThe package includes legislation which would allow the state’s attorney general to sue members of the firearm industry for violations stemming from the sale or marketing of firearms, the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is legislation to regulate the sale of handgun ammunition, developing a system of electronic reporting of these sales; and require training prior to the issuance of a gun purchaser identification card with a validity date of 10 years.\n\nAnother bill in the package mandates firearm owners who become state residents to obtain a Firearm Purchaser Identification Card and register out-of-state acquired handguns, according to the bill.\n\nOn December 22, Murphy signed another gun safety bill strengthening the state’s firearm licensing laws and established a list of ‘sensitive places’ where concealed carry is prohibited, including playgrounds, bars and restaurants serving alcohol, train stations, and polling places.\n\nNew York\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed a package of bills and an additional piece of legislation to address a wide range of gun safety issues.\n\nHochul signed a gun safety package on June 6, which includes bills requiring microstamping on handguns, strengthen the state’s extreme risk and firearm purchase permit law, raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21 and enhance information sharing between state, local and federal agencies when guns are used in crimes.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision on June 23 to strike down a New York gun law enacted more than a century ago which places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside the home, Hochul signed legislation to strengthen the state’s gun laws and bolster restrictions on concealed carry weapons.\n\nThe law, which takes effect on September 1, will expand eligibility requirements in the concealed carry permitting process, restrict the carrying of concealed weapons in sensitive locations and establish state oversight over background checks for guns and regular checks on license holders for criminal convictions, according to the legislation.\n\nOregon\n\nIn the November 2022 US midterm elections, Oregon voters enacted a gun safety ballot measure, Measure 114, which strengthens background checks and prohibits the sale and transfer of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nThe measure also closes the “Charleston Loophole,” which allows gun purchases to move forward by default after three days even if a background check has not been completed. It requires state police to complete background checks on individuals before a gun sale or transfer is made.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee signed three gun safety bills on June 21. They prohibit high-capacity magazines, ban the open carry of rifles and shotguns in public and raise the legal age to purchase firearms or ammunition from 18 to 21, with exceptions for law enforcement officers.\n\nOne of the bills also changes the definition of “rifle” and “shotgun” consistent with federal law.\n\nVermont\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott signed into law a package on March 25 banning firearms from hospital buildings and prohibits the transfer of firearms between unlicensed people.\n\nThe governor vetoed a similar bill, S.30, in February which would have closed the “Charleston Loophole.”\n\nThe new law, S.4, addresses the policy by extending the time period to seven days for the federal government to complete a background check before an individual can purchase a firearm. It also strengthens protections for victims of domestic violence, according to the bill.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee signed three gun safety bills into law on March 23.\n\nHB 1705 prohibits the manufacture, sale, purchase or possession of ghost guns, while HB 1630 prohibits the open carry of firearms at local government meetings and restricts them at school board meetings and election-related locations.\n\nThe third bill, SB 5078, prohibits high-capacity magazines, defined as an “ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 17 rounds of ammunition,” the bill states.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/05/10/delaware-craft-breweries-soon-able-sell-spirits-wine-more/597677002/", "title": "Delaware votes to allow craft alcohol-makers to sell each other's ...", "text": "Have you ever been to a craft brewery in Delaware with a friend who doesn't drink beer either because of taste or a gluten-free diet?\n\nWell, they won't have to sip water any longer.\n\nThe state Senate voted unanimously Thursday to allow Delaware's craft alcohol-makers to sell each other's products, effectively allowing breweries to sell wine.\n\nA spokesman for Gov. John Carney would not comment on whether or when Carney would sign the bill into law.\n\nBut Carney did say in a statement, \"Delaware has a thriving craft beverage industry that helps drive our $3 billion tourism economy. We’re always looking for ways to support our craft breweries, wineries and distilleries.\"\n\nThe new rule would take effect immediately once signed, allowing each of the state's 30-plus alcohol-makers to decide whether they want to sell their products at other craft locations and vice versa.\n\nThe move offers more for choice craft drinkers, ushering in a new era where a customer could conceivably drink a glass of wine from Marydel's Harvest Ridge Winery at Blue Earl Brewing in Smyrna.\n\nDelaware beer historian and author John Medkeff Jr. says the move should bring in new customers and expose them to more of what Delaware's craft world has to offer.\n\n\"I don't see it being a huge boon [for craft alcohol-makers], but it's certainly going to help them,\" Medkeff says. \"It will eliminate some of the remaining vestiges of Prohibition-era regulation in Delaware.\"\n\nThe real winners may be customers, some of whom have been chafing at the regulations that kept them from having a shot with their beer in a brewery or a glass of wine at a distillery.\n\nThe idea for the bill originated after a trip to Pennsylvania by Smyrna's Painted Stave Distillery co-owner Michael Rassmussen. He noticed that their laws allow much of the same kind of interchangeable offerings that Delaware's bill would OK.\n\n\"We all turn away business because of the limitations on what we can serve,\" Rassmussen says. \"We obviously want to introduce people to our products in our tasting room, but if it's the difference between them having a great time and not, then all the better to put something in their hands that they'll enjoy. And at the same time, we'll be supporting another craft producer in the state.\"\n\nAfter approaching Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Control Commissioner John Cordrey with his idea last year, he sent the Pennsylvania liquor law to Cordrey, along with other states' laws that allow similar sales to see if it was feasible in Delaware.\n\nRep. William J. Carson, D-Smyrna, the bill's primary sponsor, soon got on board and introduced it in April. His bill didn't get a single \"no\" vote in the Senate (19-0) on Thursday or the House (39-0) on April 26. Carson says he has not heard a single complaint about the bill from a constituent.\n\nThe bill did not face resistance from the state's alcohol distributorships because language in the bill was specifically crafted to keep the state's three-tier distribution in place for H.B. 373.\n\nThat means the state's breweries, wineries, distilleries, meaderies and cideries would not be able to directly sell to each other but would have to go through a third-party. That means everyone involved in the production, distribution and sale of the product would benefit.\n\nOver at Yorklyn's Dew Point Brewery Co., brewer Cody Hoffman says his bucolic brewery at the Garrett Snuff Mill complex would jump at the chance to offer other drinks, such as wine.\n\nHe says the previous limitations affected the number of large groups that would choose a craft location over a typical restaurant or bar, which offer a wider selection to fit everyone's tastes.\n\n\"This is huge. I think we'll start to see more groups because the way it is now, if one person doesn't like beer, they aren't coming here because we don't have wine or mixed drinks,\" Hoffman says of the new flexibility.\n\nIf Carney signs the bill, that same kind of selection from the bar/restaurant world would be transported right to your favorite local craft location if they so choose. (Rassmussen predicts the vast majority of the state's craft alcohol-makers would take part.)\n\nMilton's Dogfish Head Brewery — the largest craft brewery in the state and 12th top-producing craft brewery in the country — would be among those who would be willing to share their beers with others.\n\nDogfish Head Vice President Mariah Calagione says you could end up finding Dogfish Head beer at other craft locations across the state. And the next time Dogfish Head makes a collaborative beer with fellow First State brewery, you'll be able to find it at both spots.\n\nThat's another change that H.B. 373 brings in.\n\nIt now allows collaborative drinks made by multiple craft locations to be sold at each location. In 2016 when Liquid Alchemy Beverages made its Triple Trouble D³ mead with help from Painted Stave and Dover's Fordham & Dominion Brewing Co., the result was a powerful 13.5 percent ABV drink that could be sold only by Liquid Alchemy.\n\nAt Newport's Twin Lakes Brewing Co., they are chomping at the bit not only to support Delaware's craft industry but to also offer non-beer alternatives at their tap room.\n\n\"We've always put a focus on our Delaware identity, so anything we can do to support the Delaware alcoholic beverage-makers, we're going to do,\" says Twin Lakes co-owner J. Burke Morrison. \"And we want people to come in and enjoy their experience. If somebody is not a beer drinker, nobody's perfect. We're not going to hold that against them.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Among measures on the table: shutting down high-capacity businesses such as bars and gyms, halting elective surgeries and requiring people to wear masks.\n\nMap: Take a look at coronavirus trends, reopening status and mobility\n\nHere is a look at which states have paused their reopening or taken other steps. This list is continually updated.\n\nArizona\n\nGov. Doug Ducey issued an executive order requiring bars, gyms, theaters and water parks to shut down June 29. The order follows mounting pressure to respond to ballooning COVID-19 numbers that followed his accelerated reopening plan, which he announced in May.\n\n\"Arizonans have been, by and large, terrific, fantastic and responsible,\" the governor said. \"But, we have found some situations in categories where we need to take more aggressive actions, and that's what we're going to do today.\"\n\nArizona reported over 3,500 new COVID-19 cases and 36 additional deaths July 8.

Asa Hutchinson said he's not ready to ease restrictions further as the state experiences a spike in coronavirus cases.\n\nThe state has recorded over 25,000 confirmed cases, over 5,500 which are currently active. The number of new cases on July 8, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, was the second-highest since the outbreak began.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAs California faces an explosion of new COVID-19 cases, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered 19 counties — including Los Angeles, Orange and Santa Clara — to shut down businesses with indoor operations for three weeks. That includes theaters, wineries, museums and restaurants.\n\nAs of July 8, California has reported 289,468 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The state set an all-time single-day high on that day, with 11,694 cases — that includes a considerable backlog from Los Angeles County.\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware did not move into phase three of its economic reopening on June 29. The announcement, issuedby Gov. John Carney, postponed official action until this week so officials \"can get a better handle on what’s going on in Delaware and around the country.\"\n\n“Too many Delawareans and visitors are not following basic public health precautions,\" Carney said.\n\nAt the end of June, he also announced restrictions on parking at state beaches, as well as face covering requirements in public areas at the beach prior to the Fourth of July weekend. Those restrictions remain in place.\n\nThe state reported 12,414 total cases as of July 7, with 514 deaths.\n\n– Jeff Neiburg and Meredith Newman, Delaware News Journal\n\nFlorida\n\nThe number of COVID-19 cases in Florida surpassed 220,000. On June 26, the state's Department of Business and Professional Regulation announced it would suspend on-premise consumption of alcohol at bars statewide. Bars will still be able to serve drinks in to-go containers.\n\nHalsey Beshears, the department's secretary, said the action was taken because of an increase in COVID-19 cases and noncompliance by some businesses. Restaurants that serve alcohol will be allowed to stay open. However, Gov. Ron DeSantis has not rolled back any other reopening plans.\n\n– Jane Musgrave and Olivia Hitchcock, Palm Beach Post; Rachael Thomas, Treasure Coast Newsapers; Dave Osborn, Naples Daily News\n\nTravel advisory:NY, NJ, CT add states to quarantine order, bringing total to 16\n\nIdaho\n\nGov. Brad Little announced that the state will remain in phase four of its reopening process through at least July 10 after a nearly monthlong spike in COVID-19 cases. Phase four allows visits to senior living facilities and corrections facilities, and it lets nightclubs and sporting venues open with limited capacity. It is the last stage before full reopening.\n\nThe state has reached a total of over 7,800 confirmed and probable cases as of July 7. It set a new single-day record of 448 new cases July 7.\n\nIndiana\n\nGov. Eric Holcomb announced a new stage of reopening will begin July 4.\n\nStage 4.5 will temporarily pause increases in capacity at restaurants, bars and entertainment venues, among others.\n\n\"This virus is on the prowl,\" Holcomb said. \"In some places it's gaining momentum. It's not slowing down.\"\n\nThe new stage is set to last through July 17. Under the governor's initial five-phase plan to reopen the state, Stage Five was set to begin in most of the state on July 4.\n\n– Ethan May, Indianapolis Star\n\nKansas\n\nGov. Laura Kelly signed an executive order that mandates masks in public spaces statewide in order to deal with an upward trend in new coronavirus cases.\n\nAlthough Kelly’s mask mandate will require anyone in a public space where social distancing is not possible to wear a mask, counties have the ability to fight the order and not enforce it.\n\nThe mandate follows a recommendation June 22 that communities remain in phase three of reopening, which allows bars, nightclubs and personal care facilities such as nail salons and barber shops to remain open with reduced capacity. However, the governor cannot enforce this statewide.\n\nThe Kansas Department of Health and Environment has reported 17,618 positive COVID-19 cases as of July 8. The agency has reported 282 deaths.\n\n– India Yarborough and Brianna Childers, The Topeka Capital-Journal\n\nLouisiana\n\nLouisiana is approaching nearly 70,000 total coronavirus cases as the state's hospitalizations and ventilator use continued to rise. Officials reported a single-day COVID case surge of nearly 2,000 June 8, the fifth-highest total of the pandemic, while hospitalizations topped 1,000 for the first time since May 19.\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards issued a 28-day order June 23 to keep the state in phase two of reopening. That allows restaurants, malls, gyms, theaters, museums, bars and other businesses to operate at 50% capacity.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is we're not getting better; we're getting worse,\" Edwards said. \"Before it gets out of control we have to get better compliance.\"\n\nHe also asked Louisianans to avoid large groups and remain home on the Fourth of July Holiday. He traces the origin of Louisiana's summer surge in cases and hospitalizations to Memorial Day.\n\n– Greg Hilburn, Monroe News-Star\n\nMaine\n\nA week after Gov. Janet Mills indefinitely postponed the resumption of indoor bar service, she issued a mandate requiring restaurants, stores and other businesses in the city's southern and coastal regions to enforce mask-wearing.\n\nAccording to the Portland Press Herald, Mills said that was necessary to deal with an uptick in cases in those areas after \"they lifted restrictions dramatically.\"\n\nMore venues in the state, including movie theaters and museums, reopened July 1 as part of its third phase of reopening, with a 50-person cap and a checklist of requirements.\n\nAs of July 8, the state has registered a total of 3,460 cases and 110 deaths. No new deaths were reported.\n\nMichigan\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer on July 1 closed indoor bar service in south and central Michigan, saying it's needed to control an increase in the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nOnly in the northern Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula can indoor bar service remain open.\n\nThe governor also signed a package of bills allowing cocktails-to-go at bars and restaurants, which she said would help these businesses serve more Michiganders.\n\n– Paul Egan, Detroit Free Press\n\nNevada\n\nGov. Steve Sisolak signed an emergency directive Monday extending phase two of the state’s COVID-19 recovery plan through the end of July. Churches, salons, bars and gyms, all at limited capacity, were part of the state's second phase.\n\nThe move fulfills a promise Sisolak made last week, when he announced a statewide mask-wearing mandate and said “any discussion of entering phase three will be tabled” until further notice.\n\nThe number of Nevadans who have tested positive for COVID-19 reached 24,301 on July 8, with 553 deaths.\n\n– Brett McGinness, Jenny Kane and Marcella Corona, Reno Gazette Journal\n\nNew Mexico\n\nGov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the state will pause the next phase in reopening businesses that have been closed or are operating under restrictions. The state would begin to enforce mask-wearing in public. Violators could be fined $100.\n\nThe state recorded 253 new COVID-19 cases on July 6, bringing the state's aggregate total to 13,507 cases. Of those, 5,902 COVID-19 cases — or about 44 percent — are designated as having recovered.\n\n– Algernon D'Ammassa and Lucas Peerman, Las Cruces Sun-News\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFace masks will be required outside under an order expected to be signed July 8 by Gov. Phil Murphy. The announcement of the expected new mandate comes just a couple days after Murphy said there should be a national requirement for facial coverings “certainly when you're going out.\"\n\nThis mandate follows a postponement on reopening indoor dining , a major blow to an industry that has struggled since the coronavirus outbreak began.\n\n\"It brings me no joy to do this, but we have no choice,\" he said.\n\n— Terrence T. McDonald, NorthJersey.com\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGov. Roy Cooper moved to extend the state's current reopening phase for another three weeks, through July 17, rather than reopen further. The state is adding a new requirement that people wear face coverings in most public spaces.\n\nCooper announced he would not address reopening plans for the 2020-21 school year, which had been planned Wednesday.\n\nOn July 8, North Carolina set the sixth straight day of record-high COVID-19 hospitalizations, with 994 patients. The state registered 77,310 cases in total as of July 8.\n\n– Todd Runkle and Mackenzie Wicker, Asheville Citizen Times; Brian Wicker, USA TODAY Network\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGov. Tom Wolf announced July 1 that masks are now mandatory \"whenever anyone leaves home.\"\n\n\"Limited exceptions\" will be permitted, and anyone found violating the order will \"be tasked with education\" by officials or law enforcement.\n\nPennsylvania is grappling with 92,148 cases after 849 cases were tacked on to the statewide total July 8, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The state's death toll stands at 6,812.\n\n– Jasmine Vaughn-Hall, York Daily Record\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nStarting July 11, South Carolina's 8,000 restaurants, bars, breweries and other establishments will be ordered to stop serving alcohol after 11 p.m., Gov. Henry McMaster announced Friday.\n\nHis executive order, which he called \"the last call,\" will not affect the sale of beer, wine and liquor at grocery stores or convenience stores. Bars and restaurants that violate the order can lose their liquor licenses, McMaster said.\n\nThe move is meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the state's under-40 population, which now accounts for more than half of the over 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Carolina, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\n\"We hope that this will help all of us, particularly the younger generations, to realize just how serious this virus is and how much is at stake if we don't see these infection rates start dropping,\" McMaster said.\n\n— Nikie Mayo and Kirk Brown, Greenville News\n\nTennessee\n\nGov. Bill Lee granted authority July 3 to mayors in 89 counties in Tennessee to issue their own face mask mandates as COVID-19 cases rise statewide. The move follows a record day-over-day increase after the state health department reported 1,822 new cases.\n\nThat comes days after Lee extended his state of emergency declaration on June 29, along with a host of other provisions that were set to expire this week.\n\nTennessee will remain in a state of emergency until at least Aug. 29, according to Lee's latest order. The order expanded access to telehealth services, allowed restaurants to offer take-out and delivery alcohol, and eased access to unemployment benefits.\n\nTennessee shattered its daily record for both new coronavirus infections and active infections on July 8.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Health announced 2,472 new cases of coronavirus, along with 20 more deaths and 73 more hospitalizations. There are now 22,565 active cases in the state, the most since the pandemic began.\n\nAs of July 7, Tennessee has had at least 55,986 confirmed cases and 685 deaths.\n\n– Joel Ebert and Brett Kelman, Nashville Tennessean\n\nTexas\n\nRolling back an aggressive reopening process, Gov. Greg Abbott closed Texas bars and limited restaurant occupancy, leading to a lawsuit from a state group, and prohibited elective surgeries. He also issued a statewide mask order July 2, requiring Texans in counties with more than 20 positive COVID-19 cases to wear masks in public spaces.\n\nTexas health officials reported 9,979 new COVID-19 cases, 98 additional deaths and 9,610 total hospitalizations July 8 — the latter two single-day records for the state amid a pandemic that is showing no sign of diminishing.\n\n– Nicole Cobler, Austin American-Statesman\n\nUtah\n\nA week after mandating masks at all state facilities, troubling numbers prompted Utah Gov. Gary Herbert to require masks in regions of Utah that are home to several of the state’s famous national parks July 2. He announced a pause in reopening in June.\n\nUtah had counted 26,675 cases total, with 1,678 hospitalizations and 201 deaths.\n\n.\n\n– The Spectrum\n\nVirginia\n\nThough Gov. Ralph Northam announced July 1 the state would begin its third phase of reopening, he has decided to prohibit bar seating as of Wednesday.\n\nRestaurants and bars may still be able to house guests as long as they're eating at tables 6 feet apart, according to a statement from the governor's office. “I am watching what is happening in other states — we are taking a cautious approach as we enter Phase Three and maintaining the current restrictions on bar areas,” Northam said in the release.\n\nPhase three allows businesses to increase capacity to 75% and entertainment businesses to increase to 50%. As of July 8, Virginia has had more than 67,000 cases of COVID-19, with just over 6,600 total hospitalizations and more than 1,900 deaths.\n\nWashington\n\nDays after Gov. Jay Inslee delayed phase four of reopening amid a surge in coronavirus cases, he announced a short-term extension to the state's \"Safe Start\" emergency guidelines through at least July 8.\n\nAccording to the Seattle Times, his announcement came \"in anticipation of additional modifications\" early next week.\n\nAs of July 1, 17 of Washington state’s 39 counties had moved into phase three of Inslee’s four-part coronavirus recovery plan, allowing for gatherings of no more than 50 people, resuming non-essential travel and reopening theaters, libraries and museums, among other businesses.\n\nWashington has had nearly 38,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of July 6, according to a tally by the state's Department of Health.\n\n– Austen Macalus, Kitsap Sun\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.

This decision comes about two weeks after bars and nightclubs reopened for limited in-person services statewide.\n\nThe new guidelines for bars will allow bars to serve take-out alcohol. Bars that have also changed their business model in response to state guidelines and are now serving food can remain open as a restaurant as long as they keep patrons six feet apart, seated with their own groups, and do not allow groups to mingle.\n\nAs of July 14, the state has 37,686 confirmed cases.\n\n– Sady Swanson, Fort Collins Coloradoan\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware did not move into phase three of its economic reopening on June 29. The announcement, issued by Gov. John Carney, postponed official action until this week so officials \"can get a better handle on what’s going on in Delaware and around the country.\"\n\n“Too many Delawareans and visitors are not following basic public health precautions,\" Carney said.\n\nAt the end of June, he also announced restrictions on parking at state beaches, as well as face covering requirements in public areas at the beach prior to the Fourth of July weekend.

Bars will still be able to serve drinks in to-go containers.\n\nHalsey Beshears, the department's secretary, said the action was taken because of an increase in COVID-19 cases and noncompliance by some businesses. Restaurants that serve alcohol will be allowed to stay open. However, Gov. Ron DeSantis has not rolled back any other reopening plans.\n\n– Jane Musgrave, Palm Beach Post; Dave Osborn, Naples Daily News\n\nHawaii\n\nHawaii is delaying its plan to allow out-of-state visitors until September.\n\nIn late June, Gov.

It is the last stage before full reopening.\n\nThe state has reached a total of 13,113 confirmed and probable cases as of July 16.\n\nIndiana\n\nGov. Eric Holcomb announced a new stage of reopening will begin July 4.\n\nStage 4.5 will temporarily pause increases in capacity at restaurants, bars and entertainment venues, among others.\n\n\"This virus is on the prowl,\" Holcomb said. \"In some places it's gaining momentum. It's not slowing down.\"\n\nThe new stage is set to last through July 17. Under the governor's initial five-phase plan to reopen the state, stage five was set to begin in most of the state on July 4.\n\nThe total number of people sickened by coronavirus in the state as of July 15 is 54,813, while 2,610 have died from it.\n\n– Ethan May and Shari Rudavsky, Indianapolis Star\n\nKansas\n\nFollowing an executive order that mandates masks in public spaces statewide, Gov.

John Bel Edwards announced a statewide public mask mandate in an executive order, which took place July 13. The order also closed bars and reduced the limit on crowd sizes as he tries to reverse a summer surge of COVID-19 in the state.\n\n\"It's become clear to me the current restrictions are not enough,\" Edwards said. \"We cannot risk losing our capacity to deliver hospital care.\"\n\nEdwards' previous order requires employees who interact with the public to wear masks, but not the general public.\n\n– Greg Hilburn, Monroe News-Star\n\nMaine\n\nA week after Gov. Janet Mills indefinitely postponed the resumption of indoor bar service, she issued a mandate requiring restaurants, stores and other businesses in the city's southern and coastal regions to enforce mask-wearing.\n\nAccording to the Portland Press Herald, Mills said that was necessary to deal with an uptick in cases in those areas after \"they lifted restrictions dramatically.\"\n\nMore venues in the state, including movie theaters and museums, reopened July 1 as part of its third phase of reopening, with a 50-person cap and a checklist of requirements.\n\nAs of July 16, the state has registered a total of 3,598 cases and 114 deaths. No new deaths were reported.\n\nMichigan\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer on July 15 extended Michigan's state of emergency through Aug. 11.\n\nThe state of emergency does not in itself place any restrictions on Michigan residents. But it allows Whitmer to issue executive orders that place such restrictions, including current orders closing gyms and theaters in south and central Michigan, restricting occupancy at dine-in restaurants, and requiring face masks at indoor public places and crowded outdoor spaces.\n\nThe governor also signed a package of bills allowing cocktails-to-go at bars and restaurants, which she said would help these businesses serve more Michiganders.\n\nThe state surpassed 70,000 cases July 14.\n\n– Paul Egan, Detroit Free Press\n\nMontana\n\nAfter the state reported a daily high of 145 new COVID-19 cases on July 15, Gov.

Steve Sisolak signed an emergency directive extending phase two of the state’s COVID-19 recovery plan through the end of July.

Phil Murphy. The announcement of the expected new mandate comes just a couple days after Murphy said there should be a national requirement for facial coverings “certainly when you're going out.\"\n\nThis mandate follows a postponement on reopening indoor dining, a major blow to an industry that has struggled since the coronavirus outbreak began.\n\n\"It brings me no joy to do this, but we have no choice,\" he said.\n\nAs of July 15, the state has registered 172,742 confirmed cases and 13,308 confirmed deaths.\n\n— Terrence T.

Bars and restaurants that violate the order can lose their liquor licenses, McMaster said.\n\nThe move was meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the state's under-40 population.

That comes after Lee extended his state of emergency declaration on June 29, along with a host of other provisions that were set to expire this week.\n\nTennessee will remain in a state of emergency until at least Aug. 29, according to Lee's latest order.

While beer-filled growlers were legal, mixed drinks were not. And while Medkeff says cocktails weren't very popular in pre-Prohibition Delaware, takeaway growlers of beer, which were basically glorified buckets, were popular items at saloons years back.\n\nBecause alcohol sales traditionally have the highest profit margins for restaurateurs, the new rule has sparked a wave of inventive offerings ranging from 64-ounce growlers filled with margaritas and single-serve mimosa pouches to canned cocktails and bags filled with pitchers of fruit cocktails.\n\nAs Wilmington's Stitch House Brewery co-owner Dan Sheridan says, \"Liquor sales have been helping us tons. Almost anyone that gets food, especially at dinner, gets a crowler or a few to-go cocktails.\"\n\nHere's a look at some of newest ways to catch a buzz in Delaware while everyone is hunkered down.\n\nIron Hill Restaurant & Brewery, various locations including Wilmington, Newark and Rehoboth Beach. It's been a nearly 25-year run for the Delaware-born chain, so why not try something completely new? One look inside an Iron Hill restaurant and the cases of Jose Cuervo will tell you all you need to know. In addition to growlers filled with their craft beers, Iron Hill has unveiled a $29, 64-ounce margarita growler available to go or takeout. It's part of a wave of changes Iron Hill is making these days, even selling grocery bundles with toilet paper, along with craft meal kits. Iron Hill Regional Manager Clint Wagner says the restaurants will continue to adapt. \"While our main staple is beer, we know that people want as much variety as is available during this. Since we have the equipment, we decided to offer margaritas. They're typically easy to pre-batch. It was a no-brainer to offer them to our guests,\" he says.\n\nPachamama Peruvian Rotisserie, 76 E. Main St., Newark. While margaritas are also on the menu at Pachamama, they also offer pisco sours and frozen passion fruit pisco sours. You can grab a gallon of the hard stuff for $28 or pay $7 for a 16-ouncer.\n\nMad Macs, 801 S. College Ave., Newark. Want a pitcher of beer or pitcher of cocktails to bring home? Mad Macs has a unique way to get it to you: gallon bags outfitted with handles and a spout. The pitchers of margaritas and cocktails, including Southern sweet tea and \"Sweet & Fruity,\" cost $24 with beer prices varying from brand to brand.\n\nCORONAVIRUS:20 changes Delawareans made due to coronavirus (and might keep after it passes)\n\nCrow Bar, 1711 Delaware Ave, Wilmington. The high-end cocktails that once flew across this bar located in the Trolley Square area are still being made. You just can't drink them there. The menu includes $12 single cocktails and $18 doubles. And then there are the $40 batch cocktails including an Old Fashioned (bourbon, sugar, orange twist, Luxardo cherry), Moscow Mule (vodka, lime, ginger beer) and margarita. In addition, you can order a Sazerac (rye cognac, sugar, Peychaud's Bitters, absinthe rinse, lemon peel), Paper Plane (bourbon, Amaro, Aperol, lemon) or Gold Digger (turmeric and spice-infused bourbon, Strega and grapefruit).\n\nGrain Craft Bar + Kitchen, locations including Newark and Bear. With at least 60% of sales needing to be food, Grain co-owner Lee Mikles and his co-workers came up with $40 booze kits to go with $60 meal kits to make the math easy for everyone. \"With the lockdown, we’ve had to be creative in all areas,\" he says. When it comes to the drinks, your first option is a $40 orange or grapefruit crush kit, which comes with everything you need to make six drinks except the glasses and ice. Or you can purchase a pair of batch cocktails for $40, picking from their Summer Soulstice, Russian Doll, Hurrigrain or Pom margarita. The meal kits include four sandwiches, two sides, an appetizer and two desserts.\n\nMORE:Born into a 9/11 world, Delaware's high school seniors cope with chaos of pandemic\n\nKid Shelleen's Charcoal House & Saloon, 1801 W. 14th St., Wilmington.

In addition to their signature flavor, you can try strawberry or peach.\n\nStone Balloon Ale House, 115 E Main St, Newark. An Eggspectation sister site, which is also owned by High 5 Hospitality, is selling its own $5 pouches: Tito's & Tonic, Tito's and Coke, Tito's and Diet Coke, Screwdriver and Tito's Strawberry Lemonade. In addition, their $10 32-ounce \"pop top bottles\" can be filled with any beer or wine on tap. Select cocktails on tap are included, as well.\n\nStitch House Brewing, 829 N. Market St, Wilmington. Sure, you can get brews like Big Stitch Nick to go in a crowler, but cocktails and margaritas are now getting in on the action. Cocktails range from $21 to $27 for the 32-ounce cans filled with drinks such as mimosas, cranberry vodkas and bloody marys.\n\nDel Pez Mexican Gastropub, 400 Justison St., Wilmington. If you've been missing these post-work margs, they're just a phone call away. Margaritas are served in 14-ounce mason jars ($9), along with 32- and 64-ounce containers, which cost $17 and $29 respectively. They come in two flavors: El Chavo (traditional) and El Chapulin (cranberry margarita). Sangria is also available in the same sizes and cost $10 (14 ounces), $21 (32 ounces) and $38 (64 ounces).\n\nSanta Fe Mexican Grill, 190 E. Main St., Newark. Santa Fe has its own margarita deal, served in both house and Hurricane styles. They are sold in three sizes: 16 ounces ($8-10), 32 ounces ($15-$17) and 64 ounces ($28-$30).\n\nStewart's Brewing Co., 219 Governors Place, Bear. Set to celebrate 25 years this summer, there's always a first time for everything. That's the case for owner Al Stewart, who is selling individual cocktails for $5-$7 and growlers filled with them for around $30. They've been making just about everything and anything: margaritas, vodka drinks, specialty cocktails and, yes, even 64-ounce Long Island iced teas. Hangover not included.\n\nGot a tip?

The department said in a news release that only 12% of child care providers were open for business in March because of the pandemic. The department said reopening is a positive sign for parents. “This is good news at a time when many parents and guardians are gradually returning to their normal daily lives outside of the home,” Alabama DHR Commissioner Nancy Buckner said in a statement. The department said that, so far, $7 million in financial aid has been provided to 501 child care providers through the Temporary Assistance for Stabilizing Child Care grant program. Locations of open child care facilities and information about the grant program can be found at www.dhr.alabama.gov/child-care.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Municipality of Anchorage has requested a contempt-of-court hearing after a restaurant defied a judge’s ruling to halt indoor dining service in compliance with a city order meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The motion filed Saturday requests contempt sanctions against Kriner’s Diner and its owners, The Anchorage Daily News reports. City attorneys said they do not want the defendants jailed but are trying to make sure the restaurant stops indoor dining service to protect the health of Anchorage residents. The motion also accuses the restaurant’s attorney, Blake Quackenbush, of encouraging and participating in the violation, arguing the lawyer should be sanctioned. Mayor Ethan Berkowitz issued an emergency order temporarily prohibiting indoor dining at restaurants and breweries as the number of confirmed cases increased. Quackenbush argued the order violates the Alaska Constitution.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Hundreds of faculty at Arizona State University have added their names to a letter online in opposition of the university’s plans to return to some in-person instruction Aug.20. Citing risks of COVID-19, a lack of transparency and other concerns, the letter asks that ASU postpone in-person instruction until it uses the state’s guidance for starting in-person classes that was released Thursday, conducts testing of all members of the ASU community, and accommodates all faculty, staff and graduate students regardless of reason. The letter also demands equal representation of faculty, staff and students on a committee that advises executive leadership on COVID-19 policy. Directed to ASU President Michael Crow and administration, the letter was created by a new group called the ASU Community of Care Coalition and was signed by more than 500 faculty, staff and graduate students from across the university’s colleges as of Sunday.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state has 572 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and nine additional deaths due to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, state health officials reported Sunday. The Arkansas Department of Health said there are now 49,383 confirmed cases of the virus in the state and a death toll of 544, up from 48,811 cases and 535 deaths reported Saturday. The true number of coronavirus cases in Oklahoma is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The health department said 41,452 people have recovered from the virus, and there were 7,387 active cases Sunday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California’s top public health official has resigned, just days after the state announced a fix for a glitch that caused a lag in reporting coronavirus test results. Dr. Sonia Angell said in a resignation letter made public late Sunday that she’s departing from her role as director and state public health officer at the California Department of Public Health. Her letter to staff did not give a reason for her departure. Angell often appeared during news conferences about California’s response to the pandemic alongside Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who in a statement thanked Angell “for her service to the state and her work to help steer our public health system during this global pandemic, while never losing sight of the importance of health equity.” Sandra Shewry, vice president of external engagement for California Health Care Foundation, will fill the role of acting health director, the health and human services department said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Volunteers from the public health department are sitting in vehicles outside stores, watching shoppers to see whether they’re wearing masks. Thanks to the reconnaissance, Tri-County Health Department has weekly data going back to April about the percentage of people in Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties putting on face coverings when they go out in public, the Colorado Sun reports. The data could ultimately help in figuring out whether a weekly dip in mask-wearing correlates with increasing cases of coronavirus one or two weeks later, said Brian Hlavacek, Tri-County’s environmental health director. The public health department, one of the largest in the state, is among the few conducting mask surveys. The percentages of mask-wearers, after slipping in June, have been above 90% the past two weeks – which coincides with Gov. Jared Polis’ July 16 statewide order requiring people to wear masks when indoors in public.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont criticized President Donald Trump’s executive order that seeks state money to help extend emergency unemployment benefits amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s plan to provide an extra $400 a week in benefits requires states to kick in $100 a week. Speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Lamont said the plan would cost Connecticut about $500 million through the end of the year. “I could take that money from testing,” Lamont said. “I don’t think that’s a great idea. I could take that money from, you know, mass disinfecting for our schools. I don’t think that’s a great idea.” The governor also defended the state’s plan to reopen schools without requiring regular coronavirus testing for students and teachers. He said that he believes the the state’s low infection rate will allow the state to open schools safely and that teachers could go get free tests if they wanted.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state is going to spend $40million to help residents who are struggling to pay rent or mortgages during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. John Carney and the Delaware State Housing Authority announced Monday that the state is resurrecting the Delaware Housing Assistance Program to help people who are missing payments. The program was originally launched in late March but then halted a few weeks later because it was swamped with applications. At the time, it received requests from three times more tenants than officials originally set aside funds to help. The $40 million this time around is coming from the federal coronavirus relief package that Congress passed in late March to help states cover coronavirus-related expenses.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The mass shooting of 21 people at a D.C. party is calling into question the issue with large gatherings during the pandemic, and some neighbors want police to do more, WUSA-TV reports. D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham said Sunday that a gathering of hundreds of people in the city’s Southeast neighborhood Friday into Saturday defied the mayor’s order to limit groups to 50 people. Despite community members circulating flyers advertising the block party days before, police said organizers did not have a permit for the party. “It’s important as a community that we have zero tolerance for this kind of activity,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday. But, when it comes to enforcement, the district’s police department said recently that it is hoping for community compliance. Newsham said the department did not have enough officers to break up this party.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Students began returning to some university campuses Monday as the state reported the fewest new daily cases in more than a month. Classes for new students started Monday at Stetson University. Students moved into dormitories over the weekend at the DeLand campus as well as at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. In Orange County, public school students started the school year Monday with two weeks of online learning. At the end of the month, they will get to choose between continuing with the virtual learning or going to in-person classes. Meanwhile, Florida reported 4,155 new coronavirus cases Monday, the smallest daily caseload increase since the end of June. The Sunshine State now has 536,961 total cases and 8,408 virus-related deaths. That marked an increase of more than 90 deaths reported in Florida on Monday.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A man falsely claimed that a drug his company was selling would lower the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19, federal prosecutors said. Matthew Ryncarz and his company Fusion Health and Vitality, which operated as Pharm Origins, are accused of saying a misbranded drug called Immune Shot would lower the risk of getting COVID-19 by 50%, according to federal prosecutors in Savannah. The drug “bore false and misleading labeling,” prosecutors said in a news release Monday. A lawyer for Ryncarz did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the charges of selling a misbranded drug. “Our office is committed to ensuring that businesses do not take advantage of a global health crisis and people’s fears in order to unlawfully make a buck,” U.S. Attorney Bobby Christine said in the release.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health officials reported a record 231 new coronavirus cases Saturday as state and municipal officials closed beaches and parks on Oahu and restricted other activities. The statewide total of cases since the start of the pandemic in March has risen to 3,346, and newly confirmed infection cases surpassed 200 for two days in a row. Most of the cases have been in Honolulu and its suburbs. The death Friday of an Oahu man who was older than 60 was the state’s 31st fatality linked to COVID-19, the state Department of Health said. Closing Oahu’s beaches, parks and other high-risk activities will help prevent the spread of the virus, but the measures are not enough, and residents need to take responsibility in efforts to curb the virus, Anderson said. Gov. David Ige, a Democrat, plans to reinstate a requirement that people traveling between the islands quarantine themselves for 14 days, starting Tuesday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will remain in the fourth and final stage of a plan to reopen for at least another two weeks as coronavirus infections and deaths show little sign of slowing, Gov. Brad Little said Thursday. The Republican also reemphasized his desire that schools open this fall, though he said that would be up to local districts. Little said the state has sufficient health care workers, personal protection equipment, ventilators and ICU beds. He also said the state was making some progress with declining infection rates and other criteria and emphasized the money being spent to make sure schools can safely reopen, including $10 million for additional masks, gloves, sanitizer and separation glass. “The expectation is that schools will not be closed for extended periods of time during the ’20-’21 academic year,” Little said. “I genuinely understand the deep concern of some teachers and parents about returning to school for in-person instruction.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The school district in the capital city has updated its dress code policy for remote learning, saying students can’t wear pajama pants, slippers or hats while on camera when classes start this month. Springfield Public Schools officials said they hope students approach online classes the same way they would attending classes in person, and that means following a dress code that also bars hoods, sunglasses and bandannas, among other things. The district said students should also be “sitting up out of bed preferably at a desk or table” during remote learning, according to its school manual. “The expectation is that the dress code is upheld,” Jason Wind, director of school support, recently told school board members. School officials said the policy changes were developed with teachers, administrators and parents. But some parents disagree with the rules.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State public health officials on Sunday reported a fourth consecutive day of 1,000 new confirmed COVID-19 cases and one new death. The Indiana State Department of Health said the state has had 74,328 cases and 2,835 deaths since the start of the pandemic. More than 841,000 tests have been administered in Indiana. Students at Indiana University began moving in Sunday, in a process that will be spread out over 12 days. Before moving in, students have to undergo a COVID-19 test. Tents will be set up in Memorial Stadium, according to The Herald-Times. Those who test positive will have to return home and isolate themselves for 10 days before coming back to campus. If they can’t return home, they’ll be assigned to isolation on campus. Students who are living off campus will also have to get tested before they arrive. Classes begin Aug. 24.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: University of Iowa administrators pushed ahead Monday with plans to resume some in-person classes and on-campus housing, even as student leaders said those steps were too risky during the coronavirus pandemic. University leaders said they would not test students who will begin moving into the Iowa City campus in the coming days, unlike last week’s mass testing at Iowa State University. They have also not finalized metrics for determining whether to shut down face-to-face instruction in the event of an outbreak during the semester. But at a news conference, top administrators touted the safety measures they have put in place and said they looked forward to welcoming students. Last week, undergraduate and graduate student government leaders sent a joint letter calling on the school to offer online-only classes and limit student housing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state on Monday reported nearly 1,100 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases and another seven COVID-19-related deaths over the previous three days. The state Department of Health and Environment said Kansas has had 31,730 coronavirus virus cases since the pandemic reached the state in early March. That’s up 3.6%, or 1,092 cases, since Friday. The actual number of cases is thought to be far higher because people can be infected without feeling ill and because of a lack of testing, particularly early in the pandemic. The state health department said there have been 387 COVID-19-related deaths reported for Kansas during the pandemic, an increase of 1.8% since Friday. However, the confirmed or probable cases leading to deaths stood at 1.22% as of Monday, a low for the pandemic. Hospitalizations increased 1.9% over three days, up 36 to 1,911.\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: Bourbon fans will be doing virtual toasts at this year’s Kentucky Bourbon Festival. The festival’s board has shifted the event to a virtual experience because of the coronavirus to help protect the safety of distilleries and the health of bourbon fans and the Bardstown community, where the annual event is held, festival organizers said. “At this time, we know it’s the right decision to move to a new type of bourbon celebration by going virtual,” said festival Board of Directors Chairman David Mandell. “We look forward to welcoming everyone back to Bardstown for our 30th anniversary next year.” This year’s event is set for Oct. 15-18. Bourbon fans will be able to go online to view nearly 20 live and recorded “Spirits Education Sessions,” festival organizers said. All will require free registration to attend. Virtual sessions will include a series featuring master distillers teaching the particulars of bourbon making.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s legislative auditor found two rural parishes’ claims that the state was double-counting their positive coronavirus tests in the official tally of cases was unfounded, upending theories pushed in conservative circles that the data is being skewed to make the outbreak appear worse than it is. Legislative Auditor Daryl Purpera’s office, a nonpartisan agency that digs into numbers for state lawmakers, said the case statistics reported on the Louisiana Department of Health’s online coronavirus dashboard “are generally correct.” “We found that none of the duplicates reported by Red River Parish were counted twice on LDH’s dashboard, and all but three duplicates identified by DeSoto Parish were not counted twice on LDH’s dashboard,” says the auditor’s report, released Thursday evening.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: An American Indian tribe plans to expand its food pantry services as it responds to the coronavirus pandemic. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians has received $900,000 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Indian Community Development Block Grant program to retrofit and expand a food service facility, Republican Sen. Susan Collins said. The expansion will establish a food pantry, Collins said. She said the expansion is important for the tribe’s efforts to combat the pandemic, which has brought economic hardship to the community. “This investment will help ensure that the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians can continue to safely provide affordable and nutritious food services on their lands during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Collins said. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs were awarded $1.8 million in HUD money last month, Collins said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSilver Spring: The state elections board voted Friday to significantly reduce the number of places where voters can cast ballots on Election Day in November, a proposal aimed at accommodating a shortage of poll workers while avoiding voter confusion and crowded precincts during the coronavirus pandemic. The five-member board’s recommendation to Gov. Larry Hogan calls for using 282 public high schools or better sites as “vote centers” where any registered voter in a particular county could cast a ballot Nov. 3. Board members also expressed support for keeping the state’s roughly 80 early-voting centers open Nov. 3. The state’s current election format calls for having roughly 80 early-voting centers and opening up to 1,800 precinct-based polling places. Vote centers would be larger forums than precincts, which could make it easier to maintain social distancing rules, according to local election officials.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Church officials say nearly a dozen Catholic schools have closed in the state this year, and more could shutter as the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic mounts. The Boston Herald reports among the recently announced closures are schools in Chelsea, Boston, Braintree, Holbrook, Lowell, Kingston, Marlborough, Methuen, Weymouth and Winchester. Thomas Carroll, school superintendent for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, told the newspaper it’s already the largest number of closures the region has seen in almost 50 years. He said Catholic schools nationwide have been dealing with declining enrollment and financial challenges for years, but they’ve been exacerbated by the pandemic. Carroll estimated Catholic school enrollment in the Boston archdiocese is down 7% from March, when Massachusetts and other states enacted widespread economic closures and social restrictions to control the pandemic.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Hatch Detroit contest winners and other participants whose businesses have been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic will have access to a $100,000 utility assistance relief fund created by the nonprofit. This year’s Hatch Detroit Small Business Alumni Relief Fund takes the place of the annual Comerica Hatch Detroit Contest. Hatch Detroit is a nonprofit that supports existing and new retail initiatives in Detroit, Highland Park and Hamtramck through funding, exposure and mentoring. Hatch Detroit’s executive director, Vittoria Katanski, said the program’s graduates have opened 44 businesses, employed more than 500 people and invested more than $7 million in their businesses since the first contest was held in 2011. Comerica has invested an additional $50,000 to provide organizational support to Hatch Detroit in 2020.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State health officials reported a decrease in the number of new cases of COVID-19 on Friday but urged residents to stay vigilant in their efforts to stop the virus’s spread by continuing to wear masks, practice social distancing and avoid large crowds. Officials also expressed worry about an increase in cases tied to long-term care facilities, saying the new cases seem to come as staff members have relaxed precautions and started attending large events such as parties, church gatherings or weddings. “This is fragile, and we are very concerned that the progress we have made can be at risk, and can even be lost, if we let up on our precautions,” said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist. “We need everyone in Minnesota to be doing their part to limit transmission. We are all connected to each other.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state Department of Health reported 16 new coronavirus deaths and 476 new cases Monday, bringing the total to 67,649 cases and 1,912 deaths. There were a total 175 outbreaks reported at long-term care facilities. The latest statistics available, last updated Saturday, show 4,067 Mississippians in long-term care have been diagnosed with coronavirus, and 832 have died. Mississippians in the 60-to-69 age bracket made up the largest number of hospitalizations as of Friday with 1,039. Those in the 70-to-79 age bracket made up the largest number of deaths with 497. But, by far, those in the 18-to-29 age group have the highest number of confirmed cases in the state with 14,236. Eleven people in that age bracket have died of the virus. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said positive cases of the virus have surged in recent weeks in the that demographic.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State health officials reported another 1,027 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Monday, continuing a trend of nearly 1,000 new cases every day since last week. The exception was Sunday, when the state recorded 475 confirmed cases. The state’s data was delayed over the weekend as health department officials moved the numbers from an old surveillance system to a new one, and health officials said Monday that another 1,073 cases were confirmed Saturday. Six COVID-19 deaths were confirmed over the weekend and none Monday. On Monday, St. Louis County health officials said they planned to survey 5,000 randomly selected residents and test them for the coronavirus. The study is planned to help health officials understand racial disparities in public health, identify risk factors for COVID-19 and educate about preventative measures that could be taken, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has surpassed 5,000 known cases of COVID-19 and has reported 75 deaths, officials said Monday. The state reported 261 cases over the weekend, including 65 on Monday, bringing the total known cases to 5,017. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick. Two more residents of long-term care facilities in Billings recently died from COVID-19, Yellowstone County officials said Saturday. A woman in her 80s who had lived at Canyon Creek Memory Care died in the hospital Aug. 4. Hers was the 16th death tied to an outbreak at the facility. A man in his 90s died Aug. 5 at a senior living facility that county officials did not identify. Eighty people are hospitalized with the respiratory virus, including 44 in Yellowstone County, health department spokesperson Barbara Schneeman said Saturday.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Lincoln Police closed down a bowling alley over the weekend for violating the city’s coronavirus restrictions after the owner vowed to fight the rules requiring people to wear masks in public places. On Saturday, Lincoln Police enforced the local health department’s order to close Madsen’s Bowling & Billiards for violating restrictions related to the coronavirus outbreak. Officials have said employees at Madsen’s Bowling & Billiards weren’t wearing face coverings, patrons were told masks were optional, and people weren’t far enough apart. The bowling alley’s owner, Benjamin Madsen, has challenged the city’s health restrictions in court. The business was ticketed Saturday for violating a closure order by operating Friday. Madsen’s attorney, J.L. Spray, declined to comment on the closure Saturday.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Tourism officials marked another index of the economic effect of the coronavirus pandemic Friday, reporting that about 1 million people visited the Las Vegas area during June – down 70.5% from the same month a year ago. A monthly economic report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority noted that casinos were closed for 78 days before reopening four days into the month. It said that with large gatherings banned to prevent the spread of COVID-19, convention attendance was zero. Some Las Vegas resorts remain closed, and the report put occupancy of the more than 95,000 rooms available after properties were allowed to open June 4 at only about 41%. State health officials reported 976 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 statewide and 20 more deaths, bringing the Nevada total to at least 920 since the pandemic began.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s hospitals are hurting financially and bracing for cuts due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hospitals in the Granite State collectively lost $575 million in revenue between March and July, said Kathy Bizarro-Thunberg, executive vice president of the New Hampshire Hospital Association. The group estimates hospitals will lose $700 million by the end of the year, The Concord Monitor reports. Hospitals were forced to pause lucrative nonessential surgeries and services due to the virus crisis. Alex Walker, chief operating officer at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, said the hospital laid off more than 70 employees last week, reduced hours for dozens of positions and froze hiring for all nonessential workers. The hospital expects to lose $40 million by the end of next month. “COVID has had a devastating effect on our finances,” Walker said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nParamus: Two congressmen called for the CEO of the New Jersey Veterans Home at Paramus to resign Monday following a story last week that showed how lax infection control and questionable decisions may have exacerbated the devastating toll COVID-19 has taken at the facility. U.S. Reps. Bill Pascrell Jr. and Josh Gottheimer called for CEO Matthew Schottlander to step down before an expected second wave of COVID-19 emerges this fall and winter. “Mismanagement and a lack of transparency at the state-run Paramus Veterans Home resulted in needless death and preventable tragedy,” the two Democrats said in a statement. The Paramus home leads the state in nursing home deaths, with 81 residents and one caregiver dying from COVID-19. It is one of the highest death tolls nationally. Almost 300 residents and staff have been infected.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Environmental regulators have ordered employers to promptly report coronavirus cases to the state. An emergency rule issued by the Environmental Department requires employers to report positive COVID-19 cases to the department within four hours of being notified of the case. The department said the emergency rule will remain in effect for up to 120 days unless a permanent rule is adopted before the end of the 120 days. “By requiring employers to report positive cases in a timely manner, the state will be able to more rapidly respond to workplaces, providing immediate guidance and support to employers and preventing the spread of COVID-19 beyond the infected employees,” the department said. However, the department said that in more than 280 instances, employers were aware of cases at least three days before the department learned of them.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday dismissed President Donald Trump’s executive orders as “laughable” and another chapter in the federal government’s botched response to the coronavirus as he praised New Yorkers for mostly good behavior that has reduced the infection rate in his state. The Democrat was particularly critical of Trump’s Saturday announcement that states must pay part of $400 weekly unemployment insurance benefits. Meanwhile, Cuomo praised New Yorkers for driving down the rate of infections so low that only 0.78% of tests performed Saturday came back positive. He said the 131 people in intensive care units also represented the lowest number since the early days of the health crisis. “It’s great news,” he said. It was not all good through: Another seven deaths were recorded. And Cuomo is trying to keep pressure on local authorities to enforce rules meant to keep crowds from bars and restaurants.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: When K-12 public school students in the state resume classes this fall, the vast majority of them will be sitting at home in front of a computer screen. Despite a desire by most Americans to reopen schools at least partially for in-person learning, nearly 2 in 3 North Carolina parents were not given the choice to send their kids back for the start of the fall. Data released by the state shows at least 65% of public school students will start this academic year fully remote because their districts went with the Plan C option that Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper offered in his reopening guidance. Beyond that, an unknown number of parents have opted for remote instruction in districts that allowed for a mix of in-person and online learning. “We know how important in-person school is,” Cooper said Thursday. “However, we need to put the health and safety of the children first.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nHarwood: Veterans who weren’t given military funeral rights when they were buried during the coronavirus pandemic have been given a final salute at the Fargo National Cemetery. United Patriotic Bodies and Fargo Honor Guard volunteers were at the cemetery Saturday when three rifle volleys were fired and taps were played individually for 14 different families of veterans. United Patriotic Bodies Cmdr. Jason Hicks said the salute is an honor and a duty to those who sacrificed for their country. Gary Varberg came to the cemetery to honor his brother, Roger Nelson. They served in Iraq together and decades in the National Guard, KVLY-TV reports. “Closure, maybe a little bit,” Varberg said. “Mainly to salute his military history and his duty.” Nelson was just one of the many veterans who wasn’t given military rights and honors when he was buried at the Fargo National Cemetery during the pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Unemployment claimants would receive $300 in federal weekly unemployment assistance under an option provided by the White House that doesn’t require extra state spending, the administration of Gov. Mike DeWine said. The plan agreed to late Sunday by Gov. Mike DeWine means less money for the unemployed than under another option that would provide $400 a week, with $100 coming from the state. Both options involve less than the $600 a week in federal pandemic aid that recipients were receiving until their expiration Aug. 1, with Congress unable to agree on an extension. Ohio recipients will still receive regular state unemployment benefits under the plan. The new federal benefit might not take effect until later this month while Ohio seeks guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor for implementing it, said DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials reported 397 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus Monday and two additional deaths. The latest numbers from the Oklahoma State Department of Health bring to 43,963 the number of confirmed cases in the state since the pandemic began in March. The death toll now stands at 605. Meanwhile, one of the state’s largest hospital systems is reporting an alarming increase in the number of pregnant women testing positive for COVID-19. Integris Baptist Medical Center reported Monday that doctors have delivered 24 babies from women who have the coronavirus since June 30. Prior to that, the hospital had not cared for any expectant mothers with COVID-19. The health system has not reported any maternal or fetal deaths related to the virus.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Out-of-state travelers will be charged more while camping at state parks to help recoup some losses during the economic downfall caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department announced a 30% surcharge on nonresidents who make new camping reservations or arrive at a state park campground beginning Monday. Under the surcharge, the average cost for a full-service recreational vehicle site for nonresidents will increase from $33 a night to $42 a night, and the average tent rental fee will increase from $19 a night to $23 a night. The additional fees are temporary and will remain through 2020, officials said, adding that it could raise about $500,000 to help hire staff, pay for cleaning supplies and support other operations. It is similar to the extra fees most states add to fishing licenses purchased by out-of-state residents.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Under pressure to give schools more health guidance about how to safely reopen, Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said Monday that it will provide recommendations to school districts based on the local rate of transmission of the coronavirus. The Department of Health plans to provide an analysis showing the seven-day rate of transmission in each county and group those rates into three categories: low, moderate and substantial. The department’s recommendation on how to reopen would be based on those categories. So, for areas with a low transmission rate, districts could adopt a partly remote or a full in-person instruction model. For areas with a moderate transmission rate, districts could adopt a partly remote or fully remote instruction model. For areas with a substantial transmission rate, the department would recommend a fully remote instruction model. Most districts will be in the moderate category.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state registered one more death from COVID-19 and 176 newly reported positive cases over the weekend, state health officials said Monday. The state Department of Health also said 93 people are currently hospitalized with the virus, the highest total in more than a month. Eight of the patients are in the intensive care unit, and two are on ventilators, the agency said. The new cases bring the state’s coronavirus death toll to more than 1,000 and its total cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started to nearly 20,000. In recent days Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo has been enacting tougher social and economic measures to control the spread of the virus as cases of COVID-19 continue to rise in the state.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster is calling on the state health department to report any COVID-19 cases among students and staff in public schools. The Department of Health and Environmental Control should develop a process to collect and disclose cases in every school district in the state, McMaster wrote Monday in a letter to DHEC Chairman Mark Elam. That data, stripped of identifying information to comply with confidentiality laws, should be reported on a daily basis, he said. A spokesperson for the health agency said it intended to fulfill the governor’s request. At least eighteen districts will start classes next week, according to reopening plans approved by the state education department. Currently, schools are only required to notify students and families who were in close contact – within 6 feet for at least several minutes – with someone who tested positive, state Department of Education spokesman Ryan Brown said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Sioux Falls School District may be short of bus drivers when school begins later this month. School Bus Inc. holds the contract to transport Sioux Falls students to and from school by bus, and manager Jim Shafer said concerns about the coronavirus pandemic are partially to blame for the shortage. Shafer said in a normal year, the district would still be looking for 10-15 drivers. He said it’s about double that number this year. Shafer said driver applications are coming in, but there are background checks, physicals and other tests that potential hires need to complete. Shafer said that “the district has done pretty extensive stuff” in the way of precautions. Those safety efforts include an expectation by the district that drivers wear masks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Election officials have updated the absentee ballot application for November to reflect that the state Supreme Court eliminated an expansion of mail voting during the pandemic. Secretary of State Tre Hargett’s office said voters who have underlying health conditions particularly susceptible to COVID-19 can get absentee ballots by selecting the “illness or physical disability” on the application. The application doesn’t mention underlying conditions or COVID-19, but the secretary of state’s website does. Voters themselves will determine under penalty of perjury whether their underlying conditions qualify. In a news release, Hargett and Elections Coordinator Mark Goins said that “if a voter is too ill to go to shopping centers, Walmart, Home Depot, or other public places then they are probably too ill to go the polls and conversely, if you are going to those other places then common sense would indicate the voter is well enough to go to their polling place.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State Attorney General Ken Paxton advised Friday that local governments’ attempts to delay evictions for renters grappling with the COVID-19 recession amounted to rewriting state law – something they can’t do, he said in nonbinding legal guidance. “While local officials do possess certain emergency powers ... statewide eviction procedures far exceed the requirement that those powers be exercised ‘on an appropriate local scale,’ ” Paxton said in a letter. “Government Code does not authorize local governmental entities operating under a declared disaster to independently rewrite state law as it applies to their jurisdiction to prohibit, delay, or restrict the issuance of a notice to vacate.” Paxton’s letter, in response to a question from Republican state Sen. Brandon Creighton of Conroe, seems to chide local officials like Austin Mayor Steve Adler, who last month extended the eviction moratorium in the city until Sept. 30.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Federal inmates who have sued a jail and alleged a failure to adequately protect them from the coronavirus will not be able to seek immediate release through a habeas corpus petition, a judge ruled Friday. Six people charged with federal crimes and held at Weber County Jail in Ogden filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court last month, asking for more inmates to be released to home confinement and for additional health measures, such as mandating masks and providing hygiene supplies. Attorney Benjamin McMurray, whose office represents more than 100 jail inmates, said during a court teleconference hearing Friday that his clients are being punished and put into disciplinary confinement if they continue to report symptoms. Frank Mylar, who represents Weber County Sheriff Ryan Arbon, said some of the inmates lack any legal standing because they have already contracted the virus “and moved on.”\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: As the first group of Norwich University students has arrived on campus, some students have failed to follow coronavirus-related safety guidelines, the military school said. Some cadets apparently broke the rules of the school contract, school officials told WCAX-TV, but they would not elaborate on which ones. President Mark Anarumo plans to meet with those students early this week to discuss consequences, Norwich officials said. Students who break the contract may be asked to leave campus, officials said. Under the contract, students agree to follow certain safety measures, including abiding by occupancy limits in dormitories and common areas as well as physically distancing and wearing a mask in public spaces. On-campus students may not leave the campus without approval. Approximately 400 to 500 students were expected to return to campus this past weekend and were required to quarantine based on state guidelines.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Hundreds of thousands of applications for mail-in ballots that a voter advocacy group sent to voters in Virginia had the wrong return addresses, adding another complication for state election officials who are already hard-pressed to pull off a smooth election in a pandemic. The Virginia Department of Elections said the return envelopes were addressed to the wrong election office, which would force election officials to forward the applications to the correct office for processing. Meanwhile, the department said anyone wanting to vote absentee should apply for a ballot through the state’s website. The problem mailers were sent by The Center for Voter Information, a third-party group not affiliated with the state, the department said in a news release. The Washington-based group, which says it’s a nonpartisan organization aiming to increase voter participation, had mailed over 2 million applications, The Washington Post reports.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: New guidelines for fitness centers and gyms went into effect in the state Monday in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus. KING TV reports under the updated guidelines, gyms and fitness facilities will need to nearly triple the minimum distance required for patrons exercising indoors, except for those practicing certain team sports. The new COVID-19 guidance issued by Gov. Jay Inslee for counties in Phase 2 or 3 of reopening increases the requirement of 6 feet of distance between patrons to 300 square feet, which is just over 17 feet of space. Showers, hot tubs, saunas and tanning beds at multi-use facilities will be closed, as will steam rooms, squash courts and racquetball courts. Locker rooms will also be limited for handwashing and restrooms only. All patrons will also be required to wear facial coverings while inside indoor fitness facilities, “except while engaged in strenuous exercise.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: The New River Gorge National River is increasing access and services that were stopped in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The National Park Service is using guidance from federal authorities and state and local health officials as it monitors the pandemic and increases access. The park was reopening access beginning Saturday to Grandview Sandbar Campground, Glade Creek Campground and Stone Cliff Campground. Backcountry camping, hiking trails, river and river access points, vault toilets at heavy visitor use areas and group picnic shelters at Grandview continue to be available. Facilities that remain closed include visitor centers, vault toilets at less popular areas, group campsites, and campgrounds at Army Camp, Brooklyn, Gauley Tailwaters, Meadowcreek, Thayer and War Ridge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s voters have requested more than 900,000 absentee ballots for Tuesday’s primary, more than seven times what they requested in the August primary in 2018, according to data state elections officials released Monday. The sheer volume of applications is another sign of the coronavirus pandemic’s impact as voters try to avoid infection at the polls. According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, voters had requested 903,760 absentee ballots and had returned 506,709 as of Monday. That compares with 2018, when they requested 123,393 ballots and returned 106,663. Tuesday’s primary includes nearly 30 legislative races and two Republican primaries for congressional seats in southeastern Wisconsin’s 5th District and western Wisconsin’s 3rd District. No statewide offices are on the ballot.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Workers closed the state’s last operating oil rig last week. It is just the second time since 1884 that the state has had zero gas rigs in operation, according to Pete Obermueller, the executive director of the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. “It is historic, but not in a great way,” Obermueller said. “There are so many jobs attached to these rigs, and now, people are painfully learning so much revenue is attached too. It’s mind-boggling and hard to capture the impact.” The organization estimates that one lost rig means roughly 100 lost jobs, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. This year, diminished demand for oil due to the coronavirus pandemic and a global price war have depleted production. In April, oil future prices turned negative for the first time in history. The state relies heavily on revenue from fossil fuels. The collapse in energy prices and the pandemic have led state analysts to predict a $1.5 billion revenue decline.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/07/anti-racism-art-speedway-shot-sweetener-pharrell-vs-va-beach-news-around-states/119027036/", "title": "Anti-racism art, speedway shot sweetener: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The first capital of the Confederacy has renamed a street honoring the rebel president to recognize a Black civil rights lawyer instead, defying a state law meant to protect Confederate monuments and memorials. The Montgomery City Council voted Tuesday night to rename Jeff Davis Avenue for attorney Fred D. Gray, who grew up on the street during the Jim Crow era and went on to represent clients including Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. “When I think of heroes who exemplify the best in our city, (Gray) is certainly at the forefront of that,” said Mayor Steven Reed, Montgomery’s first Black mayor. He initially proposed the change in December. The City Council’s unanimous approval could prompt a $25,000 fine under an Alabama law passed in 2017 to prevent the removal or alteration of Confederate monuments, which have been challenged and taken down across the South, but Reed said donors already had offered to pay the penalty for the city, where delegates voted to form the Confederacy in 1861. Gray, 90, still practices law in Tuskegee, located east of Montgomery, and said the city had kept him informed. “This is a project of the mayor’s,” he said. “He expressed it to me. I was very happy about it. And I am very happy about it.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Citing an increase in rude, violent behavior in schools, the city’s superintendent wants parents to help address the problem with children. The bad behavior has included a fight at a high school that prompted a large police response, along with a TikTok challenge in which students caused thousands of dollars in damage to school bathrooms, KTUU-TV reports. Superintendent Deena Bishop said the pandemic may be behind the behavior. “We are just finding, more and more, our young people, our children, are mostly as stressed out as the rest of us,” Bishop said. “And the stress and the anxiety in the community has taken effect. And we just want to work with our parents to find solutions to this.” The state’s largest school district has recorded nearly 800 suspensions this year, most at the secondary level. Officials say while that’s not necessarily a high number, the severity of the incidents has increased, including fights, assaults, and drug and alcohol issues. Teachers also report younger children seem to have lost the coping skills they need to calm down, Bishop said. In a recent newsletter, she asked parents to intervene after students in many incidents lacked respect and patience. “If you are seeing it at home, guess what’s happening in our schools,” Bishop said of the bad behavior.\n\nArizona\n\nFountain Hills: Beaten in his last three elections, former six-term Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is attempting another comeback, this time running for mayor of the affluent Phoenix suburb where he has lived for the past two decades. The former lawman on Tuesday announced his entry in the 2022 mayor’s race in Fountain Hills, a town of about 25,000. After getting crushed by a Democratic challenger in 2016 after 24 years as sheriff, Arpaio finished third in a Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in 2018 and second in the GOP primary in his 2020 bid to win back the sheriff’s post. In both comeback attempts, Arpaio lost the vote in Fountain Hills. In an interview, he said his last comeback bids failed because he entered those races too late in the election cycle, and his early entry in the mayor’s race is an attempt to avoid the same fate. He rejected criticism that he should walk away from public life. The 89-year-old said he remains in good health and wants to push a pro-business agenda on behalf of the town. Arpaio was voted out as sheriff in 2016 amid voter frustration over his headline-grabbing tactics and legal troubles, including his disobedience of a judge’s 2011 order to stop his large-scale traffic patrols targeting immigrants that led to his 2017 criminal contempt of court conviction, which was pardoned by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Elizabeth Eckford, one of the nine Black students who first integrated Central High School in 1957, celebrated her 80th birthday at the school with the help of about a dozen students. The teens, members of the Civil Rights Memory Project, lined the sidewalk in front of the high school Monday, holding handwritten signs. “It’s an honor to be here to celebrate with her because she did so much for our school,” Destiny Logan, a senior, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The number of students participating was kept small, and they were told not to clap or make loud noises, as they gathered outside the same school where an angry mob of protesters had met Eckford and eight other Black students in 1957. After President Dwight Eisenhower ordered federal troops to protect the nine students, they began their first full day on Sept. 25, 1957. Images of the nine Black teens became among the most indelible of the civil rights movement, including one of Eckford calmly walking into school as a teen girl behind her shouts. A teacher sang “Amazing Grace,” and the students sang “Happy Birthday” to Eckford. Students and other guests took turns taking pictures with her and telling her stories. “It was the best birthday I had in a long, long time,” Eckford said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: City leaders on Wednesday approved one of the nation’s strictest vaccine mandates – a sweeping measure that requires the shots for everyone entering bars, restaurants, nail salons, gyms or even a Lakers game. The City Council voted 11-2 in favor of the ordinance that will require proof of full vaccination starting Nov. 4. The move came after the council postponed a vote last week to deal with concerns ranging from who could be fined for violations to whether employees could end up in fistfights when they have to serve as vaccine door monitors. Some critics charge that a mandate would amount to segregation of those who cannot or refuse to be vaccinated. Others call it unenforceable. Business trade groups have said the city mandate will sow confusion because Los Angeles County’s own vaccine rules – which apply both in Los Angeles and in surrounding communities – are less sweeping. However, council members who support the ordinance said it is aimed at reducing the risk of new coronavirus case surges. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who’s expected to sign the ordinance into law, said last week: “I don’t want to bury another city employee, police officer, firefighter.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A health system fired 119 employees for not adhering to its vaccine requirement without a religious or medical exemption. That accounts for less than 0.5% of the company’s 26,500 employees around the state, said UCHealth spokesperson Dan Weaver. UCHealth employees had until Oct. 1 to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or apply for and receive an exemption. Among those fired, 54 employees were from the Denver region, 33 from northern Colorado and 32 from the southern part of the state. Nearly 1,170 medical and religious exemptions were approved, for about 4% of the workforce, Weaver said. “Despite the loss of these employees, UCHealth’s COVID-19 vaccination requirement has helped to improve staffing. With broad vaccination rates, fewer employees are testing positive for COVID-19 and needing to be out of work while they recover,” he said in an email. The employees who were terminated are welcome and encouraged to reapply if they receive one of the three approved COVID-19 vaccinations, Weaver said. UCHealth is a nonprofit health care system with 12 hospitals and hundreds of medical clinics in the Rocky Mountain region.\n\nConnecticut\n\nManchester: A private high school’s president apologized Tuesday after cheerleaders from another school reported being subjected to racist taunts after a football game there. Sean Brennan, president of East Catholic High School, said an investigation has not been able to determine who was involved in the Sept. 24 incident, but the school has “no tolerance for derisive and unkind words or behavior directed at our own students or students from other schools.” In an open letter to the Montville High School community, he wrote: “I am deeply sorry this happened, and I promise you that we can and will do better.” A 16-year-old Black cheerleader from Montville reported two East Catholic football players used a racial epithet in telling her to go home after East Catholic won. Another cheerleader reported she also was subjected to racial slurs, and the cheerleaders had water thrown at them. Brennan had earlier issued a statement saying the school took the reports seriously but did not believe “anything inappropriate was said.” There have been daily protests outside East Catholic since the interaction was reported, and leaders from both schools met Sept. 29 to discuss it with Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference officials. The CIAC said both schools will send student representatives to a training session on sportsmanship.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Dover International Speedway is offering the chance to drive around its “Monster Mile” to people who get vaccinated against COVID-19 at the racetrack later this month. Up to 800 drivers and their passengers will be able to take two laps around the track in their own vehicles behind a pace car, according to a news release. Events will be held Oct. 16 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Oct. 17 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines will be offered. Participants will be able to get their first, second or booster shots. Free coronavirus testing will also be available, and people can get vaccinated at the events without driving the track. The first 250 people to sign up for vaccinations will receive two tickets to the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at the speedway April 30, 2022. Registration opened Wednesday at racetoendcovid.org. Appointments are encouraged, but walk-ups for testing and shots without driving the track will be accepted. Driving the track without signing up will only be available if the slots aren’t filled in advance. Drivers going around the track alone must be at least 18 and have a valid driver’s license, car registration in their name and vehicle insurance. Those who are 16 and 17 must have a license and a parent or guardian in the vehicle to sign a release form.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mourners and members of the public gathered on the Washington National Cathedral’s grounds Tuesday evening as its massive funeral bell tolled for America’s more than 700,000 COVID-19 victims, WUSA-TV reports. It was an astounding number – 700 plangent peals of the funeral bell, which was used before the pandemic to mourn the loss of presidents, senators, and luminaries of American life. Now, the bell tolls largely for those who chose to remain unvaccinated, six months after most Americans gained access to the lifesaving shots. “They don’t seem to realize the import of it until they themselves suffer a loss in their family,” said Zenaida Samaniego, who drove from Maryland to hear the hourlong ceremony. “The bells will toll again because of this hard-headedness about getting something that protects people.” With each bell symbolizing 1,000 American deaths from the coronavirus, disruptions and nonchalance were not lost on the mourners. A woman watching a YouTube video on her phone, at full volume, received glares until she got the message. “This must be moving us in a way I didn’t think it would,” said a woman who gave her name as Bess, describing the somber sense of hearing the bells from her Adams Morgan home. “I wish I could say this would be the end. But I don’t think it will be.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: The mansion that gangster Al Capone owned for nearly two decades – once fated to be demolished – just sold for $15.5 million. The Miami Herald reports the home was sold to 93 Palm Residence LLC, managed by Coral Gables accountant Toni Alam. Capone, the original “Scarface,” bought the waterfront house for $40,000 in 1928. He died there in 1947 from a heart attack. Developer Todd Michael Glaser and partner Nelson Gonzalez, senior vice president of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM, bought the nine-bedroom residence in August for $10.75 million with plans to demolish it and replace it with a more modern project. But preservationists in Miami Beach balked at their plans. Glaser compared the out-of-the-blue offer to a winning lottery ticket. “If someone tells you they want to give you a $5 million lotto ticket, of course you’d take it,” he said. Glaser had previously told the Herald the home, which is about 3 feet below sea level, had flood damage and standing water underneath it. “The house is a piece of crap,” he said at the time. “It’s a disgrace to Miami Beach.” The home is believed to be where Capone and his associates plotted the notorious St. Valentine’s Day massacre in which seven members of an opposing gang were gunned down in a Chicago parking garage in 1929.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State inspectors and an investigation found that a state agency unlawfully held onto millions of dollars in seized funds, spending money on Fitbits, exercise equipment and other items. A division of the Department of Revenue also spent funds on engraved firearms and stress balls shaped like beer mugs, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The report released last month by the Office of the Inspector General confirmed reporting last year by the newspaper and WSB-TV detailing how money seized in tax investigations was spent by the Department of Revenue’s Office of Special Investigations. Spending by that investigative division was “clearly wasteful” and “gave the appearance of extravagance,” the report found. The department has since changed its policies and returned money to the state treasury, where it should have gone in the first place, the newspaper reports. Revenue Commissioner Robyn Crittenden, who took over the department in July, vowed to make more reforms. “The department is actively moving forward to ensure the findings highlighted in this report are remedied,” she said. “We are committed to consistently doing the right thing and serving the taxpayers of Georgia with integrity and accountability.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. Geological Survey officials have lowered the alert level for the Kilauea volcano, saying they expect its latest eruption to remain confined to the summit. The eruption began last week in the Halemaumau crater at the volcano’s summit on the Big Island. Officials with the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory had raised Kilauea’s alert level to “warning” and its aviation code to red as they assessed the intensity of lava fountains covering the floor of the crater and billowing clouds of volcanic smoke. But over the past several days, a thick layer of molten lava has accumulated at the base of the crater, lessening fears it could spread. Observatory officials lowered the alert level to “watch” and the aviation code to orange Monday afternoon. The eruption remains confined to the crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. It’s not in an area where there are any homes. Ron Hanatani, who has a pottery studio in Volcano Village near the park’s entrance, said residents and tourists have been flocking for a glimpse, though as a former geologist at the observatory, he has seen more spectacular eruptions. Village businesses are grateful for the attention during a normally slower time of year for tourists, said Ira Ono, owner of Volcano Garden Arts and Cafe Ono. Even though he has lived in the area for decades, he’s still mesmerized by Kilauea. “We see the glow at night,” he said. “It’s pretty dramatic and beautiful.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: With Gov. Brad Little out of the state Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin issued an executive order involving COVID-19 vaccines. Oh no you don’t, said Little, who promised to rescind it in quick order and was expected to be back in the state Wednesday evening. The maneuvering of Idaho’s top leaders came while Little was in Texas meeting with nine other Republican governors about concerns with how President Joe Biden is handling border issues. McGeachin, a far-right Republican, is running for governor, and the governor and lieutenant governor don’t run on the same ticket in Idaho. Her executive order seeks, among other things, to prevent employers from requiring their employees be vaccinated against COVID-19. Most mainstream Republicans prefer to give private businesses latitude to make their own decisions. McGeachin was also rebuffed Tuesday by Maj. Gen. Michael J. Garshak in a query about activating Idaho National Guard troops and sending them to the U.S.-Mexico border. “I am unaware of any request for Idaho National Guard assistance under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) from Texas or Arizona,” Garshak wrote, in part, to McGeachin. “As you are aware, the Idaho National Guard is not a law enforcement agency.” It’s not the first time McGeachin has ruffled feathers in her capacity as acting governor with Little out of state. In May, she issued an order banning mask mandates that Little eliminated on his return, saying such decisions were best left to local officials.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State and federal officials on Monday unveiled a mobile unit that they say will add speed and efficiency to digital investigations of child pornography and exploitation at a time when young people are using the internet more than ever before. The gray van is assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children task force, said Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, whose office oversees the group and its increasing caseload. Tips about alleged exploitation received by the task force increased by 118% from 2017 to 2020 and are on pace to jump another 23% this year. “Child predators are actively trolling the internet, trading, selling and collecting images of the most vile sexual acts involving children,” Raoul said. Other predators log on to appear to innocently befriend young people, he said, then lure them to meet-ups for sex. The mobile unit is funded by a $174,000 federal grant and outfitted with advanced technology. When authorities target a suspect, the unit will be key in an environment where timing is critical, and evidence integrity can make or break a case, said Zeus Flores, a digital forensic examiner for the task force. Instead of having to work in what could be squalid conditions – “some of the homes we’re going into are frankly biohazards,” Flores said – the mobile unit will offer privacy and safety.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Mourners gathered at a small chapel Tuesday evening to remember the dozens of Hoosiers lost last year to domestic violence. The Indianapolis-based Domestic Violence Network, which seeks to raise awareness of and end domestic violence across the state, hosts the annual memorial. The number of people honored Tuesday was the highest in recent memory, advocates said. Among the 74 Hoosiers known to have been killed in domestic violence incidents between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, 34 were from Marion County, with the oldest 77 and the youngest just 7. The names of those 34 from the capital area were read aloud at Tuesday’s service. Domestic Violence Network Executive Director Kelly McBride said the increase in deaths was “staggering.” Eleven people were honored at 2020’s service and 16 in 2019. Ash Rathwell, training services manager for the network, said local service providers have seen a sharp increase in calls for help regarding domestic violence since the pandemic began. But a report released by the group this year examined the overwhelming need domestic violence service providers experienced long before COVID-19. On any given day, there were more than 1,800 victims and survivors served by direct service providers, but at least 182 requests for services go unmet, it found.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Legislature on Tuesday rejected the first set of redistricting maps drawn by a state agency, raising concerns that majority Republicans may opt to insert politics into the state’s nonpartisan process. The Legislative Services Agency drew the maps, which proposed revising Iowa’s four congressional districts to include two that lean heavily toward Republicans, one that favors Democrats and one that both parties would have a chance at winning. After a committee moved the first set of maps to the Senate floor without debate, the full Senate rejected the first plan on a party-line vote, with all 32 Republicans voting “no” and the 18 Democrats voting “yes.” By state law, the LSA is responsible for following detailed guidelines to ensure population balance among Iowa’s congressional districts and to prevent political influence in the initial drafting of changes. By law, the Legislature can only accept or reject the maps without amendment. The LSA now has 35 days to draw a second set of maps, which again must be voted up or down by lawmakers with no amendments. If that is rejected, the LSA would have another 35 days to draw a third set, which could be amended with majority Republicans leading that process – something that hasn’t happened in 40 years, since the first time the state’s current redistricting procedure was in place.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Legislators are setting up a new anti-mandate committee targeting COVID-19 vaccines and masking in schools. “I’m absolutely not sure it’s safe,” Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, said of the vaccines. Thompson is one of 11 legislators on the Special Joint Committee on Government Overreach and the Impact of COVID-19 Mandates. Republican leadership announced their eight appointees Monday. Democrats haven’t appointed their three allotted members. “It would be one thing if we knew this thing absolutely worked, and there was no adverse reaction,” Thompson told reporters Tuesday. “But that’s not the case right now.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. But Thompson said that “this is not a true vaccine ... an attenuated or weakened version of the virus itself. This is a a genetically engineered vaccine that some doctors I’ve talked to have told me that this is introducing basically an autoimmune disease into your body.” Republicans have balked at President Joe Biden’s proposed vaccine-or-testing mandates. Brushing aside concerns about immunocompromised people and children who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination, Thompson asked why Biden and others who’ve been inoculated would care whether others have gotten their shots.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bourbon industry is signaling it’s increasingly bullish on its future after reaching new production heights despite the COVID-19 pandemic and trade disputes in key overseas markets. Bluegrass State bourbon producers filled nearly 2.5 million barrels in 2020, setting a new production record, the Kentucky Distillers’ Association said Monday. It marked the third straight year Kentucky distilleries filled more than 2 million barrels of bourbon. And for the first time in the modern era of American whiskey, Kentucky has 10 million barrels of bourbon aging in distillery warehouses, it said. The state of 4.5 million people has more than 10.3 million barrels of maturing bourbon, according to the latest figures. “Kentucky’s signature bourbon industry continues to invest in our commonwealth at unprecedented levels, despite global pandemic disruptions, exorbitant taxes and ongoing trade wars,” said Eric Gregory, president of the distillers’ group. “This is truly a historic and landmark record.” Massive inventories are a bet on the future because most bourbons typically age four to eight years before reaching their market. Bourbon gets its flavor and golden brown color during aging.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A 2017 lawsuit challenging former prosecutors for hardball tactics, including the issuance of fake subpoenas and the jailing of crime victims who wouldn’t cooperate with investigators, was settled Tuesday in federal court. The suit centered on the practices of staff under former District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro, who did not seek reelection last year after two six-year terms. Cannizzaro’s successor, Jason Williams, agreed to the appointment of a special monitor to ensure his office complies with terms of the settlement, including detailed policies written to ensure prosecutors don’t use “coercive or unlawful means to secure cooperation from crime victims or witnesses.” Cannizzaro ended his staff’s use of phony subpoenas soon after the practice was exposed by an online news outlet, The Lens. He defended the jailing of witnesses, including victims, as a rarely used but sometimes necessary practice. Civil rights and criminal justice advocates were harshly critical of the practices. Among the harshest critics was Williams, a defense attorney and City Council member. He won election to succeed Cannizzarro late last year while running as a reformer who vowed to end what he called a “win at all cost” mentality in the district attorney’s office. The settlement calls for a $120,000 payout to three remaining plaintiffs.\n\nMaine\n\nYork: A high school student staged a schoolwide walkout after her anti-racism art display sparked complaints, forcing school officials to remove it. York High School senior Claudia Corcoran’s display was part of a school project that tasked students with creating a topic inspired by a book, Principal Karl Francis said. Corcoran’s project included a two-panel painting that describes racism as an issue that continues to plague American society. She donated the piece to the school’s librarian, who displayed it in the library. The York School Department administration ordered that the school should remove the display after complaints from parents, students and faculty. But more complaints on social media followed after its removal. The administration said the artwork was removed because the librarian did not get approval to display it. But in the past, librarians have been allowed to hang student art without permission from school officials. In a statement, YSD Superintendent Lou Goscinski said the student’s art isn’t an issue, “but once we display it, it becomes the speech of the school.” Following that statement, Corcoran staged a walkout Sept. 29, demanding that the school return her artwork to the library. Two days later, Francis announced the art would be put back on display.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff has been indicted on charges that he defrauded a state agency he led by inducing it to pay him nearly $280,000 in mostly severance pay before he moved to his post in the governor’s office, the Maryland U.S. attorney announced Tuesday. Roy McGrath also used funds from the Maryland Environmental Service to pay a personal pledge to a museum and got the agency to pay tuition expenses for a class after he left his job as executive director, according to the indictment. He also recorded conversations with senior state officials without their consent and faces state charges, it said. McGrath, of Naples, Florida, fraudulently obtained $276,731 from the environmental service, according to the indictment. The Baltimore Sun, which first reported the story, said McGrath characterized the case as “political persecution.” His attorney, Bruce Marcus, wrote in an email to the Associated Press that his client “vigorously and categorically denies the allegations.” McGrath resigned in August 2020 when he was just 11 weeks into the job as Hogan’s top aide, after the payments became public. Michael Ricci, Hogan’s spokesman, described the charges Tuesday as “very serious and deeply troubling.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Acting Mayor Kim Janey on Tuesday signed an ordinance intended to address climate change by requiring large buildings in the city to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The measure “is a monumental achievement that will have positive impacts on our residents for generations to come,” Janey said in a statement. “We know that the negative effects of climate change bear a disproportionate burden on our most socially vulnerable communities.” Last month the City Council unanimously approved the ordinance, which applies to about 3,500 commercial and residential buildings of 20,000 square feet or more, or about 4% of structures in Boston, according to city officials. They account for 60% of Boston’s building emissions. To reach the goals, building owners can perform energy efficiency improvements; switch to clean, efficient and electric heating systems or fossil fuel-free systems; and purchase clean energy. The measure is an amendment to a 2013 ordinance that required all commercial and residential buildings of at least 35,000 square feet or with at least 35 units to report their energy and water use to the city every year. Buildings covered were also required to show concerted efforts to reduce their energy use or emissions every five years through energy actions or audits.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Canada invoked a treaty with the United States and asked a judge Monday to suspend litigation over Michigan’s effort to shut down a Great Lakes oil pipeline. Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau made clear that his government is backing Enbridge, the Calgary-based company that operates Line 5. Canada said it requested negotiations with the U.S. about the pipeline. It cited a provision in a 1977 treaty that says no public authority in either country can take steps to interfere with the flow of hydrocarbons. Line 5 moves about 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids daily between Wisconsin and Ontario, traversing parts of northern Michigan. A section of the pipeline runs on the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, which connects lakes Huron and Michigan at the top of the Lower Peninsula. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel, both Democrats, have said Line 5 is a grave threat to the Great Lakes and should be closed to prevent spills. Whitmer said she was disappointed by Canada invoking the treaty. “Rather than taking steps to diversify energy supply and ensure resilience, Canada has channeled its efforts into defending an oil company with an abysmal environmental track record,” she said, noting an Enbridge pipeline rupture into a southwestern Michigan river in 2010.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz called on lawmakers Tuesday to approve a series of new moves to respond to the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, including vaccine and testing requirements for teachers, school staff and long-term care workers, plus measures to relieve strained hospital capacity. The Democratic governor detailed his proposal in a letter to lawmakers after meeting privately with legislative leaders. He urged lawmakers to approve the measures in a special session that was originally envisioned for last month to approve a $250 million bonus package for front-line workers who have risked their lives during the pandemic. Negotiations on that plan have yet to produce an agreement and missed a Labor Day target for completion. Since then, Walz has proposed that the session also include drought relief for farmers. But he has also insisted that Senate Republicans agree not to use the special session to fire Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm, as some have threatened. Walz urged lawmakers to approve a series of waivers and enact other relief to allow hospitals, nursing homes and child care centers to respond more effectively to the surge. He noted that more Minnesotans are hospitalized for COVID-19 than last spring and that at the end of last week only two pediatric intensive care beds were available in the entire state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state on Wednesday followed through on its promise to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that it come up with a plan to prevent unnecessary institutionalization of people with mental illness. Lawyers for the state filed a notice of appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. On Sept. 7, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ordered that the state’s initial plan be submitted to the U.S. Justice Department and a mental health expert for feedback within 120 days. The judge said then that the final plan must be completed in 180 days. State lawyers asked last week that the deadline be postponed because Mississippi intended to appeal Reeves’ ruling. James Shelson, the state’s lawyer, wrote Sept. 27 that if the Department of Mental Health were required to complete its plan and other requirements of Reeves’ order in the allocated time frame, “Mississippi will suffer irreparable injuries from undue interference with its mental health system and a fundamental alteration of that system both in costs and structure.” Under Reeves’ order, the state is responsible for tracking a wide array of data, fund new vouchers to help people with mental illness pay rent and utilities, and start a clinical review process sampling 100 to 200 patients a year “to assure that services are working as intended to address the needs of people with serious mental illness.”\n\nMissouri\n\nBonne Terre: A man was put to death Tuesday for killing three workers while robbing a convenience store nearly three decades ago – an execution performed over objections from racial justice activists, lawmakers and even the pope. Ernest Johnson died from an injection of pentobarbital at the state prison in Bonne Terre. He silently mouthed words to relatives as the process began. His breathing became labored, and he puffed out his cheeks, then swallowed hard. Within seconds, all movement stopped. In his written last statement, Johnson said he was sorry “and have remorse for what I do.” He said he loved his family and friends and thanked those who prayed for him. Johnson was pronounced dead at 6:11 p.m., nine minutes after the dose was administered. A corrections department spokeswoman said four relatives representing all three victims were present. Johnson’s witnesses included relatives and his lawyer. No relatives spoke after the execution. Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said 59 demonstrators gathered on the edge of the prison grounds. Johnson had a history of scoring extremely low on IQ tests, dating back to childhood. His attorney, Jeremy Weis, said Johnson also was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and lost about one-fifth of his brain tissue when a benign tumor was removed in 2008.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The University of Montana law school is launching an independent review following a walkout and rally over alleged mistreatment of sexual harassment and assault victims. About 100 university students and community members gathered Tuesday morning to demand change and accountability in the Alexander Blewett III School of Law, the Missoulian reports. Speakers and students called on law school Dean Paul Kirgis and Associate Dean Sally Weaver to resign, saying they had failed students and created a toxic environment. As first reported by the Daily Montanan, women from the law school say the two administrators discouraged them from reporting allegations of sexual harassment and assault to the university’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX. Following students’ demands, university officials are launching an “independent, outside review to assess the learning and working environment in the Law School and the mechanisms in place to best support students,” according to a statement to the Missoulian on Tuesday from university spokesman Dave Kuntz. The institution has invested significant resources into investigating the allegations against the law school, Kuntz said in the statement. Those initial investigations found law school leaders did not violate university policy.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A man who fled to Nicaragua after being charged with dozens of felony counts of child pornography and enticement has pleaded no contest to seven of the counts. Adam Hawhee, 29, faces up to 88 years in prison when he’s sentenced in December, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Hawhee was originally charged last year with two counts of child enticement and 26 counts of child pornography possession. He was accused of trying to entice two 7-year-old girls at an Omaha park in March 2020, leading police to search his home, where they reported finding more than 100 child pornography images – some involving toddlers. Hawhee was freed after posting bond. He was jailed again four months later after allegedly exposing himself to a young boy and trying to coax the boy into his vehicle. Hawhee was freed again after posting bond and fled to Nicaragua, missing a December court appearance. When Omaha police found him and had him returned to Nebraska, a judge set his bond at a whopping $50 million – believed to the highest in Douglas County history.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Tribal lawyers are asking a U.S. judge to reconsider her earlier refusal to block digging at a proposed lithium mine where they say newly uncovered evidence proves it was the sacred site of a massacre of dozens of Native Americans in 1865. The new motion filed in federal court in Reno includes an 1865 newspaper report and two eyewitness accounts of how at least 31 Paiute men, women and children were “murdered by federal soldiers” at Thacker Pass. The accounts were in an autobiography published in 1929 by well-known American labor organizer Bill Haywood. One was from a cavalry volunteer who participated in the slaughter and the other a tribal member who survived it. Nevada Lithium Corp.’s construction is slated to begin next year at what would be the largest lithium mine in the nation and biggest open-pit lithium mine in the world. Demand for the mineral, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, is expected to triple in the next five years. The only significant lithium mine now operating in the U.S. is in Nevada. Another planned halfway between Reno and Las Vegas by Ioneer Ltd. also faces legal challenges from environmentalists fighting to protect Tiehm’s buckwheat, a rare desert wildflower that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service formally proposed last week to be listed as an endangered species.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: As a drug recovery program comes to an end at fire stations in the city, a local center that’s part of a state-founded network can offer immediate screening and other services, Gov. Chris Sununu said Monday. The Doorway of Greater Manchester is now available 24 hours a day by calling 2-1-1 and is offering recovery services to coincide with the closing of the Manchester Safe Station program. “I would like to thank the Manchester Fire Department for their tireless service these last few years,” Sununu said in a statement. “Our Doorways have served a tremendous purpose and have provided an excellent service, and we are building out a system that goes beyond the scope of Safe Station.” Safe Station was founded by Manchester firefighters in 2016 in response to the community’s opioid epidemic. People could go to any Manchester fire station for screening and handoff to services. The department will continue to provide mobile, field-based substance use disorder outreach services. The Doorway program is a network of nine locations across the state that provide one-stop access to substance use services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: A man who used dating apps to lure and kill three women five years ago was sentenced Wednesday to 160 years in prison after a trial in which it was revealed that friends of one victim did their own detective work on social media to ferret out the suspect. Khalil Wheeler-Weaver, 25, sat motionless as the judge gave the sentence in state court in Newark. The sentencing was preceded by emotional statements by family members of victims Robin West and Sarah Butler. In a brief statement before they spoke, Wheeler-Weaver denied responsibility, telling Superior Court Judge Mark S. Ali that he was framed. Wheeler-Weaver’s mother, aunt and brother sat in the gallery but didn’t address the court. The sentences covered three murders, one attempted murder, and other counts including kidnapping, aggravated arson and desecration of human remains. The Essex County prosecutor’s office had credited friends of Butler, a college student from Montclair, with using social media to help police find Wheeler-Weaver. They gained access to her social media accounts, set up a fake account, lured Wheeler-Weaver to a meeting in Montclair and notified police, according to prosecutors. A fourth woman who survived an attack and testified at Wheeler-Weaver’s trial also provided crucial information that helped investigators.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The City Council has adopted a resolution that acknowledges ongoing generational trauma caused by U.S. Indigenous boarding school policies and formalizes a commitment to work with Indigenous communities toward reconciliation and healing. Councilors voted in favor of the measure during a meeting Monday. Mayor Tim Keller is expected to sign the resolution next week on Indigenous Peoples Day. The city has been researching the history of a public park where students of the former Albuquerque Indian School were believed to have been buried more than a century ago. Ground-penetrating radar will be used to study the site, and another meeting was planned later this week to talk about how to keep moving forward. “It really is kind of a first step for us as a city to move forward toward healing and also to be inclusive of all of our communities in Albuquerque and to understand some of the pain that people have lived with over the years of not knowing,” Council President Cynthia Borrego said during the virtual meeting. Indigenous activists became concerned earlier this year when a plaque memorializing the students from the former school vanished. They established a makeshift memorial of flowers and other offerings and demanded an investigation.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal agents raided the offices Tuesday of a New York City police union, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, and the Long Island home of its bombastic leader, who has clashed with city officials over his incendiary tweets and hard-line tactics. FBI spokesperson Martin Feely said agents were “carrying out a law enforcement action in connection with an ongoing investigation.” Agents were seen carrying boxes out of the union’s Manhattan headquarters and loading them into a van. The FBI also searched union President Ed Mullins’ home in Port Washington, Feely said. Mullins resigned as the union’s president Tuesday night, according to a message the union’s board sent to members, saying he did so at the board’s urging. The union represents about 13,000 active and retired NYPD sergeants and controls a $264 million retirement fund. “The nature and scope of this criminal investigation has yet to be determined. However, it is clear that President Mullins is apparently the target of the federal investigation,” the board’s message said. “We have no reason to believe that any other member of the SBA is involved or targeted in this matter.” The union’s board said that while Mullins is presumed innocent, it asked him to step aside to ensure the union’s day-to-day operations continue unimpeded.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Some supporters of Republican former Gov. Pat McCrory’s efforts to contest the 2016 gubernatorial election results can be sued for allegedly defaming four residents who were falsely accused of voting twice, an appeals court ruled Tuesday. The complaint the Southern Coalition for Social Justice brought forward in 2017 could pave the way for lawmakers and their supporters to be penalized for making inaccurate voter fraud claims in future elections. The unanimous ruling from the three appeals court judges allows a trial court to hear the case against the Pat McCrory Committee Legal Defense Fund and the Virginia-based Holtzman Vogel Josefiak Torchinsky law firm named in the complaint. The judges also decided that William Clark Porter, a GOP official in Greensboro whose signature was on one of the election protests that was filed, is entitled to a legal defense that would likely clear him of defamation claims because he participated in a “quasi-judicial election protest proceeding.” “Mr. Porter was not the puppet master. He was the puppet, and obviously, he did make serious allegations against our clients, but this is a good ruling for us,” said Allison Riggs, who leads the voting rights program at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. “We believe that we now can proceed against the masterminds of this concerted effort to defame North Carolina voters.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFort Yates: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has elected a woman to be its next leader, according to results released Tuesday. Janet Alkire would be the first woman to head the tribal council in more than half a century. Gates Kelley was elected Standing Rock chairwoman in 1946 and was the first woman to preside over a tribe in the United States, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Alkire received 829 votes to defeat current tribal Vice Chairman Ira Taken Alive, who came in with 762 votes. Taken Alive, who said he is contesting the results, edged Alkire in the July primary that advanced the top two vote-getters. A 15-year Air Force veteran, Alkire has served as Standing Rock’s executive director twice. Her platform included prioritizing youth and elderly wellness initiatives, homelessness, economic development and government transparency. She favors mental health, addiction treatment and rehabilitation for all members and is an advocate for child welfare. The Standing Rock Reservation straddles the North Dakota and South Dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has lost its most important accreditation, a major blow to an institution once widely admired in its industry and by the general public. The zoo said it plans to appeal the decision announced Wednesday by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, considered the nation’s top zoo-accrediting body, one day after the institution announced its new leader. The accrediting group cited concerns about the zoo’s animal programs department and inappropriate businesses practices by its former leaders. Tom Stalf, the zoo’s former president and chief executive, and Greg Bells, its former chief financial officer, resigned in March after an investigation by the Columbus Dispatch found they allowed relatives to live in houses owned or controlled by the zoo and sought tickets for family members to zoo entertainment events. Subsequent audits initiated by the zoo’s board found that improper spending and questionable business practices by the pair resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in zoo losses. Investigations and reviews by the Ohio attorney general’s office and the state auditor are pending. Besides the financial issues, the accrediting group voiced concerns about the zoo’s acquisition of ambassador animals in its animal programs department.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A prosecutor is again asking the state Supreme Court to remove two members of the Pardon and Parole Board from the case of a high-profile death row inmate. Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater filed the motion Monday to remove Kelly Doyle and Andrew Luck from the clemency hearing for Julius Jones. Prater alleges the two are biased because of their work with inmates on criminal justice reform. “Both Adam Luck and Kelly Doyle engage in political activities that work to release inmates from prison, all of which makes their Board decisions, at the very least, have an appearance of impropriety,” Prater wrote. The court previously rejected Prater’s request to remove the two from Jones’ commutation hearing on the same grounds. The same five-member board narrowly rejected clemency Tuesday for another death row inmate convicted of killing a prison cafeteria worker in 1998, paving the way for the state’s first execution in more than six years. John Marion Grant, 60, is scheduled for lethal injection Oct. 28. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death for killing 58-year-old Gay Carter at the Dick Conner Correctional Center in Hominy. Grant’s attorneys said he received ineffective trial counsel because his lawyers never properly presented mitigating evidence, such as his difficult childhood.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: After receiving positive reviews, experts say a nonpolice first-response unit has the potential to be a “citywide solution” for an alternative to nonemergency calls regarding people experiencing a mental health crisis or homelessness. During a City Council work session Tuesday, researchers suggested the Portland Street Response team pilot program should be expanded, following a Portland State University study that evaluated the program’s first six months. “Our first recommendation is to commit the necessary resources toward the expansion of Portland Street Response to eventually make its services available throughout the city and during all hours of the day,” researchers wrote in the report. The unarmed Portland Street Response team is composed of a mental health crisis therapist, a firefighter paramedic and two community health workers who are dispatched to 911 calls related to mental health crises or the homeless population. The team currently works Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. From February to mid-August, the team responded to 383 incidents, with two-thirds involving people experiencing homelessness and roughly half involving someone who needed mental health care. Less than 4% resulted in a trip to the hospital, and none led to arrests, the report found.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSomerset: Officials in a rural western Pennsylvania county say the elected prosecutor’s access to his office and the courthouse has been restricted after he was charged last month with violently raping a woman he knew through work. Somerset County District Attorney Jeffrey Lynn Thomas, 36, was accused last month of having attacked the woman in her Windber home. He was charged with rape, indecent and simple assault, strangulation and criminal trespassing. County Solicitor Michael Barbera told The (Johnstown) Tribune Democrat that Thomas can no longer use a remote “key fob” to enter the building through side doors or after hours. Instead, he must use the main public entrance with metal detectors and scanners and staffed by sheriff’s deputies, he said. Barbera said that because Thomas is charged with felonies, he no longer has access to a law enforcement database. The Republican said he is planning to plead not guilty and fight the charges in court. He told reporters Friday through his attorney that he’s taking a leave of absence to focus on his case. His lawyer also told reporters Friday that “there’s much more to this story than meets the eye.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nSmithfield: Veterinarians are trying to save a bald eagle that was found injured, with infected eyes and elevated lead levels. An environmental police officer and wildlife control specialist from the state Department of Environmental Management rescued the young bird from the shore of Stump Pond on Saturday and brought it to the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island in Saunderstown, where it’s being treated. The national bird since 1782, bald eagles were once an endangered species, and their recovery is considered “a spectacular conservation success” story, according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Still, there are only “a small handful of bald eagle pairs breeding in Rhode Island,” said John Herbert, a biologist for the DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife. Veterinarians believe the bird rescued Saturday is a young adult, and he’s almost totally blind, said Kristin Fletcher, executive director of the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island. It has a lesion on one eye and an apparent problem in the other eye and is being treated with eye drops. Fletcher said the bird might have neurological damage and is being tube-fed. A low level of lead was also detected in the bird, she said. The clinic has treated about a half-dozen bald eagles through the years, and “pretty much every eagle we’ve had has lead issues,” she noted, saying the metal likely gets into the birds through shotgun pellets and sinkers used in fishing.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The executive director of the South Carolina Election Commission has left her position several months earlier than planned, with the agency saying she’s taking a new job at a nonprofit that provides cybersecurity resources to election-related entities. Marci Andino had planned to step away from her role Dec. 31 but left office Friday to take over as director of the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center, part of the nonprofit Center for Internet Security, commission spokesman Chris Whitmire told The State newspaper. Until a permanent replacement is found, Voter Services Director Howard Knabb is taking the helm in an interim role, Whitmire said. Leading the agency since 2003, Andino implemented a new statewide voter registration system, voter ID law and candidate filing process. Her departure follows tension with state Republican leaders in the run-up to the 2020 election. She recommended stricter safety measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including expanding absentee voting. One of Andino’s suggestions was challenged in court and made it all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court: the removal of a witness signature requirement for absentee ballots. But the court ruled unanimously that the rule should stay.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A panel of judges will review allegations that Gov. Kristi Noem abused her office to help a family member obtain a state appraiser license. The Attorney General’s Office on Wednesday announced it was referring the complaint to the South Dakota Government Accountability, which will investigate the matter and determine if any misconduct occurred. The allegations center on a meeting Noem had with officials with the Department of Labor and Regulation after the agency had recommended denying Noem’s daughter, Kassidy Peters, a real estate appraiser license. Peters ultimately was granted the license in late 2020, four months after the meeting, and shortly after, the state employee who’d recommended denial was no longer employed in the labor office. The Associated Press reported Peters began working as a state-registered appraiser – an entry-level job – in 2016. And in September 2019, Peters applied to become a certified residential appraiser. The appraiser certification program moved to deny the license in summer 2020. Noem initially refused comment on the story but used social media last week to deny any wrongdoing. “I never once asked for special treatment for Kassidy,” the Republican governor wrote. “She is my daughter and I’m proud of her. I raised her to accomplish things on her own.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center has landed $3.2 million in federal money to upgrade a laboratory used for research on infectious diseases. In a news release, the Memphis campus said the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded the money for equipment and infrastructure improvements at the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory. The school said the lab is one of about a dozen nationwide commissioned by the institute after the 9/11 attacks to study very contagious pathogens as a safeguard against bioterrorism. The laboratory opened in 2009. It has played a role in research related to COVID-19.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Opponents of a new state ban on most abortions filed a lawsuit in Illinois on Tuesday after weeks of being thwarted by courts elsewhere in their efforts to block the nation’s most restrictive abortion law. The latest legal challenge came as the Biden administration waited for a federal judge in Austin to rule on a request to halt the law known as Senate Bill 8, which bans abortions in Texas once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks after conception. A hearing was held Friday, but there was no timetable on a decision. Although courts have blocked similar measures elsewhere in U.S., the Texas law has remained in place since early September because it uniquely leaves enforcement solely up to private citizens, who are entitled to at least $10,000 in damages if they prevail in a lawsuit against abortion providers. A San Antonio doctor who admitted defying the law last month was quickly sued – not by anti-abortion advocates but by former attorneys in Illinois and Arkansas who oppose the law and are trying to force a court to weigh in. The Center for Reproductive Rights is now asking a federal court in Chicago to consolidate the lawsuits against Dr. Alan Braid and declare the law unconstitutional. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to remain in place through inaction.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program Clinic from the St. George Regional Hospital is offering five informational meetings this month for those affected by radiation from nuclear testing in Utah, Nevada and Colorado. The clinic is focusing on more than 60,000 people, known as Downwinders, who were exposed to radiation at testing sites during the 1950s and ’60s. A law known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act will expire in July 2022, according to a press release from Intermountain Healthcare. Those who qualify for RECA will be able to learn more about the compensation for which they can qualify and about starting the process through these public meetings. Qualifying cancers are leukemia; multiple myeloma; non-Hodgkin lymphomas; and primary cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, salivary gland, brain, stomach, urinary bladder, colon, thyroid, pancreas, breast, esophagus, bile ducts, liver, gallbladder, lung and ovary.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state plans to halt legislation that would change the way its criminal justice system handles 18- and 19-year-old criminal offenders because officials said some young offenders are too dangerous to be treated as juveniles. The state became the first in the U.S. last year when it passed the law known as Raise the Age, which treats 18-year-olds as juvenile offenders instead of adults. The reform would also include 19-year-old offenders, Vermont Public Radio reports. But Gov. Phil Scott’s administration said it has concerns with the law including 19-year-olds. “There was a level of dangerousness there that we do not have the expertise to manage as a juvenile system,” said Sean Brown, commissioner of the Department for Children and Families. The administration also said it wants to reform the youth offender program, which allows for people as old as 22 to go through confidential proceedings in family court, instead of the adult court system. Brown said the reform would allow an assessment to decide who is eligible for youth offender status, instead of prosecutors and judges. Washington County State’s Attorney Rory Thibault said a potential new path through the criminal justice system would allow those ages 19 to 25 to process as adults but give them the same confidentiality as in the juvenile system.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: City leaders want Pharrell Williams to bring his popular Something in the Water festival back next year, but the musician is reluctant, saying a “toxic energy” has run the city for too long, and he wishes Virginia Beach had taken a more proactive stance after a police officer fatally shot his cousin. City leaders appealed to the Grammy-winning producer to restore the festival in 2022. In 2019, the event brought $24 million to the local Hampton Roads economy. But Williams, who lived there as a child, wrote that he held the festival to ease racial tension, and he feels the city isn’t valuing his ideas for promoting “human rights for all.” “I wish the same energy I’ve felt from Virginia Beach leadership upon losing the festival would have been similarly channeled following the loss of my relative’s life,” Williams wrote in response. “I love my city, but for far too long it has been run by and with toxic energy.” Williams’ 25-year-old cousin, Donovon Lynch, was killed in March on a chaotic night during which 10 people were shot in separate incidents. Lynch’s father filed a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit in June. In its response, the city said Lynch, who was Black, pointed a gun at the officer who shot him. The officer, who also is Black, “feared for his life and the lives of other officers and citizens in the vicinity,” the city said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Northwest Carpenters Union said it reached a new contract agreement with the Associated General Contractors that would put several thousand striking carpenters in the Seattle area back on the job Wednesday pending a vote on the deal. Union members have been on strike since Sept. 16, with rotating pickets at some major projects. Leading up to the strike, union members rejected four previous contract proposals put forward by union leadership, the Seattle Times reports. Carpenters who voted “no” on previous deals said the agreements did not do enough to boost pay and benefits as the cost of living in the Seattle area skyrockets. Current carpenter wages range from $46.92 to $48.42 an hour. The last rejected offer would have increased pay by about $9.40 per hour over the course of four years, along with increases in benefits. In a statement on its website Tuesday, the union said the new deal includes a $10.02 “total package” increase over three years, retroactive pay dating back to June 1, and a 50-cent increase in the parking reimbursement in some areas of Seattle. Although a majority of union members voted to authorize the strike last month, many of 12,000 members have not walked off the job because they work at high-profile job sites governed by no-strike agreements.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPrinceton: A southern West Virginia health department stopped its needle exchange program due to strict requirements under a new state law, officials said. The Mercer County Health Department voted last month to discontinue its program, saying the new regulations are so strict that compliance is not possible, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. “Under the new law, we can’t comply,” Health Department Administrator Roger Topping told board members. He noted almost 50 requirements that had to be approved for a license to offer a harm-reduction program that includes a needle exchange. Local health officials had begun the needle exchange in 2019 in order to prevent the spread of diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV, as outbreaks have exploded in West Virginia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative legal group has threatened legal action against the University of Wisconsin-Madison, claiming it hired three mental health providers to serve only students of color. UW-Madison spokeswoman Meredith McGlone said Wednesday that the original announcement of the hires cited in the complaint – which said the new hires would “exclusively serve students of color” – was inaccurate and had been updated. “Mental health providers at University Health Services are not assigned based on a student’s race nor are they limited in which students they serve based on race,” she said. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty raised the issue in a Wednesday letter sent to leaders at both UW-Madison and UW System, saying the jobs as originally described violate state and federal laws against racial discrimination. WILL attorney Dan Lennington cited a Sept. 9 announcement that said University Health Services had hired nine new mental health providers, three of whom “will exclusively serve students of color, joining eight providers already in this role.” The school said the new providers would bring cultural awareness to help support students of color. McGlone said students have the option to choose one of the providers with expertise in serving students of color if they wish.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s toll from COVID-19 has surpassed 1,000 with the addition of 45 deaths to the official tally Tuesday, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Most of the newly reported deaths occurred last month, according to the paper, which noted that the death count now exceeds the number of residents in almost half of incorporated communities across the sparsely populated state.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/15/cave-sale-brothel-lawsuit-killer-gator-caught-news-around-states/118822502/", "title": "$2.2M cave sale, brothel lawsuit: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nSelma: A project to light the Edmund Pettus Bridge – an iconic structure for its role in the struggle for civil rights – could be completed by next summer, organizers say. The Rev. Mike Lewis of the Selma Bridge Lights Project gave an update on the timeline last week. Lewis had proposed the idea in 2017 as a way of attracting more people to visit the city, The Selma Times-Journal reports. About 600 protesters marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on a day in 1965 that became known as Bloody Sunday. The late civil rights leader John Lewis, leading the demonstrators across the bridge in a protest for voting rights, was knocked to the ground and beaten by law enforcement officers. The violence on the bridge focused the nation’s attention on racial oppression in the South. “When people think of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, they think of Selma. The lighting of the Edmund Pettus Bridge will honor the foot soldiers and civil rights,” the Rev. Mike Lewis said. There are plans to have different lights for various occasions, he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Rental rates across the state have risen during the pandemic, and it’s more difficult to find an apartment, a new study indicates. The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development survey shows a median adjusted rent for all unit types in Alaska at $1,179 a month in 2021, a 2% increase from spring 2020, Alaska Public Media reports. Sitka had the highest median rental rate at $1,323, the survey shows, while Wrangell and Petersburg were the lowest at $950. In Anchorage, the state’s largest city, the rent was $1,172, up 2.8% over 2020. The largest increase came in Ketchikan, where the average rent rose nearly 10% to $1,230 this year. However, the survey notes that electricity and water rates had just been approved at the time of the survey, and that anticipated increase might have been a factor. Vacancy rates dropped almost everywhere across the state. State economist Rob Krieger said that amid the pandemic, fewer people moved to a new rental, and there were fewer people shifting from renting to buying their first home. Rising home purchase prices and low interest rates are also making it difficult for first-time buyers in a competitive housing market, “especially when you consider that an average mortgage payment is now significantly higher than the average rent,” Krieger said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Political wonks and interested citizens can help draw the state’s new congressional and legislative districts. Mapping software made available by the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission will allow computer users to examine new rough drafts of the districts combined with the latest census data. More tech-savvy folks can tinker with the software, at tiny.cc/arizmap, to create new district boundaries based on population and demographics, then submit their handiwork to the commission, which may use some of the ideas in the commission’s final maps. The five-member commission conducted 15 “listening tour” events around the state in July and August and is scheduled to discuss and adopt grid maps at its Tuesday meeting. Those maps look nothing like the final redistricting maps, displaying contiguous boxes that contain roughly equal portions of Arizona’s more than 7 million inhabitants, as based on the 2020 census. The maps split the population evenly among the nine congressional and 30 legislative districts. With this raw clay, plus the ideas heard and yet to be heard from the public in the coming weeks, the commissioners will redraw the boundaries for the next 10 years. Hearings on the draft maps will continue through November, with the final product coming out the next month.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 31 more COVID-19 deaths and 646 new cases Monday. The Department of Health said the state’s death toll from the coronavirus since the pandemic began rose to 7,298. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said 12 of the newly reported deaths Monday were delayed reports from before the previous 24 hours. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations dipped slightly, by five, to 1,113. Arkansas ranks 15th in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. There are 443 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units around the state and 246 on ventilators. The department said 40 ICU beds are available in the state, though it’s unclear how many of those are equipped for COVID-19 patients.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLivermore: About 3,100 acres of open space in the San Francisco Bay Area could soon be preserved as a state park under a $31 million deal struck by Bay Area lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom. The deal would keep the area from becoming part of a neighboring off-road vehicle park. The agreement has been cast as a way to safeguard the ecological and cultural significance of the land east of Livermore, Democratic Sen. Steve Glazer of Orinda, who has advocated for the land’s preservation since 2018, said in a statement. The land known as the Tesla parcel borders the Carnegie State Vehicular Recreation Area, which had planned to expand into the land, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Scientists say the land is a “biologically unique habitat,” and Native Americans consider it a “sensitive historical site,” Glazer’s office said in a statement. Under the agreement, the state would reimburse the Off-Highway Vehicle Trust Fund for the land and other costs and pay for development of a new off-roading park elsewhere. The land, home to several threatened and endangered wildlife species, is designated a California Native Plant Society Botanical Priority Protection Area and has been deemed an Audubon Important Bird Area. It is named after the historic town and Tesla coal mine established on the site in the 19th century.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Supreme Court ruled Monday that police officers violated a man’s constitutional rights when they installed a video camera on a utility pole near his home and spied on him for months without getting a search warrant. The justices said the 24-hour-a-day, 3-month-long surveillance of the Colorado Springs man’s front yard, house, driveway and part of his backyard violated his Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, The Denver Post reports. His conviction and 15-year-prison sentence for drug trafficking were overturned. The unanimous decision differentiates between police officers personally watching suspects and officers using technology to record a person’s every move for extended periods of time. The man had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his yard, even though parts of the area were visible to the public, the court found. And the Colorado Springs Police Department should have received a search warrant before setting up the camera, which could pan and zoom to see over the man’s 6-foot-tall fence. The justices also rejected the state’s argument that the surveillance wasn’t as intrusive as GPS tracking or the use of cellphone data, noting that constant surveillance “shares many of the troubling attributes of GPS tracking.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: For years, many Native American tribes have felt their history has not been given its due by schools in Connecticut, a state that takes its name from an Algonquian word meaning “land on the long tidal river.” Soon, however, schools will be required to teach Native American studies, with an emphasis on local tribes, under a law passed this year at the urging of tribes including the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, best known today for its Foxwoods Resort Casino. “When you’re in Connecticut, to not learn about the Eastern woodland tribes, the tribes that Connecticut was founded on, (that) was the issue that we were pressing,” said Rodney Butler, chairman of the Mashantucket Pequots. The legislation makes it mandatory for schools to teach Native American studies starting with the 2023-2024 school year. It passed despite concerns raised by teachers unions and state Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona. Now the U.S. education secretary, Cardona had said it is important to teach about Native Americans, but he was wary of unfunded mandates for school districts that are still working to implement other courses that lawmakers and the governor have required them to teach.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Beebe Healthcare and Tidal Health will temporarily pause elective surgeries due to spikes in COVID-19 hospitalizations, officials said Monday. Beebe’s announcement, which went into effect Tuesday, is “out of an abundance of caution,” officials said. In the early weeks of the pandemic, nearly all Delaware hospitals paused elective procedures, but they resumed them months later. TidalHealth also announced Monday that its hospitals would temporarily stop “elective, non-emergency surgeries that require an overnight stay for at least a two-week period,” according to a news release. “Several factors have combined recently to put stress on hospital staffing levels and hospital bed capacity at both TidalHealth hospitals,” officials said. Since August, Delaware has seen an explosion of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. As of Monday, 266 people were hospitalized in the state – heights Delaware has not seen since the winter. Nearly all of the people being hospitalized for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, health officials say.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. police have taken several steps to prepare their departments and the city as a whole in advance of a rally planned at the Capitol on Saturday in support of Jan. 6 defendants, WUSA-TV reports. USCP officers were seen installing surveillance cameras around the area of the U.S. Capitol on Monday morning. Some areas near the home of the legislative branch have already been boarded up, and several robotic cameras were placed at different locations. The rally, known as “Justice for J6,” is planned for the Union Square area of the Capitol grounds, the section of the west front encompassing the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial and Capitol reflecting pool. “We are here to protect everyone’s First Amendment right to peacefully protest,” USCP Chief Tom Manger said in a statement. “I urge anyone who is thinking about causing trouble to stay home. We will enforce the law and not tolerate violence.” Manger said a fence will go up around the Capitol again a few days before the rally and come down soon after if everything is peaceful. The Metropolitan Police Department has also activated its entire force and postponed vacation days for its officers. The full activation alert assigned specific notice to MPD civil disturbance units trained for First Amendment demonstrations.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: Attorney Mike Freed has left his mark locally cultivating an annual series of marathons raising money for Jacksonville Area Legal Aid. Now he’s asking lawyers around the country to donate their time to help to prevent a deluge of evictions rooted in the pandemic’s effect on jobs and incomes. “Sometimes you have to give up your time without compensation for the greater good,” said Freed, who is president of the National Conference of Bar Presidents, an organization involving Bar associations in 53 states and U.S. territories. Freed, an attorney at the Gunster law firm who organizes a yearly six-day series of six marathons called Freed to Run, used online messages to highlight a letter signed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland asking lawyers to prevent an eviction tsunami, writing that “no matter where you live, lawyers and law students like you can apply your legal training and skills to help your community.” Coming days after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a federal moratorium on evictions during the pandemic, the pleas reacted to a situation that is growing more dire for many tenants. In Duval County, judges hearing eviction lawsuits last month issued 530 orders for police to serve writs of possession and take homes back from renters. Landlords filed another 737 eviction lawsuits last month.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCalhoun: A northwest Georgia county is negotiating an agreement for its employees to work extra at the local hospital, which is over capacity due to COVID-19 patients. The Chattanooga Times Free Press reports Gordon County commissioners are near a deal to let county employees assist at AdventHealth Gordon when not working for the county. The hospital would pay the employees. County Administrator Jim Ledbetter said a number of firefighters and law enforcement personnel are interested. People who volunteer to work extra hours must be vaccinated against COVID-19 before their first shifts. “With the hospital being licensed for 69 patients and having more than 100, the labor force is stretched pretty thin, and staff are pretty tired,” Ledbetter said. “The hospital came to us for help, and we decided to do what we can.” Ledbetter said the county will require employees have at least 12 hours’ rest between their county shifts and hospital work. He said hospital doctors and nurses will supervise county employees. He said duties might include stocking supplies and making sure people are wearing masks before coming in. “They would help with security. People’s nerves have been frayed with the pandemic, and they don’t always want to mask. Some people have been getting testy about that,” Ledbetter said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The median sale price for a single-family home on the island of Oahu has surpassed $1 million. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the median price in August reached $1,050,000, according to Honolulu Board of Realtors data. “Market conditions have been pointing to a $1M median single-family home price this year for some time,” Jason Lazzerini, president and CEO of the brokerage firm Locations, wrote in a report last month. The Honolulu Board of Realtors said the record was up 25% from $839,000 in the same month last year. The August peak for single-family homes was the seventh monthly record set this year. The islands of Kauai and Maui hit the million-dollar mark in January and May, respectively. Hawaii economist Paul Brewbaker said that “this is not a bubble” and that he expects the demand will eventually ease. “This is transitory,” Brewbaker said. “We need to put that in perspective.” He said demand has been driven in part by stay-at-home workers during the pandemic. Honolulu Board of Realtors President Shannon Heaven said the August spike was driven by a tripling of homes sold for more than $2 million. “Those really begin to push that median price up,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An arrest warrant has been issued for a former state lawmaker who resigned in disgrace after a 19-year-old intern reported that he brought her to his apartment on false pretenses and raped her. The Ada County arrest warrant on charges of rape and sexual penetration with a foreign object came nearly five months after Aaron von Ehlinger, R-Lewiston, resigned from the Idaho House of Representatives after an ethics committee found he should be formally censured for his behavior. The investigation into von Ehlinger began in March after the young staffer reported he raped her after the two had dinner at a Boise restaurant. Von Ehlinger has denied all wrongdoing and maintains he had consensual sexual contact with the young woman. A legislative ethics committee unanimously found that he engaged in “behavior unbecoming” and said it would support a vote to remove him from the Statehouse. The woman informed legislative leadership and the police about the rape allegations on her first day at work after the incident. She also testified before the legislative ethics committee, despite facing harassment from von Ehlinger’s supporters and some fellow lawmakers. Earlier this month attorney Erika Birch reportedly filed a tort claim with the state on the woman’s behalf, which is the first step in filing a lawsuit.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Two nuclear plants would be saved from closure and carbon-emitting coal plants closed during the next quarter-century as part of a clean-energy package the state Senate approved Monday, sending it to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who has pushed for a carbon-free Illinois by 2045. With just one vote over the minimum necessary, the 37-17 tally in the chamber controlled by Democrats came on the same day energy company Exelon had threatened to begin shutting down its nuclear-power generating station in Byron as unprofitable, with the Dresden generating site in Morris to follow this fall. But the Clean Energy Jobs Act provides a $700 million subsidy to Exelon with the idea of saving jobs and the large amount of carbon-free energy the plants already produce. “The state of Illinois is making history by setting aggressive standards for a 100% clean energy future,” Pritzker said in a post-vote statement. In addition to the nuclear-power subsidy, the legislation includes provisions for closing coal-burning plants in central and southwest Illinois, investing in renewable energy such as wind and solar, and offering $4,000 rebates on electric-vehicle purchases. Pritzker wants 1 million electric cars on Illinois roads by 2030. Plants producing greenhouse gases by burning coal must cut those emissions by 45% by 2035 and close permanently by 2045.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A Republican redistricting plan shores up a suburban Indianapolis district for the GOP while leaving a potentially targeted Democratic district in northwestern Indiana intact. The proposal for new congressional districts released Tuesday shifts the northern tier of Democratic-leaning Marion County from the district now held by Republican Rep. Victora Spartz to that of Indianapolis Democratic Rep. Andre Carson. That move will boost Spartz, who lost badly in Marion County in last year’s election even as she won by an overall 50%-46% margin over Democratic candidate Christina Hale. Other changes among Indiana’s nine congressional districts to account for population shifts don’t appear likely to shift the 7-2 control that Republicans now hold on those seats. The Republican plan leaves intact the northwestern Indiana district that includes industry-heavy Lake County and has long been a Democratic stronghold. The proposed district along Lake Michigan wouldn’t change much from the one Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan won last year. Republicans have full control Indiana’s redistricting process through their dominance of the state Legislature.\n\nIowa\n\nMount Ayr: A woman whose husband died from a breakthrough COVID-19 infection is blaming Americans who refuse to wear masks or get vaccinated. “It’s that kind of attitude that killed my husband,” said Ardith Keplinger, whose husband, Gary Keplinger, of Mount Ayr, was buried this month. In his obituary, the family wrote that his life was “unnecessarily cut short.” They described the retired school superintendent as “one of several victims recently infected from an unmasked, unvaccinated person.” His widow said he had a chronic autoimmune, neuromuscular condition called myasthenia gravis, which may have made him particularly susceptible when he attended a gathering of 50 to 75 extended family members in a rented hall in July. The couple had been avoiding crowds, but they mingled unmasked at the event, along with relatives, several of whom were unvaccinated, Ardith Keplinger said. “Within a week, 11 members of our family had COVID,” she said, adding that she was among them but recovered. But her husband and a cousin who also attended the party both died of the disease Aug. 11. The Iowa Department of Public Health reports vaccinated people make up just 10% of those being treated for the disease in the state’s intensive care units, even though 64% of Iowa adults have received the shots.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Hundreds of people chanted and held signs outside a University of Kansas fraternity house where a member is accused of sexually assaulting another student. The Kansas City Star reports the Monday night protest outside the Phi Kappa Psi house came after the fraternity officials reported the allegations over the weekend. “The university takes seriously all allegations of sexual violence and has robust processes to investigate such allegations,” university spokeswoman Erinn Barcomb-Peterson said in an email Tuesday. “We encourage anyone who has experienced sexual violence to contact law enforcement or the university’s Office of Civil Rights and Title IX to initiate an investigation.” The university has multiple resources to assist individuals who have experienced sexual violence, she said. A spokesman for the fraternity said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. “Phi Kappa Psi takes these allegations very seriously and will fully cooperate with law enforcement,” the statement said. “Due to the recent nature of these allegations and the need for a full and complete investigation, Phi Kappa Psi cannot provide further comments at this time.”\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: Union workers, upset over the prospect of expanded weekend shifts, have manned picket lines at bottling and warehouse operations of Heaven Hill Distillery, one of the world’s largest bourbon producers. The walkout involves about 420 members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 23D. They voted overwhelmingly last week to reject a new five-year contract offer and formed picket lines Saturday at Heaven Hill’s operations in Bardstown. Family-owned and operated Heaven Hill produces Evan Williams, one of the world’s top-selling bourbons, and others including Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna, Old Fitzgerald, Larceny and Parker’s Heritage Collection. As the bourbon industry tries to keep up with increasing global demand, Heaven Hill signaled it wanted to assign new hires to nontraditional schedules that would include weekend work, Local 23D President Matt Aubrey said. The company was vague about how widespread weekend shifts would be and how it would affect existing workers, he said, raising a “red flag” with union workers. “They tell these workers, ‘You’re family, just like us. You’re our family,’ ” Aubrey said, adding that most workers have their own families. “If they get pushed on this nontraditional schedule, then that’s going to take them away from their loved ones.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nSlidell: A 12-foot-long alligator believed to have attacked a man in Hurricane Ida floodwaters two weeks ago was captured and killed Monday, and authorities found human remains in its stomach. The St. Tammany Parish Sheriff’s Office said the parish coroner’s office was working with investigators to determine if the remains were those of Timothy Satterlee, 71, who has been missing since the Aug. 30 attack. Ida had caused widespread flooding and knocked out electricity and phone service in parts of south Louisiana when it came ashore Aug. 29. Satterlee was attacked outside his home, which was surrounded by floodwaters, in the New Orleans suburb of Slidell on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Authorities said Satterlee’s wife heard a splash and walked outside their home to see the alligator attacking her husband. She managed to pull him, severely injured in the attack, to the steps of their home and used a small boat to reach higher ground to get help. But when she and deputies returned to the house, Satterlee was gone. Sheriff’s deputies were joined by federal and state wildlife agents in the search for the alligator. A trap set by alligator hunters captured the 500-pound animal Monday morning.\n\nMaine\n\nPresque Isle: Potato growers anticipate a solid crop and stronger demand thanks to reopening restaurants, providing a sense of optimism heading into the harvest in northern Maine. Another positive indicator: A decline in acreage was reversed with an extra 8,000 acres planted this summer. “Growing conditions have been really good. We have a quality crop, and we expect good yields. Market demand is good,” said Don Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board. Growers are looking for something to cheer after a dismal 2020 in which some farmers gave away potatoes to avoid having them go to waste, and crops withered from heat and drought in northern Maine. This summer, rainfall was nearly 3 inches below average, but that’s better than last summer, which ranked as the warmest and second-driest since records were kept in Caribou, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures hitting 90 and above can stunt the growth of potatoes, but the highest temperature this summer was 84 degrees, Flannery said. Potatoes are big business in Maine, with direct sales in the neighborhood of $300 million supporting about 2,400 jobs. About 65% of Maine’s potatoes are processed into french fries, chips or some other product, and demand for processed potatoes is rebounding.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A panel of state lawmakers approved an emergency measure Tuesday to require masks in K-12 schools to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The 10-7 vote by the General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive and Legislative Review puts the emergency regulation into effect for up to 180 days. The Maryland State Board of Education approved the regulation last month on an 11-1 vote. Only two of Maryland’s 24 jurisdictions, Carroll and Somerset counties, had not already required students to wear masks while attending school. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended universal mask-wearing for teachers and students inside school buildings this fall, citing the rapid spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. Maryland State Superintendent of Schools Mohammed Choudhury said the mask requirement will increase safety and help reduce the need for quarantining sick students. “Seventeen other states, including most of Maryland’s neighbors, have required that all individuals wear masks in school buildings,” Choudhury said. He said data will be reviewed each month, and the board of education will consider whether the requirement could be lifted, if conditions improve enough, in consultation with the state health department.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Harvard University will divest itself from holdings in fossil fuels, President Lawrence Bacow said Thursday. Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university’s nearly $42 billion endowment, has already been reducing its exposure to fossil fuels and has no direct investments in companies that explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels, Bacow said in a message posted on the university’s website. The university has legacy investments in a number of private equity funds with holdings in the fossil fuel industry. Those indirect investments constitute less than 2% of the endowment, according to Bacow. The school has not made any new commitments to these limited partnerships since 2019 and has no intention to do so going forward, he said. Bacow said the legacy investments are in “runoff mode” and will end as these partnerships are liquidated. Harvard has already committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the entire investment portfolio by 2050, he said. The decision follows years of protests from students who have pressed Harvard to divest from fossil fuel companies. Harvard is building a portfolio of investments in funds that support the transition to a green economy, Bacow wrote.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Former Detroit Police Chief James Craig formally announced his campaign for governor Tuesday – but not before protesters derailed his kickoff event on Belle Isle and forced him to move. Craig effectively has been running for months. He is among 10 Republicans, all of them political newcomers, looking to unseat Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2022. Craig was to speak to the media at the state park in the middle of the Detroit River in his hometown, but he abandoned that plan when he was shouted down by a couple dozen people critical of his role as chief. He turned around and walked back toward a waiting vehicle, which took him to a nearby office complex, where he made the announcement a short time later. “My name is James Craig. And I’m running to be your governor,” he said, flashing a thumbs-up. “The governor for the state of Michigan.” He nodded as supporters chanted: “Chief Craig.” As for the disruption on Belle Isle, Craig said a “small group of paid protesters did nothing. What they did is reinforce why we need change.” Asked about his statement that the protesters were paid, Craig said he did not have evidence of that but believed it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Four former police officers charged with violating George Floyd’s civil rights pleaded not guilty Tuesday in a federal hearing that included arguments on several pretrial motions, including requests to hold separate trials. A federal grand jury indicted Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao in May for allegedly depriving Floyd of his rights while acting under government authority May 25, 2020, as Floyd, 46, was held face-down, handcuffed and not resisting in a restraint that was captured on bystander video. His death led to worldwide protests and calls for change in policing. All four of the men appeared at the hearing remotely via videoconference. Chauvin, wearing a plain T-shirt, appeared from a small room in the state’s maximum-security prison, where he is serving a 22 1/ 2 -year sentence for murder in Floyd’s death. The other three men appeared remotely alongside their attorneys. U.S. Magistrate Judge Tony Leung asked each man separately how he would plea, and each clearly responded: “Not guilty.” The hearing also addressed roughly 40 pretrial motions. Most of the motions were routine, such as agreeing when names of witnesses would be disclosed. But Leung heard oral arguments on two issues and ordered attorneys to file additional written arguments on those motions.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: A third person has died as a result of a highway collapse two weeks ago. Amanda Williams of Wiggins died Saturday after being hospitalized since the Aug. 30 collapse, WLOX-TV reports. The collapse on Highway 26 outside Lucedale in George County, which occurred during torrential rain brought by Hurricane Ida, caused seven vehicles to crash into the washed-out roadway. Two people died at the time of the crash, and 10 others were injured, including 39-year-old Wiggins and her 16-year-old daughter, Emily. Emily Williams is currently recovering from a torn colon, a broken leg and other injuries. Amanda Williams was being treated for her injuries at Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg when she died, according to WLOX. During a Sept. 5 video interview with WLOX-TV, Emily Williams said she could hear the terrifying sounds of other vehicles crashing around – and on top of – the pickup truck where she and her mother were trapped after the truck plunged into a dark, muddy pit when the highway collapsed. “I saw a black hole, then I blacked out, and I woke up, and my mom was leaned over toward me. She was choking on her blood, and she couldn’t breathe or anything,” she told the television station.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: A cave containing Native American artwork from more than 1,000 years ago was sold at auction Tuesday, disappointing leaders of the Osage Nation who hoped to buy the land to “protect and preserve our most sacred site.” A bidder agreed to pay $2.2 million to private owners for what’s known as “Picture Cave,” along with the 43 hilly acres that surround it near the town of Warrenton, about 60 miles west of St. Louis. Bryan Laughlin, director of Selkirk Auctioneers & Appraisers, the St. Louis-based firm handling the auction, said the winning bidder declined to be named. A St. Louis family that’s owned the land since 1953 has mainly used it for hunting. The cave was the site of sacred rituals and burying of the dead. It also has more than 290 prehistoric glyphs, “making it the largest collection of indigenous people’s polychrome paintings in Missouri,” according to the auction website. The Osage Nation, in a statement, called the sale “truly heartbreaking.” “Our ancestors lived in this area for 1300 years,” the statement said. “This was our land. We have hundreds of thousands of our ancestors buried throughout Missouri and Illinois, including Picture Cave.” The cave features drawings of people, animals, birds and mythical creatures.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: The U.S. Forest Service has given preliminary approval to a plan for road building, logging and other forest management measures in the Swan Valley with the goal of reducing fire danger and enhancing habitat for several federally protected species, the agency said. The project area is located on U.S. Forest Service lands on both sides of Montana Highway 83 between the communities of Condon and Swan Lake. “Species such as Canada lynx, bull trout and whitebark pine face unprecedented risk from climate change, exotic pathogens and all the associated ecological impacts, and failure to act will most likely result in their continued decline,” Flathead National Forest Supervisor Kurt Steele wrote in a draft record of a decision published Friday. “A warming and drier climate, combined with the legacy effects of fire suppression, requires active vegetation management, and the scientific knowledge applied to this decision has been shown to be an effective prescription to mitigate these risks.” The agency plans to approve about half of its initially proposed 15-year project. Doing so will reduce plans for logging, road building and improvement, and the number of acres where trees are to be thinned or burned with fires called prescribed burns set in certain areas to reduce wildfire risks, the Daily Inter Lake reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Lawmakers launched a special session Monday to redraw the state’s political boundaries, with one proposal that would add a 50th state senator to the Legislature to try to keep rural Nebraska from losing a seat. Sen. Mark Kolterman, of Seward, proposed the measure along with two other rural senators. The bill would expand the Legislature from its current 49 members to 50, as allowed under the Nebraska Constitution. Adding a senator would reduce the ideal number of residents per legislative district, making it easier for lawmakers to preserve rural districts that lost population over the past decade while still adding a district to fast-growing suburban Omaha. The bill’s prospects are unclear, and some lawmakers questioned whether they could legally consider it in a special session that’s strictly limited to redistricting issues. Lawmakers have asked the state’s attorney general to offer a legal opinion. Even so, rural senators said they planned to press the issue as a way to ease pressure on senators by reducing the average number of residents per district. The measure was co-sponsored by Sens. Matt Williams, of Gothenburg, and John Stinner, of Gering. “I want to help protect the rural senators of the state,” said Kolterman, whose district could be merged with another rural area under one of the proposed plans.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A national advocacy group has filed a sweeping federal lawsuit aimed at convincing a judge the nation’s only legal brothels are dens of illegal sex trafficking and unconstitutional slavery. The case filed Friday in Las Vegas by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation names the governor, state attorney general, and city and county officials as defendants, along with a brothel in Nye County and hip-hop music figure Jamal “Mally Mall” Rashid. Rashid, 46, is serving a 33-month federal prison term after pleading guilty to operating a prostitution business disguised as a Las Vegas escort enterprise. Attorneys who represented him in that case did not immediately respond to a message about the lawsuit. Representatives of Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, state Attorney General Aaron Ford, Las Vegas and Clark County declined to comment. Officials in Nye County and the Chicken Ranch brothel in Pahrump did not immediately respond to messages. The lawsuit seeks to abolish Nevada’s legal prostitution statutes as unconstitutional and a violation of federal anti-trafficking laws. It asks the court to order reimbursement to victims of “all profits and unjust enrichment obtained as a result.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A man has been accused of putting his baby daughter into a clothes dryer and turning on the machine before the mother quickly stopped it, police said. Police arrested the man in Manchester on Sunday on charges of reckless conduct, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal threatening. The child did not appear to be injured. The man waived arraignment Monday, and a judge ordered him held without bail. His case has been assigned to a public defender’s office, but no attorney was listed for him in court documents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: The Sea Hear Now music festival returns to town this upcoming weekend after the 2020 event was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. And this year’s fest will have some musicians showing off their other artistic talents, too. Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and other members of Pearl Jam, Scott Avett of the Avett Brothers, and more will show their artwork inside the Transparent Gallery pop-up Saturday and Sunday in Bradley Park. In past festivals, musicians have popped into the gallery for an impromptu performance. Musically, the fest – held on the beach and in Bradley Park – will also feature acts including Billy Idol, Lord Huron, Dr. Dog, Grouplove, Orville Peck, Ani DiFranco, and Tank and the Bangas. More than 35,000 people attended the second Sea Hear Now in 2019 to see groups such as the Dave Matthews Band and the Lumineers. Organizers expect about 35,000 this year, but there will be more room on the beach, as the two stages will be farther apart by about a city block. Construction on the festival grounds started over the weekend. Attendees will need to require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Election officials are deploying ballot drop boxes across the state for people who choose to cast absentee ballots without walking indoors during the upcoming Nov. 2 local elections for public offices including the mayors of Albuquerque and Santa Fe. New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver told a legislative panel Monday that county clerks are required to provide one drop box for every 25,000 voters and at least two per county. Exceptions can be made at the request of local county officials. The quick-drop boxes for voting are among a long list measures backed by Toulouse Oliver, a second-term Democrat, that are aimed at making voting more accessible. Lawmakers appropriated funding for the initiative amid concerns about COVID-19 and indoor crowding at polling places. Ballots must be collected at least once a day from the boxes, video surveillance of drop boxes is required, and recordings must be retained by county clerks. It remains illegal for any person to deliver a ballot for another person with the exception of immediate family, and signs at each drop box are required to explain that prohibition against so-called ballot harvesting.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Parents of adults with severe autism and other disabilities say state officials are threatening to revoke funding for their children’s long-term care at out-of-state care centers unless they agree to send their children to a secure, in-state facility. Some parents believe they have no alternative but to send their adult children to the Sunmount Developmental Center in Franklin County in the Adirondacks, the Times Union of Albany reports. They describe the facility as remote and prison-like. A group of state lawmakers recently asked Gov. Kathy Hochul to end the policy, which they say was put in place by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in an apparent cost-saving move. The lawmakers, including Democratic Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi of New York City, say the policy may violate disabled people’s right to receive care in the least restrictive setting, which was guaranteed under a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A 2014 state law also guaranteed due-process rights for disabled children and their families in long-term care decisions, when the child turns 21 or graduates from school. In a response Friday, the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities said a legal process prevents the agency from providing funding for out-of-state care at a certain point.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: A fund set up to honor George Floyd and raise awareness about racial injustice said Monday that it has awarded more than $50,000 in scholarships since it was created. The Fayetteville-based George Floyd Memorial Foundation said it has recently given scholarships valued at $1,000 to 15 law school students, scholarships valued at $10,000 to interns, and $2,500 scholarships to undergraduate students. The foundation said it has also awarded $25,000 to Fayetteville State University, a historically Black college. Foundation executive director Jacari Harris said the scholarships keep Floyd’s memory alive and support students. “Our hope at the George Floyd Memorial Foundation is that these high-achieving students will become attorneys, activists and scholars who will work to ensure people are treated fairly around the world,” Harris said in a statement. Bridgett Floyd, George Floyd’s sister and the foundation’s founder, said that “as the days, months and years go by, one thing is true: My brother George’s death truly changed the world, and by offering support to these students, it will allow us to continue to bring hope to those in need.” The foundation, created in August 2020, focuses on raising awareness of racial injustices, police brutality and ensuring everyone’s civil rights are protected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A three-day symposium to discuss the history and revitalization of the American bison has been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, event organizers said Monday. The Dakota Bison Symposium had been scheduled for Thursday through Saturday. Many of the national speakers have recently decided against traveling to North Dakota, where 1 in every 253 people tested positive for the coronavirus in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. It is also one of the worst states in the country for rate of COVID-19 vaccinations. Bismarck State College and its partners decided against a virtual format and rescheduled the event for next spring, BSC President Doug Jensen told The Bismarck Tribune. “One of the exciting things about symposia is getting to rub elbows with these national speakers,” Jensen said. “Within the last few weeks, we’ve lost that aspect of the conference.” The symposium also was canceled last year due to the pandemic. The North Dakota Department of Health on Monday confirmed 180 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,815 active cases throughout the state. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by nearly 48%.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republicans and Democrats appeared closer to agreement Monday on a map of state legislative districts that could stand for the next 10 years, as a powerful new redistricting panel faced a looming Wednesday deadline. But a group that monitors redistricting and works to reduce the drawing of political district lines that maximize partisan advantage, a process called gerrymandering, flunked the Ohio GOP’s proposed state House map in an analysis released earlier Monday. The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, working with the anti-corruption group RepresentUS, said its boundaries fell short of being fair when compared to a million simulated alternatives, delivering it a score of “F.” The analysis gave a better score of “B” to the Ohio Senate map that Republicans have proposed, which Democratic consultant Chris Glassburn also reworked and presented Monday. Analysts said the second map fared better because each Senate district contains three House districts, diluting the partisan advantage. During a regional hearing in suburban Cleveland, members of the Ohio Redistricting Commission’s GOP majority – including state Auditor Keith Faber, Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Senate President Matt Huffman praised Glassburn, for his work on a revised map aimed at garnering the support of both parties.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials said Tuesday that coronavirus hospitalizations appear to be leveling off, but hospital stays are longer due to the delta variant of the virus. The three-day average of new COVID-19 hospitalizations fell from 1,518 a week ago to 1,352 on Tuesday, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which reported a seven-day average of 2,114 new cases daily, down from 2,709 one week ago. However, the average hospitalization increased from five to six days in January to 10-11 days currently, and intensive acre unit stays rose from 10-11 days to 15-20, said Dr. David Kendrick, chair of Medical Informatics at the University of Oklahoma School of Community Medicine. Patti Davis, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said it is too soon to call the decline a trend. “Given … Labor Day activities, all health care providers probably have their fingers crossed and are hoping for the best, but not assuming (the decline) will hold once we get at the requisite date past Labor Day,” which could result in another surge in cases, Davis said. Kendrick said most new virus cases are among younger patients; 21.6% are 36-49 years old, and those ages 18-35 account for about 18% of new cases.\n\nOregon\n\nTroutdale: An explosion in a pickup truck killed a man early Monday, authorities said. Police and firefighters responded to calls at 2:19 a.m. reporting a loud explosion and vehicle fire at a home , the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office said. The Gresham Fire Department extinguished the fire, and the sheriff’s office said a person was located inside the burned vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The body was taken to the county Medical Examiner’s Office. The case and manner of death are yet to be determined. Investigators are not yet releasing the identity of the man, the sheriff’s office said. Special agents from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives Seattle branch are assisting the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office and other agencies in the investigation. Investigators are trying to determine what caused the explosion, which is believed to have originated inside the vehicle, according to the sheriff’s office. No other injuries were reported, and the sheriff’s office said there was no threat of additional explosions. “We woke up with a big explosion, and things were falling in the house, so I thought the house was falling down,” neighbor JoAnn Robinson told KGW-TV. The siding on Robinson’s home is covered in holes from debris.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: More than $104 million in Pennsylvania Turnpike tolls went uncollected last year as the agency fully converted to all-electronic tolling, with the millions of motorists who don’t use E-ZPass having a nearly 1 in 2 chance of riding without paying under the “toll-by-plate” license plate camera system. An internal turnpike report issued in July and obtained by the Associated Press through a Right-to-Know Law request showed nearly 11 million out of the total of about 170 million turnpike rides generated no revenue for the agency in the year that ended May 31. “We take this issue very seriously. It is a big number, there’s no question,” turnpike Chief Executive Mark Compton said. “But we, as an organization, are leaving no stone unturned in the way in which we’re going after that leakage.” Toll revenue “leakage” – an industry euphemism for uncollected tolls – has become the focus of turnpike agencies across the country as the use of E-ZPass transponders and license plate cameras continues to spread. It is a particular problem for the debt-strapped Pennsylvania Turnpike, more than half of whose total revenue goes to pay borrowing costs and tolls have more than quadrupled in 12 years for the minority of motorists who don’t have E-Z Pass to pay for rides.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has paused in-person dining and instituted a limit of five people for undergraduate social gatherings in response to a recent rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases on campus. The Ivy League school had 82 confirmed coronavirus cases, primarily among undergraduate students, in the prior seven days, according to a statement Monday. “The increase in positive asymptomatic test results is a reflection of the transmissibility of the delta variant, our significant increase in the number of tests conducted at Brown, and an increase in our student population, some of whom have been engaging with other students in multiple smaller groups outside the classroom, especially indoors without masks,” the school’s statement said. Those testing positive generally remain asymptomatic, and there are no indications of serious illness and no hospitalizations, the school said. There is no evidence of spread in classrooms, and classes will continue, the school said. The “short-term” restrictions also include increased undergraduate student testing from once to twice per week and an indoor mask requirement. Brown requires vaccinations for students and employees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: Residents of an Upstate neighborhood say they were ducking for cover after pellets from a nearby dove hunt started striking them. Children playing outside were also struck by the pellets, one of them as he played on a trampoline, WYFF-TV reports. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources responded to calls Saturday afternoon about the stray pellets coming from a field in Greenwood County. Neighbors said they saw 10 to 20 people in the field hunting doves. Department of Natural resources officials said they talked to several people who say they were hit, including a 6-year-old boy who had two marks on his cheek. The land is private property, and the landowner wasn’t doing anything illegal, authorities said. There is no state law or regulation mandating the minimum distance from other homes or properties from a dove hunt on private land. Officials said they talked to the landowner, who voluntarily stopped the hunt due to safety and noise concerns. Neighbors said the children struck by pellets were OK.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State lawmakers on Monday rejected a handful of proposals for rules governing medical marijuana from Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration but approved the bulk of the program. The Legislature’s Rules Review Committee, which is responsible for approving administration rules, effectively told the Department of Health to try again on a number of controversial rule proposals. Most of the Department of Health’s 124-page proposal got the sign-off from the Legislature, spelling out rules ranging from fees for cardholders to the heights of fences around cannabis growing facilities. The rules they rejected included proposals that would have limited the amount of high-potency marijuana that patients could possess, required medical practitioners to write a recommendation for patients who wanted to grow more than three cannabis plants, and defined a list of conditions that would qualify for a medical marijuana recommendation. The law allowing medical marijuana, passed by 70% of voters last year, has seen a halting acceptance from officials trying to balance a clear mandate from voters while placing restrictions on medical marijuana. The rules set a $75 application fee for medical marijuana cards and discount the fee to $20 for low-income applicants.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Rhodes College is investigating after students reported racist and anti-Semitic incidents on campus a few weeks into the fall semester. In one instance, a banana was taped to the door of a dorm room of two Black students, student organization Men of Distinction has said. The group called for more swift and public response by the college. Interim President Carroll D. Stevens wrote to campus last Friday: “Whatever the intentions when actions or words make members of our community feel unsafe or unwelcome, they do not align with our values as a college community.” The president’s letter did not specify particular incidents on campus but said the incidents made Black and Jewish students in particular feel unsafe. Kofi Whitehead, student president of Men of Distinction, immediately called leaders of the organization together. He knew the students targeted by the Labor Day incident, he said, but it could have been “any of us.” In a post days after it happened, Men of Distinction decried the lack of response from the Rhodes administration. In an interview Monday, Whitehead said he acknowledged that internally, campus leadership was likely working to address the issue. But when a racist incident occurs in a public place, and students see it across social media, he expects the college to be more upfront.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Travis County commissioners voted unanimously Tuesday to allocate $110million in federal funds to build housing units for people experiencing homelessness in the area. The vote was met by applause from the group of homelessness service providers and community leaders gathered in the commissioners’ court chambers. The vote marks a significant investment in housing projects from the county – a change from the commissioners’ initial reluctance to spend money directly on housing units. Commissioner Margaret Gomez, who developed and sponsored the plan with Commissioner Ann Howard and a diverse coalition of local community leaders and organizations, said after years of discussion on the need to address affordable housing issues and homelessness in the Austin area, it was time for something different. “I think it’s time we take some action here,” Gomez said. The $110 million comes from the federal American Rescue Plan Act, which was the second of two federal stimulus programs created during the coronavirus pandemic. Travis County received $247 million from the program and had wide discretion on how to spend it. The funding will go toward the construction of 10 or so projects that would total more than 2,000 new housing units.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man who displayed a rifle at a youth soccer tournament, spreading panic through the crowd, wasn’t prompted by anything related to the game, police said Monday. People screamed “active shooter” as parents and players ran to take cover behind cars in the parking lot after the man retrieved the gun from his car Saturday afternoon, the Deseret News reports. Ultimately no shots were fired, but it was terrifying for many who were there. “It was pretty traumatizing,” said parent Megan Perkins. “My kid is pretty shaken.” The man had been involved in an argument at the game when he went back to his car and retrieved the weapon, Salt Lake City Police said. No one has been arrested, but those involved have been identified by investigators. Police did not release their names or say what the argument was about but said it did not appear to be related to the game or the tournament, according to a statement Monday. U.S. Youth Soccer officials said they were saddened by the traumatic experience but proud of staff and volunteers who helped defuse the situation. The team associated with the people involved was expelled from the tournament, the organization said. Additional sanctions are possible.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state on Tuesday became the latest to sue some of the country’s top fossil fuel companies by alleging they misled the public about the impact their products have on climate change. The state wants the companies to tell consumers that the use of fossil fuel products harms the environment, Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan said after the lawsuit was filed in Vermont Superior Court in Burlington. The warnings could be similar to those noting the danger of tobacco products or food products that include nutritional and calorie information, he said. Donovan, speaking outside the Chittenden County courthouse in downtown Burlington where the lawsuit was filed, said officials are not trying to prevent the companies from selling their products in the state, and residents will continue to be able to use fossil fuels. “What we are saying is that Vermonters have the right to know,” Donovan said. “Give Vermonters accurate information. Put a label on the product, and let Vermonters decide.” The suit names ExxonMobil Corp., Shell Oil Co., Sunoco LP, CITGO Petroleum Corp. and other corporations. In a Tuesday email, a spokesperson for ExxonMobil said the suit was baseless and without merit. Citgo declined to comment on pending litigation. The other two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Five people who recently traveled to the state from Afghanistan have been diagnosed with measles, health officials said Tuesday. The cases are being reported four days after the U.S. halted inbound flights of Afghan evacuees following the discovery of a few cases of measles among new arrivals. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release that the people were part of the U.S. government’s emergency evacuation efforts from Afghanistan, which recently came under Taliban rule. State health officials did not offer specifics Tuesday regarding where the people who are infected are located. But they said they’re working to identify and contact people who may have been exposed in three parts of the state. Those places include Dulles International Airport, where some refugees flew into the U.S., and other parts of northern Virginia. Health officials are also working to notify people potentially exposed at an unidentified Richmond hospital and at Fort Pickett, an Army National Guard base southwest of Richmond that is providing temporary housing to recently arrived evacuees. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be spread through coughing, sneezing, and contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat. Most Americans are vaccinated against it as children.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has voted to move some of the $15 million in savings related to police officer departures to community-based programs. The police department will keep about $10 illion for technology projects and other expenses, while about $5 million will be invested elsewhere in what Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda described as a “hybrid approach.” The plan will partially address commitments the council made in 2020 to decrease the police department’s budget during 2021, The Seattle Times reports. The vote was 8-1, with Councilmember Kshama Sawant calling for the department to keep less money. The council’s midyear budget legislation somewhat jibes with a plan proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan over the summer, though a Durkan-backed request that some money be allocated for officer hiring and retention incentives was rejected. In November, Durkan and the council decreased the police department’s budget by tens of millions of dollars for 2021, reversing a growth trend. But they also cleared the department to hire new officers. The council is also no longer pursuing layoffs of officers with records of misconduct, citing legal barriers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The numbers of new cases and people hospitalized for the coronavirus in the state both smashed records yet again Monday as Gov. Jim Justice scolded residents who continue to balk at receiving COVID-19 vaccines. At least 40% of the state’s population above age 12 has not been fully inoculated, according to health data. Efforts by Justice and others to urge residents to do so have resulted in only minimal improvement in recent weeks. “This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Justice said at a news conference. The Republican governor has himself balked at issuing either a vaccination mandate or new mask requirements. An earlier indoor masking rule was lifted in June as the number of cases dropped. At the news conference, Justice introduced Linda Lanier, who said her adult son, Joe Goodnite, refused to get vaccinated and contracted COVID-19 on a family vacation. He’s been in a Charleston hospital for more than six weeks and remains on a ventilator. Lanier’s son “listened to all the negative and false accusations about vaccination,” she said. “Being in the medical field myself, I tried to convince him. However, it didn’t work. He listened to his friends. He listened to social media. And he just listened to what I call the garbage that’s out there.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge’s decision to release from a mental health facility a woman who helped stab her sixth grade classmate to please online horror character Slender Man has left the victim’s family nervous and afraid, a spokesman said Tuesday. Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren on Friday ordered 19-year-old Anissa Weier released from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh, ruling that she’s no longer a threat and that conditions on her release should protect both her and the community. Weier has spent nearly four years at the facility. Bohren had scheduled her release for Monday. Officials with the state Department of Health Services, which oversees Winnebago, have repeatedly refused to so much as acknowledge Weier was a patient out of privacy concerns. Steve Lyons, a spokesman for victim Payton Leutner’s family, said Tuesday that they’re disappointed with Bohren’s decision and that Weier should have served more time. “We’re just nervous that she’s going to be out,” Lyons said. “We’re nervous about the potential of what could happen.” Weier and a friend, Morgan Geyser, both were committed to Winnebago after pleading guilty to attacking Leutner when they were all 12 years old. Leutner suffered 19 wounds – including one that narrowly missed her heart – and barely survived.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The leader of the state Senate expects Gov. Mark Gordon to call a special legislation session on vaccine mandates, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Senate President Dan Dockstader, R-Afton, said the effort to repel President Joe Biden’s controversial executive order last week – which says large companies must require workers either to get a COVID-19 vaccination or to undergo regular coronavirus testing – seemed likely to result in a special session, though the Republican governor would have to request the move. But it’s unlikely legislators could block a presidential order, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/24/schools-alice-cooper-muhammad-alis-gym-goldblum-vs-plastic-news-around-states/41053459/", "title": "School's in with Alice Cooper, Muhammad Ali's gym, Goldblum vs ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The city has kicked off a new anti-littering campaign. Mayor Randall Woodfin and community leaders in the Bush Hills neighborhood on Tuesday announced the Don’t be a D.U.M.M.Y. campaign – “Dumping Ugly Mess in My Yard.” The mayor and people in various Birmingham communities are tired of illegal trash dumping, WBRC-TV reports. “People are too comfortable dumping in our city. Whether they live here or bring it into the city, we want to make something clear and simple for folks: That is illegal,” Woodfin said. He wants residents to report any illegal dumping by calling 311. They can take video or pictures of people or their vehicles and go to the city magistrate’s office to sign out warrants for their arrest, he urged. First-time offenders will face a $500 fine. For a second or subsequent offense, it doubles to $1,000.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A federal appeals court has reversed the dismissal of a lawsuit filed by four men who contend they were illegally imprisoned for nearly two decades. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday overturned a lower court ruling that dismissed a lawsuit by the “Fairbanks Four” against the city, KTVF-television reports. George Frese, Kevin Pease, Marvin Roberts and Eugene Vent were convicted of murder in the 1997 death of Fairbanks teenager John Hartman. The men spent 18 years in prison while they asserted their innocence and appealed their convictions. After a five-week hearing that re-examined the cases in detail and presented the case that others killed Hartman, the convictions were vacated in December 2015. The four men sued the city for wrongful imprisonment and said an agreement that led to their release, in which they agreed not to sue, was not legally binding because they were coerced.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Alice Cooper’s Solid Rock Teen Center is expanding into the city. The legendary rocker and his wife, Sheryl Cooper, were at Westwood High School on Wednesday to announce a partnership with Mesa Public Schools. They projected a summer 2020 opening of a second Solid Rock Teen Center in a former elementary school downtown. Alice Cooper’s Solid Rock Teen Centers will fund the renovations and provide more than $100,000 worth of music, arts and dance programming to youth ages 12 to 20 and the local community. The Mesa center grew out of the Hall of Famer’s annual Rock & Roll Fundraising Bash at Las Sendas Golf Club in east Mesa. The original Solid Rock Teen Center opened in 2012 in Phoenix, built in partnership with Genesis Church and Cooper’s Solid Rock Foundation after more than a decade of fundraising.\n\nArkansas\n\nJonesboro: Residents celebrated a street being renamed in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. this week after months of contentious debate. About 100 people gathered Monday at the intersection of Commerce and Highland Drives to witness a new street sign’s unveiling after a parade and program on Arkansas State University’s campus to commemorate King’s legacy. “The question is asked occasionally, do we still need to celebrate Dr. King’s holiday? If you followed the efforts this year to get a street name in the honor of Dr. King in Jonesboro and some of the language used in the debate and editorials, you realize there still remains a need for programs like this,” the Rev. Ray Scales said. Emma Agnew, president of Craighead County’s National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, encouraged the audience to register to vote at the event, asking them to consider those who died fighting for the right to vote and to take their legacy seriously.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A push to pass first-in-the-nation proposals to limit single-use plastic containers and other items drew support from actor Jeff Goldblum on Wednesday. Environmental groups hail California’s proposal as a landmark attempt to cut down on 75% of waste from plastic items like takeout boxes, food containers and utensils. The bills aim to achieve the target within a decade. “I feel like we’re on the brink of accomplishing something,” Goldblum said, likening the proposal to President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 moon-shot speech. The two bills, one in the Assembly and another in the Senate, would require companies to reduce single-use packaging as much as possible by 2024 and ensure products made or imported into California after 2030 are recyclable or can be composted. Goldblum and advocates met with representatives from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office and lawmakers at the Capitol. They delivered signed letters of support from January Jones, Ted Danson, and other actors and activists.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Immigration and customs officials violated federal law by refusing to release documents about people who are not citizens, a Colorado federal court judge said. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement used the rule to deny the release of records at least 333 times between July 2017 and April 2019, The Denver Post reports. The court ordered ICE to change its nationwide standard operating procedure and comply with the Freedom of Information Act. The case started in 2013 in Glenwood Springs when attorney Jennifer Smith requested documents about her client, but ICE refused to release them because the client was deemed a fugitive, authorities said. Releasing the documents could help people evade immigration enforcement, ICE officials said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new economic action plan will be rolled out in the state that will include incentives to attract employers to its cities and promote the growth of women- and minority-owned businesses, according to a top state official. David Lehman, commissioner of economic and community development, announced a strong push will be coming to create hubs of innovation in the manufacturing, health care, insurance and bio-science industries, the Hartford Courant reports. Lehman said there is an effort to focus these innovations in cities and strengthen networks that will be enough for Connecticut to become competitive among larger cities like Boston and New York. Since the last recession, the state has struggled to regain jobs, with the latest count showing just 85% have been added back. Lehman said Gov. Ned Lamont will roll out a plan in the coming weeks that he hopes will answer and resolve a lot of the state’s economic and development issues.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A proposal by Democratic state lawmakers to outlaw homemade “ghost guns,” which can’t be traced by law enforcement agents because they don’t have serial numbers or are fashioned from parts created with 3D printers, has cleared its first legislative hurdle. A Democrat-led House committee voted to release the bill Wednesday after an hourlong public hearing, although its chief sponsor, House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst, said she plans to amend the bill after meeting Tuesday with representatives of the National Rifle Association. Longhurst said her amendments would include a phase-in date by which owners of existing guns would have to obtain serial numbers for their weapons, exempting muzzle loaders and replicas of antique firearms, and allowing licensed firearms dealers to legally handle gun parts that do not have serial numbers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Despite months of protest from students, faculty and parents, the chancellor for D.C. Public Schools announced Thursday that Washington Met will close at the end of the school year, WUSA-TV reports. The news prompted a group of students to walk out of class Thursday morning in protest, chanting “Save Washington Met!” and carrying signs noting, “School closures disproportionately happen to black and brown communities.” Chancellor Lewis Ferebee’s originally announcement Nov. 26 of a proposal to close the school was met with outrage from some stakeholders. He cited low enrollment and achievement compared to DCPS’ three other opportunity academies. The district hosted two community forums to gather feedback and gave the public a chance to provide input until Dec. 20, which critics said was not nearly enough time.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state House on Wednesday moved to repeal a powerful commission charged with placing constitutional amendments before voters. On a 93-25 vote, the House sent the joint resolution to the Senate. If the Senate also approves, it would send the matter to voters in November. The Constitution Revision Commission was established in 1968 and meets once every 20 years to consider measures to put before the state’s electorate. “Maybe it served a valid purpose at one time,” said Rep. Brad Drake, a Republican. “Their purpose was to make revisions to the constitution, not to become policy makers – that’s our job.” The commission last met in 2018 and placed seven measures on the ballot – all of which were approved by voters. Among those was a ban on offshore oil and gas drilling and vaping in enclosed indoor workplaces. Another measure barred public officials from lobbying for compensation while in office and six years thereafter.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Proposed budget cuts could mean fewer state troopers on the road, fewer lawyers defending poor people and fewer probation officers, state agency heads told lawmakers Wednesday as budget hearings continued. Gov. Brian Kemp has proposed overall increases to the state budget, mostly based on higher pay for teachers; increased funding for K-12 schools, colleges and universities; and higher spending on the state-federal Medicaid health insurance program. But Kemp has proposed more than $200 million in cuts to other agencies for the remainder of the current budget year and more for the budget year beginning July 1. Department of Public Safety Commissioner Col. Mark McDonough told lawmakers he would leave 55 trooper positions open in the 2021 budget year and warned that “a reduction in troopers on the roadways equates to an increase in fatalities.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Solid Waste Advisory Committee in the state has proposed a plan that includes 82 waste management recommendations covering nine programs. The committee also heard recommendations at a public hearing in Hilo on Tuesday, West Hawaii Today reports. The committee made recommendations including to conduct public awareness campaigns, regularly review the West Hawaii Sanitary Landfill contract and conduct more household hazardous waste collection events, officials said. Some residents also made recommendations to the committee. “The key approach to landfill reduction is public education,” said Melody Euaparadorn of Zero Waste Big Island. Members of the Sierra Club’s Hawaii Island Group said the committee should enact a disposal fee on all purchased products at the point of purchase, an environmental impact fee on tourists and negotiations for an end date with Waste Management Inc., which operates the West Hawaii landfill.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s residents wouldn’t have to fall back or spring ahead for daylight saving time under legislation introduced Thursday. The House State Affairs Committee voted to introduce the measure brought forward by Republican Rep. Christy Zito. She said the twice-a-year time change was a safety hazard that caused temporary jet lag leading to injuries among motorists and pedestrians. She said it also increased the chances of strokes and heart attacks. Zito introduced similar legislation last year, but it failed in the full House on a 55-15 vote. A similar fate is expected this year, and there was some mirth among lawmakers on the committee. “At this point, it seems like the only one who can mess with time is God,” said Rep. Vito Barbieri, who is in favor of ending daylight saving time and moved to approve introducing the bill. “We’re going to try again.” Zito acknowledged getting the bill signed is a long shot but said it’s high on the list of what her roral constituents want.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Grant funds will provide nearly $30 million for efforts across the state to acquire open spaces and develop and improve recreational facilities. Gov. J.B. Pritzker released the list of 85 projects late last week. They will receive $29.7 million from the Open Space Land Acquisition and Development program through the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. “Investments in local park projects are good for families and recreation enthusiasts, helping them enjoy outdoor activities and making Illinois communities better places to live and work,” Pritzker said in a statement. OSLAD money supports up to half of a project’s cost. With local matching funds, the grant awards will cover $56 million in park developments and open-space land purchases. OSLAD, begun in 1987, receives funding from a portion of the state’s Real Estate Transfer Tax.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: Work is underway for a war memorial that was delayed for years by the Great Recession after the 2008 financial crisis. Crews began clearing trees last week in Crown Point for the memorial, which will feature three separate monuments: one for World War I veterans, another for World War II veterans and one for victims of the Holocaust. The two war memorials will be placed at opposite ends of a long walkway lined with plaques with information giving visitors a clearer understanding of the events between the two wars, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. Mitch Barloga, president of the Friends of Veterans Memorial Parkway, says the goal is to have the memorial finished by 2021 or no later than 2022.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state will become the latest to create an organization within state government designed to prevent school shootings under a plan announced Tuesday by Gov. Kim Reynolds. Reynolds said she’s creating a Governor’s School Safety Bureau within the Iowa Department of Public Safety. It would cost $2 million to start and $1.5 million annually to operate, and Reynolds said she’s included needed funding in her legislative budget request. “News headlines about school shootings and threats at unsuspecting communities across America are becoming all too common,” she said. “Although those headlines don’t often involve schools in Iowa, we can’t wait until they do to act.” Full-time bureau instructors will train local law enforcement officers and school staff in identifying and responding quickly in a consistent way. Reynolds’ plan calls for hiring two additional state agents with cyber training to identify and address early threats.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: The family of astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on the moon, has donated two items that were aboard the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 to the Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson. Armstrong’s two sons donated a 4-by-6-inch U.S. flag and a small piece of fabric from the wing of the Wright Flyer, the first flying machine built by the Wright brothers, the museum announced Wednesday. The piece of fabric was in the lunar module when it touched down on the moon, the museum said. Neil Armstrong died in 2012. “When I visited the Cosmosphere in 2019, it was clearly a world-class space museum, but I didn’t see anything from Apollo 11 (mission) on exhibit, and it seemed obvious to me that they should have something from the flight,” Rick Armstrong said in a news release. The new donations will be put on display later this year.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: People passing by the gym where Muhammad Ali learned to box can see a new historical marker that has been placed there. The Columbia Gym at Spalding University also has a red bicycle hanging over the entrance to the gym. Ali’s red bike was stolen when he was young, leading him to a police officer who trained at the gym. Officer Joe Martin told Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, that he would have to learn to fight, and Clay started training at the same gym. News outlets report the marker was unveiled last week, the day before Ali would have turned 78. He died in 2016. Ali’s brother, Rahman Ali, helped unveil the marker. He said his brother’s “whole life” started at Columbia Gym.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A historic brewery that’s been shuttered since Hurricane Katrina will officially reopen in a new location this weekend. Dixie Brewery plans to hold a grand opening Saturday, news outlets report. It originally opened in 1907. Floods and looting after the hurricane contributed to its closure, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. The new facility is open to the public and boasts a bar, cafe, outdoor space, museum and games. The brewery will also offer tours showing parts of the production process, according to news outlets. The brewery has created jobs for more than 40 people, WVUE-TV reports. The general manager said he hopes the facility becomes a landmark for people visiting New Orleans. “I mean, if you go to Cafe Du Monde for a beignet, you have to come to Dixie for a beer,” Jim Birch said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor used her first State of the State address this week to paint a picture of the Pine Tree State as a home of compromise and bipartisanship in an era marked by political gridlock elsewhere. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills themed Tuesday’s address “We are not Washington; we are Maine” and stuck to a theme of working together to improve health care access, protect the environment and grow the economy. Mills, who has used her first year in office to focus on issues such as Medicaid expansion, tackling climate change and solving the state’s opioid crisis, also ticked off accomplishments that she said show Maine is in good hands. “We have made progress, and we have done so without rancor or bitterness,” Mills told the crowd in the Maine House of Representatives chambers, also touting “the security and saneness of our own small outpost” during the state’s bicentennial year.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A new report says a critical shortage of police officers in the city is delaying many of the reforms that are required under a federal consent decree. The report was authored by an independent monitoring team of policing and civil rights experts, according to the Baltimore Sun. The team wrote that staffing challenges will have staggering effects on overall reforms. The department finished 2019 with 31 fewer officers than it had when the year began. A consultant recently concluded the department needs to hire 300 more officers and 100 civilians to adequately staff areas such as patrol and internal affairs. The consent decree – which followed a federal investigation that found officers routinely violated residents’ civil rights, particularly in black neighborhoods – requires improvements in how police interact with youths and respond to residents with mental disabilities as well as sexual assault victims.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSwansea: A Target employee who faced criticism by a customer upset over the price of a toothbrush received more than $30,000 in donations for a vacation fund. Tori Perotti was overwhelmed with support from social media users after a customer took to Twitter to call her out for the price of an electric toothbrush last week, news outlets report. The manager at the Swansea Target was approached by David Leavitt when he tried to purchase an electric toothbrush that he said was marked on sale for $0.01 but was actually $89.99. When Perotti refused to sell the toothbrush to Leavitt for a cent, he turned to his more than 200,000 Twitter followers to write that Perotti “is not honoring the price of their items,” in accordance to state law. He added in another tweet that he was going to call 911 over the incident. Social media users came to Perrotti’s defense shortly after, with one person going as far as starting a GoFundMe page.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Haven: Record-high water levels on the Great Lakes are wreaking havoc along the state’s coastlines, swallowing beaches and houses, swamping sewer systems, flooding roads and public buildings, and turning farm fields into lakes. And it’s only expected to get worse this year, state lawmakers were told Thursday. “We won’t have much of a beach this summer. We’re telling people to plan on getting your feet wet if you come here,” said Pat McGinnis, city manager of Grand Haven, which sits on the shores of Lake Michigan. “We had to close a public building because of mold issues from the higher water. We’re shutting them down and tearing them down, and there is no insurance coverage.” In Saginaw County, where the Saginaw River leads into Lake Huron, Public Works Commissioner Brian Wendling said there’s no place for the water to go anymore.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state Supreme Court has upheld the city’s authority to impose a minimum wage that’s higher than the state’s. The ruling follows three years of legal fighting over the $15 minimum wage as is seen as a victory for laborers and the city. The manufacturing and supplies company Graco Inc. sued in 2017 to try to block the $15 wage from taking effect, according to the Star Tribune. Graco argued it would create a patchwork of compensation standards because of the state’s $10 minimum wage for large businesses. The Supreme Court said in its ruling that the “Legislature did not intend to occupy the field of minimum-wage rates,” and because the city’s rate would not prevent employers from complying with the lower state rate, Minneapolis’ ordinance could stand. Minneapolis was the first Midwestern city to adopt a $15-per-hour minimum wage, which will be phased in gradually until it peaks in 2024.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Belhaven University is creating scholarships to honor one of its graduates who is the author of bestselling young adult novels. The Angie Thomas Writers Scholarship program will be based at the Jackson school. Thomas wrote “The Hate U Give,” about an African American teenager who sees a police officer shoot and kill her best friend, and “On the Come Up,” about a young rapper who finds her identity and confronts stereotypes through music. One creative writing major at Belhaven will receive a scholarship to cover all expenses for tuition, room and board for four years, the university said in a news release Thursday. Other top applicants may receive smaller awards. Thomas graduated from Belhaven with a bachelor of fine arts degree in 2011. “The Hate U Give” was published in 2017 and was released as a movie in 2018. “On the Come Up” was published in 2019, and Thomas is working as a producer of the movie that is in development. The deadline to apply for the scholarship is March 1.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Lawmakers are considering whether to allow police in all of the state’s municipalities to reside outside the cities where they work. A House bill initially introduced to lift the residency requirements for officers in St. Louis was expanded Tuesday to include all Missouri cities, despite opposition from Kansas City leaders, The Kansas City Star reports. Many cities currently require all law enforcement officers to live within city limits. St. Louis supports lifting the residency requirements, in part because the police department is 100 officers short. In Kansas City, officers must live in the city one year before beginning employment, and civilian workers have nine months to move into the city. Attorney General Eric Schmitt supports lifting residency requirements, contending it would help recruit and retain officers and help fight violent crime. The mayor and police chief of St. Louis also support the bill.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: An oil-drilling lease dispute has continued in federal court over whether to cancel the lease near Glacier National Park on land considered sacred by the Blackfeet tribe. The U.S. Court of Appeals heard arguments Monday from lawyers for leaseholder Solenex LLC and EarthJustice, which is representing the Blackfeet Nation and some environmental groups, the Missoulian reported Tuesday. Drilling leases in Badger-Two Medicine have been a point of contention for years, court officials said. The Bureau of Land Management in 2016 canceled the oil and gas leases held by Moncrief Oil and Solenex LLC, drawing a lawsuit from the two firms. A U.S. district court later reinstated the leases. Moncrief reached a settlement with environmental groups, but Solenex is still defending its lease, company officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s attorney general filed a lawsuit Wednesday against a commission that voted to allow machine bets on previously run horse races despite the attorney general’s warnings that the machines are illegal. The lawsuit alleges that the Nebraska State Racing Commission approved so-called historical horse racing even after state lawyers advised the commission that the machines violate state law and the Nebraska Constitution’s prohibition of casino gambling. The attorney general’s office said the commission’s vote amounted to a “unilateral decision to expand gambling without action by the Legislature or the citizens of Nebraska.” The commission voted 3-2 in July to allow the terminals at Fonner Park in Grand Island. Lawmakers have considered measures to legalize the machines in the past but rejected them amid arguments that they’re too similar to casino slots.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Silver State will be joining Iowa in using mobile apps to gather results from thousands of caucus sites, amid heightened worries about election hacking. The decision to use the apps was made to increase transparency and help run the caucuses more smoothly, says Shelby Wiltz, director of the Nevada State Democratic Party Caucus. Although the technology is intended to make counting easier, it also raises concerns about the potential for hacking or glitches. Party officials say they worked closely with the Democratic National Committee and security experts while picking and vetting the app vendor that was chosen. They declined to name the vendor, citing security reasons. Wiltz says the app has been thoroughly tested. Democratic Party activists in the two states will use programs downloaded to their personal phones to report the results of caucus gatherings to the state headquarters. That data will then be used to announce the unofficial winners.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Sexual assault survivors, parents and other advocates urged lawmakers Thursday to close a loophole in state law they argue enabled a Concord High School teacher accused of abuse. Primo “Howie” Leung was charged in April with sexually assaulting a student off school property in Massachusetts in 2015 and 2016. But school officials did not report him to police after he was seen kissing a different student in 2018 because state law allows teenagers 16 and older to consent to such contact if they are not being coerced. The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony on a pair of bills filed in response to the school district’s handling of Leung, who has pleaded not guilty. But both sponsors, Sen. Martha Hennessey, D-Hanover, and Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, said they back an amendment offered by the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence combining elements of their proposed legislation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold: A ham-handed attempt to steal organ pipes has left a township church facing extensive damage. The burglary occurred overnight Tuesday at First United Methodist Church of Freehold, according to a post on the church’s Facebook page. A bid to steal the large decorative pipes caused a collapse that damaged the organ, according to the post. A picture showed the pipes arrayed like pick-up sticks. “At this time, we do not know,” the church’s pastor, the Rev. Wil Wilson, said of the cost of the damage. “Just taking it a day at a time, but costs will be assessed soon.” The post said: “While the damage is shocking and disturbing, we thank God that no one was injured and nothing was stolen. ... We will not let this crush our spirits.” Business will go on as usual. The pastor wrote that Sunday services will be held at 10 a.m.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest university is asking students to help with picking a new school seal to replace one that had sparked protests. The University of New Mexico is allowing students to vote on five options. One has a howling Lobo and the Sandia Mountains in the background. Others have the names of the school around various designs. The move comes after the University of New Mexico began looking for a new design for its official seal following protests from Native Americans over concerns about the seal that featured a sword-carrying Spanish conquistador and a rifle-toting frontiersman. The Native American student groups Kiva Club and The Red Nation had been pressuring the university to drop the seal. “If you want to go to a school, and there is an image of a group of people who killed your ancestors on the logo, then it might deter you from going there,” student Cara Greene told TV station KRQE.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The president of the city’s subways announced his resignation Thursday, two years after being brought in to help turn around the beleaguered system. No reason was given for the unexpected departure of Andy Byford, a British executive with experience in transit systems all over the world. But there had also been tensions, notably with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who largely controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that includes the subways that Byford oversaw. In a statement on his resignation, Byford said he was “very proud” of what had been accomplished during his tenure. Speaking briefly at a board meeting Thursday after his resignation became public, Byford thanked Cuomo for giving him the opportunity and gave him credit for the efforts he and the Legislature made in securing capital funds for system improvements.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHatteras: More than 100 sea turtles stunned by recent cold temperatures have washed up on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the National Park Service said. The agency wrote on its Facebook page Wednesday that approximately 95 green and Kemp’s ridley turtles washed ashore Tuesday on the south side of Hatteras Island. Of that total, 35 washed up onto the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, the agency said. In addition, the park service says another 10 turtles were found Wednesday morning on the seashore. The turtles were taken to the N.C. Aquarium on Roanoke Island for rehabilitation. Many are expected to be released by the end of the week. The majority of the cold-stunned turtles have been found from Buxton to Hatteras, and seashore biotechs and multiple volunteer organizations continued searching for cold-stunned turtles Wednesday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Hundreds of electronic devices aimed at adding speed and security at the voting polls will be distributed to the state’s 53 counties in the coming weeks. The 990 poll books replace the paper process to check in voters that are used in most counties. North Dakota has no voter registration but maintains a central voter file, which is a database of who has voted. “One of the things when it comes to election integrity is that once you come in and show your ID, that automatically goes back into our central voter file, and so if you attempted to vote, let’s say, in Minot or drive up to Killdeer or some other place, they would know that you voted already,” Secretary of State Al Jaeger said Monday. The state’s six or seven larger counties have been using the poll books already, and by February every county will have them, the Bismarck Tribune reports.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Cincinnati Zoo is using the third birthday of its beloved premature hippo as a way to raise money for Australian wildlife affected by the recent bushfires. Instead of sending birthday gifts, the zoo is asking people to buy T-shirts that will directly benefit the Bushfire Emergency Wildlife Fund. The shirt features a koala and kangaroo giving Fiona a hug and says “Supporting Our Friends Down Under.” All proceeds from sales will be sent to Zoos Victoria to help them care for the animals that are suffering. The zoo will add $5,000 to the total amount raised. Fiona became a global celebrity after she was born Jan. 24, 2017, weighing in at just 29 pounds. The normal range for a hippo’s birth weight is 55 to 120 pounds. Fiona now weighs a healthy 1,300 pounds, according to the zoo.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former zookeeper and one-time candidate for governor was sentenced Wednesday to 22 years in prison for his role in a murder-for-hire plot and violating federal wildlife laws. A federal judge in Oklahoma City sentenced 56-year-old Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage – also known as “Joe Exotic” – for trying to arrange the killing of a Florida animal sanctuary founder who criticized his treatment of animals. The woman, Carole Baskin, wasn’t harmed. Maldonado, who maintained his innocence, also was sentenced for killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs and falsifying wildlife records. A jury convicted him last April. “I still maintain my innocence and looking forward in the upcoming days to my attorneys filing my appeal and moving onto the next step in this nightmare,” he said in a statement posted to his Facebook page.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Schools raised the statewide high school graduation rate for the class of 2019 to 80% and slightly narrowed racial and economic inequities, according to figures made public early Thursday. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the biggest gains were among low-income students, whose on-time graduation rate rose 2 percentage points; students with disabilities, whose rate rose 3 percentage points; and students who were still learning English as their second language while in high school. The on-time graduation rate for that third group surged more than 4 percentage points to 60%. In 2018, the overall graduation rate was 78.7%. State schools chief Colt Gill hailed what he called an “historic” achievement. He credited hard work in local school districts as well as a half-dozen statewide initiatives for the widespread improvement and the narrowing of racial and other gaps. Oregon’s graduation rate has been considered an embarrassment for many years, with it typically ranking in the very bottom tier of states.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Philadelphia Flyers mascot Gritty is under investigation for allegedly assaulting a 13-year-old boy during a photo shoot, police said. Chris Greenwell and his son Brandon met the hairy, googly-eyed mascot at a November event for season ticket holders. Brandon patted Gritty on the head after he and his father posed for a photo with him at the Wells Fargo Center, Greenwell told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Greenwell said that as Brandon walked away, Gritty ran out of his chair and “punched my son as hard as he could.” Greenwell, who told the newspaper he only wanted an apology and something special for his son, filed a complaint with police Dec. 21. A police spokesperson said Tuesday that the investigation is “active and ongoing.” Officials at Comcast Spectacor, the company that owns the Flyers, said it conducted an investigation but couldn’t verify whether the alleged assault happened.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State lawmakers are considering a bill that would ban 3D guns. The measure would make it illegal for anyone in Rhode Island to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer or receive any firearm that is made from plastic, fiberglass or through a 3D-printing process. The proposal received unanimous approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday night. The guns, also referred to as “ghost guns,” are especially dangerous because they can pass through metal detectors and be obtained by people who wouldn’t otherwise pass background checks, supporters have argued. Critics of the bill contend that the ban is unnecessary and that existing laws tackle undetectable firearms.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGeorgetown: A sheriff’s deputy responding to a burglary call was forced to settle a beef between his K9 and a spooked cow by using a stun gun. Georgetown County sheriff’s deputies were dispatched to the Pleasant Hill community Wednesday when a K9 that was brought to the scene reportedly became “distracted” and bit a cow belonging to the property owners, a statement from the agency said. The officer was forced to stun the dog to prevent the cow from being seriously injured, the office said. Reacting to the bite, the cow charged at the deputy and property owner, hitting them and causing minor injuries. After taking stock of the situation, the deputy placed the dog in his cruiser. None of the people or animals involved appeared to be seriously hurt. At the end of it all, the sheriff’s office determined the original burglary call was unfounded.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Twenty-one state legislators have signed on in support of a bill that would prohibit local governments from banning plastic bags, straws and other products. Eight states have banned single-use plastic bags, and 15 states, including Minnesota and North Dakota, have adopted laws prohibiting government entities from banning plastic bags, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Republican Sen. John Wiik says he decided to introduce the legislation after working with retailers on the issue and seeing neighboring states attempt similar legislation. “I just thought it was time to move ahead and give the small businesses, your mom-and-pop convenience stores and small town businesses, a little more solid footing going into the future,” Wiik says. The question of a ban rose to the surface in Sioux Falls last year after the flooded Big Sioux River left thousands of plastic bags stuck in the trees along the river banks as the water receded.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city says it has emergency, private garbage crews on standby in case of a “wildcat” work stoppage this weekend. “They are operating outside of their leadership. Should this stoppage occur, it’s in breach of the memorandum of understanding with the city and also the ordinance,” city spokesman Dan Springer said. he said any worker who participates in an unauthorized work stoppage technically resigns their position under the city charter. How large of a work stoppage is planned for Saturday or if it will happen at all is unclear. Any potential stoppage could delay trash pickup scheduled for this weekend after being pushed back for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The head of AFSCME Local 1733, the Memphis sanitation workers union, wrote a letter to Mayor Jim Strickland last week disavowing a planned, “unsanctioned” strike.\n\nTexas\n\nTomball: A teacher who authorities say brought a handgun to school and made threatening comments about colleagues has been arrested. Mark Davis, a history and geography teacher at Concordia Lutheran High School, was arrested Wednesday. Tomball police say he’s charged with possessing a weapon in a prohibited place and threatening to exhibit or use a firearm at a school. According to a criminal complaint, a teacher who encountered Davis, 62, on Tuesday in a first-floor common area at the private school said he “appeared to be more angry than usual.” Davis told the teacher he felt the principal gave another school a bad reference regarding his time at Concordia, and he complained the school’s baseball coach hadn’t picked him for an assistant coaching position. The teacher told police Davis said he would buy an automatic rifle and had a handgun upstairs, according to the complaint, and he told school officials he brought it to campus to “protect the kids.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A contentious state tax overhaul will be repealed amid growing voter backlash to the plan that would raise taxes on food and groceries while cutting income tax, Republican legislative leaders said Thursday. The repeal was announced after an effort to challenge it through a citizen referendum appeared to have succeeded in getting a spot on the November ballot, the Deseret News reports. Gov. Gary Herbert told reporters during his regular monthly news conference on PBS Utah that an overhaul is still needed, but lawmakers will likely wait to take up the issue until next year. The legislative session begins Monday. “I think we’re accommodating the will of the people,” Herbert said about the repeal. “The fact that we have pushback means we have not done our job as far as convincing the people this is the right thing to do or the right way to do it.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is looking to award $2 million to help construct fast vehicle charging stations along highway corridors. The state is requesting proposals for a third round of grant funding to build Direct Current Fast Charging stations at eleven priority locations along Vermont’s major arteries. As of last October, there were more than 3,500 electric vehicles registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles, up 154% since 2016. The third round of funding will ensure charging stations are available along interstate and other priority highway corridors such as interstates 89 and 91, U.S. Route 4 and Vermont Route 100. “Electric car owners often charge at home, but increased availability and speed of public charging are critical to advancing transportation electrification in Vermont,” said David Roberts, the Drive Electric Vermont coordinator.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An event considered the world’s leading international competition for young violinists will feature a Virginia competitor when it comes to the city this spring. The Menuhin Competition Richmond 2020 on Wednesday announced the 44 competitors who had been selected from a pool of 321 applicants for the May event. The Menuhin Competition, which is held every two years in a different location, is known as “Olympics of the Violin.” The competitors represent 16 countries of residence across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia, and 13 U.S. states, according to a press release from event organizers. Kayleigh Kim, a 15-year-old from northern Virginia, will compete in the junior level of the competition, for ages 15 and under. The senior level features musicians 21 and under. The event was founded in 1983 by violinist Yehudi Menuhin, one of the great musical talents of the 20th century.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Middle and high school students joined administrators, parents and doctors Wednesday in urging a state Senate committee to pass severe restrictions on nicotine vaping products, decrying how some of their peers leave class to vape in the bathroom or even use the products during class by exhaling into their sleeve. Washington adopted a temporary ban on flavored e-cigarette juice in October as the nation grappled with a mysterious, sometimes fatal lung illness that appeared linked to vaping. Since then, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has said the outbreak appears to have been linked mostly to vitamin E acetate in vaping products containing THC, the main active ingredient in cannabis. The bill considered by the Senate Health and Long Term Care Committee on Wednesday would make the flavor ban permanent, while also limiting the nicotine content and size of each vaping juice cartridge.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s public schools superintendent wants the state Board of Education not to reduce the number of social studies courses required for high school graduation. Superintendent Steve Paine said in a statement that he will make the recommendation based on an overwhelming response to the proposal. Last month the Board of Education placed the overall high school credits proposal up for public comment through Jan. 24. It would reduce the number of required social studies courses in favor of other courses such as career technical education and computer science. Meanwhile, a new class on cooking, cleaning and budgeting could be coming to schools under a bill passed Thursday by the Senate. Lawmakers voted 33-0 to approve the proposal to have the state education board come up with a home economics course that would also include training on sewing, minor home repair and time management.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Milwaukee Brewers home ballpark will have a new name next year after a 20-year deal with Miller comes to an end. American Family Insurance announced this week that Miller Park will become American Family Field next Jan. 1. A new logo and other branding elements will be revealed later this year. The Brewers a year ago announced the 15-year naming rights deal with American Family, but the name of the ballpark was not known until now. No terms of the agreement were announced. The deal with Miller was worth $40 million. The brewing company, now MillerCoors, showed little or no interest in extending the naming rights. The insurance company also has the naming rights to the main amphitheater at Summerfest, the music festival along Milwaukee’s lakefront.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Sleeping Giant Ski Area in northwest Wyoming is suspending winter operations after this season because of financial problems. Amy Woods, manager of the Yellowstone Recreations Foundation, announced the board of directors’ decision this week, saying that “the number of skiers and snowboarders we currently attract does not make winter operations financially feasible as we run a deficit of over $200,000 per year.” She said the decision is “agonizing but necessary.” The Cody Enterprise reports the zipline will not be affected and will start running again in the summer. In 2007, a local group launched a plan to acquire Sleeping Giant, which had shuttered three years earlier. The Yellowstone Recreations Foundation was established to reopen the ski area.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/11/04/memorial-service-super-weed-bear-attack-news-around-states/50901741/", "title": "Memorial service, destructive 'super weed': News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTrussville: A school district’s superintendent has resigned after it was revealed that school officials had been aware of a student’s notebook filled with threats for a year before taking action to ensure student safety. Trussville City Schools Superintendent Pattie Neill’s contract was scheduled to expire June 30, 2026, but her attorney renegotiated the pact that will now end Oct. 31, 2023. Neill will be paid through that date but will no longer be in charge of the district, which is in a suburb of Birmingham, al.com reports. “It provides us an opportunity to move forward; it provides us an opportunity to have a fresh start,” Trussville City Board of Education Vice President Kim DeShazo said of the negotiation involving Neill. “I am looking forward to our city being in the news for the things that we have to celebrate because Trussville City Schools does have a lot to celebrate and a lot to be thankful for ... I’m looking forward to the next chapter.” The board named Interim Superintendent Frank Costanzo as the district’s acting superintendent as the system begins the search for Neill’s permanent replacement. Since Sept. 30, Neill had been on a 60-day leave of absence.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer said Wednesday that he is satisfied with Alaska’s ballot counting process and that there are no plans for a statewide hand-count audit of a race like the one he called for two years ago. Meyer oversees elections in Alaska and after the 2020 general election announced plans for an audit of votes on a statewide ballot initiative that narrowly passed. He cast the audit, conducted after the race was certified, as a way to address questions that had been raised about the validity of election results tied to vote tabulation equipment used by the state. The audit affirmed the passage of the initiative, which ended party primaries and instituted ranked-choice voting in general elections. This year’s elections were the first held under the new elections process. Meyer and Division of Elections Director Gail Fenumiai held a briefing with reporters Wednesday, ahead of next week’s election. Meyer said he is “satisfied that the process works and that there’s enough checks and balances in place that if something isn’t quite right, we’ll catch it soon.” In an interview with the Associated Press, Meyer said that with the 2020 review, “we were able to show folks that the machines worked correctly.” He said it has been frustrating to see people get misinformation from social media or from online videos.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A planned research center operated by the University of Arizona will get a $150million allocation of federal money via the state, officials announced Wednesday. The designation comes from money the state received through the American Rescue Plan Act, C.J. Karamargin, a spokesperson for Gov. Doug Ducey, wrote in an email. The funds will go to the UA Health Sciences’ planned Phoenix-based Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies, which will be part of the downtown, 30-acre Phoenix Bioscience Core campus. There are no current cost estimates for the project, UA officials said Wednesday. The Phoenix Bioscience Core includes several education, health care and research entities, including the Arizona-based Translational Genomics Research Institute, the UA College of Medicine Phoenix, and the Dignity Health-Cancer Institute at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center. The Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies intends to advance immunology research in four areas: cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and real-time immune system monitoring, UA officials said.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nArkansas\n\nVan Buren: Two former Crawford County deputies fired over excessive force complaints had requested a public hearing Wednesday in efforts to clear their names, but they didn’t show up, the sheriff’s office reports. Neither Levi White nor Zack King appeared at the sheriff’s department lobby Wednesday. Instead, a woman showed up to make accusations that she, too, has been roughed up during an arrest by White. White and King were caught on video making a rough arrest of Randal Worcester on Aug. 21. The video taken by a bystander showed White, King and a Mulberry police officer, Thell Riddle, beating Worcester after a convenience store clerk in Alma claimed Worcester threatened her. Attorney David Powell of Fort Smith, who previously represented Worcester, said he is now represented by another attorney in Oklahoma City. Powell is now representing Tammy Nelson, who said on Aug. 21, she was at her home, where she was involved in a civil matter that resulted in a heated argument that didn’t go well. White was sent to the call, where things escalated for the worse, she said. “I was just attacked by him and violated and thrown to the ground,” Nelson said. She was arrested and jailed on complaints of obstruction of a government operation and harassment. Powell said he has heard from other clients with such complaints.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Delays in testing evidence from sexual assaults have been a lost opportunity for investigators and a source of frustration for victims for years, prompting state officials to announce Tuesday that they have created a way for survivors to track the progress of linking their rape kits with DNA evidence. California is also the first state to hire a sexual assault evidence outreach coordinator, Sarai Crain, who will work with investigators, medical facilities and others to help track and process sexual assault evidence. The new online tracking system was required under a law approved by state lawmakers last year. It follows a 2017 California law that requires law enforcement agencies to submit the evidence for testing within 20 days and requires crime labs to test the evidence within 120 days or provide reasons for any delay. The goal is to end the backlog of rape kits by local agencies, make sure they are tested quickly once they are submitted, and keep survivors better informed, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. Of nearly 6,400 kits collected in 2020, 90% were analyzed by May 2021, according to an annual report by the attorney general’s office. The rest were in various stages of processing. About half the tests found DNA that was compared to other DNA on the FBI’s database, and nearly 800 resulted in “hits.”\n\nColorado\n\nIdaho Springs: The Colorado city of Idaho Springs said Wednesday it has agreed to pay $7 million to a 75-year-old man who said an officer used a stun gun on him without warning and dragged him from his apartment after a dispute with a neighbor, causing a stroke that left him with permanent injuries. Michael Clark alleged in the federal civil rights suit filed last year that he suffered numerous health problems after Officer Nicholas Hanning used a Taser on him in his home in Idaho Springs, causing Clark to lose consciousness, fall and strike his head. Clark also accused Hanning of putting a knee on his neck, depriving him of oxygen and increasing his risk of death. Hanning, who was fired after the May 2021 encounter, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor third-degree assault and relinquished his right to serve as a law enforcement officer in Colorado. He was sentenced in January to two years of probation and community service. The Idaho Springs statement said the city admits no liability but is settling the case “for economic reasons and to bring closure to all involved.” It did say the city and Police Chief Nate Buseck “acknowledge the poor judgment that led to the use” of the Taser against Clark, which Buseck previously described as unacceptable. “He is wheelchair bound and now forever dependent on his family and doctors to survive,” Clark’s attorney, Sarah Schielke, said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A man who was linked to the sexual assaults of four women in 1984 by information on a genealogy database was convicted Wednesday of all eight kidnapping charges against him. A state jury in Hartford took less than an hour of deliberations to unanimously convict Michael Sharpe after a five-day trial. He faces 25 to 100 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 9. Sharpe, 71, who had been free on a promise to appear in court, was detained after the verdicts because a judge set a new bond at $2.5 million. At least two of the victims were in the courtroom and wept after the verdicts were announced, The Hartford Courant reports. Sharpe’s public defender, Dana Sanetti, said in her closing argument Tuesday that the only evidence connecting Sharpe to the attacks was his DNA, which was only “a piece of the puzzle,” Hearst Connecticut Media reports. Sharpe, of Marlborough, was once the chief executive officer of a group that ran the Jumoke Academy, a tuition-free charter school in Hartford. Prosecutors said he broke into the women’s homes in four different towns and sexually assaulted them at gunpoint in June and July of 1984. Investigators found DNA evidence at the homes, but no matches could be found at the time, and the cases went cold.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A big change is coming for the state’s surf-fishing car tag program: There will be no cap on the number of permits issued for 2023, according to an announcement from State Parks Director Ray Bivens on Wednesday. Yes, that means people don’t have to rush to the computer or Delaware State Parks’ gates to snag those coveted surf-fishing tags that allow drive-on beach access. No longer crushed by the “sold out” announcement from State Parks, anyone who wants a surf-fishing tag can now get one. Still, there was a reason the cap was put in place − to protect the natural resources and manage crowds. That’s where another change comes in. After a stakeholder group met this spring, State Parks announced it will be piloting a new reservation system for 36 of the busiest days during the season. The pilot reservation system and lifting of the cap come after the demand for surf-fishing permits has continued to grow in recent years and peaked at unprecedented heights in the past two years. In 2020, the maximum 17,000 tags sold out in just a few months, prompting the state to release an additional 1,000 tags. Eager anglers and beach enthusiasts lined up overnight for a chance to get one of these extra permits.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Internationally renowned chef Gordon Ramsay teamed up with Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday for a friendly cooking competition at his newly opened restaurant in the nation’s capital, WUSA-TV reports. Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips opened Oct. 25 in The Wharf area of the city. The location is the third in the franchise, his take on the classic English street food. The menu ranges from classic fish and chips to chicken, shrimp, “dirty chips” and Gordon’s signature shakes: Sticky Toffee and Biscoff. During the competition, Bowser got to try her hand at one of the signature shakes with the help of Ramsay. The famed chef and the mayor competed against Deputy Mayor John Falcicchio and chef Christina Wilson, who won season 10 of Ramsay’s reality show “Hell’s Kitchen,” to see who could make the best Biscoff shake. The Ramsay-Bowser duo claimed victory. There could be a chance for a rematch in the future, as restaurateur Ramsay is not stopping with the Fish & Chips location in D.C. He is also opening his wildly popular Hell’s Kitchen restaurant, inspired by the show of the same name, on The Wharf as well in early 2023. Until then, the Fish & Chips location in D.C. is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday-Saturday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Florida State University held a memorial service on campus Wednesday evening to remember the victims of the 2018 yoga studio shooting in the city. The service marked four years since the mass shooting took place at Tallahassee Hot Yoga, where Scott Paul Beierle killed two women, 21-year-old Maura Binkley and 61-year-old Nancy Van Vessem, and injured five other victims before killing himself. A key part of the service was the announcement of a new initiative called “Florida State United: One Voice Against Hate,” which aims to bring more awareness to hate crimes through research and education. “As Maura and Nancy exemplified in their lives, love is the most important work we can do,” Jeff Binkley, Maura Binkley’s father, said to the FSU and Tallahassee community as they were gathered near the Integration Statue on campus. “Always remember that only love can conquer hate.” Maura Binkley was a senior at FSU double majoring in German and English, and Van Vessem was a chief medical officer at Capital Health Plan, as well as a former faculty member at FSU’s College of Medicine. Signs were placed throughout the area with phrases such as “A Voice for Safety,” “A Voice for Peace” and “A Voice for Freedom.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A state agency has stopped accepting applications from people seeking assistance with their rent payments, saying money from the federally funded aid program has begun to run out. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs posted an announcement on its website last week that the agency is no longer taking rental assistance applications, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The news caught housing advocates off guard and left some tenants scrambling to pay rent with little warning, said Lindsay Siegel, director of housing advocacy at Legal Aid of Atlanta. “The DCA put some tenants in a pretty bad position,” Siegel said. “If they knew they were running out of money, they should have told them so they could plan.” The federal government put $46.5 billion into an emergency rental assistance program in 2020 in hopes of averting spikes in evictions and homelessness during the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Treasury Department reported a year ago that several states and large cities had already exhausted their share of the funding. Now Georgia is getting close to running out of rental assistance money, prompting the Department of Community Affairs to suspend applications, agency Commissioner Christopher Nunn said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The ground is still shaking and swelling at Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano in the world, indicating it could erupt. Scientists say they don’t expect that to happen right away, but officials on the Big Island are telling residents to be prepared. Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up Hawaii Island, the southernmost in the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s not the tallest – that title goes to Mauna Kea – but it’s the largest and makes up about half of the island’s land mass. It sits immediately north of Kilauea volcano, which is currently erupting from its summit crater. Kilauea is well-known for a 2018 eruption that destroyed 700 homes and sent rivers of lava spreading across farms and into the ocean. Mauna Loa last erupted 38 years ago. In written history, dating to 1843, it has erupted 33 times. The Big Island is mostly rural and is home to cattle ranches, coffee farms and beach resorts. Mauna Loa’s eruptions differ from Kilauea’s in part because it is taller. Its greater height gives it steeper slopes, which allow lava to rush down its hillsides faster than Kilauea’s. Its enormous size may allow it to store more magma, leading to larger lava flows when an eruption occurs. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has more than 60 GPS stations on Mauna Loa taking measurements to estimate the location and the amount of magma accumulating beneath the surface. There’s also a thermal webcam at Mauna Loa’s summit that will identify the presence of heat. And satellite radar can keep track of ground swelling and deflation.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A high-profile attorney who has defended in state and federal courts some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation is among the latest attorneys to quit state employment. Former Deputy Attorney General Megan Larrondo is one of eight attorneys and a handful of other staffers who have left or are leaving the Idaho attorney general’s office following Raúl Labrador’s win over five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the Republican primary in May. More departures are expected. Information obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request shows that Larrondo’s job ended Monday. Court documents filed Friday in both U.S. District Court in Idaho and the Idaho Supreme Court show filings requesting Larrondo be removed as attorney of record in the state’s abortion cases. The state and federal courts have yet to make final rulings in those cases. Labrador, a former U.S. representative who has said voters are looking for an aggressive, conservative attorney general, has promised to make the office more partisan should he win in next week’s general election. In a series of recent interviews, he denigrated attorneys working in the office, telling the Lewiston Tribune that the “Attorney General’s Office needs to have better lawyers.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The 2018 killing of “ZackTV,” a trailblazer in a perilous genre of gangland reporting he called “‘hood CNN,” seemed destined to go unsolved, even though gunmen attacked him on a downtown Chicago street lined with surveillance cameras. Police never announced arrests in the shooting of Zachary Stoner, who drew a national YouTube following filling a media niche with up-close stories about the lives and deaths of gang members and affiliated rappers from places other reporters were afraid to go. But police records obtained by the Associated Press reveal investigators believe they solved his homicide years ago when they arrested members of South Side Chicago’s “Perry Avenue” gang. Yet prosecutors in 2019 declined to prosecute, and police were forced to release the suspects. Police say the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office cited the possibility that the two sides in the shooting on May 30, 2018, were “mutual combatants” – a disputed legal concept that’s a throwback to duels between nobles or prearranged gunfights in the Wild West. That prosecutors passed on charges on those grounds raises questions about whether Chicago gangs can literally get away with murder when it’s unclear who initiated a shooting and who returned fire in self-defense.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is planning his fifth overseas trip of the year, this time to attend a U.N. climate conference in Egypt. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office announced Wednesday that he would take part in the COP27 climate change conference. Holcomb’s schedule includes giving a speech about Indiana’s efforts to increase use of clean energy in the state, the governor’s office said. “I look forward to highlighting the ongoing ways Hoosiers continue to pioneer the way forward, develop sustainable solutions, and lead productive global conversations,” Holcomb said in a statement. Holcomb and state Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers will be part of an Indiana delegation arriving Sunday in Egypt and returning to Indiana on Nov. 12. The trip is being paid for with private donations to the Indiana Economic Development Foundation, the governor’s office said. Holcomb also plans meetings with businesses and foreign governments and organizations during the conference drawing leaders from nearly 200 nations. The governor has made four previous economic development this year, including to Germany and Switzerland last month and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in May. He made two trips in the spring that took him to Sweden, Great Britain, Monaco, Slovakia and Israel.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: This week the Des Moines Area Religious Council’s network of food pantries broke the record for the number of individuals helped during a single day in the network’s 46-year history. On Tuesday, the network of 15 pantries assisted 1,530 individuals across Polk County, beating the previous record of 1,476 individuals helped in one day Sept. 3, 2019, according to a DMARC news release. Matt Unger, the CEO of DMARC, said even though he expected the record to be broken this month, seeing it happen is still “jarring.” He said he expects this November to be the busiest month in the network’s history. “It’s going to be a big month and it is going to take a tremendous amount of public support for ALL organizations working in the food insecurity space to make sure our community members have AT LEAST the basic groceries they and their households need,” Unger wrote in an email. According to DMARC, rising costs for essential goods such as food and gasoline, coupled with the decrease in benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in April, have contributed to the rise in people in need across Iowa. Michelle Book, the president of Food Bank of Iowa, said 1 in 7 working households across the state cannot cover the costs of their basic needs.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A former undersheriff was acquitted Wednesday in the death of an unarmed man he shot with a defective beanbag round five years ago. Virgil Brewer was charged with involuntary manslaughter after he shot Steven Myers using his personal shotgun the evening of Oct. 6, 2017, in Sun City, a rural area about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A Wyandotte County jury deliberated for four hours after a weeklong trial before returning the not-guilty verdict. It was unclear if Brewer, who has been on unpaid leave from the Barber County Sheriff’s department since his 2018 arrest, would return to his former role. Brewer and two other officers responded to a call about an armed man on a street after an altercation at a Sun City bar. Myers, who was drunk and had been told to leave the bar, was gone by the time officers arrived. They found him in a shed at a Sun City home. He came out of the shed, and Brewer shot him at close range with a beanbag, which split open and emptied pellets into his chest, causing fatal injuries. Medical Examiner Timothy Gorrill ruled Myers’ death a homicide. An expert testified at trial that the beanbag round was defective and should never have been sold or distributed, defense attorney David Harger said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: In a move that experts describe as outrageous, the Kentucky Bar Association is seeking to punish a lawyer who brought a scandal to light this summer in which an elected prosecutor was trading favors with a defendant in exchange for nude images of her. An inquiry panel has accused attorney Thomas Clay of violating what is known informally as the “squeal rule” or “rat rule.” The rule says that when a lawyer knows another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Misconduct raising a “substantial question about their honesty, trustworthiness or fitness,” the first lawyer must report it to bar counsel. When Clay learned that Commonwealth’s Attorney Ronny Goldy Jr. had for several years done favors for a defendant in exchange for her giving him nude photos and videos of herself, he reported it to the FBI but not to the bar association’s disciplinary counsel. Clay provided the FBI and the Louisville Courier Journal with 230 pages of Facebook messages documenting the quid quo pro. Just two days after the newspaper published a story that included excerpts of the messages, the bar moved to temporarily suspend Goldy, the elected prosecutor for Bath, Menifee, Montgomery and Rowan counties. Clay’s lawyer, Jon Fleischaker, said his client deserves “praise, not sanction.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A little more than 12% of registered voters in the state have cast their ballots ahead of next week’s elections, keeping up with Louisiana’s steady increase in midterm election turnout. Of the 363,009 residents who participated in the state’s early voting period, which ended Tuesday night, about 42% were registered Democrats, and 43% were Republicans, according to data from the Louisiana Secretary of State’s office. Most Louisiana voters opt to vote in person on Election Day. But the percentage who vote early has been steadily increasing. During 2018 midterm elections, about 11% of voters cast their ballots early, up from 8% in 2014 and 4% in 2010. Early voting topped 32% in 2020, though presidential election years tend to draw far more voters than midterms. The state has placed a number of restrictions on mail-in voting. Absentee ballots need a notary or witness signature and can only go to older people, those with disabilities or voters who can show they cannot cast a ballot in person on Election Day. This election, absentee ballots went to about 3% of the total number of registered voters in the state.\n\nMaine\n\nWells: More than $4.3 million in federal funds is on its way to the Wells-Ogunquit Community School District to help purchase 11 new, clean, zero-emission school buses. Such funds essentially will help the district swap out its current fleet of 12 diesel-engine buses. David Cash, the New England regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, made Wells his first stop Monday on his tour of Maine school districts that will be receiving their own slices of more than $13 million from the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program. Cash said the buses currently in use create pollution with “long-term impacts on our kids” and contribute to “problematic” issues related to climate change. He called the $5 billion being spent nationwide for new, “clean” school buses “tremendous.” “It’s incumbent upon us to make the right kind of choices and the right kind of investments,” he said. WOCSD is one of 13 school districts in the state that President Joe Biden announced would be part of his administration’s funding for the bus program for the current fiscal year. The funds are a part of the infrastructure bill Biden signed into law last year. WOCSD is receiving the largest share of the $13 million. Overall, the grant funds will help with the purchases of 34 “clean” buses for school districts throughout the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nMontgomery County: Vulgar signs atop a busy roadway are grabbing the attention of drivers and neighbors alike, WUSA-TV reports. Conservative activist Shaun Porter and several other people have recently been holding signs atop the Capital Beltway on the Bradley Boulevard overpass. While holding politically tinged signs near roadways is not a new phenomenon in the D.C. region, Porter’s signs include curse words and sexually graphic language directed at President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. Jobe Lett, an 11-year-old Montgomery County resident who lives nearby the overpass, said the signs have become a distraction in his neighborhood “because of the language that they’re using.” Data provided by the state shows more than 200,000 people drive the beltway around the Bradley Boulevard overpass every day. But some of those drivers honk at Porter’s signs. That has also become a problem for neighbors. Homes surround the overpass on both sides. “Hey, I support everyone’s right to (free speech),” Montgomery County Jesse Sanders said. “I just kind of wish it wasn’t in the most residential of areas.” Maryland State Police said obscenity laws are vague, and they have questions about infringing on Porter’s First Amendment rights by asking him to stop.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Authorities who earlier this week said they had finally identified the “Lady of the Dunes,” the woman whose mutilated body was found on Cape Cod in 1974, are now looking for information about a man she may have married. The late Guy Rockwell Muldavin is believed to have married Ruth Marie Terry in February 1974, just a few months before the 37-year-old Terry’s body was found in Provincetown, according to a statement Wednesday from state police, Provincetown police and the Cape and Islands district attorney’s office. Investigators are asking anyone with information about the whereabouts of Terry or Muldavin in New England in 1973 or 1974 to contact them. Muldavin, described as an antiques dealer who also used the names Raoul Guy Rockwell and Guy Muldavin Rockwell, was a suspect in the deaths of a previous wife and a stepdaughter in Seattle in 1960, according to media reports at the time. He was caught in New York City and charged with “unlawful flight.” He died in California in 2002, according to his obituary. The death of the “Lady of the Dunes” was one of the most enduring and frustrating murder mysteries in Massachusetts. A young girl out for a walk found the body in the dunes in Provincetown in July 1974. The woman was naked on a beach blanket with her hands severed – so she could not be identified by her fingerprints, officials said. Her skull was crushed, and she was nearly decapitated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A shortage of poll workers has concerned local election officials in some parts of the country, but Michigan is facing a different side of the trend. Conservative groups and local Republican Party operatives who have pushed false claims about the 2020 presidential election have recruited poll workers in the state by the thousands. Similar recruitment efforts on the right have bolstered the ranks of poll workers in some other states with nationally watched races. Seeding the ranks of front-line election workers with people recruited by groups promoting election conspiracies has raised alarms among some that the people at the foundation of the election system could try to undermine it. “It concerns me when the motivation to serve as a poll worker is fueled through misinformation and people who have been fed lies, in some cases, for years now,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat. “Since the spring, clerks have come at us with concerning questions they’re getting and, in some cases, hundreds of poll worker applications that seem to be motivated by nefarious intent.” In Oakland County, the state’s second-most populous, Republicans “discouraged about the outcome of the 2020 election” have been urged to sign up as poll workers through a new Republican National Committee recruitment program.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council on Thursday unanimously approved a former public safety director from New Jersey to take over the city’s police department, as it struggles with depleted staffing and the uncertainty of an ongoing federal investigation following the killing of George Floyd. Brian O’Hara, deputy mayor of Newark, will start serving as Minneapolis’ police chief Monday. “Everyone is hungry for change in this city. I’m not here to maintain the status quo,” he told reporters after the council vote. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey nominated O’Hara to lead the police department in September and said Thursday that the city needs someone like O’Hara right now. “This moment matters,” Frey said. “The act of stepping up for this job – at this time – is an act of courage.” Minneapolis has been at the center of calls for changes in policing since the May 2020 killing of Floyd, whose death under an officer’s knee led to nationwide demands for racial justice and an end to police brutality. Calls to abolish the department or dismantle and replace it with a new department of public safety were rejected by voters in the city last year. The city is also under a federal investigation into its policing practices, and it is expected that court-enforced changes will be ordered through a consent decree.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State lawmakers met in special session Wednesday and quickly approved nearly $247 million in incentives for an aluminum plant that is supposed to bring 1,000 jobs to northern Mississippi by 2029. Many legislators voted on the incentives without knowing the name of the company. At a news conference as the session ended, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves acknowledged the aluminum project is being developed by Steel Dynamics Inc., an Indiana-based company that already operates a steel mill near Columbus, Mississippi. “They are a fantastic employer in the Golden Triangle today,” Reeves said. Reeves had previously said a nondisclosure agreement prohibited him from publicly naming the company until the deal was done. Only the governor can call a special session, and Democratic legislators questioned why Reeves has not called sessions to address other issues, including funding for Jackson’s troubled water system or for struggling rural hospitals. “Many Mississippians are suffering and dying. But none of these things, despite being matters of literal life and death, compelled the governor to call a special session,” Rep. Robert Johnson of Natchez said Wednesday during a Democratic Caucus news conference. “So, what compelled him to bring us back again? A victory lap being portrayed publicly as an emergency? But this feels a lot more like a campaign event, a political pep rally, than public service.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city will pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of an unarmed Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer in 2019. The Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners approved the settlement with the family of Terrence Bridges Jr. in a closed meeting earlier this week, The Kansas City Star reports. Bridges, 30, was shot and killed after officers responded to a reported carjacking. Police had contended he was resisting arrest and was shot during a struggle with the officer, identified in police records as Dylan Pifer. The officer told investigators he feared for his life because he thought Bridges was pulling a gun from a sweatshirt. Bridges’ family and civil rights activists said he was not armed, not resisting, did not pose a threat to the officer and was not involved in the carjacking. Tom Porto, an attorney representing the family, said in a statement the settlement represents the police department’s acknowledgement of the tragic and significant loss to Bridges’ family. Pifer, who is still on the police force, was not charged in the killing. A year after Bridges’ death, Pifer was with Sgt. Matthew T. Neal as Neal injured a 15-year-old boy by slamming his face into the pavement after stopping a car the teenager was in. Neal left the department after pleading guilty last week to third-degree assault. He was placed on four years’ probation. Pifer was not charged.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: While Budweiser and Coors Light remain the state’s favorite beers, Gov. Greg Gianforte and Department of Agriculture Director Christy Clark have signed a letter of understanding saying Heineken’s parent company, Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, S.A., will do more business in Montana, including buying more Treasure State barley. The deal was announced Tuesday, The Daily Montanan reports. While the letter of intent didn’t commit the beverage industry giant to specific amounts or prices, it did say the company was committed to using more Montana products in its beer manufacturing. The “intent to procure increased volumes of high-quality Montana barley” will be met with “transparent market information, producer consultations, and continued investments in barley research” by the state, according to the letter. Gianforte, as well as leaders from Heineken and the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee along with members of the U.S. Grain Council, signed the letter at Bos Hay and Grain at Gallatin Gateway. “We’re thrilled Heineken recognized the superior quality of Montana barley and wants to do more business with our farmers,” Gianforte said. ‘This agreement ushers in tremendous opportunities for our ag industry.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: In the wake of a Halloween block party where a man drove around barricades and toward the crowd before a police officer shot and wounded him, counselors and government officials have been offering help for those who witnessed the chaos. Therapists were available Thursday evening at Minne Lusa Elementary School for those dealing with stress from Monday night’s incident in the same neighborhood, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Project Harmony Deputy Director told the newspaper that officials were hoping to help kids and adults alike process the experience and normalize their feelings, which she said might include fixating on the event, sleep interruptions, irritability and fearing for their own safety. The shooting happened about 7 p.m. Monday during the annual Halloween block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood, and no one besides the driver was injured. It capped a chaotic few seconds in which people ran screaming as the car accelerated toward the crowd before shots rang out. Authorities had blocked off the area to traffic to allow trick-or-treaters and their families to mill about the streets safely. Police said the driver, later identified as 31-year-old Dontavius Levering, drove around the barricades and traveled recklessly the wrong way without headlights on Minne Lusa Boulevard through crowds of people, including throngs of children. It’s not clear whether he intended to hurt anyone.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada asked the state’s secretary of state Wednesday to investigate what it called a “coordinated partisan election administration effort” during rural Nye County’s hand-count of mail-in ballots that was shut down last week until after polls close. The ACLU said a hand-count volunteer openly carrying a firearm removed an ACLU observer from a hand-count tally room, which the organization said it recently discovered was Nye County GOP Central Committee Vice Chair Laura Larsen. The ACLU said the situation “poses questions” surrounding Nye County interim clerk Mark Kampf’s delegation of authority to partisan officials to remove observers from hand-count rooms, particularly during a hand-count process that deals with tabulation of ballots.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: A boil water order for customers of the Rye Water District has now stretched into its third week following the detection of harmful bacteria in district water samples in mid-October. A public informational meeting has been set for this weekend to discuss the order. Town leaders are continuing to distribute cases of bottled water to affected residents as Rye Water District leadership awaits the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services’ lifting of the order. Three weeks since the enactment of the order, Rye Water District superintendent Arik Jones said he still feels it could take several more days before it’s over. The cause of the water contamination has not been identified, though Jones stated that potential causes could be from “improper irrigation operation and/or maintenance.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDelran: A $2.5 million upgrade at a water-treatment plant here is intended to remove a potentially harmful contaminant from a major source of South Jersey’s drinking water. New Jersey American Water said the improvements will target a man-made chemical found more than two years ago in samples taken from the Delaware River. The utility’s Delran plant processes up to 40 million gallons of river water daily for use by hundreds of thousands of customers in Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Salem counties. The chemical – 1,4-dioxane – is used as a solvent during manufacturing or industrial processes, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. It is also a byproduct of some consumer products, including detergents and cosmetics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Work to plug hundreds of abandoned oil and gas wells began in southeast New Mexico, amid the U.S.’ most active oilfields in the Permian Basin. The State’s Oil Conservation Division, an agency of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, got about $25 million in initial grant funding via the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed last year, hoping to redouble efforts to plug some of the about 1,700 wells believed to be abandoned throughout New Mexico on state and private land. Operations began Oct. 31 at a well east of Hobbs in Lea County. It was prioritized, the OCD said, as it was reportedly emitting large amounts of methane and hydrogen sulfide within 1,000 feet of local homes. Before the federal funds were granted, New Mexico was able to plug about 50 wells a year, but the OCD estimated the funds would allow the agency to clean up about 200 wells in the next 12 months. The money will also help remediate and restore the surfaces of another 50 to 60 locations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York will receive up to $524 million from drugmaker Teva to settle claims that the company contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic, the largest amount secured from an opioid manufacturer or distributor sued by the state, Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday. The state has reached a series of settlements with drug companies following an attorney general’s lawsuit in 2019 accusing them of deceptive marketing and failing to prevent the unlawful diversion of controlled substances. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and its affiliates were found liable last year for public nuisance charges by a jury on Long Island. To resolve the remedies phase, Teva agreed to pay out $313 million over 18 years, James said. New York will additionally receive $211 million from a $4.3 billion national settlement Teva agreed to in July if it is approved by state and local governments and tribes, according to the attorney general.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s health agency is weighing whether to challenge a judge’s order demanding that the state ramp up services for people with intellectual and development disabilities to allow more of them to live at home or in their communities. In 2020, Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour ruled that too many such people were forced to live in institutions in violation of state law. Baddour allowed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a plan to address the violation, but recommendations made by a consulting firm haven’t been carried out, the judge wrote Wednesday while directing his own remedies. Baddour ordered that at least 3,000 people must be diverted or shifted to community-based programs by early 2031. Separately, he told DHHS to eliminate before 2032 a waiting list of roughly 16,000 people who are qualified to participate in a Medicaid-funded program that helps them live at home or outside of an institution. A shortage of well-paid direct-care workers also must be addressed by the state Department of Health and Human Services, the judge ruled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An invasive and destructive weed species threatening North Dakota agriculture has been found in three more counties. That raises the total to 19 counties in North Dakota where the so-called “super weed,” also known as Palmer amaranth, has been found since it was first identified in the state four years ago, The Bismarck Tribune reported. “We think it’s a very significant threat to our growers and ranchers,” said Tom Peters, an agronomist and weed control specialist at North Dakota State University and the University of Minnesota. Palmer amaranth can grow as tall as seven feet, even as much as 3 inches per day, and can resist many herbicides, produce hundreds of thousands of seeds and become strong enough to stop farm machinery, according to experts. A heavy infestation can cut soybean yields by as much as 79% and corn yields by up to 91%, according to research by Purdue University. The plants were recently found in Kidder, Williams and Stark counties, according to the state’s agriculture department. The findings were confirmed by the National Agricultural Genotyping Center at NDSU in Fargo.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: An exhibit in Ohio is evoking Christmas memories with a display of historic storybooks, vintage toys and costumes from the sets of the “Brady Bunch” of TV and movies. The show, “A Storybook Christmas Featuring a Very Brady Holiday,” opened Tuesday at the Decorative Arts Center of Ohio and runs through Dec. 31. The exhibition marks the opening of the holiday season at the historic Reese-Peters House that houses the museum. Across five rooms trimmed for the holidays, visitors will be invited to step into the pages of classic Christmas storybooks including “The Night Before Christmas,” “Polar Express” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” Some children’s board books and pop-up books will be arranged with pages open for visitors to read, while others will be positioned along with toys under Christmas trees as gifts, replicating what Christmas morning may have looked like for the Bradys and other families in the 1960s and ’70s. Several costumes and props from the “Brady Bunch” sets have been incorporated into the display by co-curator Randall Thropp, who manages the Paramount Pictures Costume Archive. They include a two-piece pantsuit Florence Henderson wore in the episode where the Bradys travel to the Grand Canyon and a horse sculpture that appeared at the base of the Bradys’ staircase.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt granted another temporary reprieve to death row inmate Richard Glossip, pushing his scheduled execution back until February 2023 so that an appeals court has more time to consider his claim of innocence. Stitt, who is locked in a tough reelection contest, issued an executive order on Wednesday that delays Glossip’s execution, which was scheduled for Nov. 21. Stitt’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A clemency hearing for Glossip that was scheduled before the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board next week also will be delayed. Glossip received the death penalty for the 1997 murder-for-hire killing of his boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese. Prosecutors acknowledge Glossip did not kill Van Treese, but maintain that he paid the hotel maintenance man, Justin Sneed, to do it. Sneed, who received a life sentence but was spared the death penalty, was a key witness in two separate trials in which Glossip was convicted.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland City Council members voted Thursday to create at least three large designated campsites and ban the rest of the roughly 700 encampments currently scattered across the city. More than 3,000 people are living without shelter in Portland, a 50% jump from 2019, according to the proposal. “People on the streets deserve our compassion. They need our understanding, and many of them need our help to get off and stay off the streets,” Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said after the vote. “It is my personal view that these resolutions take an important step forward for the city of Portland to be able to do just that.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A measure to help the Pennsylvania Turnpike recover more unpaid tolls was signed into law Thursday, legislation that could trigger the suspension of thousands of vehicle registrations early next year. Gov. Tom Wolf gave final approval to legislation aimed at getting owners or operators of some 25,000 vehicles to pay their overdue bills for turnpike travel. After the law takes effect in two months, the process will start with the Turnpike Commission notifying registrants they are seeking to have their registrations suspended. At least a month later, the toll agency can ask the Transportation Department to start the process, and PennDOT said it will give the owners six weeks’ notice. “The customer is given several notices and opportunities to pay the tolls they owe before their registration is suspended,” PennDOT spokeswoman Alexis Campbell said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Police are investigating an anti-Semitic note left at the reception area of the Brown-Rhode Island School of Design Hillel Center on Sunday. In a letter to the Hillel community, Rabbi Josh Bolton said staff alerted both the campus police and Providence police. “I personally came to campus and met with detectives who opened an investigation into the incident. The investigation remains ongoing,” Rabbi Bolton wrote. Public safety officers, he said, determined there was no threat to Jewish students on campus. Hillel opened its doors Monday at 9 am. “While BRH takes any expression of anti-Semitism very seriously, we will not allow an incident like this to divert our focus from our core mission of building a flourishing Jewish community, and supporting the growth of Jewish students on College Hill,” Bolton wrote.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nChester: A man and his girlfriend suspected of killing five people in three states last year have pleaded guilty to two of the killings in South Carolina and have been sentenced to life in prison without parole, authorities said. Tyler Terry and Adrienne Simpson each pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and numerous other charges Wednesday in Chester County, according to media reports. Prosecutors agreed to not seek the death penalty in any of the five killings as long as the couple also pleaded guilty to two shootings near St. Louis, Missouri, and another in Memphis, Tennessee. All five deaths happened in May 2021, investigators said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The University of South Dakota received $552,381 to research the risk of emerging bed bug disease transmission in households across South Dakota earlier this month. On Oct. 7, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced seven universities were awarded $5.7 million to study populations at higher risk of being affected by home health hazards, like pests, injury hazards and asthma triggers. Those focus populations will be young children and seniors. Although there isn’t evidence that indicates bed bugs are transmitting disease, the goal of the “pro-active” research project is to identify if there’s a risk bed bugs could eventually be contributing to disease in households, said Jose Pietri, the USD assistant professor of microbiology leading the project.\n\nTennessee\n\nMt. Juliet: A Tennessee man who fled a traffic stop with an officer in the vehicle and refused to stop has been fatally shot, authorities said. The shooting happened after Mt. Juliet officers stopped a vehicle late Wednesday and asked the passenger, Eric Jermaine Allen, 39, to exit the vehicle, according to preliminary information from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Instead of exiting, Allen moved from the passenger seat to the driver’s seat and began to drive away, the bureau said in a statement. One of the officers attempted to stop Allen by leaning into the vehicle and gave commands for him to stop, but Allen drove away with the officer fully inside the vehicle, the statement said. The officer attempted to use a stun gun, but Allen continued to ignore commands to stop, prompting the officer to fatally shoot Allen. The officer was not injured. Bureau agents are working to independently determine the events leading to the shooting.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner revealed Wednesday that he underwent surgery and six weeks of radiation therapy during the summer for bone cancer in his jaw. Turner made the disclosure during a question-and-answer session after he delivered his annual State of the City address, the Houston Chronicle reported. Turner said he underwent nine hours of surgery on July 30 to remove the osteosarcoma. “Let me tell you, I have been blessed,” Turner said to applause. Turner missed a few weeks of City Council meetings while receiving his radiation therapy in August and September. His staff said he was undergoing medical treatment but did not specify what for. Turner, who has served as Houston’s mayor since 2016 after 27 years in the Texas House of Representatives, suffered a bout of COVID-19 last December.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The family of a Black fifth grader in Utah who died by suicide last year plans to file a $14 million lawsuit against her school, arguing that an inadequate response to reports of her being bullied over her race and disabilities led to her death. Attorneys representing Brittany Tichenor-Cox on Wednesday said they would seek damages for the 2021 death of her daughter, Isabella “Izzy” Tichenor. In a notice of claim, they said the school had violated state and federal laws, including those that require schools ensure equal treatment, provide educational opportunity and protect students experiencing homelessness. Notices of claim are required before people can sue government entities and the family’s claim said that the lawsuit will seek $14 million in damages. The notice of claim from Tichenor-Cox names Foxboro Elementary School in North Salt Lake City as a defendant, as well as its director and principal. It also names as defendants the Davis School District, school board and superintendent. They have 60 days to respond before the family can file a lawsuit based on the claim.\n\nVermont\n\nStratton: Game wardens are investigating a bear attack in the southern Vermont town of Stratton, the Department of Fish and Wildlife said Thursday. Wardens said the victim was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after the Wednesday evening attack and discharged from Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. Officials did not describe the circumstances of the attack, but said more information would be made public as it becomes available. Vermont wildlife officials said earlier this year that the state was seeing a record number of risky encounters between human and bears.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Seeking to learn more about the election integrity unit of Virginia’s attorney general’s office, the state’s chapter of the NAACP has put down a $20,000 deposit to fulfill a request for unit records. Virginia’s NAACP President Robert Barnette said there’s not enough transparency about the unit and he feels the price aims to discourage the Freedom of Information Act request, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. “Given the importance of fair elections, the attorney general’s stated desire for transparency, we would have thought he would want to make these records public,” Barnette said in a news conference outside the state Capitol on Tuesday.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: The Bremerton City Council on Wednesday approved unanimously a plan to expand property tax exemptions for developers who build affordable housing in the city. The city remains “far behind the curve” in attracting affordable housing proposals and is thousands of units short of the number of people who desire to live in Bremerton, City Council President Michael Goodnow said. “I look at this as one tool in the toolbox toward solving our housing and homelessness issues,” Goodnow said. While beefing up what’s known as the city’s multifamily property tax exemption program, or MFTE for short, Mayor Greg Wheeler and other city council members had differing opinions about the best methods of bringing new affordable housing projects to the city. For now, the council created new property tax exemptions of both 12 and 20 years for developers who devote a fourth of their units to those defined as low income under a calculation using Kitsap County’s average income levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A West Virginia elementary school principal has been honored as one of the nation’s top educators. Principal Andrea Trio of Madison Elementary in Wheeling received a $25,000 Milken Educator Award from the Milken Family Foundation on Thursday. Up to 40 elementary educators nationwide will receive the awards this school year. Trio is known for walking through the school halls singing with children, using music and other social-emotional behavioral tools to calm her young students. Trio earned a bachelor’s in music education in 2005 from West Virginia University and a master’s in educational leadership in 2014 from Hood College.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Madison Children’s Museum has fired a Wisconsin man with cognitive disabilities after he wore an Adolf Hitler costume over the Halloween weekend. The museum said the man believed he was making a mockery of the Nazi Party’s leader when he wore the costume on a busy street near the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus on Saturday. He was fired Tuesday night, after his costume was condemned on social media and by some news outlets, including the Jerusalem Post. The museum said in a statement that it fired the man after it “determined that his continued employment would create an environment at odds with our values and unwelcoming to visitors and staff.” The statement said the man’s costume was “completely unacceptable” and that the museum stands against antisemitism, bigotry and discrimination. The museum also said the man has cognitive disabilities due to a traumatic brain injury and that his work over the last decade has been supervised. “It is our understanding that he believed his costume to be mocking Hitler,” the statement said. The Madison Police Department called the costume “offensive and reprehensible,” but said wearing it was not a crime. Police said they told the man about the concerns his costume raised.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Sexual assault reports and complaints about equal-opportunity employment in the Wyoming National Guard have increased in the past year, a military official told state lawmakers Wednesday. While Greg Porter, adjutant general of the Wyoming National Guard, noted that sexual assault is a national problem, he told the state’s Joint Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee that the state ranks “among the top 10 in forcible rapes in the U.S.,” the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. State Rep. Mark Baker, R-Green River, said while reports in the Guard have risen – suggesting service members feel more comfortable speaking up – he still fears the numbers don’t properly illustrate the scope of the problem, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/23/mariachi-mass-water-cutbacks-maine-bicentennial-news-around-states/118462240/", "title": "Mariachi Mass, water cutbacks: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey is urging college football fans to get vaccinated before heading to stadiums this season. The first games kick off in a few weeks, raising concerns that crowded stadiums could help spread COVID-19. Asked about those concerns last week, the Republican governor said the remedy is for more people to get inoculated. “If everybody would just get the vaccine, we wouldn’t have a problem. Simply get the shot, then go enjoy your football game,” Ivey said after participating in an event with college mascots on the steps of the state Capitol. Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama’s state health officer, said the state Department of Public Health has issued guidance on sporting events including recommending spacing and emphasizing the importance of vaccinations. “Outdoor events are safer in general than indoor events, but having hundreds of thousands of people getting together during a pandemic is going to result in some disease transmission,” Harris said. “We hope people are vaccinated enough that that can be minimized.” Alabama coach Nick Saban has also been an outspoken advocate for getting vaccinated and participated in a public service announcement over the summer encouraging Alabamians to get the shots. The state has one of the nation’s lowest rates of fully vaccinated residents.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The city could see nearly a half-million cruise ship visitors next year after a new docking agreement was announced with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal between the cruise line and Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal came last week as one of the world’s largest cruise ships arrived, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. “It ensures they have a place to bring their ships and additional ships to Sitka for the future,” said Chris McGraw, manager of Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal. Halibut Point Marine, owned by McGraw’s family, is majority owner of the cruise terminal. The Royal Caribbean ship Ovation of the Seas, which is 1,138 feet long – or nearly the length of four football fields placed end-to-end – arrived Tuesday. Officials said the visit got off to a great Alaska start, with a bear walking along the dock as the ship pulled in. The ship’s arrival marked the formal completion of a cruise terminal dock expansion that McGraw called “phase one” of plans intended to position Sitka as a premier port in Alaska. The Ovation of the Seas, which can hold up to 4,900 guests, brought about 1,500 passengers to Sitka. There were fewer travelers aboard because of COVID-19 mitigation measures.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: After more than a year of silence due to the pandemic, mariachis are back playing Sunday services at Tucson’s St. Augustine Cathedral, where the colorful and sonorous tradition dates back a half-century and fuses Roman Catholicism with Mexican American pride. For the hundreds of worshippers gathered in this Spanish colonial church and other congregations across the Southwest, the unique sound of mariachi liturgy evokes a borderlands identity where spirituality and folk music have blended for centuries. “Syncretism is the reality of this land, the ‘ambos’ reality,” said the Rev. Alan Valencia, the cathedral’s rector, who grew up attending mariachi Mass in “ambos Nogales,” or “both Nogales,” as locals refer to the two cities of the same name straddling the U.S.-Mexican border about 60 miles to the south. “And that’s what we see in these mariachi Masses,” he said. “Faith and culture come together and grow.” The first canon of mariachi Mass was composed in Cuernavaca, Mexico, after the Vatican encouraged the incorporation of regional musical traditions into services in the 1960s. Called the Misa Panamericana, or Pan-American Mass, it features a specific order of instrumental arrangements, sung prayers and hymns, according to Dan Sheehy, director and curator of the Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 33 new COVID-19 deaths and more than 2,400 new coronavirus cases Friday as Arkansas reached a new high for virus patients on ventilators. The Department of Health said the state’s COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began rose to 6,614, while coronavirus cases increased by 2,407 to 431,507 total. The number of COVID-19 patients in the state’s hospitals dropped by 13 to 1,397, but only 19 intensive care unit beds were available across the entire state, the department said. There were 343 COVID-19 patients on ventilators, a new high for the state, while 533 were in ICUs. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University research data. The state’s cases and hospitalizations have surged in recent weeks due to the ultra-contagious delta variant and the state’s low vaccination rate. Only about 39% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated against the disease. The state on Thursday reported 9,143 additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines were given. “We must continue to work to increase vaccinations,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “Our children under 12 cannot get the vaccine and need our help to stay healthy.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Golden City became the first major city in the nation to require proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 on Friday for people dining inside restaurants, working out in gyms or attending indoor concerts. Restaurants and bars posted signs and added extra staff to begin verifying people’s proof of vaccination before allowing them in. “There’s definitely some anxiety around how it’s all going to work,” said Pete Sittnick, a managing partner of Waterbar and EPIC Steak restaurants on the city’s waterfront. He anticipates a slowdown in checking in diners, possible pushback from guests who disagree with the requirement and awkward scenarios where someone shows up without proper documentation. “The good thing is, if somebody doesn’t have their verification of vaccination, they can still eat outside,” he said. Mayor London Breed announced the requirement more than a week ago in an attempt to stem rising COVID-19 cases, saying she was worried the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus could disrupt the city’s economic rebound. The mandate goes further than New York City, which requires people to be at least partially inoculated for a variety of high-risk indoor activities, and New Orleans, which requires proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test for indoor dining or drinking.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper announced Thursday that he has a “breakthrough” case of COVID-19. The first-term Democrat issued a statement saying he tested positive for the coronavirus after experiencing mild symptoms and was self-isolating at the direction of Congress’ attending physician, Dr. Brian P. Monahan. Hickenlooper said he was “feeling much better.” “I’m grateful for the vaccine (and the scientists behind it) for limiting my symptoms and allowing us to continue our work for Colorado,” Hickenlooper said. “If you haven’t been vaccinated, don’t wait for the virus – get the shot today, and a booster when it’s available too!” Infections and illnesses can happen even after being vaccinated. Experts say inoculation could help make any illnesses less severe. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that newer variants of the coronavirus could be a factor in “breakthrough” cases. Hickenlooper, 69, is a former brewpub entrepreneur, Denver mayor and two-term governor who defeated incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner in the 2020 election.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A year after receiving a huge influx of federal aid for the mailing of absentee ballot applications, town clerks across the state are facing the prospect of not having enough money to do the same for Nov. 2 local elections. They told the Connecticut Post local budgets were set months ago, and there may not be additional money for printing, postage and office workers. Absentee ballots are supposed to be ready for the public by Oct. 1. “With cities and towns finalizing their annual budgets in the spring, town clerks do not have the necessary funds built into their current budget to cover the costs of postage and staff to process the possible increase in applications,” Kate Wall, president of the Connecticut Town Clerks Association, told the newspaper. The secretary of state’s office said a provision in the state budget allows people to continue to cite pandemic-related concerns to request using voting by mail or drop-off ballots this year. The $15 million in federal support for state elections last year, which also included cybersecurity measures, was a one-time event and is not available this year, the Post reports. A spokesperson for Secretary of the State Denise Merrill blamed the lack of funding this year on Republicans in the Legislature who oppose mail-in balloting.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Current and former students of the University of Delaware can pursue claims that the school breached contractual obligations and unjustly enriched itself by halting in-person classes and shutting down the campus last spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, a federal judge ruled Friday. Judge Stephanos Bibas said the students have plausibly alleged that the school promised them in-person classes, activities and services. “True, the school never promised them expressly. But promises need not be express to be enforceable,” Bibas wrote. “By its statements and history of offering classes in person, the school may have implied a promise to stay in person.” Bibas also said that, even if the university was justified in breaking any such promise because of COVID-19, it should not be unjustly enriched in doing so and may have to return the money it saved, if any, when it went online. The judge rejected the university’s arguments that it expressly reserved the right to go online and that the case involves claims of “educational malpractice,” which many states prohibit. Bibas also rejected the university’s argument that parents who paid their children’s tuition and fees do not have standing in the lawsuit because they had no duty to shoulder those costs and were not personally deprived of campus services or in-person classes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In a flash notice sent to all officers and members of the agency Thursday, the Metropolitan Police Department activated the entire force and postponed vacation days in anticipation of a Sept. 18 protest organized by supporters of Jan. 6 insurrection defendants, WUSA-TV reports. The rally, known as “Justice for J6,” is planned for the Union Square area of the Capitol grounds, the section of the west front encompassing the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial and Capitol reflecting pool. Matt Braynard, the head of data for the 2016 Trump campaign, announced the September gathering on Steve Bannon’s podcast, issuing a clarion call for his followers to seek justice for those charged in the riots two weeks before the inauguration of President Joe Biden. “As we continue to raise the profile of these individuals, it makes it harder and harder for the left’s phony narrative about an insurrection to stick,” Braynard said on Bannon’s podcast released July 30. “What’s going to define (the rally) is where it’s going to take place: We’re going back to the Capitol.” In a YouTube video, Braynard specifically asked rally attendees not to bring signs relitigating the 2020 election, including visible markers of support for specific political candidates.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The mayor asked residents Friday to stop watering their lawns and washing their cars immediately, saying water usage needed to be cut back because of the recent surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. The Orlando Utility Commission treats the city’s water with liquid oxygen, and supplies that ordinarily go toward water treatment have been diverted to hospitals for patients suffering from the coronavirus, Mayor Buddy Dyer said. “We acknowledge that the No. 1 priority for the liquid oxygen should be for hospitals,” Dyer said at a news conference. Since the 1990s, the utility has used liquid oxygen to remove the slight discoloration and rotten-egg smell that is found naturally in Florida’s water supply. The city-owned utility typically goes through 10 trucks of liquid oxygen a week, but its supplier recently said it would be cut back to five to seven trucks a week to accommodate hospitals, said Linda Ferrone, OUC’s chief customer and marketing officer. About 40% of the utility commission’s potable water is used for irrigation, so any strains on the water supply will be greatly reduced if residents stop watering their lawns, washing their cars or using pressure washers, she said. On its website, the utility said residents should prepare to follow the conservation measures for at least two weeks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The mayors of some of the state’s largest cities on Friday slammed Gov. Brian Kemp’s new order that aims to limit local efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. In an open letter, the mayors of Atlanta, Savannah, Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County suggested the Republican governor was putting politics above public health, and they defended mask requirements. “While Governor Kemp may find it politically necessary to hew to the course of others who live in the shadow of the former president, we are more concerned with the health and livelihood of friends we see in the grocery store, at the schools where we bring our children each morning, and who we encounter as we head into work,” the four mayors – all Democrats – wrote in the letter. “They overwhelmingly articulate support for the smart, tested public health measures that we have promoted for the past eighteen months.” An email to the governor’s office was not immediately returned. Amid a new surge of coronavirus cases that is straining hospitals, Kemp signed an executive order Thursday that says cities cannot require businesses and sports teams to enforce local pandemic restrictions. The governor presented the move as a way to protect businesses, saying some people in the state wanted to return to “lockdown mode” and close businesses.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s surging COVID-19 cases have overwhelmed its contact tracing efforts. Hawaii News Now reports the Department of Health recently expanded its contact tracing team to 313 people from 269 but still struggles to keep up with the hundreds of people newly infected each day with the coronavirus. In the middle of July, department data showed contact tracers were able to reach about 90% of people who were infected. The latest data for the first week of August showed they were only able to reach 62%. “One thing we’re seeing is there are a lot more people not picking up the phone,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, the Hawaii state epidemiologist. “That aside, we are seeing a record number of case counts in the state. Of course, that is a challenge to try to reach everyone.” A West Oahu hospital filled up Friday as the community faces a surge of COVID-19 cases. Jason Chang, CEO of The Queen’s Health Systems, said the Ewa Beach hospital has sent some patients to its sibling facility in downtown Honolulu. It has also asked staff from other parts of the Queen’s system to come help. The city has set up a triage tent outside the hospital with 25 cots. Chang said the hospital had 63 patients in its emergency room at one time, which is a crisis given the hospital only has 24 ER beds.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: Gov. Brad Little is directing $30 million to expand coronavirus testing in K-12 schools. The money is coming from emergency funds set aside by the Legislature to deal with unforeseen events, Little said. “It’s critical now,” the Republican governor said this month. “These school districts have got to have some resources.” House Republicans earlier this year killed a bill to use $40 million in federal coronavirus relief funds for voluntary testing in public and private schools. Little urged residents who haven’t been vaccinated to get their COVID-19 shots to help avoid disruptions at schools and the potential to overrun hospitals with coronavirus patients. He also said workers getting sick and schools shutting down because of coronavirus outbreaks and parents forced to stay home to care for kids and miss work could slow the state’s economic rebound. “Our workforce cannot afford to stay home because schools and day cares shut down due to outbreaks,” he said. “This threatens Idaho’s phenomenal economic success.” The Gem State has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation, with just over half of people ages 12 and up fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Masks will be required indoors throughout Cook County beginning Monday, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. The Cook County Department of Public Health issued the order Friday, saying it’s needed as new coronavirus cases continue to increase due to the more contagious delta variant. “We are in a dangerous period, with the delta variant surging, during which we must return to previous remediation measures,” said Dr. Rachel Rubin, co-lead and senior medical officer of Cook County Department of Public Health. “We have no choice but to mandate that people wear masks indoors to help contain this spread of the virus.” Illinois reported 4,904 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases Friday. That pushed the state’s seven-day average of new cases above the peak of a COVID-19 surge this spring. The health department order applies to all multi-unit residential buildings and public places such as restaurants, stores, fitness clubs and public transportation in suburban Cook County. Chicago reinstated its indoor mask mandate effective Friday, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker has already said masks are required in all schools. The mandate applies to anyone over age 2. Businesses also are required to post signs saying masks are required.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials have counted about 62,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines being tossed out in recent months across the state as the number of people seeking the shots has fallen drastically. That is about 1% of the some 6 million shots that have been given in Indiana since they first became available in December, but it’s a sign of the struggle that officials face in raising the vaccination rate. The state health department said doses can go unused by reaching their expiration date or a vial breaking, and officials knew eventually vaccine supply would outstrip demand. “We are taking every action possible to minimize wastage, including urging providers to use doses with the nearest expiration dates first and encouraging Hoosiers to get vaccinated if they are eligible,” the agency said in a statement. “In addition, we have been working with healthcare providers to allow them to order small batches of vaccine to have in their offices for patients and have increased the number of mobile vaccination clinics we are deploying across the state.” About 45% of Indiana residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, the 16th-lowest rate among the states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The city’s new mask mandate would impose the requirement on the University of Iowa’s campus, but the school will continue to strongly encourage but not require masks per guidance handed down from its own governing body, the state’s Board of Regents. Iowa City’s mandate announced Thursday evening goes against state law, said a spokesperson for Gov. Kim Reynolds, calling it “not enforceable.” May 2 guidance from the state’s Board of Regents says face masks are not required at the University of Iowa, Iowa State University or the University of Northern Iowa. Legally speaking, the regents could choose to make them required. The Board of Regents, as well as University of Iowa leadership, have not changed course on COVID-19 protocols ahead of the school year despite pressure from students and faculty to make them stronger, including mask and vaccine requirements or stronger incentivization. This month faculty and students sent a petition to the state’s board of Regents, and three faculty senate leaders sent a letter directly to President Barbara Wilson. Iowa City Mayor Bruce Teague declared a civil emergency and ordered a mask mandate late Thursday night. It applies to everyone within the limits of Iowa City when in public spaces where maintaining 6 feet of distance is not possible.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: Gov. Laura Kelly on Friday called for school districts to require masks and said she was contemplating an emergency declaration as hospitals buckle under the strain of increasingly young COVID-19 patients and as hundreds of students and staff become infected. “We really want people to understand that this is no fooling around,” Kelly lamented while speaking at Saint Luke’s South Hospital in Overland Park, which is brimming with patients. “This is an emergency.” The latest health department data shows 154 school clusters, with 1,889 cases. Kansas City, Kansas, Public Schools reported that 82 students and staff were infected in just the first nine days of the academic year, with 220 quarantined. The Turner school district began requiring masks after more than two dozen students were infected. The Wichita district, which is the state’s largest and isn’t requiring masks, has had “a few” COVID-19 cases since classes started last week, said spokeswoman Susan Arensman. She said the district won’t provide weekly updates on cases until next month. The school board for Perry-Lecompton public schools, where 16 students are quarantining, imposed a mask mandate Thursday night. “These are students that are not in school right now and cannot learn because of COVID,” Superintendent J.B. Elliott said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Top Republican lawmakers are promising to work with Gov. Andy Beshear to fight COVID-19 after a court ruling cleared the way for new limits on the Democratic governor’s emergency powers. Beshear’s allies said they’ll be watching to see if his critics follow through. Kentucky Republicans cheered the state Supreme Court ruling Saturday that ordered a lower court to dissolve an injunction that for months had blocked the GOP-backed laws. It comes as the highly contagious delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the state. The court’s decision “signals it is time for the Republican leadership to publicly put forth their plan to protect the commonwealth from this pandemic and the deadly delta variant,” said Rep. Joni Jenkins and Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the top Democrats in the Kentucky House and Senate. “We know what they don’t support; show us your plan.” The top legislative Republicans – House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers – said lawmakers are “ready to work with the governor, as we have for nearly a year and a half, and address what is a very real public health crisis.” The GOP holds supermajorities in both chambers, and Republicans accused Beshear of taking a go-it-alone approach in dealing with the pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Stressed with too little staff and too many patients in an unrelenting COVID-19 resurgence, some hospitals are pressing insurance companies to ease up on requirements that can slow the transfer of recuperating patients to other facilities. At issue are “Medicare Advantage” plans that supplement government-funded Medicare coverage. These insurance policies require extensive reviews and sometimes consultations with other doctors before transfers to inpatient facilities providing skilled nursing care, rehabilitation or long-term care. Some of these patients are clearly ready to be moved to a non-hospital setting, but the bureaucracy has them stuck in badly needed beds, said Dr. Leslie Dean, of the Willis-Knighton system in northwest Louisiana. “It’s almost impossible for them to move these people along in a timely manner right now because of these delays with some of these insurance plans, unfortunately,” she said. The delays are critical as COVID-19 numbers grow, but the issue doesn’t just involve coronavirus patients. The paperwork also can slow transfers of Medicare Advantage-covered patients recuperating from a stroke, a heart attack, or some other illness or injury that will need post-hospital attention. Statewide hospitalizations have set records almost daily through most of August.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: The pandemic put the kibosh on most of the state’s bicentennial celebrations last year, but Maine proved Saturday that it’s never too late for an old-fashioned parade. Riding in a 3D-printed boat created at the University of Maine, Gov. Janet Mills served as grand marshal of the pandemic-delayed State of Maine Bicentennial Parade that snaked its way through the cities of Lewiston and Auburn. Mills said the state has persevered in the pandemic “with the grit and grace that have shaped our state for generations.” “The Bicentennial Parade is another opportunity to honor the resilience of Maine people, to remember our history and to recommit to creating a better and brighter future for us all,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. The parade was held against a backdrop of a surge in coronavirus infections caused by the delta variant and an ongoing debate over rules put in place by the Mills administration to protect residents. Protesters opposed to the governor’s vaccination mandate for health care workers gathered on a bridge between the cities before the parade started to make their point. Some exchanged words with the governor’s supporters. Later, dozens of protesters followed the boat in which the governor was riding and shouted at her. Mills ignored them and waved to the crowd.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan, a cancer survivor, said Sunday that he’s received a third shot of COVID-19 vaccine, and he’s urging the federal government to make booster shots available earlier than currently planned. Hogan appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and said he received the additional dose this past week on the recommendation of his doctors. Asked if he wanted Marylanders to get the booster shot as soon as possible or wait the eight months that is currently recommended under federal guidelines, he said: “No, we can’t wait that long.” He said he’s pushing the federal government to speed up the time frame for providing booster shots, and he’s pushing for full FDA approval of the vaccines. He said many of those who have refused to get the shots have cited the fact that the available vaccines do not have full approval but are being administered under an emergency use authorization. Federal officials announced last week a plan to start administering booster shots to the general public beginning the week of Sept. 20. The recommendations call for people to wait eight months from their second dose, which they said was a judgment call about when vaccine protection against severe illness might fall. Some public health experts have said a booster shot administered too early won’t be as effective.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Masks will be required for all indoor public places starting this Friday as the city moves to contain rising coronavirus infections blamed on the highly contagious delta variant, acting Mayor Kim Janey said late last week. Janey’s office issued a statement saying the mandate will apply to everyone age 2 and older who enters a business, retail shop, club, government office or any other public venue. Janey said the mask mandate was being imposed ahead of the arrival of more than 50,000 college students from across the nation and a return to classes for more than 50,000 Boston Public School students. “There is nothing more important than Boston’s safe recovery, reopening, and renewal from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “We know that masks work best when everyone wears one. Requiring masks indoors is a proactive public health measure to limit transmission of the delta variant, boost the public confidence in our businesses and venues, and protect the residents of our city who are too young for vaccination.” On Thursday, Gov. Charlie Baker said tens of thousands of state workers will need to prove they’re fully inoculated against COVID-19 by October or risk losing their jobs. Massachusetts remains one of the most vaccinated states in the nation, with more than 64% of residents fully inoculated against COVID-19.\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: The Michigan Court of Appeals has granted a new hearing to a man who claimed his rights were violated when he was sentenced for a crime by video, a common practice during the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Christian participated and spoke during a hearing last fall in Oakland County court and had a lawyer present. But the appeals court still found problems. “At no point during the hearing did the trial court obtain a waiver of defendant’s right to be physically present in the courtroom for sentencing,” judges Jane Markey and Brock Swartzle said in a 2-1 opinion Thursday. Christian, 38, was convicted of uttering and publishing, a crime typically related to forging documents, and sentenced to a minimum of a year in prison. Judge Michael Riordan disagreed with the majority, saying Christian failed to show that the error “affected substantial rights.” “He has not shown or even argued, for example, that he would have received a lighter sentence if he was physically present,” Riordan said. Christian remains in prison for other unrelated crimes in Macomb County.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: St. Cloud State University and St. Cloud Technical & Community College, alongside all Minnesota state colleges and universities, will mandate COVID-19 vaccination or frequent coronavirus testing for certain student groups, according to a memo from Chancellor Devinder Malhotra. The memo, sent Wednesday to Minnesota State’s Leadership Council, said the system’s schools would require vaccination attestation for “specific student groups or populations that are in settings where there is close and frequent contact with others.” That includes students living in residence facilities run by the school system, those participating in intercollegiate athletics, and those required to by clinical or internship sites. Additionally, the memo said, colleges and universities could include other extracurriculars that pose difficulties for social distancing. As of Friday, the technical and community college hadn’t had conversations about student groups, though the school is limiting large group gatherings. Vice President of Administration Lori Kloos said extracurricular activities are being kept to a minimum but may continue in different ways, such as meeting outside or virtually.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: Two concert venues are now requiring guests to provide proof they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19 or show negative coronavirus test results. The Lyric and Proud Larry’s in Oxford announced last week that they would implement the requirements, The Oxford Eagle reports. Lyric general manager Lindsay Dillon-Maginnis said the regulations have been a trend nationwide for music festivals. “Promoters who have been in our line of work, we could see the storm coming,” Dillon-Maginnis told the paper. Not every venue in Mississippi is following suit. Entertainer Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit announced Friday that they would pull out of a show at the Brandon Amphitheater scheduled for October. Isbell said the venue would not require that attendees show proof of vaccination or a negative test. “Unfortunately, the powers that be were not willing to comply with the band’s updated Health and Safety standards,” a statement from Southeastern Records said. Dillon-Maginnis said there has been “overwhelmingly large majority of support” for the policy, with less than 1% of ticket holders requesting a refund. “I think what people see online or what you see in comments is vitriolic or negative,” she said. “But with those people, if you dig deeper, have no connection to the Lyric or Oxford or even Mississippi.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: New COVID-19 hospital admissions are reaching winter surge levels in the city, and southeast Missouri hospitals are under strain due to a surge in coronavirus cases and a rise in deaths. On Thursday, hospitals in St. Louis reported admitting 100 new patients with COVID-19 – the most since Jan. 16, according to the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force. A total of 585 people were hospitalized, including 25 children, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Twelve of those children are younger than 12 and not yet eligible for vaccines. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Southeast Hospital and Saint Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau has increased by more than 50% in the past week and a half, according to data released Thursday by both facilities. Saint Francis, which reopened its COVID-19 care unit last week, reported 39 coronavirus inpatients as of early Thursday afternoon, up from 25 just 10 days ago. At Southeast Hospital, the number of COVID-19 inpatients increased from 22 about 10 days ago to 32 as of Thursday morning, the Southeast Missourian reports. Statewide, the death toll from the rapidly spreading delta variant continues to rise in Missouri, with July shaping up to be an even deadlier month than earlier reported.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: While many large companies across the U.S. have announced that COVID-19 vaccines will be required for their employees to return to work in person, Montana stands alone in banning such mandates. Under a new law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this year, requiring vaccines as a condition for employment is deemed “discrimination” and a violation of the state’s human rights laws. Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a law like this for private employers, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. The law has raised concern among employers across the state as Montana struggles with a rise in COVID-19 cases that is once again straining the state’s health care system. Pushback swelled last week when physicians called on the Legislature to reverse the law. “This is against everything we’ve ever known or believed about public health,” said Dr. Pamela Cutler, president of the Montana Medical Association. “I believe it’s a travesty now, and it needs to be fixed so that we can make our offices safe for patients and our co-workers.” GOP lawmakers who supported the bill in the Legislature said it was needed in response to employers “coercing” employees to get vaccinations under threat of termination.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Nebraska Medical Center on Friday announced it’s reducing inpatient surgeries at the Omaha hospital because of the rise in COVID-19 cases. The change will take effect Aug. 30, Nebraska Medicine spokesman Taylor Wilson said in a news release. Wilson said inpatient surgeries likely will be limited through October. Nebraska Medicine is not limiting surgeries at Bellevue Medical Center or any other outpatient surgery clinics. Wilson said the rise in coronavirus patients, who need extra care and resources, strained Nebraska Medical Center. On top of that, he said, Nebraska is facing a nursing shortage. Nebraskans can help to ease the strain on hospitals by getting vaccinated against COVID-19, Wilson said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Half of all eligible residents are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, pushing the state closer to the national inoculation rate of about 60% for all people 12 and older, state health officials said. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said Friday that the 50% mark for residents 12 and up who are now fully vaccinated is an “incredible milestone to reach.” “We know there is more work to be done and we will remain focused on promoting vaccine opportunities throughout the state,” he said in a statement. Among those 12 and older, 60.5% have initiated vaccination, receiving at least one dose of vaccine, officials said. Nationally, 59.8% of that age group was fully vaccinated, and 70.4% had received the first of two shots as of Thursday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nevada’s 14-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases and positivity rate both declined through the week after a steady rise began in early June. At an emergency meeting Friday, the state Board of Health approved a vaccine mandate plan for Nevada’s public colleges and universities scheduled to take effect Nov. 1. The requirement will not affect enrollment until the spring semester.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House of Representatives will begin holding committee meetings on retained bills this week, without the option to participate remotely that existed during much of the coronavirus pandemic. In the calendar published Friday, House Speaker Sherman Packard reminded lawmakers that the emergency order allowing public bodies to meet remotely without a physical quorum present in the same location expired when the governor lifted the state of emergency June 11. That means House committees meeting to discuss bills that were set aside for more work must meet in person at the Legislative Office Building, which has reopened to the public. Packard said dozens of additional air purification units have been set up throughout the office building and Statehouse, and each meeting room will have air treatment that meets or exceeds federal health guidelines for office buildings. Masks will be encouraged but not required.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A group of parents wants Gov. Phil Murphy to remove the ban on virtual learning for the 2021-22 school year and provide a permanent remote learning option for K-12 schools. A change.org petition started by New Jersey Parents for Virtual Choice has garnered more than 17,000 signatures. The parents are driven by a variety of reasons, some related to health and safety concerns due to the coronavirus and the highly transmissible delta variant, said group spokesperson Karen Strauss. Some parents want to retain the virtual learning option from last year because their children excelled, she said. The petition asks Murphy to let K-12 schools continue to offer virtual learning for parents who want it and to create a permanent virtual learning option by approving free virtual-only public or charter schools. It also asks Murphy to meet with the group. “New Jersey needs to catch up,” Strauss said, referring to school systems in other states that offer virtual learning options. Strauss said she wants a virtual option for her 5-year-old son, who has asthma and high-functioning autism. She said he thrived during remote learning last year even though it took some getting used to, but her primary consideration is his health. “We already lost someone to COVID. I’m not risking him getting sick,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: About 150 people protested in front of the state Capitol on Friday, demanding an end to vaccine mandates for health care workers. Many protesters identified themselves as hospital workers – nurses, nursing assistants and clerical workers. Other attendees included correctional officers, retirees and children of health care workers. A state mandate requires nurses and other workers in high-risk environments to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and some hospitals have their own mandates. “I believe the vaccine is harmful,” said practical nurse Katrina Philpot, who was picketing along the road outside the Capitol complex with a sign that read: “Healthcare workers deserve rights.” Philpot said the hospital where she works in Rio Rancho is requiring her to be vaccinated by Aug. 27 or be fired. She fears she won’t qualify for medical or religious exemptions to the mandate. State employees, including prison guards, are required to get COVID-19 shots or submit to weekly testing. At least one prison guard has sued the state over the mandate. New Mexico has outpaced neighboring states when it comes to getting people vaccinated. About two-thirds of residents 18 and up have been fully inoculated, but state health officials have warned that evidence shows vaccinated people can still get infected and spread the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s public schools will require COVID-19 shots for student-athletes and coaches participating in “high-risk” sports including football, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, lacrosse, rugby and bowling, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday. The students and coaches will have to get at least one dose of vaccine before the start of competitive play, de Blasio said on radio station WNYC. Bowling, while not a contact sport like football or wrestling, is on the list because it is indoors, de Blasio said. Masks will be required for all students and staff when school starts Sept. 13, but while the mayor has urged all New Yorkers who are eligible for COVID-19 shots to get them, vaccination is not required either for school staff or for students over age 12. Asked about the possibility of requiring public school teachers to be vaccinated, de Blasio said: “We’re actively looking right now at different actions we could take.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Children now must get approval from a parent before receiving the current COVID-19 vaccine available to them under legislation that Gov. Roy Cooper signed into law Friday. The written consent requirement is contained in a broader measure that largely expands the medications or immunizations, including vaccines, that pharmacists trained to deliver shots can administer to consumers. It comes even as the U.S. and North Carolina see a marked rise in coronavirus cases due to a highly contagious variant. The measure, which received nearly unanimous support in the Republican-controlled General Assembly, also states that trained pharmacy technicians and interns can administer a COVID-19 or flu vaccine under a pharmacist’s supervision. “This important legislation will help our state administer COVID-19 vaccines more quickly and efficiently,” Cooper, a Democrat, said in a news release announcing the bill signing. Permission from a parent or guardian applies immediately to vaccines authorized by federal regulators for emergency use – such as the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer – and administered by any health care provider. State law had given minors the ability on their own to be treated for certain health issues, including communicable diseases.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Amid a COVID-19 resurgence, advocates are calling on nursing homes to require that all staff members get vaccinated, and a nonprofit tracking the latest data says there haven’t been enough workers getting on board. The latest COVID-19 dashboard from AARP shows that only 24% of senior care facilities in North Dakota have met the industry target of having at least 75% of their staffs inoculated against the disease. Josh Askvig, state director of AARP North Dakota, said experts don’t want to go back to last fall, when the state saw some of the highest coronavirus death rates among patients. “What’s concerning right now is as new variants are emerging, facilities cannot let preventable problems be repeated,” Askvig said. “We’ve got to increase vaccinations, and we’ve got to do it now.” The latest AARP dashboard also shows nearly 12% of North Dakota nursing homes lack personal protective equipment to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Askvig said the state should help to ensure they have enough supplies. As for the vaccinations, he said facilities need to step up in the area. “They’ve got the resources through the different relief funding to get it done,” Askvig said. “And so we’re encouraging everyone eligible for the vaccine to get vaccinated.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: While COVID-19 cases have reportedly risen nationally among children, that trend has yet to show up locally. Instead, another common virus has squeezed Nationwide Children’s Hospital in recent weeks: The pediatric hospital is dealing with a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus, which usually begins circulating more in the fall rather than late summer. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why RSV is showing up again now, but the coronavirus pandemic is likely the cause, said Dr. Mike Patrick, an emergency department physician at Nationwide Children’s. With everyone masking up, staying home and keeping their distance, RSV didn’t spread as easily in 2020. Now that more families are getting out and doing things, and kids are returning to school and day care, RSV is able to spread, Patrick said. “No one knows for certain what is driving this,” he said. “But being isolated and behind masks and then suddenly reintroducing people together really fuels the spread of these viral illnesses.” The spike in RSV cases is similar to what Nationwide Children’s usually sees at its peak in winter, Patrick said. But Patrick said he worries whether COVID-19 cases could also start showing up more in kids seeking treatment at Nationwide Children’s.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt is criticizing both a northeast Oklahoma school district that adopted a mask mandate and President Joe Biden over comments that the state’s ban on school mask requirements ban may violate a coronavirus aid package for schools. The Republican governor and state Attorney General John O’Connor released a joint statement Thursday criticizing the Hulbert school district for its mask requirement. “It is disappointing that one school district has chosen to openly violate a state law that was supported by 80 percent of the Legislature,” Stitt said in the statement. The district’s policy includes an opt-out option for medical reasons. Earlier this month Stitt praised two Oklahoma City school districts for mask mandates that included opt-out options for medical, religious or personal reasons. O’Connor said that the law is constitutional and that the state is fighting a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality. Stitt’s criticism of Biden comes after U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in letters to him and state school Superintendent Joy Hofmeister on Wednesday that the school mask ban may violate the American Rescue Plan that provided $123 billion to the nation’s schools to help them return to the classroom.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Managers from a senior living facility say a video posted to social media by a recruiter for the company saying she would hire unvaccinated health care workers does not reflect the company’s views. Shayna Hall, a recruiter for Salem-based Bonaventure Senior Living, a senior assisted living community with locations in Oregon, Washington and Colorado, posted the video on TikTok last month, as first reported by the Salem Reporter. In the video, which has been deleted from Hall’s account but can still be found on other posters’ accounts, Hall says she came across medical workers posting on TikTok about being fired or forced out of their jobs because they refuse to get a “brand new vaccine.” “I just wanted to tell you if you are a nurse, a caregiver, a med tech, and you now need a new job because of this, hit me up, I’ll hire you,” she says in the video. “I need nurses, caregivers, med techs in Washington, Colorado and Oregon. Take your pick.” While the COVID-19 vaccines are new, the research behind them is not. Scientists around the world have been working on vaccines for the SARS coronavirus for more 20 years. Hall’s video swiftly ignited controversy online. Many have decried the company’s willingness to hire unvaccinated employees to serve elderly and high-risk residents.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s unemployment rate dropped to a new post-pandemic low in July, and the labor force shrank, as payrolls jumped by nearly 29,000, according to figures released Friday. Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate dropped three-tenths of a percentage point to 6.6% from June’s adjusted rate, the state Department of Labor and Industry said. The national rate was 5.4% in July, more than a point below Pennsylvania’s. The figures come out as the federal government prepares to end supplemental payments of $300 a week to people who lost jobs or self-employment income during the pandemic. The $300 payments last through the week ending Sept. 3. In a survey of households, the labor force shrank by 16,000 in July, closer to 6.3 million. However, the number of employed grew slightly, while the number of unemployed slid by 19,000. The state hit a record-high labor force of almost 6.6 million just before the pandemic hit. In a separate survey of employers, payrolls grew in July by 28,800, to above 5.7 million. The state has regained about 65% of the 1.1 million jobs lost in the pandemic. It hit a record high for payrolls of 6.1 million just before the pandemic hit, according to state figures. The leisure and hospitality sector led all gainers, adding 16,000 jobs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s downtown arts festival has been canceled for the second year in a row amid rising cases of COVID-19, city officials announced Friday. PVDFest, a weekend festival that typically draws more 100,000 people to downtown Providence, was scheduled to make its comeback Sept. 25-26. But officials said it would be unsafe to continue amid high levels of coronavirus transmission. Mayor Jorge Elorza said the decision was made “after carefully considering the increased spread of the delta variant.” “Together we can beat this virus and return to dancing and celebrating together downtown next year,” Elorza said in a statement. Although the downtown event is canceled, smaller outdoor art programs affiliated with the festival will continue in the coming weeks. Officials said face masks will be strongly recommended. Rhode Island is averaging about 310 new COVID-19 cases a day, up from about 196 a day two weeks ago. The festival was started in 2015 and has featured more than 5,000 artists and performers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s health agency became the latest group Friday to ask lawmakers to make it clear that school districts can require students to wear masks without losing state budget money or facing any other penalties. The General Assembly put the mask ban item into the budget in early June when South Carolina was seeing an average of 150 COVID-19 cases a day. Ten weeks later, the state is seeing about 3,520 new cases each day. And that dire new case average comes before about 700,000 public school students completed their first week back in classrooms. Of the more than 5,200 new coronavirus cases reported Friday, more than 500 were in children 10 or younger. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control Board voted unanimously Friday to ask the state House and Senate to come back in special session to “provide local authority for mask mandates.” They joined the Republican state education superintendent, House Democrats, teacher groups, an association of school board members, a group of two Democratic and two Republican state senators, several school boards, and other groups that have asked lawmakers to reconsider the mask ban.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that she is planning to focus on water, sewer and broadband infrastructure projects as the state plans to spend nearly $1 billion in federal funds meant to help towns and cities recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The state government is readying to receive $974.5 million from the federal government over the next year and a half. Over the course of the pandemic, South Dakota has been alloted more than $4.8 billion in federal relief funds – a windfall that nearly matches the state’s annual budget. Under the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress, state and local governments must use the funds to respond to COVID-19. They can use the money for public health programs, addressing the financial fallout of the pandemic, replacing lost revenues, paying for essential workers, or infrastructure. The Republiacn governor said the state has “broad flexibility” in using the money. Meanwhile, daily coronavirus cases across the state on Friday topped 300 for the first time in more than six months as a fresh pandemic wave appeared to build. In the past two weeks, the state has seen case counts spike by 270%, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. However, the number of cases per capita in that time has remained one of the lowest in the country.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Bluff City teens have been leading the state’s surge of recent COVID-19 vaccinations. The 15-19 age group in the Memphis region showed the greatest growth of any age group across the state’s eight regions from late July through last week, according to a new study by researchers at the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt School of Medicine. Vaccinations among residents ages 12-14 also grew, according to the study. The increase in vaccinations comes as infections and hospitalizations surged through July and August, driven by the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The burden of new COVID-19 cases across the state is among the Tennessee’s younger populations, who are also less likely to be inoculated, researchers concluded. Findings show infections have grown the most among people in their early 20s. The two western Tennessee regions saw the greatest vaccination growth, according to the study, though each of the eight regions in the state saw growth in vaccinations beginning in late July. The state’s metropolitan areas of Nashville, Knoxville and Memphis have the highest vaccination rates in nearly all age groups, the researchers wrote. The lowest rates are among the Upper Cumberland region of Cookeville and surrounding counties.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The lieutenant governor blamed rising hospitalization and death rates from COVID-19 on unvaccinated Black people in comments that were quickly denounced as racist. Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick made the remarks Thursday night on a Fox News segment in response to question about the latest coronavirus surge in Texas, which is seeing its highest hospitalization rates since January. “The biggest group in most states are African Americans who have not been vaccinated,” Patrick said. He did not change course Friday, saying that “Democrat social media trolls” misstated facts and that he had used state data in his assertions. But statistics from the Texas Department of State Health Services don’t back that. Black people – who make up about 12% of Texas’ population – accounted for about 15% of total COVID-19 cases and just more than 10% of deaths. Patrick also told Fox News that Democrats were to blame for low vaccination rates among Black people, who frequently support that party, even though he believes Republicans should persuade more people to get their shots, too. But he also tiptoed around that issue, which has been sensitive for the GOP. About 8% of Texans who have been fully vaccinated are Black, according to state data. The resulting percentage of Black people who’ve been inoculated is unclear.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The mayor announced Friday that she had issued a mask order in the city’s K-12 schools as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus spreads. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she used her emergency powers to issue the order and plans to work with health officials to determine when it can be lifted. “As Mayor it is my responsibility to do everything I can to keep our City, and our school district, from going down the tragic and dangerous path many others are already on,” Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. The order came a week after the Salt Lake County Council overturned a school mask order for kids under 12 that the county’s top health official issued. Mendenhall said the majority of board members had privately told her they feared retaliation and urged her to issue the order. “Unfortunately, and despite all the evidence that masks protect children and the adults who care for them, this issue has become politicized to the point that elected bodies across the country, and in the State of Utah, worry about retaliation if they take stand as an organization,” she wrote. Masks were required in classrooms last year, but under a new state law, school mask mandates are banned. Local health departments can issue a rule with the support of elected county leaders, but anti-mask advocates have been vocal in their opposition.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state and Vermont Legal Aid have reached a settlement over the end of a hotel voucher program for some of the homeless population during the pandemic, the Vermont Agency of Human Services and the legal services group announced Friday. Under the settlement, eligibility for the general assistance emergency housing program will be expanded for people with disabilities, and a formal process will be created for applicants whose health or welfare would be at risk due to their disability if they were unsheltered, the groups said. Last year Vermont expanded eligibility for the program during the pandemic to allow more people to stay temporarily in hotels and motels. It ended the program for some in July and gave $2,500 checks to those who were no longer eligible. Vermont Legal Aid sued, and a judge signed an agreement extending the emergency housing for some people to show they had a disability and could remain eligible. “People with disabilities who are experiencing homelessness will now be able to access GA benefits even if they are able to work,” Vermont Legal Aid staff attorney Jessica Radbord said in a statement. “We believe this will protect some truly vulnerable members of our community from suffering negative health consequences as a result of being unsheltered.”\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: More than 200 University of Virginia students who didn’t comply with the school’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement have been disenrolled ahead of the fall semester. The move affected 238 students, including 49 students who were enrolled in fall courses, The Virginian-Pilot reports. That may mean that “a good number” of the remaining students “may not have been planning to return to the university this fall at all,” university spokesperson Brian Coy said. The students were disenrolled after “receiving multiple reminders via email, text, phone calls, calls to parents that they were out of compliance,” Coy said. They can reenroll if they comply with the vaccine requirement or file an exemption by Wednesday. About 96.6% of students have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to a news release. The university granted 335 permanent vaccine waivers for students with religious or medical exemptions. The university also granted 184 temporary vaccine waivers for students who couldn’t get inoculated but intend to get a COVID-19 shot once on campus. Exempt students must be tested weekly for the coronavirus and wear a mask in indoor and outdoor common spaces.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee’s announcement of mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for state workers comes at a time when the state ferry system is experiencing a severe staffing shortage. KUOW reports that in an Aug. 13 notice, Washington State Ferries Chief of Staff Nicole McIntosh said there were “an unprecedented 91 relief requests yesterday.” She thanked the crew members who helped cover for their absent colleagues. In response to the shortage, the agency canceled sailings and went from two ferries on the Edmonds-Kingston and Clinton-Mukilteo routes to one. Washington State Ferries spokesperson Ian Sterling said staffing issues have been a chronic problem throughout the pandemic, but that week was “as bad as it’s been, due to the labor shortage, due to people out with active COVID or having to quarantine.” Capt. Dan Twohig, the regional representative of the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, one of several unions representing ferry service workers, said last week’s staff shortages were an anomaly. A coalition of unions representing Washington State Ferries employees started bargaining with state officials last week over the implementation of the vaccine mandate. Twohig said the unions agree that the mandate is legal and will go forward.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Friday launched a second round of vaccination sweepstakes, this time with prizes aimed at enticing younger residents to sign up for COVID-19 shots as the pandemic continues to worsen. The first of six weekly drawings will be held Aug. 31. Registration opens Monday. All residents must register again for the new drawings, even if they were registered for the first series of prizes earlier this summer, Justice said at a news conference. The prizes include season ticket packages to West Virginia University and Marshall sporting events, ski lift tickets, and a 10-year supply of free gas. Also being given away each week will be a $150,000 dream wedding, a luxury sports car, a custom fishing boat, ATVs or high-end lawnmowers, and college scholarships for residents ages 12 to 25. The governor’s announcement came as the number of people hospitalized statewide from COVID-19 reached 447, the most since late January. More than 1,350 coronavirus cases had been reported statewide in the prior two days alone. Cases of the more contagious delta variant of the virus are now present in at least 46 of the state’s 55 counties, according to health department data.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOneida: At least three American Indian tribes in the state will put cash in the pockets of their members and employees to get COVID-19 shots. The Oneida, Menominee and Ho-Chunk tribes are offering a $500 incentive for vaccinations. The offer includes those who have already been inoculated. For the Menominee Nation, members ages 12 and older as well as tribal employees who are fully vaccinated on or before Oct. 31 are eligible. Oneida tribal members and employees have until Sept. 30 to show proof of their vaccination to receive the $500. Ho-Chunk Nation members have until Nov. 1 to provide proof. “We know that once we can get at least 75% of our community vaccinated, we’re going to be able to have that level of safety that we can,” said Debbie Danforth, director of the Oneida Nation Division of Health. So far, Danforth said about 5,000 tribal members, or about 30%, have been vaccinated, WLUK-TV reports. The rate for employees is about 50%. Marlon Skenandore, who had COVID-19 last year and is still dealing with its effects, said the incentive is not swaying his decision on whether to get vaccinated. “I’m just hesitant about the FDA not approving it and not going through its normal procedure, so I’m on the fence, but I’m leaning towards getting it,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Grand Teton National Park had its busiest month on record in July. July is almost always the busiest month for tourism in the park in northwestern Wyoming. In July 2021, almost 830,000 people visited, park officials said in a statement. That was up from 796,000 in July 2018, the second-busiest month in records dating to 1979. July was the first time Grand Teton topped 800,000 visitors in a month. Visitation was up almost 10% compared to July 2020, when the park had just reopened after being mostly closed by the coronavirus pandemic. Accompanying the tourism surge, camping was up 2.7%, backcountry camping was up 15%, and trail use was up 21% in July 2021 compared to July 2019. Researchers this summer have been studying the relationship between the number of vehicles entering Grand Teton and visitor traffic at key areas of the park, park officials said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/16/spaceport-america-police-cat-superdome-plan-news-around-states/39968663/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: The city is looking for a new slogan, and it won’t be “A little different.” The north Alabama community of 55,000 people is trying to come up with a new branding tagline, and a Birmingham-based consulting firm suggested it use “A little different.” City leaders liked the idea. Council member Kristi Hill says it seemed modern. But the Decatur Daily reports the public reaction was so negative that leaders voted this week for the company to try again. Hill says the town isn’t ready for something as edgy as “A little different.” Decatur is on the Tennessee River, and it has long been called the “River City.” Council member Chuck Ard says residents need to speak up if they don’t want to lose that identity.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Country musician Zac Brown has lost a bid to limit snoopers on his private property in the state, the latest case in which the desires of the wealthy or celebrity for privacy have been at odds with public access. The lead singer for the multi-platinum, Grammy-winning Southern rock group that bears his name had sought to remove easements allowing access along his property, but the bid was rejected by a planning commission on the Kenai Peninsula, south of Anchorage, KSRM-AM reports. “I’m not interested in the public coming up to my home, people snooping, walking up to my windows,” Brown told the commission. “I’ve had to sell property for this reason.” Brown’s log home in Homer overlooks scenic Kachemak Bay. Homer, with a population of about 5,600, is frequented by fishermen and free spirits and bills itself as the “Halibut Capital of the World.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A court has scheduled arguments Oct. 23 in former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s appeal of a ruling that refused to erase his criminal record after he was pardoned by President Donald Trump. Arpaio was convicted of misdemeanor contempt of court for disobeying a court order to stop his immigration patrols. A judge who had refused to expunge the conviction says that pardons don’t erase convictions or the facts of cases and that Arpaio’s clemency only mooted his possible punishments. Arpaio’s lawyers argued their client was deprived of his opportunity to appeal his conviction because the pardon came before he was sentenced and final judgment was entered, so the conviction must be erased. A special prosecutor says Arpaio relinquished his right to appeal his conviction when he accepted the pardon.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A plant-based food producer has asked a federal court to temporarily stop the state from enforcing a law that bans labeling vegetarian and vegan products as meat and advertising them as such while litigation is underway. Hood River, Oregon-based Tofurky Co. told courts Wednesday that complying with the law would have a “severe detrimental impact” because of the cost to change marketing and packaging. It’s not clear if the law has been enforced since taking effect three weeks ago. The law’s authors say it’s designed to protect consumers. Tofurky claims the lawsuit restricts commercial speech protected by the First Amendment. A spokeswoman says Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge is reviewing the motion to determine next steps.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 500 animals including lions, tigers, alligators and wolves will get new homes after officials announced a long-struggling Southern California sanctuary is shutting down. The Los Angeles Times reports the board of directors of the Wildlife Waystation in the Angeles National Forest voted this week to close after 43 years. The Department of Fish and Wildlife says it’s collaborating with the facility and animal welfare organizations across the country to relocate 470 exotic animals, including 42 chimpanzees. Officials with the 160-acre Wildlife Waystation were unavailable for comment. But a Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman said the sanctuary suffered extensive damage in a 2017 wildfire and during severe flooding earlier this year. The Times says for two decades, authorities have been scrutinizing the waystation for alleged environmental and animal-safety violations.\n\nColorado\n\nBethune: The state has set a new hail record, though the exact size of the hail that fell near the Kansas border is still being determined. Officials with the National Weather Service and the Colorado State University Climate Center measured a hail stone that fell at a home north of Bethune on Tuesday and was preserved in a freezer at 4.8 inches in diameter. That’s about the size of a softball, although it’s more oblong. Measurements taken by the family that recovered the hail stone after it was safe to go outside show it was initially a little bigger. The Climate Center says it will consider all information to determine a final measurement. The previous hail record for Colorado is 4.5 inches. The national record is 8 inches – the size of a volleyball – set in 2010 in South Dakota.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A pilot program in several cities aims to divert people accused of low-level offenses and who are homeless or have mental illness from the criminal justice system and get them treatment instead. The Early Screening and Intervention Initiative asks specially trained prosecutors to screen for low-level offenses – such as fourth-degree larceny or second-degree assault – and work with counselors in the courthouse to get the defendants treatment. If the person completes treatment, prosecutors then can decide not to pursue the case. The Division of Criminal Justice says the goal is to reduce the burden on the courts and find more appropriate, and often cheaper, outcomes for people struggling with addiction or other mental health issues in a state where police often file charges directly rather than working through prosecutors.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Big Brother wants to keep a closer eye on big rigs in the state. Gov. John Carney was expected to sign legislation Thursday that authorizes state and local governments to install vehicle height monitoring systems. The systems use camera technology to record images of motor vehicles whose heights exceed specified size limits. The legislation is aimed at making sure tractor-trailer drivers aren’t using roads on which trucks are prohibited. State transportation officials will have one year from enactment of the legislation to identify roads as potential candidates for the monitoring systems and conduct an analysis to determine the appropriateness of each location. State officials could then install monitoring systems on state-maintained roads, and local governments could adopt ordinances authorizing monitoring systems on locally maintained roads after notifying the public.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has defended its plan to house unaccompanied migrant children in the city. The Washington Post reports DHHS says unaccompanied minors were apprehended alone, unlike migrant children separated from their families. It says its wards have beds and access to meals, legal services, games and classes. It says it awarded Dynamic Service Solutions a $20.5 million contract this month to operate a 200-bed D.C. facility for kids ages 12 to 17. The Maryland-based contractor has applied for a permit to open the shelter and posted jobs for people to work with “unaccompanied alien” children there. City officials have denounced the shelter, and Councilwoman Brianne K. Nadeau may propose emergency legislation to limit the number of youths allowed at shelters.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The federal government is proposing to strip the tiny Key deer of its endangered species status despite what environmentalists say are continuing threats to the animal due to development in the Florida Keys, its only known habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says its studies show there is no more significant threat to the deer and has set a public forum Aug. 22 in the Keys on removing the deer from the Endangered Species List. Environmental groups say stripping the deer of endangered status would leave it at the mercy of further development. The deer, which grows to about 30 inches at the shoulder, have become a tourist attraction. Its numbers are estimated at about 600, up from as low as a couple dozen in the 1950s.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge overseeing a challenge to the state’s outdated voting system said that after years of inaction in the face of warnings about vulnerabilities, state officials have finally taken a solid step in the right direction. But she foreshadowed a looming fight over the state’s new system, writing that “it may be ‘like ‘deja vu all over again.’ ” U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg’s order Thursday prohibits the state from using its antiquated paperless touchscreen machines and election management system beyond this year. She also said the state must be ready to use hand-marked paper ballots if its new system isn’t in place for the March 24 presidential primary election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: University of Hawaii students protesting the construction of a $1.4 billion telescope are expected to have class options allowing them to remain on the mountain, a report says. The plan to start construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on the Big Island has been thwarted for weeks by a group of Native Hawaiian activists who say the construction will further desecrate a mountain that already has more than a dozen observatories. A list of more than 200 courses students can take either online or via distance learning has become available, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The majority of the remote classes for student demonstrators are offered through UH-Manoa, while others are offered by the UH-Hilo and Hawaii Community College. Course topics include Hawaiian religion, mythology, culture and language, Pacific Island literature, business, creative writing, and philosophy.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials are looking into how the Trump administration’s move to weaken how it applies the Endangered Species Act could affect federally protected species in the Gem State. Scott Pugrud, Idaho Office of Species Conservation administrator, says his office is reviewing the regulatory changes. “We’ve got all our staff kind of digging in and seeing what they are and what the impacts will be on Idaho,” Pugrud told the Idaho Press. Idaho is home to six endangered and 13 threatened species, including sockeye salmon and Kootenai River white sturgeon. Threatened species include Canada lynx and grizzly bears. Idaho’s Office of Species Conservation was established in 2000, one year after the peregrine falcon was removed from the endangered species list. The bird bounced back with a successful captive-breeding effort led by the Peregrine Fund, now based in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to the Illinois State Fair can see a plot of newly legalized industrial hemp growing. The Illinois Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday that 100 industrial hemp and eight CBD plants were planted next to the U of I Master Gardner’s land on 8th Street. Hemp production was legalized last summer, and officials in April made applications available to would-be growers. Agriculture Director John Sullivan says the two varieties of the cash crop are easy to differentiate. CBD plants need to branch out to produce buds for oils. Industrial strains are planted close together so they will grow tall with long, straight stems for production of fiber or hurd – dense, absorbent material. An agriculture official will be giving presentations at the hemp plot daily from 1 to 3 p.m.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The cemetery where 1930s gangster John Dillinger is buried is objecting to his body’s planned exhumation as part of a television documentary. Crown Hill Cemetery said in a statement Wednesday that it objects to the exhumation in part because it’s concerned that “the complex and commercial nature of this exhumation could cause disruption to the peaceful tranquility of the Cemetery” and people visiting loved ones’ graves. Dillinger was fatally shot by FBI agents in Chicago in 1934. WXIN-TV reports that Dillinger’s nephew, Michael C. Thompson, sued the cemetery Wednesday, arguing it should allow him and his family to exhume Dillinger’s remains for a forensic examination to determine if it’s in fact Dillinger’s body. That exhumation would be part of a Dillinger documentary for The History Channel.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A full weekend of international food and music is in store next month, with the 15th annual World Food & Music Festival set to be held at Western Gateway Park in downtown Des Moines on Sept.20-22. More than 50 food vendors representing more than 25 countries and culinary regions will be featured at one of the city’s premier food and music events. The festival will be open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Admission is free. The band Vertical Horizon, which had a No. 1 Billboard spot in 2000 for “Everything You Want,” will headline the festival Saturday.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas City, Kansas, improperly listened to recorded communications between inmates and their defense attorneys and willfully violated court orders during an independent investigation of the systemic practice, a judge said in a ruling that could upend hundreds of federal convictions and sentences. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson in a 188-page decision handed down late Tuesday also held the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas in contempt of court, saying she would impose monetary sanctions against the government as punishment for violating orders to preserve evidence and turn over documents to the court-appointed special master investigating prosecutors’ use of video and phone recordings at the privately run Corrections Corporation of America detention center in Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new state law requires public schools to display the motto “In God We Trust,” and one school district has responded with framed copies of a $1 bill. Fayette Superintendent Manny Caulk told the Lexington Herald-Leader on Wednesday that all schools in the district have been provided the framed copy to display. Parent Brittany Pike posted a message on Facebook saying she was pleased to see the back of the dollar bill framed at an elementary school last week and said her children “don’t feel awkward or excluded for not believing in any God.” Republican state Rep. Brandon Reed of Hodgenville filed the legislation that created the new law. He says he’s disappointed to see schools “spend time searching for silly loopholes,” noting the law passed with broad support.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The iconic Superdome, home to the Saints football team and a symbol of the city’s revival after Hurricane Katrina, will undergo a $450 million facelift, under a financing plan approved Thursday that is aimed at keeping the NFL team in Louisiana for decades. The 44-year-old domed stadium, which has hosted seven Super Bowls, will see its ramp system removed and replaced with elevators and escalators, club and suite levels expanded, new entry gates erected, concession stands added and access for people with disabilities improved. Construction is expected to take four years, working around football and other event schedules, but will be completed before the Superdome hosts its next Super Bowl in 2024, says Doug Thornton, a New Orleans-based executive for SMG, which manages the facility.\n\nMaine\n\nRockland: Pop artist Robert Indiana had $13 million in the bank even as his house sank into disrepair before his death, with pigeons living in the roof, water damaging books, rotting wood and the stench of cat urine, according to court documents filed Wednesday. Documents filed by Indiana’s estate allege that aide Jamie Thomas was not a selfless caregiver, contending he “improperly lined his pockets,” claimed as gifts more than 100 of Indiana’s works, and allowed Indiana to live in “squalor and filth.” Indiana, whose “LOVE” series is instantly recognizable worldwide, died at his home on Vinalhaven Island on May 19, 2018. He was 89. The documents, filed in Superior Court, accuse Thomas of violating his duties to Indiana. In the end, it took more than 1,000 hours of cleanup and the disposal of 8.6 tons of ruined, waterlogged paper to get the home in order, the documents say.\n\nMaryland\n\nOwings Mills: An African American school principal says he was degraded by a white Baltimore County police officer while he and his son watched an arrest. The Baltimore Sun reports police are investigating the claim made by Patterson High School Principal Vance Benton, who says he and his 15-year-old son were observing an arrest last month when the officer began “baiting” him, making belittling comments, such as asking Benton if he could read and insinuating that Benton’s son would be arrested someday. His letter to county officials says he’d never experienced such “degradation, disrespect and humiliation.” He wrote that innocent lives are in jeopardy from this kind of racial bias. Police Chief Melissa Hyatt says they’re taking the complaint seriously. The department denied the paper’s request for the officer’s body camera recording.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: An increase in the number of great white sharks around Cape Cod has forced a longtime charity swim race to be rerouted. The Cape Cod Times reports that Cape Cod National Seashore officials have denied a permit for the 32nd annual Swim for Life & Paddler Flotilla. The race was originally slated to start off Long Point Beach in Provincetown Harbor. Agency superintendent Brian Carlstrom says starting the race there isn’t in line with the organization’s “shark-smart” principles. Carlstrom says the agency made the decision out of an abundance of caution. The rerouted Sept. 7 race will be closer to shore. The state’s first fatal shark attack in 80 years occurred last September off Cape Cod. Another man was seriously injured in an attack last August.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: More than half of the state’s inmates who are eligible for resentencing following a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on so-called juvenile lifers still are waiting to learn their fate. An analysis found nearly 200 inmates, or about 55% of those eligible, haven’t gotten new sentencing hearings. As of early July, 86 of the state’s 354 juvenile lifers have been released. “We are not resolving cases at the rate that you would hope, given that the United States Supreme Court said these sentences should be rare,” says Tina Olson, an attorney with the Michigan State Appellate Defender Office. Her office is representing roughly two-thirds of the state’s cases. Prosecutors defend the process and say they’re thoughtfully weighing each case.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A conservative law center is suing state Attorney General Keith Ellison, alleging that a lawyer working in his office on climate issues is an improper political plant. Attorney Pete Surdo is working for Ellison under a fellowship with the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University’s School of Law. Minnesota Public Radio reports the center was funded by billionaire donor Michael Bloomberg to address climate issues. Doug Seaton of the Upper Midwest Law Center says the connection is improper and unethical. He also says the arrangement violates a state law requiring all lawyers in the attorney general’s office to be state-paid. But Ellison says the arrangement is legal. He says Minnesotans expect an attorney general who enforces environmental law, and he’s happy to accept the help.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s largest city will stop curbside recycling collections by month’s end. Public Works Director Bob Miller says the program is indefinitely suspended, in part because China’s demand for recycled materials has fallen. Officials say more than 300 cities nationwide have stopped curbside collections. Jackson is referring residents to private collectors and says it’s seeking drop-off alternatives. Residents will get at least one more curbside collection before Sept. 1. Miller says while the city has been spending $1.15 million annually for curbside pickup, less than a third of residents participate. He says Jackson will consider restarting curbside recycling when the marketplace “reorganizes itself.” Waste Management, which collects Jackson’s garbage and recycling, argues the city can’t cut recycling from its contract. Jackson officials disagree and haven’t paid for months.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state Department of Natural Resources and Missouri Central Railroad have more time to negotiate over a proposed 144-mile bike trail that would stretch across the state. Missouri State Parks said Wednesday that the U.S. Surface Transportation Board approved a request for another 133 days to negotiate an agreement for the Rock Island Trail, which would run from Windsor in western Missouri to Beaufort in eastern Missouri. The trail would run along a former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad path. The Jefferson City News-Tribune reports Mike Sunderland, of the Missouri State Parks, says the extension will allow the Missouri State Park Foundation to develop potential partnerships to support the project.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A federal land agency has purchased a large area of land from a state conservation organization, increasing the amount of public ownership in the region. The Missoulian reports the Bureau of Land Management signed paperwork this week to purchase 20 square miles in the Lower Blackfoot River corridor just east of Missoula. Federal officials say money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund was used to purchase the land, with future plans to acquire additional areas by the end of 2020. Officials say the goal is to reach 94 square miles in the Blackfoot drainage and return formerly public lands that were given away decades ago. Officials say any additional purchases will have to go through a federal review process.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials say hunters may begin donating deer to the Hunters Helping the Hungry program beginning Sept. 1 at 11 processor locations around the state. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says two more will accept deer for the program starting Nov. 1 and Nov. 16. Hunters pay no processing costs for the processing. The program is funded solely by tax-deductible contributions. Ground venison is distributed by charitable organizations to Nebraskans in need. Processors accept only whole deer in good condition to ensure a good yield of pure ground venison. Learn more about the program and how to support it at the commission website, or contact program coordinator Teresa Lombard at 402 471-5430 or teresa.lombard@nebraska.gov.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: The Federal Highway Administration has issued an environmental excellence award to state wildlife and transportation officials for creating wildlife safety crossings on special highway overpasses in northeast Nevada. The award recognizes nine safety crossings installed on Interstate 80 in Elko County between Wendover and Wells and U.S. Highway 93 north of Wells to reduce potentially dangerous vehicle-animal collisions. The overpasses are covered with native soil and vegetation to replicate the natural environment and encourage crossing by mule deer, elk and other animals. Nevada’s departments of transportation and wildlife worked together to identify the most critical deer migration and roadway-crossing points, including GPS collars to track the migratory movements of hundreds of deer.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The police department says it will install surveillance cameras despite a judge’s warning they could violate privacy laws. New Hampshire Public Radio reports the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire sued the city of Manchester over the cameras in June. A judge’s preliminary order Tuesday said reviewing the footage and using it to identify someone is illegal, though installing the cameras isn’t. Manchester police want to install the three cameras near City Hall because of complaints about crime, panhandling and loitering. A live feed would be transmitted to the dispatch office. While not intended for traffic, the cameras on Elm Street could capture a driver’s identifying information, such as their face or license plate, which the ACLU says is against the law.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge has put a temporary hold on a new state law allowing terminally ill patients to seek life-ending drugs. Judge Paul Innes of Superior Court in Mercer County signed the temporary order Wednesday blocking the law and set a hearing for October. Brought by Dr. Yosef Glassman, the suit seeking to block the law argues it violates constitutional rights as well as common law barring suicide. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the bill in April, making New Jersey the seventh state allowing the practice. Maine enacted a similar law in June, becoming the eighth. New Jersey’s law went into effect this month. Murphy said at an unrelated event Thursday that he will fight the suit, and the attorney general will put out guidance.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nUpham: Virgin Galactic has unveiled its digs at Spaceport America. The once-empty hangar in a remote spot in the New Mexico desert that anchors the taxpayer-financed launch and landing facility has been transformed into a custom-tailored headquarters where Virgin Galactic will run its commercial flight operations. Two levels within the spaceport include mission control, a preparation area for pilots, and a lounge for paying customers and their friends and families, with each element of the fit and finish paying homage to either the desert landscape that surrounds the futuristic outpost or the promise of traveling to the edge of space. Billionaire Richard Branson, who is behind Virgin Galactic, and former Gov. Bill Richardson first pitched the plan for the spaceport nearly 15 years ago, but there were plenty of construction delays and cost overruns.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: Visitors may now get a look at two rare leopard cubs at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo. Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon announced that the little Amur leopards made their public debut Wednesday at the Syracuse zoo. The male and female cubs gradually ventured out from private quarters into their exhibit. It’s a temporary one while the zoo works toward a new, more complex $400,000 outdoor space for the leopard family. The cubs were born June 19 to parents Tria and Rafferty. The cubs don’t yet have names. The zoo plans a vote soon. Amur leopards are considered critically endangered. They are found in far eastern Russia, where an estimated 84 remain in the wild, up from about 30 in 2012. About 250 Amur leopards live under human care.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMocksville: The police department is evicting its pet cat named Sgt. Butters, and some residents are mounting a campaign to bring him back. The Winston-Salem Journal reports the Mocksville Police Department’s resident feline needed a new home after concerns were raised about a pregnant woman who worked in the building and said she couldn’t be around cats. Officers had rescued the cat last year after it was seen hanging around the department. A Save Sarge Butters petition on Change.org was nearing its goal late Thursday. Sgt. Butters has been credited with helping to restore the department’s tarnished image after a jury awarded $4.1 million in damages to three former officers who said two town officials fired them in 2011 for reporting allegations of corruptions to state officials.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: North Dakota State Fair officials have decided against holding a tobacco-free day at next year’s event. The state Health Department and Bismarck tobacco prevention coalition had asked the fair board to designate Family-Military Day as smoke-free at the 2020 event. Fair Board President Gary Knell says it would be difficult to make a fairgrounds ban work. The board decided to continue following state guidelines regarding tobacco in public places. State law prohibits smoking in enclosed public spaces oe within 20 feet of doors, windows or ventilation systems of public buildings. The Minot Daily News reports Knell says even though the board denied a tobacco-free day, advocacy groups could set up booths at the fair to encourage people to go tobacco-free on the grounds.\n\nOhio\n\nPortsmouth: A man is crediting his dog for saving him after the man suffered a bad fall. WSAZ-TV reports Jimmy Hale fell off a flood wall in Portsmouth last week while walking Taco. Hale ended up passing out after falling 15 feet and didn’t wake up until the next day. Hale says he screamed for help, but no one answered. That’s when Hale says he heard a lawnmower and then footsteps. Portsmouth city worker Mark Puckett says he only noticed Hale because of Taco, who stayed on the wall until someone showed up. Hale was flown to St. Mary’s Medical Center, where he was still recovering Wednesday from pelvic and wrist injuries. Hale was reunited with Taco in the hospital Wednesday, and the two had an emotional reunion.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin has agreed to provide access to propriety research and other data to researchers at Oklahoma State University to help them find causes and treatments for drug addiction. Purdue Pharma announced the agreement Thursday in a joint statement with OSU. Purdue said it will provide OSU’s new National Center for Wellness & Recovery access to “research molecules and certain associated data” that will help with research into addiction. The company and its controlling family, the Sacklers, agreed earlier this year to pay Oklahoma $270 million to settle allegations they helped create the nation’s deadly opioid crisis with their aggressive marketing campaign. That money is being used to establish the research center at OSU.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The governor has signed a bill requiring eggs produced by commercial farms to eventually be cage-free. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Gov. Kate Brown approved the new law mandating all eggs produced or sold in Oregon must come from cage-free hens by 2024. The measure signed Monday applies to commercial farms with 3,000 or more chickens. The state requirements will give about 4 million birds added space and perches. The Humane Society of the United States called the law a “monumental win for hens confined in tiny cages in the egg industry.” Oregon joins a handful of other states with similar laws including California, Washington and Massachusetts. The newspaper cites reports that say cage-free laws provide an improvement for chickens, but most remain held in small spaces and cages.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMechanicsburg: A man is accused of putting people at risk by placing unidentified substances into consumer product packaging and returning the items to retail stores. Police on Wednesday charged 58-year-old Robert Keith Burns of Mechanicsburg with reckless endangerment, theft by deception and criminal mischief through tampering. The arrest affidavit says Burns wouldn’t tell investigators what materials were put inside of packaging for beauty aids and medication returned to stores or recovered from his home. He’s in jail, unable to post $50,000 bail. Burns doesn’t have a lawyer listed in court records. Authorities seized packaging, glue, jars and white cream from a search of Burns’ home last week. Police have said they are trying to determine what substances were used and haven’t fielded any reports of people being sickened.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: The state’s attorney general and state police launched investigations Thursday after a truck drove through a group protesting federal immigration policies at a detention center, which has since placed an employee on leave. At least two people were injured, one seriously, Wednesday night outside the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, according to the Jewish youth movement Never Again Action. The center is used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A video posted by the group on social media shows a black pickup that protesters say was operated by a uniformed corrections officer driving up to an entrance blocked by demonstrators. The vehicle stops before again moving forward. Protesters surround the truck, screaming and chanting: “The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBeaufort: A former commercial helicopter pilot has become the first female Marine to pilot the F-35, a next-generation joint strike fighter aircraft. The Island Packet reports Capt. Anneliese Satz completed her fighter jet training this summer at the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort. Satz trained in Mississippi, Florida and Texas over the past four years before arriving in Beaufort last summer to train in the F-35B Lightning II. A station statement says Satz’s aircraft is a supersonic stealth vessel designed to operate from short-field bases and near front-line combat zones. The statement says the 29-year-old Satz credits her history as a commercial helicopter pilot as what prepared her for a career in military aviation. She’s now headed to Iwakuni, Japan, to join a unit called the Green Knights.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBrandon: The state Department of Health and city officials are trying to assure residents the quality of the city’s drinking water is just fine. Concerns were raised after a doctored water quality report surfaced online that indicated unsafe radium levels. The report had redacted information about the company that conducted the testing, as well as the identity of the customer who hired the water quality assessment done. The state and city investigated and found the report posted online July 28 had been altered. The city of Brandon held a press conference Wednesday afternoon to address the issue and assure residents Brandon’s drinking water meets Environmental Protection Agency safety standards.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A local startup aims to use honey to help heal wounds, and Regional One Health is putting its unique product to the test. Apis is a dissolvable patch made of manuka honey from New Zealand and the structural protein collagen that protects wounds during the healing process. It’s the first product by SweetBio, a company with four full-time employees based out of the University of Memphis’ CommuniTech Research Park. SweetBio wants to figure out where exactly its product fits in the health care industry, a question Regional One’s health system is suited to answer thanks to the variety of patient scenarios it encounters. Regional Medical Center in Memphis, an acute-care hospital, is in that system. The partnership is the next step in Apis’ journey to becoming a commercial product, following its FDA clearance for wound management in May.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Area voters will be asked this fall to approve up to $3.5 billion in bonds to expand public transportation that supporters say could benefit more than a dozen communities. Metropolitan Transit Authority board members on Tuesday agreed to place the issue on the Nov. 5 ballot. The bonds would be repaid by future sales tax revenues. Federal money will also be sought for the anticipated $7.5 billion in projects that could extend three light rail lines, expand use of bus rapid transit in dedicated lanes and create high-occupancy vehicle lanes along most of Houston’s freeways. Houston-area voters in 1978 created METRO and approved a one-cent sales tax to support operations.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The University of Utah plans to spend about $925,000 to improve safety following the killing of a student track athlete on the Salt Lake City campus. University President Ruth Watkins had called for a task force to evaluate safety after 21-year-old Lauren McCluskey was gunned down in October by a man she briefly dated. The task force made two dozen recommendations, including improving building alarms, adding police patrol outside of night classes and hiring a chief security officer. The university is also rolling out a campus ride-hailing service. Students hired to be drivers will transport students and staff across campus. The university plans to have most of the security measures in place before classes start next week.\n\nVermont\n\nWilmington: A nonprofit created in response to Tropical Storm Irene is dissolving and donating its funds for local trail upgrades. The Wilmington Selectboard voted this week to accept more than $176,000 of remaining assets from the Wilmington Fund to be used for renovations of the Valley Trail system. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the money is meant to be used to enhance, upgrade and build the trail system with “family friendly” biking and hiking. The designated area spans about 5.6 miles between Wilmington and Dover. Town Manager Scott Tucker says the board’s next step is to plan the design for the trail system. He did not give a cost or exact time estimate for the project. Tucker says they hope to begin construction by next spring.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The widows of two state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while monitoring a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville are suing the state and others, blaming their husbands’ deaths on a “maintenance nightmare.” Amanda Bates and Karen Cullen filed wrongful death lawsuits Monday against Virginia, the Secretariat of Public Safety and Homeland Security and state police. Berke M.M. Bates and H. Jay Cullen had been monitoring the “Unite the Right” rally Aug. 12, 2017, before their helicopter crashed. The lawsuits say the helicopter was a “maintenance nightmare” with a history of malfunctions. Federal transportation safety investigators expect to issue a final report on the crash next year. A preliminary report did not offer a likely cause. Spokeswomen for the defendants said they couldn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Newly leaked emails show conservative state Rep. Matt Shea has had close ties with a group in the state that trained children and young men for religious combat. The Spokesman-Review reports the emails were first revealed in The Guardian on Wednesday, while Shea’s ties with Team Rugged also showed up in a video on Shea’s public Facebook page. “The entire purpose behind Team Rugged is to provide patriotic and biblical training on war for young men,” a man identified as the group’s leader, Patrick Caughran, wrote in a 2016 email to Shea, R-Spokane Valley. “Everything about it is both politically incorrect and what would be considered shocking truth to most modern christians,” Caughran wrote. “There will be scenarios where every participant will have to fight against one of the most barbaric enemies that are invading our country, Muslims terrorists.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFort Gay: The town has received a grant that’s expected to help transform a lock house into a community historical site. The Herald-Dispatch reports the FOCUS WV Brownfields Grant check was presented last week to leaders in Fort Gay. The $5,000 grant will allow the town to get an environmental assessment, which is the first step in transforming the Lock Masters House at the Big Sandy Lock and Dam #3. The town hopes to turn the lock house into a welcome center and community museum. Leaders also want to add a public river walk. Construction of the dam was completed in 1897 but abandoned in 1925. Currently, the locks are mainly used by a few fishers, but Mayor Joetta Hatfield says she hopes the site attracts more anglers in the future.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos accused a paralyzed Democratic lawmaker of trying to sabotage a new national role for the Republican legislative leader by publicly seeking accommodations for his disability. This “does not seem like an accident to me,” Vos told a conservative radio show host Thursday. “Everything they do is political and trying to make the other side look bad.” Vos earlier this year rejected Rep. Jimmy Anderson’s request to be able to call into meetings he cannot attend because of his disability and to bar overnight floor sessions. Vos told WISN’s Jay Weber he believes the timing of Anderson’s public appeal was meant to undermine the announcement of Vos taking over as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. But Democratic leaders made the request in February, and Anderson reached out to a reporter in May. Vos took over the new role 10 days after the story was published.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A new state park at a former launch command center for one of the world’s most powerful nuclear missiles has opened to the public this week. KGAB-AM reports the Quebec 1 Wyoming Historic Site north of Cheyenne opened for tours Tuesday. An official grand opening is set for this weekend. The former Peacekeeper missile site is located off Interstate 25 about 25 miles north of Cheyenne. Tourists will be able to go underground to the steel-reinforced concrete capsule. The site also features a museum. It’s estimated that the site will attract 50,000-60,000 visitors a year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/12/hoosier-caviar-glacial-burst-new-alamo-battle-news-around-states/39943229/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: A new ranking credits Auburn University with having the nation’s happiest college students, while the University of Alabama, its chief rival, is No. 2 at partying. The Princeton Review ranks universities in a number of categories each year, and Auburn comes in No. 1 this year in terms of having a happy student body. Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, is ranked second behind Auburn. The rankings list Alabama as the nation’s second-best party school behind Syracuse University in New York. The Princeton Review is a college admission services company. Its rankings are determined by student surveys on their experiences at 385 universities nationwide.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A Russia-designed floating nuclear power plant has begun its journey through the Arctic Ocean this month, causing concerns in the Frontier State. Alaska Public Media reports the 472-foot barge launched in St. Petersburg, Russia, and will continue along the coast to the Bering Strait separating that nation from Alaska. Russian officials say the plan is to dock the world’s first floating nuclear power plant at Pevek, Russia, about 1,250 miles from Anchorage, Alaska. Alaska advocates say they are concerned about potential radiation the barge could produce in the northwest region. Officials say the barge named Akademik Lomonosov is capable of powering a city about the size of Fairbanks and will provide heat and power to the mining region, starting in December.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: The Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center is asking for food donations via its Amazon wish list, citing “an unexpected change in policy” tied to an existing supplier. The corporate decision on the handling of damaged, donated food products means Southwest Wildlife urgently needs dry dog and cat food, which can be given to a variety of animals, including bears, coyotes, skunks, foxes and raccoons. The organization says this year has been especially challenging due to the large number of injured and orphaned animals coming to the shelter. Southwest Wildlife’s wish lists include Purina dog and puppy food products and Nutro brand dry cat and kitten products. Donors can purchase food through the company’s Amazon wish list, send food to the center or drop it off.\n\nArkansas\n\nMansfield: Officials say a series of escapes from the Mansfield Juvenile Treatment Center is merely a symptom of larger problems with the facility, the Southwest Times Record reports. Arkansas Department of Human Services officials say the facility, which holds mid-level juvenile offenders and from January 2017 through June was run by the state, has security protocols, a lack of staff training and a climbable fence that have created an environment that since December has allowed 12 youths on four occasions to escape. Department of Youth Services officials also lied to Sebastian County Sheriff Hobe Runion about the placement of a youth who had previously escaped from the Treatment Center. Treatment Center personnel since the beginning of 2019 have called the Sheriff’s Office at least 17 times for assistance.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Ana: Orange County, long known as a national GOP stronghold, now has more registered Democrats than Republicans. The county’s Registrar of Voters says there are 89 more Democrats than Republicans among its 1.6 million registered voters. The county between Los Angeles and San Diego was home to President Richard Nixon and long known as a conservative bastion. The parties each have about 547,000 registered voters, while 441,000 registered voters have no party affiliation. The ascendancy of the county’s Democrats mirrors a long-running trend in California. Today, Democrats hold every statewide office; dominate both chambers of the Legislature; and command a nearly 4 million edge over the GOP in voter registrations. Republicans have drifted into third-party status in the state, behind Democrats and independents.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Thousands of people have hiked up to a popular scenic lake using a new reservation system. The Denver Post reports that White River National Forest officials received five out of five stars on a shuttle service implemented in May from more than 95% of survey respondents visiting Glenwood Canyon’s Hanging Lake. Park officials say the system replaces a visitor parking lot with $12 shuttle rides from Glenwood Springs to the lake about 155 miles west of Denver. Officials say the goal was to improve the health of the trail and lake by moderating human impact while also improving the visitor experience. Officials say Hanging Lake has a daily limit of 615 visitors and has reached more than 40,000 hikers since the program began earlier this year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: Construction of the planned National Coast Guard Museum is expected to begin early next year. Members of the museum’s board tell The Day of New London that a request for proposals for the first phase of construction is expected to go out Sept. 1. The final design, which was approved earlier this year by the board, calls for an 80,000-square-foot, five-story, interactive, environmentally friendly museum on the city’s waterfront. Plans call for the Coast Guard’s tall ship, the Barque Eagle, to be docked near the museum at a renovated City Pier when the ship is in New London. The museum association has raised about $48 million in public and private funds toward the estimated $100 million cost of the project.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Private donors have pledged to replace a memorial plaque dedicated to a lynching victim that was recently stolen. Delaware State University official Steven Newton said the school would donate funds to help replace the marker. Last week a person noticed the marker to commemorate the lynching of George White was missing. White, a black man, was accused of raping and killing a white woman. A mob lynched him in 1903. Public Archives director Stephen Marz said private donors have also begun contributing to the replacement costs. The marker was erected in June. The memorial organizers say they began raising funds for the new, $2,200 marker shortly after the original disappeared. Delaware authorities offered a $2,000 reward as they investigated.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The first black woman to serve as American University’s student government president has won a lawsuit against a neo-Nazi website operator who orchestrated an online harassment campaign against her. A federal judge granted default judgment Friday to Taylor Dumpson and awarded her more than $725,000 after The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin and a follower failed to respond to her lawsuit. The judge also entered a restraining order against Anglin, his Moonbase Holdings limited liability company, and Brian Andrew Ade. After Dumpson became student government president in 2017, someone hung nooses with bananas containing derogatory messages on the university’s campus. Anglin posted an article about the incident and directed followers to “troll storm” Dumpson on social media.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: A wolf-dog hybrid that escaped from a sanctuary after jumping a 10-foot fence has been captured. News outlets report that something startled Eva on Wednesday morning at the Shy Wolf Sanctuary, prompting her to jump the fence. Sanctuary spokeswoman Cindee Woolley says Eva was spotted in the afternoon and shot with a tranquilizer but ran off before the sedation took effect. A news release from the sanctuary says calls of sightings to the Collier County Sheriff’s Office helped searchers locate the wolf-dog Wednesday evening. Woolley says Eva has been placed in a roofed enclosure to prevent any future escapes. Eva weighs about 60 to 70 pounds and is owned by Miami residents who had boarded her at the sanctuary days before her escape.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A court order has stopped demolition after it had already begun on a downtown building where the first country hit song is believed to have been recorded. Part of the building was knocked down Thursday before crews learned a Fulton County judge issued a temporary restraining order. News outlets report the ruling by Judge Shawn Ellen LaGrua will halt further demolition until a hearing Aug. 29. A developer plans to build a 21-story, Margaritaville-themed hotel and restaurant near where the building currently stands. Atlanta resident and architect Kyle Kessler sued the city, claiming it didn’t allow for due process in deciding to demolish the building. The city says it followed proper zoning procedures. Fiddlin’ John Carson likely recorded “Little Log Cabin in the Lane” in the building in 1923.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Experts say two native bird populations have declined by more than half and could face extinction. Hawaii News Now reports Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project discovered 312 Maui parrotbills and 2,411 crested honeycreepers remain in the wild. Experts say a new monitoring report conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey and other wildlife agencies reveals that is 50% less than previous population estimates. Wildlife officials say studies over several decades found multiple threats to these two bird species, including disease and habitat degradation. Experts say there are plans to reintroduce the parrotbills to the Nakula Natural Area Reserve in southwest Maui in order to boost the endangered species’ numbers. Officials say more than 200,000 native plants were planted in forest reserves since 2013 in preparation for the reintroduction.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Central Idaho ranch owners want construction of a trail connecting the popular tourist destinations of Redfish Lake and Stanley stopped and additional work to make it a smooth path for hikers and bikers prohibited. Sawtooth Mountain Ranch owners David Boren and Lynn Arnone have been fighting construction of the trail with a federal lawsuit against the U.S. government and on Thursday filed new documents contending the proposed trail violates terms of an easement. The U.S. Forest Service has a conservation easement deed dating to 2005 that allows a trail 30 feet wide to cross about 1.5 miles of private property. The lawsuit recognizes that an easement exists but contends it doesn’t allow the Forest Service to bring in machinery to create or maintain an improved trail for recreationists.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has signed legislation he says will remove a barrier for teacher candidates and help address a statewide shortage of teachers. The new law eliminates a requirement that teacher candidates pass a test of basic skills to get an educator license. Supporters say the test was unnecessary because admission to a teacher preparation program already demonstrates that candidates have basic academic skills. It also required candidates to demonstrate skills that weren’t related to the grade or subject they intended to teach. The test cost more than $60. The Illinois State Board of Education says more than 1,400 classroom positions were unfilled at the start of the last school year. The new law means about 1,300 teaching candidates will be able to start student teaching this fall.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In the past two decades, the state’s little-known caviar industry has pumped millions of dollars – one $25 ounce at a time – into the economies of some of southern Indiana’s poorest counties. But the windfall could soon come to an end. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is considering a proposal to stop sanctioning commercial fishing for roe-bearing species, a move that officials say will end decades of overfishing but that some decry as a case of government excess. If approved, the plan would mark the end for a Hoosier industry that is probably better known for the publicity surrounding a series of poaching stings than for the valuable eggs fishermen harvest from American paddlefish and shovelnose sturgeon.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: Court records show a newspaper carrier helped save a woman caught in a sex trafficking ring. One of the Des Moines Register’s delivery workers, Lavon Franz, was on her paper route early the morning of July 28 in Ankeny when she saw a woman waving her arms on the side of the road. When Franz pulled over, the woman – who had no cellphone or ID – was crying and said she wanted to go back home to a small town about an hour northwest of Ankeny. Franz took the woman to a convenience store, where an employee called police. Police arrested a 25-year-old woman from East Dubuque, Illinois, on suspicion of pimping and human trafficking. Police say Walters scheduled times for men to pay the rescued woman and others for sex at hotels in Ankeny.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to begin moving inmates to a private prison in Arizona by the end of the summer to help relieve crowding in state prisons. The state Department of Corrections announced Friday that it has signed a contract with Nashville, Tennessee-based CoreCivic that calls for moving up to 360 inmates to CoreCivic’s Saguaro Correctional Facility by the end of the year. Kansas has about 10,000 prison inmates, about 100 more than the listed capacity for its facilities. The department is housing more than 100 inmates in county jails. The state budget includes $16.4 million to put 600 male inmates in county jails or out-of-state prisons. But legislative leaders have had misgivings about using private prisons and in June blocked $6.6 million of the funding in June over that possibility.\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green: The city has been named one of the nation’s top destinations for bachelor parties. In Men’s Journal’s recent list of the 25 best bachelor party destinations in America, Bowling Green is No. 2. First, the group can take a trip to the National Corvette Museum to check out more than 80 variations of the classic American sports car. While a museum might not be what every groom has in mind for his last party as a single man, this museum also has a giant sinkhole containing even more cars. Once the crew have had their car fix, a little spelunking is in order. Men’s Journal recommends heading to Mammoth Cave National Park to explore the world’s longest cave system, about a 35-minute drive from Bowling Green.\n\nLouisiana\n\nRockefeller Wildlife Refuge: The state will build 3 miles of breakwaters to protect a wildlife refuge where the shoreline is rapidly eroding and the bottom is extremely soft. A news release says the new work adds to 4 miles of breakwaters already sheltering the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in southwest Louisiana. Like the earlier one, the new breakwater will have a core of 10-foot-long geotextile “pillows” filled with very light clay baked at extremely high temperatures. A study in 2011 found that such breakwaters can be built higher than all-rock construction on soft water bottom, making them much better at preventing erosion. The $18 million cost includes $5 million of the state surplus and $4.3 million from Cameron Parish disaster block grants, with the rest in matching funds from BP oil spill penalties.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A survey indicates the cruise ship industry is an important source of return visitors to the state. The survey found that cruise ship passengers don’t make a huge economic impact during their brief visits ashore but that 1 in 3 of them plans to return in the near future. The Portland Press Herald reports the Maine Office of Tourism commissioned the survey to get a reading of passengers’ experiences, perceptions and spending. A Portland-based tourism research group talked to more than 2,500 passengers and crew across nine ports from July to November. CruiseMaine Director Sarah Flink says it was important to have a “baseline understanding of the demographics.” About 400,000 cruise visitors sailed on ships to Maine, spending $29 million. Passengers spent about $70 on average during their visits ashore.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city’s police commissioner has named a senior FBI agent as the head of the department’s Public Integrity Bureau, which oversees officer misconduct investigations and has faced criticism in the past. Michael Harrison introduced Brian Nadeau on Thursday. He has been the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Baltimore Field Office. Nadeau handled organized crime investigations for the FBI and led the agency’s public corruption unit. At a news conference, Harrison told outlets Nadeau is “quite familiar” with Baltimore and the challenges facing the department. A recent investigation by The Baltimore Sun revealed the department failed to investigate misconduct complaints soon enough, causing about 75 cases to expire without conclusions since 2016.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNick Cocchi is sheriff of Hampden County in western Massachusetts. His name was incorrect in a previous version.\n\nSpringfield: Officials are embracing a controversial tactic amid a dramatic spike in fatal overdoses – sending men to jail for court-ordered addiction treatment. Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi has designated a jail wing for the treatment of men civilly committed for substance abuse reasons. Cocchi and his supporters say the year-old program, which is the only one of its kind in western Massachusetts, is key to curbing the county’s opioid problem. Fatal overdoses have surged more than 80% in Hampden County even as they’ve declined statewide. But Bonnie Tenneriello, of Prisoners’ Legal Services, says forcing people into correctional facilities for treatment only stigmatizes addiction. The civil rights group is suing the state to end the practice. A state commission also recently recommended ending it.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: The University of Michigan will install locks on all classroom and lab doors inside a building where reports of an active shooter triggered campuswide panic last spring. The active shooter alert occurred in March when a sorority held an event featuring balloon popping at the same time as a vigil nearby for victims of the deadly New Zealand mosque shooting. The university said Wednesday that the changes at Mason Hall will help university faculty, staff and students facilitate a faster lockdown in the case of an emergency. MLive reports that the installation is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The project is expected to give the university a better idea of what types of locks are needed inside some of the campus’ more historic buildings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRoseau: Local officials say they’re not optimistic about a return to normal hours at two customs stations used by many residents on both sides of the state’s border with Canada who had built their lives around the old order of easy crossings. U.S. Customs and Border Protection cut the hours of the stations in Roseau and Lancaster in January 2018 as it shifted officers to the Mexican border. The Border Patrol now says many of those officers are being sent home. But Roseau city planner Todd Peterson tells Minnesota Public Radio that Border Patrol officials have told him that officers returning north will be channeled to crossings viewed as more important than Roseau. And he says he doesn’t think local officials can do much to change their minds.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A pizza shop is offering free pies for immigrants and refugees in response to immigration raids at seven poultry plants elsewhere in the state. Dodo Pizza owner Alena Tikhova tells WMC-TV she’s making the offer because she moved from Russia four years ago and wants to offset “hate and cruelty” that she sees against people from abroad. The Oxford pizza store is offering a free medium pizza though Aug. 18 to anyone from another country. Tikhova says the offer is a statement of compassion, saying the 680 arrests by immigration officials “doesn’t feel right to me as a human being.” The owner says Dodo Pizza has given free pizzas to first responders and government workers during past shutdowns, and she plans future donations.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Washington University plans to open a center aimed at becoming a national leader in research and learning on the issue of race. St. Louis Public Radio reports the Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity & Equity will open in October. The idea for the center emerged in the aftermath of unrest in nearby Ferguson after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, by a white police officer in 2014. The officer was not charged, but the resulting protests shone a light on how police in Ferguson and other areas targeted blacks and how courts profited from fines and court costs largely borne by blacks. Washington University’s provost and a professor of law, Adrienne Davis, will lead the center as founding director.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Forest Service officials have proposed increasing prices and charging new fees for rental cabins and campgrounds in the Lolo National Forest. The Missoulian reports the federal agency aims to bring the income at sites in the forest in line with the cost of services. The changes include increasing lookouts and cabins that cost $30 to $80 per night up to $45 to $115 per night. Campgrounds would increase to $10 to $20 depending on the site. Forest implementation staff officer Chris James says the new and higher fees are expected to bring in about $250,000 each year. He says about 95% of the fees are directed back into maintaining the forest. The agency is taking public comment on the proposal through Sept. 30.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state Supreme Court on Friday upheld the dismissal of a unique lawsuit brought by a group of tanning salon owners who had claimed the Nebraska Cancer Coalition defamed them and hurt their businesses with an anti-indoor tanning message. The business owners, who operated some 30 tanning salons in Omaha and Lincoln, sued in 2015 after the coalition launched its “The Bed is Dead” campaign, which includes a website and ads that link tanning bed use to skin cancer. The campaign makes such claims as, “Tanning before age 35 raises your risk of melanoma by nearly 60%.” The lawsuit says the campaign not only defamed the salons but also violated the Nebraska Deceptive Trade Practices Act. But the high court in its unanimous decision agreed with a Douglas County District Court judge’s dismissal of the lawsuit last year, saying a defamation claim requires more than general criticisms of an industry.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Transportation officials are marking what they call “substantial completion” of three years of work on a $1 billion upgrade of the state’s busiest freeway near downtown and the Las Vegas Strip. Gov. Steve Sisolak declared at a Thursday ceremony that the work dubbed “Project Neon” will improve safety and reduce congestion and commuter delays. Workers widened a crucial 4 miles of Interstate 15 between Sahara Avenue and the busy “Spaghetti Bowl” interchange with U.S. 95, and they installed new overpasses and 42 electronic signs to notify motorists of traffic snarls and road hazards. Officials call the highway the busiest in Nevada, carrying 300,000 vehicles a day. They say traffic is expected to double by 2040.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has vetoed a bill that would have re-established and raised the state’s minimum wage, saying it would have had a detrimental effect on workers. The state currently relies on the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, the lowest in New England. The Legislature’s bill would have set it at $10 per hour in 2020 and $12 per hour in 2022. Sununu said according to studies, other states and cities that have artificially raised the minimum wage have seen take-home pay decline because minimum-wage workers have their hours cut or their jobs eliminated. The National Federation of Independent Business in New Hampshire supported Sununu, saying many small businesses can’t afford the increased labor costs. Rep. Brian Sullivan, D-Grantham, said it’s impossible for a couple to live on two 40-hour jobs at $7.25 per hour.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWestfield: A house whose current owners were scared off the property by a series of threatening letters has sold for $400,000 less than the owners paid. Derek and Maria Broaddus bought the Westfield home for $1,355,657 in 2014 but didn’t move in after receiving the first of four letters from the anonymous writer. NJ.com reports Andrew and Allison Carr purchased it for $959,360. It was originally listed for $1.25 million in 2016. Andrew Carr declined comment. In a series of letters, the writer asked if the Broadduses were bringing “young blood” into the home and asked the names of their two children. The Broadduses claimed the writer had a “mentally disturbed fixation” on the home. The writer was never found. A judge threw out lawsuits stemming from the purchase.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A smattering of heroin hotspots dotted an online map of the state’s largest city Friday as officials announced the new mapping tool, saying they plan to use it to track drug-use migration across the area. At a news conference, Bernalillo County officials said the GIS map will show the public where used needles and syringes have been collected by county cleanup crews and volunteer groups in Albuquerque and elsewhere across their jurisdiction. It also will show how many needles have been picked up at a single location, providing data that officials say can be used to make sound policy decisions and learn more about the habits of drug users. On Friday, a cleanup crew of mostly county workers gathered at an abandoned property in northeast Albuquerque, where they collected 84 needles – the first batch to be logged in real-time – into the GIS map at bernco.gov/needles.\n\nNew York\n\nMacedon: Singer Alicia Keys and music producer husband Swizz Beats are planning to create a performing arts center in upstate New York. The couple’s proposal to transform an industrial site in rural Macedon was introduced at a town board meeting Thursday. Linda Shaw, an attorney for Keys and her husband, whose real name is Kasseem Dean, says the project will repurpose three vacant buildings to include a classroom, an office building, an art exhibit hall and a performing arts center. The Democrat and Chronicle reports the center is a part of The Dean Collection, the couple’s organization that focuses on supporting artists. Town engineer Scott Allen called the proposal exciting. Shaw says she is scheduled to appear before the city’s planning board Aug. 19.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has a new law focused on ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft that supporters contend will improve safety for both passengers and drivers. Gov. Roy Cooper said Friday that he’s signed a bill that cleared the General Assembly unanimously last month. The bill’s impetus was the death of a University of South Carolina student who police say was killed after getting into a car driven by a man posing as an Uber driver. The law makes impersonating a ride-hailing driver a crime while increasing the penalty for assaulting a genuine ride-hailing driver. Starting in October, ride-hailing cars must have front license tag numbers. By next summer, they’ll have to display their company’s logo to be clearly seen day and night, although alternative signage is possible.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The huge white tube between Washburn and Underwood that once carried coal over U.S. Highway 83 is coming down. The Bismarck Tribune reports the tube that for decades served as a landmark along the road in central North Dakota is being removed Monday. It’s part of a 3-mile conveyor that the Falkirk Mining Co. installed in 1992 to transport coal from its mining operations east of the highway to its handling facilities on the west side. The company last used the conveyor in 2001. In the years since, Falkirk has relied on large trucks, which can each haul more than 200 tons of coal. The vehicles pass underneath the highway to Great River Energy’s Coal Creek Station. The power plant burns it to generate electricity.\n\nOhio\n\nWilberforce: A historically black university is advancing its plans to become the first public institution in the state to conduct hemp research. Central State University announced Thursday it’s received $7.1 million in contributions toward current initiatives, including its new hemp research program. The sum includes a single record-setting private donation of $2 million from philanthropist Frank Murphy. President Cynthia Jackson-Hammond says Central State is the only Ohio public university planting seeds for research into hemp, a strain of the cannabis plant used for fiber and cannabidiol, or CBD. Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill last month legalizing cultivation of industrial hemp and the manufacture and sale of CBD products. The next day, the Department of Agriculture planted Ohio’s first legal hemp plants since World War II.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s treasurer says overall receipts to the treasury are continuing to rise, but he warns there are signs of a potential economic slowdown on the horizon. State Treasurer Randy McDaniel released figures Friday that show gross receipts to the treasury topped $1.1 billion in July, up nearly 10% from July last year. Overall collections for the past 12 months totaled nearly $13.7 billion, almost 12% higher than the prior 12 months. But McDaniel also reports tax receipts from the production of oil and gas are declining, and sales tax collections are beginning to drop for the first time in two years. Treasury officials reported sales tax receipts fell below those of the prior year in both June and July.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown has decided not to veto a bill that will ease rules for farmers clearing out irrigation ditches, her office told Oregon Public Broadcasting. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported her decision was likely to please many in rural parts of the state, but it spurred a furious reaction from environmental groups. The legislation says farmers would need to give notice that they were going to clear an irrigation ditch but would not need a permit unless they planned to move more than 3,000 cubic yards of material over a five-year period – a 60-fold increase from the current 50-cubic-yard threshold, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. Environmental groups argued that the measure undermines the state’s ability to protect state wetlands. Many farm fields in the Willamette Valley are classified as wetlands.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Workers have started to neutralize a highly toxic chemical on the site of a massive refinery that’s been shut down since explosions and a blaze June 21. Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel says workers are at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions site around the clock, seven days a week in an effort to neutralize the 33,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid there. It could take several weeks to complete. Hydrofluoric acid is one of the most dangerous chemicals in use. Refineries use it to create high-octane fuel. Chemical safety officials have said once it had been released into the atmosphere, a low-lying toxic cloud could travel quickly over miles, affecting more than a million people. Thiel says air monitoring is continuing, and there are no signs that the chemical was ever released.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s oldest black church celebrated its 200th anniversary over the weekend. The Congdon Street Baptist Church opened in 1819 and has had an integral role in providing spiritual and educational needs for the city’s black communities. The Providence Journal reports the original members of the church came from the First Baptist Church in America, where they were forced to worship in a segregated space. In 1863, as tensions grew among the congregation and their white neighbors, the original church was torn down without their approval. Harold Metts, a church deacon and Democratic state senator from Providence, says the congregation has always combated “such evil” with good.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBlythewood: “School Prayer Zone” signs are cropping up near some schools in the state. News outlets report the white and fluorescent green signs show two figures kneeling in prayer, their hands clasped above the words “2 Chronicles 7:14.” The Bible verse promises those who pray and “turn from their wicked ways” will be forgiven. The $714 signs by nonprofit Christ Teens can be seen in several counties and resemble official signs by the South Carolina Department of Transportation. The agency says it didn’t approve the signs, but they’re legal as long as they sit on private property and are outside the highway rights of way. Nonprofit director and founder Vanessa Frazier says she came up with the idea in 2016 and has been working out the details with the state agency ever since.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The military says recent high-altitude balloon flights over the state and others in the Midwest complied with federal laws against conducting surveillance on civilians. Pentagon spokesman Chris Mitchell says two test flights recently launched from Baltic, South Dakota, were part of a project to develop all-weather radar-imaging capability from the stratosphere. He says no tracking information was collected during these flights, and none will be collected in future flights. But the South Dakota chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said Friday that it still has many questions about the imagery and how it will be used. Policy Director Libby Skarin says the Pentagon statement seems to contradict filings, first reported by The Guardian, saying the balloons were meant to provide persistent surveillance to locate drug trafficking and homeland security threats.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Health officials say this year’s first human case of West Nile virus in the state has been reported. The Shelby County Health Department said Thursday that the mosquito-borne illness has been found in an unidentified person. The person’s condition wasn’t released. Officials said in June that the virus had been found in mosquitoes in the county. Crews have been treating mosquito breeding sites with insecticides and setting traps to capture and kill the insects. The West Nile virus can occasionally cause severe disease or even death. But most human infections are mild and cause fever, headache and body aches that last a few days. The case reported Thursday is the state’s first this year. Three people died of West Nile virus in 2018 in Shelby County.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A local Native American group is bringing a new battle to the Alamo, filing a legal notice declaring the grounds to be an abandoned or unknown cemetery. The San Antonio Express-News reports that could delay the $450 million project to restore and enhance the sacred Texas shrine. And the American Indians in Texas at the Spanish Colonial Missions plans to go even further: The group has launched a fundraising campaign to file a federal lawsuit alleging discriminatory practices in the way city, state and nonprofit officials are guiding the project. Executive Director Ramon Vasquez says new guidelines on the handling of human remains unearthed during the planned restoration work were developed without consulting his organization, whose members are descendants of indigenous people who lived – and likely were buried – in this area well before the Battle of the Alamo.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Voter fraud is rare in the state and typically involves parents submitting ballots for children who are away from home serving missions for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the lieutenant governor says. Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox says voter fraud is usually the result of a misunderstanding of election laws, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. “They think, ‘Oh, I’ll just fill it out for him, and I’ll sign it and send it back in,’ ” Cox said during a gubernatorial campaign visit to Fielding. In those cases, Cox said state officials “call them up and tell them that’s illegal, you can’t do that.” Completing another person’s voting form is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine. Parents may be concerned the postal system will not deliver a ballot in time from overseas. But electronic voting options are now available to young missionaries, officials say.\n\nVermont\n\nBurke: Law enforcement is suggesting that the town require bicyclists to ride single-file on town roads. The Kingdom Trail Association attracts thousands of mountain bikers and others to a trail network in the Northeast Kingdom. The Caledonian Record reports that a deputy from the Caledonia County Sheriff’s Department suggested the ordinance and says it would be safer for everyone. Deputy Joe Rossi says some of the roads in the area are narrow and twisty. Abby Long, executive director of the Kingdom Trail Association, said she would support such an ordinance. Selectboard Chair Christine Emmons said the present law in Vermont is for two bicyclists abreast, so a change would require the adoption of an ordinance.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A federal judge ruled Friday that a school board’s transgender bathroom ban discriminated against a former student, Gavin Grimm, the latest in a string of decisions nationwide that favor transgender students who faced similar policies. The order issued by U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen is a major victory for the American Civil Liberties Union and for Grimm. His four-year lawsuit was once a federal test case and had come to embody the debate about transgender student rights. The Gloucester County School Board’s policy required Grimm, a transgender male student, to use girls’ restrooms or private bathrooms. The judge wrote that Grimm’s rights were violated under the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause as well as under Title IX, the federal policy that protects against gender-based discrimination.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Water has gushed from a glacier on Mount Rainier, damaging a road and trail as it flowed down. The News Tribune reports the water burst on the South Tahoma Glacier started last Monday without warning. Mount Rainier National Park officials say the flow formed new waterfalls and moved boulders down the mountain, leading to the closure of Westside Road and the Tahoma Creek Trail. No injuries were reported. Geologists say similar glacier bursts could occur in the coming weeks or months. The park is warning visitors to head to higher ground if they hear unusual sounds or see changes in creek water levels and ground shaking.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice says he’s asked his administration to see what it can do to prevent the closure of Ohio Valley Medical Center in Wheeling. The Republican governor issued a statement Thursday saying that saving the hospital’s jobs must be a top priority. The Ohio Valley Medical Center and the East Ohio Regional Hospital in Martins Ferry, Ohio, released a statement Wednesday saying they would close within two to three months. The planned closures also come after an unsuccessful search for a buyer. The hospitals have lost more than $37 million in the past two years due to declining volume and reimbursements, the statement says. It also says they haven’t been able to compete with the business practices of nearby Wheeling Hospital, pointing to a federal lawsuit that accuses Wheeling Hospital of defrauding Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nWisconsin\n\nManitowoc: A judge has rejected a man’s bid for a new trial in a killing featured in the Netflix series “Making a Murderer.” Judge Angela Sutkiewicz on Thursday denied Steven Avery’s request in the 2005 killing of photographer Teresa Halbach. Halbach’s remains were found in the Avery family’s salvage yard. Avery argued the state turned over bones to the Halbach family without notifying the defense, but WLUK-TV reports the judge ruled that does not mean Avery should get a new trial. The bones were given to Halbach’s family in 2011, but Avery’s attorneys were not notified until 2018. Tests were inconclusive about whether the bones were animal or human. Avery’s attorney, Kathleen Zellner, tweeted an appeal is likely. Avery’s nephew, Brendan Dassey, also is serving a life sentence in the killing.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The city attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the most sparklers lighted simultaneously over the weekend. Organizers were hoping for about 2,000 people to participate in Saturday night’s effort. The current mark of 1,713 was set in August 2018 in the Japanese city of Takarazuka. Jessica Seders, executive director of Gillette Main Street, told the Gillette News Record she believes the effort was record-breaking. When the count is complete, photos and video will be submitted to Guinness for a determination. Fran Silverness says, if nothing else, it brought the community together.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/10/crane-season-corporal-punishment-common-core-news-around-states/41208831/", "title": "Crane season, corporal punishment: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A vote by the Mobile City Council has moved the northern Gulf Coast one step closer to resumption of regular Amtrak service for the first time since Hurricane Katrina. Members voted 6-1 to approve a grant application for restoring passenger train service to the city, news outlets report. The train would link New Orleans and Mobile twice daily with stops in Mississippi in Pascagoula, Biloxi, Gulfport and Bay St. Louis. Mobile would be asked to pay about $3 million over three years beginning in 2023, and the state could be asked to help. The states of Louisiana and Mississippi have already committed millions. The Southern Rail Commission said it is applying for nearly $8 million in federal grant money for the project, and Mobile’s commitment was needed to move forward. Actual train service is still likely years away, officials said.\n\nAlaska\n\nKaktovik: An overnight fire destroyed the only school in this North Slope village early Friday morning, Anchorage television station KTUU reports. The school, part of the North Slope Borough School District, was a total loss, Kaktovik Mayor Amanda Kaleak says. Kaktovik resident Melvin Kayotuk captured video of the fire. “We woke up then heard the school was on fire,” Kayotuk says. The official cause of the fire hasn’t been determined. Pipes had frozen in the school, Kayotuk says, and heaters were attempting to thaw them out. “I feel sad for our kids that are gone right now,” Kayotuk says. “They went to play a ball game in another village, and they’re going to come home, and they’re going to have no more school.” No injuries were reported. Kaktovik is an Inupiat village of 250 on the Beaufort Sea about 75 miles northeast of the Canada border.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Legislators are proposing a new law to block airports across the state from raising fees on ride-sharing services, like Uber and Lyft. Rep. Travis Grantham, R-Gilbert, says House Bill 2817 rolls back the fees on rides to and from airports to the same levels as at the end of 2017. That would cut existing fees and block an increase that Phoenix Sky Harbor is planning for ride-sharing services, says Grantham, who is sponsoring the measure. Phoenix already charges a fee of $2.66 for ride-share companies picking up passengers at the airport. But the city had planned on a new fee of $4 for picking up passengers as well as $4 for dropping off passengers. The fee would then increase by 25 cents each year, reaching $5 each way in 2024. Uber threatened to stop operating at Sky Harbor if Phoenix implemented the new fees.\n\nArkansas\n\nEl Dorado: Officers on Friday shot and injured a man who authorities say struck a deputy with his vehicle outside the sheriff’s office and threatened to shoot officers inside. The El Dorado News-Times reports multiple deputies were placed on paid administrative leave while the Union County Sheriff’s Office and Arkansas State Police investigate the incident. Union County Sheriff Ricky Roberts told the newspaper that officers approached the man who was in the parking lot of the sheriff’s office after he made the threats. The man drove toward the approaching officers and struck Chief Deputy Charlie Phillips, Roberts said. Deputies fired at the man and struck him in the arm, causing him to crash into a sheriff’s office employee’s vehicle in the lot. Roberts declined to release the man’s name but said he had been treated and was in custody.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to pause physical education tests for students for three years due to concerns over bullying and the test discriminating against disabled and nonbinary students. The move also comes after annual test results show a growing percentage of students scoring not healthy. H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the Department of Finance, said the state has received complaints that the current examination’s measurement of body mass index is discriminatory to nonbinary students. A measurement calculated from weight and height, BMI screenings require students to select “male” or “female,” he said. Annual state reports of the fitness test since the 2014-2015 school year show a steady decline in the share of students scoring healthy, according to a review by the Associated Press. Students’ scores have particularly dropped in the category of the fitness test that measures “aerobic capacity.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A bill that aims to boost immunization rates and make it more difficult for parents to opt their children out of vaccinations is expected to be introduced soon at the Capitol, and Gov. Jared Polis says he’ll support it. The proposal – sure to heat up the discussion on immunizations, protecting public health and parents’ rights – would require parents who want to opt out to get a signed document from a medical professional or watch an online video, produced by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Right now, parents simply submit a form to a child’s school. The proposal would not eliminate non-medical or personal belief exemptions. Polis’ office said as it stands, he backs the measure. “The governor is encouraged by the conversations he has had with the bill sponsors and appreciates their hard work,” said a statement from his office.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Initial testing has failed to identify two victims of the 1944 Hartford circus fire whose bodies were exhumed from a cemetery, the state’s chief medical examiner said Friday. Dr. James Gill also announced that anthropological examination and dental comparisons excluded a Vermont woman as being one of the two people whose remains were exhumed. The bodies were removed in October from two of five graves of unidentified circus fire victims at Northwood Cemetery in Windsor. A state judge approved the exhumations in hopes of determining whether one of them was Grace Fifield, a 47-year-old woman from Newport, Vermont, who was never seen again after attending the circus on the day of the fire. The fire at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus on July 6, 1944, killed 168 people and injured 682 others.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: University of Delaware President Dennis Assanis has told a legislative committee that a lack of qualified students is to blame for low in-state enrollment at the school. During a hearing Thursday before the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, Assanis was asked why less than 40% of the school’s students come from Delaware. “I am not the one holding back the kids in Delaware to come into the university,” Assanis said. “We need better-qualified students who come out of our K-12. Because we don’t want to put them into a first-class environment and then lead them to having mental health problems.” Legislators quizzed Assanis about the university’s enrollment of Delawareans and underrepresented students, groups the school has long struggled to recruit. Assanis said a slowdown in population growth and a lack of qualified students coming out of Delaware high schools are to blame.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The white nationalist group Patriot Front marched near Union Station on Saturday afternoon, WUSA-TV reports. Members of Patriot Front shouted “reclaim America!” as they moved down the streets of D.C. The group ended its march at a Walmart in the Union Station area, as some onlookers called them cowards, witnesses say. Dressed in similar long-sleeved clothing with hats, masks, sunglasses and American flags, the group was trailed and surrounded by police officers who were there to de-escalate any issues that arose. The group, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, is an image-obsessed organization that rehabilitated the explicitly fascist agenda of Vanguard America with garish patriotism. The SPLC says Patriot Front focuses on “theatrical rhetoric and activism that can be easily distributed as propaganda for its chapters across the country.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Common Core is over in the Sunshine State. The state Department of Education said in a statement Friday that the controversial set of academic standards “has been officially eradicated from Florida classrooms.” Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran said he is recommending that the state Board of Education adapt Common Core’s successor, Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking. The Common Core standards were first proposed a decade ago by associations of governors and state education chiefs, and they were embraced in Florida by former Gov. Jeb Bush. The standards were adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia but have come under criticism in the past decade. A broad coalition of conservatives, liberals, parents and teachers found fault with Common Core for different reasons. After taking office last year, Gov. Ron DeSantis promised to get rid of Common Core.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state could soon loosen safety standards for dams that sit above newly built homes, under a proposal unanimously passed by a state Senate committee. Senate Bill 319 would allow for homes and other inhabitable structures to be built in a dam’s inundation zone – the area that would be flooded if the dam fails – without causing the dam to be recategorized and required to meet higher safety standards. The structures would have to be built to withstand a breach of the dam and receive certification from an engineer approved by the state Environmental Protection Division’s Safe Dams Program. The bill’s sponsor, Republican State Sen. Frank Ginn of Danielsville, said it would protect dam owners from having to choose between taking on costly upgrades or removing a dam. The proposal, passed Tuesday by the Senate Natural Resources and Environment Committee, could soon go to the full state Senate for a vote.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A bill before the City Council proposes to reduce the long-term carbon footprint of Oahu’s buildings, but the measure has encountered opposition from the island’s gas utility and construction industry, Hawaii Public Radio reports. The changes to the building codes would be the first in more than a decade. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports almost 40% of energy consumed in the United States is used to power buildings. That has led many state and local lawmakers to modify building codes in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Honolulu’s Bill 25 includes provisions such as mandating more efficient insulation and lighting in buildings. But other parts of the bill have generated opposition. The state’s construction industry opposes the bill’s proposed ban on gas water heaters in new single-family homes and a requirement for more electric vehicle charging infrastructure in apartments and commercial buildings.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Former gubernatorial candidate and Democratic state lawmaker Paulette Jordan announced Friday that she’s challenging two-term Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Risch. “I’m running because we need a senator who will work to reengineer our government to prioritize American prosperity, protect our precious land and resources, fight for affordable, quality health care, and ensure a world-class education for our children,” Jordan said. In 2018 she became the first woman to become the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Idaho but lost in the general election to Republican Brad Little. The 40-year-old Jordan is a member of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe. She’s a former two-term state representative with a long history of working on the tribal council. Jordan said she’ll fight for the rights of rural Idahoans and Native Americans while focusing on the environment and justice.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: A thrift-store find has prompted its buyer to find the person to whom it rightfully belongs – and might not know it’s even gone. A bargain-hunting Robert Ray spotted what was labeled a figurine in a Peoria Goodwill store. Upon closer inspection, he recognized it was actually an urn, with ashes still inside, The (Peoria) Journal Star reports. Ray said he bought the $2.99 jar, decorated with a military-style flag and eagle, with the intention of finding the owner. He bought it in late December, just a day or two after it arrived in the store. Goodwill officials say they don’t know the source of the donation. Ray hopes someone realizes the urn is mistakenly donated and contacts the newspaper. “I’m shooting in the dark and hoping the best,” he said.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University will offer free tampons and other feminine hygiene products in the campus’ bathrooms in response to student advocates who have been pushing for the move for three years. University President Mitch Daniels on Thursday credited the University Senate, a faculty-led body, for proposing the initiative in a resolution that described feminine hygiene products as a basic necessity that should be in campus restrooms free of charge. The measure was set to be voted on later this month, but Daniels obtained permission from the University Senate to go ahead and implement it. Alison Rickert, a junior studying neurobiology and physiology at Purdue, founded The Period Project – an initiative aimed at providing menstrual products to those who need them both in and out of university walls. She said Purdue’s decision resulted from her and other students advocating for the issue.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Staffers at a winter homeless shelter are working with police to reduce problems that have led to complaints from neighbors. Since the Fillmore Center opened in mid-November to offer a warm place to sleep, police have received 82 calls for service, according to The Gazette. Those calls include 41 for disturbances and 31 for medical needs, as well as others for theft, a warrant and other issues. Police said there have been 10 arrests, including seven for public intoxication. That led to neighborhood complaints and an effort by staff to take a firmer stance with rule-breakers and plan more activities in the center, which can house up to 70 people. “I am not sure what all helped the most, but we have seen a decline since we made all of these changes,” said Phoebe Trepp, of Willis Dady Homeless Service, which staffs the shelter.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Douglas County law enforcement officials are undergoing training and planning to coordinate investigations and prosecutions of sexual assault cases after facing criticism last year for charging women with making false sexual assault complaints. Douglas County District Attorney Charles Branson said last week that other changes planned in the county include a task force and continuing education on handling trauma and sexual assault cases, The Lawrence Journal-World reports. In October, Branson dismissed a case against a woman who was charged with filing a false rape report, after a Lawrence police detective said in an affidavit that he thought the woman reported the rape because she was angry the man involved was seeing another woman. Advocates for sexual violence victims criticized Branson and investigators, saying filing such charges would make victims reluctant to report sexual assaults. Two similar cases were dismissed in December.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state would ban the paddling of students under a bill that won House passage Friday after a couple of state lawmakers recalled being on the receiving end of disciplinary swats. The measure, which would prohibit schools from using corporal punishment, cleared the House on a 65-17 vote. It now goes to the Senate. Kentucky is among 19 states that still allow corporal punishment as a form of school discipline. Republican Rep. Steve Riley, the bill’s lead sponsor, said corporal punishment fails to change behavior in a positive way. Another GOP lawmaker, Rep. Kevin Bratcher, said he was paddled in high school after being caught sneaking out with some classmates to chew tobacco. “All it really did was make us set up a guardsman the next time,” said Bratcher, who voted for the bill. The paddling, he said, was delivered by a longtime school principal who is now his House colleague, Democratic Rep. Charles Miller.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The Mississippi River was below 15 feet at a key gauge in the city Friday, leading the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to end, for now, a “flood fight” protocol calling for daily levee inspections. The corps said in a news release that it was moving from a “Phase II” flood fight, implemented when the river hits 15 feet at New Orleans’ Carrollton Gauge, to a “Phase I,” maintained as long as the river is between 11 and 15 feet. Phase I calls for twice-weekly levee inspections. And it requires special waivers for certain types of construction or other work on or near the levees. Phase II is implemented when the river hits 15 feet at the Carrollton Gauge. It calls for daily inspections and no waivers for the prohibited work.\n\nMaine\n\nBath: The state has been the site of more than a half-dozen attacks on people by foxes in the past few months, prompting one city to try trapping the animals. Foxes are common in Maine and are typically skittish around humans, but the state’s mid-coast region has been the site of numerous attacks in the past six months. One man, Norman Kenney of Bath, was attacked twice by a rabid fox on separate occasions and had to undergo treatment for the dangerous disease. The Bath City Council voted unanimously Feb. 5 to spend $26,000 to lay out traps to catch foxes. The city is partnering with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the effort, WGME-TV reports. Maine is also in the midst of its annual season for fox hunting. The season starts in October and runs until the end of February.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Foods made of animal tissues cultured from cells outside of the original animal, or made from plants or insects, could not be labeled “meat” in the state under a Republican-backed bill in the General Assembly. The bill is sponsored by Sen. Jason Gallion, R-Harford and Cecil, who called it “truth in advertising.” Eleven other GOP senators are co-sponsoring the legislation. “Laboratory-grown meat will become more prevalent in the future, and this bill will proactively prevent these ‘franken-meat’ alternatives from being labeled as meat,” Gallion said at a bill hearing Thursday. Meanwhile, Dan Colgrove with the Plant Based Foods Association told lawmakers that “we just think it’s unnecessary. ... These products have to be very clearly marked as veggie, vegetarian or plant-based. That’s sort of the point, to offer alternatives to meat products.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: One of the largest unions in the city has filed a lawsuit against Mayor Marty Walsh’s administration alleging repeated violations to the union’s collective bargaining agreement. The lawsuit filed by Boston Fire Fighters Local 718 names the city and Fire Commissioner Joseph Finn and cites three instances in which a firefighter’s status was changed from injured leave to sick leave or light duty, the Boston Globe reports. This change forced firefighters to either work or use up sick time. The union alleges that the city acted “in an arbitrary manner and without justification or cause” in changing three firefighters’ status. The union has asked in the suit for a judicial ruling to prevent the city from taking similar action until the matter is solved through arbitration. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A major figure in the Michigan Republican Party whose Lake Michigan property is eroding suggested that political donations would fall unless GOP lawmakers do something to help, according to a memo. Peter Secchia, a Grand Rapids businessman, has been a Republican donor and activist for decades. His name is on the state party headquarters in Lansing, and he served as U.S. ambassador to Italy when George H.W. Bush was president. Secchia sent a letter in November to Republican leaders in the Legislature, noting a $6 million property loss in Ottawa County due to extraordinarily high lake levels eroding the shore and threatening homes. “There seems to be little interest in the Michigan House of Representatives or the Michigan Senate,” Secchia’s memo said. “This lack of concern mystifies me. Our property values will diminish greatly … hence, our donations will also diminish.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota called Friday for an investigation into the conviction of a black teenager who is serving life in prison, after the Associated Press uncovered serious flaws and inconsistencies in the police probe. Myon Burrell was found guilty in the 2002 shooting of an 11-year-old girl, who was killed by a stray bullet while doing homework at her dining room table. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who was the top prosecutor in Hennepin County at the time, has highlighted that case throughout her political career as an example of getting justice for victims. ACLU-MN Executive Director John Gordon says not only was there no physical evidence tying Burrell to the scene, but the AP investigation also showed police made no attempt to speak to Burrell’s key alibi and discredited co-defendants who said he was not at the scene. One of them, Ike Tyson, has for years insisted he himself was the triggerman. Police also relied heavily on jailhouse informants, who were given reduced sentences for coming forward.\n\nMississippi\n\nPurvis: A court ruling is ending a legal fight over the voluntary merger of two school districts in south Mississippi. The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that opponents waited too long to file a lawsuit. In April 2017, the Lumberton Public School District and the Lamar County School District voted to consolidate. The plan included some territory and affected some students in Pearl River County. The Mississippi Board of Education approved the plan in June 2017, and the two districts consolidated in July 2018. Lamar County schools officials agreed to keep Lumberton schools open and have Lumberton students attend those schools. The officials also hired Lumberton teachers. Pearl River County officials filed a lawsuit to oppose the merger, arguing that students who live in Pearl River County should attend school in Pearl River County.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Two local black educators have formed a support group to inspire more black students to go into teaching and to give them a place to network with one another. Darryl Diggs, a 37-year-old assistant principal at Parkway South High School, co-founded Black Males in Education-St. Louis in 2019 along with Howard Fields, the principal at Givens Elementary in Webster Groves. The men created the organization for other black people, particularly men, to feel secure in their professional roles in urban or suburban schools. The group on Friday hosted the State of Black Educators Symposium at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. About 1,300 people signed up. Among the speakers was Kelvin Adams, superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools, who says recruiting teachers of color is a top priority for the district, where 79% of students are black compared with 37% of educators.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: A one-eyed hawk that went missing after a weekend windstorm knocked over its enclosure at a rehabilitation facility in western Montana has been found safe. Bird rehabilitator Kari Gabriel climbed the ladder of a Kalispell Fire Department bucket truck with a firefighter who used a net to capture the bird in a tree Thursday, NBC Montana reports. In a Facebook post, Gabriel said Hawkeye was dining on her favorite food – beef heart. Gabriel realized Hawkeye was missing when she found her cage overturned Feb. 1. Gabriel, who runs a program called the Montana Bird Lady, asked the public for help searching for the hawk. The bird was spotted several times, and after several chases Thursday, Hawkeye stayed in one spot long enough to be captured. Gabriel took in Hawkeye after the bird was hit by a car in 2014. The hawk could not be released back into the wild because she is missing an eye and is partly blind in the other.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Sandhill crane watchers are getting ready for a new season in central Nebraska after a prolonged cold spell and flooding last year that kept some people from seeing them in person. Everything is on track this year for the Crane Trust to open as scheduled March 1, said Chuck Cooper, the group’s president and CEO. As many as half a million sandhill cranes converge on the Platte River in central Nebraska from mid-February through mid-April, according to the Grand Island Independent. The cranes fly in from their winter grounds in Texas and New Mexico and stop for about a week or more to fatten up on loose corn in the surrounding agricultural fields. During their time here, the cranes roost at night along the Platte River, congregating on sandbars for safety from predators.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state Department of Motor Vehicles has eliminated the parallel parking portion of the driving skills test. The test still meets the national standards set by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators even without the parallel parking element, department public information officer Kevin Malone said. The changes took effect Jan. 13. Nevada joins several other states – including California, Colorado and Florida – that have removed parallel parking from their driving skills exams. “Testing of the parking skills needed is met by the requirements of entering, and backing out of, a perpendicular parking space and by other vehicle control requirements,” Malone said. The changes are expected to reduce the number of repeat visits by drivers who can pass everything but parallel parking, officials said. Some driving schools have since stopped teaching parallel parking unless a student requests it, officials said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has passed a bill that would let qualified patients grow their own medical marijuana. The measure approved by senators Thursday allows designated caregivers or patients to grow up to three mature plants, three immature plants and 12 seedlings each. Although the state legalized medical cannabis in 2013, growing the plant for personal use is currently a felony offense. Rep. Tom Sherman, a Democrat from Rye, said dispensary costs can be prohibitive for patients and caregivers, and that dispensaries sometimes don’t carry the type of medical cannabis patients need to treat their conditions. The bill now heads to the House. A similar bill cleared the House and Senate last year. Republican Governor Chris Sununu vetoed it, citing public safety concerns.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Lying on applications to get tax breaks should open companies up to prosecution, and the state should create an inspector general post to watch over the agency handing out incentives, according to a report published Friday by a legislative committee probing the credits. Those were just two of more than two dozen recommendations in the Special Committee on Economic Growth’s final report, issued after nearly a year of looking into the now-expired tax incentives and holding four public hearings. The Chris Christie-era tax break program expired June 30, meaning that new applications aren’t being considered, though previously approved awards could still be paid out. The committee’s report comes about a year after Gov. Phil Murphy put tax breaks in the spotlight, citing state auditor and comptroller reports that raised questions about how the awards were handed out as the rationale for the creation of his own task force.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state Senate on Friday endorsed a red-flag gun bill prompted by concerns about a mass shooting last year in El Paso, Texas, and suicide prevention efforts. The bill won Senate approval on a 22-20 vote, with Republicans and four Democrats voting against it. The proposal moves to the House, which last year approved a similar measure that languished. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has urged the Democrat-led Legislature to provide new avenues for law enforcement to prevent gun violence and better secure the safety of schools. “The extreme risk protection order is part of an effort to give law enforcement every single tool,” she said after the Senate vote. The bill as currently written would allow law enforcement officers to petition a state district court to order the temporary surrender of firearms.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state will require manufacturers to disclose the use of potentially dangerous chemicals in children’s products under a new law signed Friday. The law, which goes into effect March 1, also creates a children’s product safety council that will advise state environmental regulators about which chemicals to restrict and how. Currently, New York prohibits the use of dangerous chemicals on an individual basis. But child safety advocates for years have pushed for more comprehensive regulations over concerns that children can be more sensitive than adults to small amounts of chemicals. The new law requires manufacturers to phase out the use of certain chemicals including asbestos. It also creates a process for state environmental regulators to ban other chemicals down the road. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the bill into law Friday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Thousands of people took to the streets Saturday in an annual march and rally designed to call for action on social and economic justice issues in the state. The 14th annual Mass Moral March on Raleigh drew support from the state NAACP, more than 200 other organizations and their supporters. Participants marched to the old Capitol building for a 14-point “People’s Agenda” that includes laws that expand health care coverage, create livable wages, redress racial wrongs and grant collective bargaining for government employees. The event began in 2007 with the leadership of then-state NAACP president the Rev. William Barber of Goldsboro, who is now president of the national organization Repairers of the Breach. From the dozens of signs and banners people carried during the march, a clear message emerged: Change starts at the ballot box.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Move over, meat. An agriculture research center on the North Dakota State University campus is plugging plants as an alternative protein source. The Northern Crops Institute is planning a three-day course this spring to provide information on the basics of plant-based foods and show participants how to produce the best products. The seminar is targeting foodies, restaurateurs, food bloggers and “pretty much anyone with an interest in it,” institute spokesman Grant Christian said. Many restaurants and fast food chains have recently bolstered their menus with vegetarian offerings. That includes the introduction of meatless tacos, meatless burgers and meatless wings. The course is scheduled for May 19-21 at the Northern Crops Institute. It will feature crops such as soy, wheat and pulses and include hands-on training in using raw ingredients and developing final products.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Opponents of a bill that would repeal the ban on using fireworks on private property are warning the legislation could lead to dangerous consequences. Current law allows consumers to legally buy fireworks in Ohio but requires they be taken out of the state within 48 hours of purchase. Critics of the law have noted for years that it’s widely ignored. The bill before the House Commerce and Labor Committee would repeal the transport requirement and allow individuals to buy and use consumer fireworks in Ohio. Roughly 1 in 5 of the 10,000 serious consumer fireworks injuries each year are to the eye, Sherill Williams, president and CEO of the Ohio affiliate of Prevent Blindness, testified Wednesday. Other opponents include firefighters, the Ohio Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and veterans concerned about fireworks’ impact on vets suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group that wants to change how the state’s legislative and congressional district lines are drawn has refiled an initiative petition in hopes of bringing the issue before voters. People Not Politicians refiled a new version of its petition Thursday, two days after its original petition was struck down by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. In that ruling, the court said that the proposal itself was constitutional but that a shorthand description of the measure, called a gist, didn’t adequately describe the proposal. The group needs to gather about 178,000 signatures in 90 days to qualify for the ballot. The plan calls for an end to partisan gerrymandering of Oklahoma’s legislative districts by creating an independent, bipartisan commission to draw district lines. The commission would include an equal number of Republicans, Democrats and members unaffiliated with either party, selected by a group of retired state Supreme Court and appellate judges.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The cost to hike and camp in three of the state’s most popular wilderness areas won’t be as high as expected. The U.S. Forest Service announced Thursday that it would cost $1 for a day permit and $6 for an overnight permit to enter the Three Sisters, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington wilderness areas beginning this summer. That’s a drop from the $4 to $11 per person, per day, that was proposed earlier this year and received an overwhelmingly negative response from over 13,000 public comments. The permit system is intended to limit overcrowding and environmental damage in 450,000 acres of Oregon’s most beautiful but fragile backcountry. Permits will go on sale at Recreation.gov beginning April 7 and be required from May 22 to Sept. 25, even though some key questions about the system still need to be finalized.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The last jailed member of the radical group MOVE was released from prison Friday, according to an attorney who represented the members in their parole appeals. Brad Thomson, an attorney for Chuck Sims Africa, posted on Twitter that the man had been released. Africa was the last of the so-called MOVE 9 to be paroled after being convicted of third-degree murder in the 1978 shooting death of Officer James Ramp in Philadelphia. The nine members of the anti-establishment, back-to-nature group were each sentenced to between 30 and 100 years in prison. The 1978 standoff with police came after officers tried to evict the group from its Philadelphia headquarters, saying they received noise and sanitation complaints from neighbors. The members barricaded themselves inside and have said they believe Ramp was killed by friendly fire. Police contended there was gunfire exchanged from both sides, but MOVE members have denied returning gunfire.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The City Council has introduced a resolution to rename a bridge to honor a local civil rights leader. The Providence Journal reports the Providence River Pedestrian Bridge could be renamed after Michael Van Leesten, who died last year. Van Leesten helped co-found and served as CEO of the Opportunities Industrialization Center of Rhode Island, a nonprofit that provides job training, career counseling and other programs for people from underserved communities. “Michael Van Leesten was a dear friend of mine and a ray of inspiration and hope to many,” Ward 3 City Councilwoman Nirva LaFortune said. “He was also a bridge builder and architect of connections, and that is why so many of us believe it would be appropriate to name the bridge after him.” Council members voted Thursday to send the resolution to the Committee on Urban Redevelopment, Renewal and Planning for approval.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: College students will help archaeologists map the walls used to defend the city more than 250 years ago. Students from Clemson University and the College of Charleston will use ground-penetrating radar in downtown Charleston’s Marion Square to find exactly where the fortification called the Hornwork was built, the American Battlefield Trust said. The 30-foot-tall wall built in 1758 stretched for three city blocks and also had a ditch or moat. The wall was made from tabby, which was a mix of seashells, sand and lime, the organization said. The Hornwork played a vital part in Charleston’s defense over the next several decades, including during the British siege of the city in 1780 during the Revolutionary War. Some of the wall remains visible in Marion Square, and archaeologists have an approximate location of the fortifications, but the radar will help pinpoint exactly where it was built.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Democrats called foul Friday after the Republican-dominated state House shot down their efforts to allow Native Americans use their tribal IDs to register to vote. The defeat prompted several Democrats to level accusations of voter suppression. Republicans say their resistance is all about keeping voter registration secure. “The way our voting system is set up does disenfranchise in particular Native American voters,” said Rep. Ryan Cwach, a Yankton Democrat. In the 2018 general election, tribal communities reported some of the lowest voter turnout figures in the state. Native Americans make up 9% of the state’s total population. Rep. Shawn Bordeaux, a Mission Democrat who is a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, said tribes in the state have improved the quality of their IDs in recent years. They include addresses, holographics and other security measures; are recognized by federal agencies; and can be used to take flights.\n\nTennessee\n\nLawrenceburg: A tornado that hit this southern Tennessee city has damaged several headstones in the community’s second-oldest cemetery, where the actor and former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson is buried. Lawrenceburg City Administrator Chris Shaffer said officials won’t know how many headstones were damaged by Wednesday’s EF-1 tornado at Mimosa Cemetery until several large oak trees are cleared away, WTVF-TV reports. WTVF says the trees narrowly missed Thompson’s headstone. One of Tennessee’s senators from 1994 to 2003, Thompson was also an actor who appeared in at least 20 motion pictures and the TV series “Law & Order.” He died in 2015. Local resident Jennifer May told told WTVF she was driving nearby when she noticed something different about the cemetery. “Walking through here and seeing this breaks my heart because these are loved ones,” May said.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Texas Legislative Black Caucus has announced it’s working on a bill that would ban discrimination based on hair textures and styles commonly associated with race following the suspension of a black high school student near Houston. State lawmakers, accompanied by black officials and advocates, introduced the CROWN Act at a press conference Thursday, the Texas Tribune reports. CROWN stands for Create a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair, and the measure would protect against “unjust grooming policies that have a disparate impact on black children, women, and men” in workplaces and public schools, CROWN Coalition advocate Adjoa Asamoah said. The coalition is a national alliance of organizations working to end hair discrimination. The bill is a show of support for students like Deandre Arnold, who was suspended from Hill High School in Mont Belvieu and won’t be able to attend graduation unless he cuts his dreadlocks.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Residents getting married in the state can now get their marriage licenses online, officials say. The state auditor’s office has already launched the digital application process on its website, KUTV-TV reports. Most states require the couple to appear in person, fill out paperwork and present identification, a process some clerks have called labor-intensive. “You and your significant other handed that to one of our clerks, who then retyped everything you had just handwritten,” clerk Amelia Powers Gardner said, citing the possibility of human error. Utah County issues about 10,000 marriage licenses each year, county officials said. The 10-minute online process requires both people to use one smartphone or computer to fill out a form and take pictures of themselves and their IDs so the system can verify identities, officials said. The couple is then emailed a PDF document with the marriage license, officials say.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Johnsbury: A guinea pig found on the street was taken to the local police department for safekeeping, and firefighters and police are already clamoring to keep it if an owner doesn’t come forward. The furry creature was found Wednesday by a pedestrian walking down Railroad Street, Cpl George Johnson told the Caledonian Record. Firefighter Phil Hawthorne said that if no owner comes forward, the guinea pig should become a resident of the firehouse. Det. Daniele Kostruba also volunteered to take the creature home as a pet. The animal, dubbed Harvey by dispatcher Karen Montgomery, was given food, water and a box to stay in. Police asked that the owner of the guinea pig go to the public safety building on Main Street to confirm ownership of the animal and take it home.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democratic state lawmakers are advancing legislation to ban the sale of assault weapons and the possession of high-capacity magazines despite fierce opposition from gun owners. A state House committee on Friday advanced legislation backed by Gov. Ralph Northam to ban the sale of certain semiautomatic firearms, including popular AR-15-style rifles, and silencers and to prohibit the possession of magazines that hold more than 12 rounds. It’s the most ambitious measure proposed by Northam and one that’s met the most pushback, including from members of his own party. Gun owners packed the committee room Friday and erupted in protest when the measured passed. Capitol Police cleared the committee room of almost every spectator after the vote. Heated debates over guns have dominated this year’s legislative session, as Virginia has become ground zero in the nation’s raging debate over gun control and mass shootings.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Lawmakers have passed a bill that would change a tax that’s supposed to make it easier for the state to pay for the Legislature’s promise to make college more affordable. The Seattle Times reports that initially, the 2019 package planned to use a business-and-occupation tax to pay for a measure making higher education more accessible, starting in the 2020-2021 school year. The new bill, sponsored by Sen. Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, replaces the tax lawmakers approved last year with a different version of the levy. In addition to worries that there wouldn’t be enough funding, lawmakers were concerned last year’s version was so complicated that there could be trouble collecting it. The new measure, which has passed the Senate, now heads to Gov. Jay Inslee. If he signs it, the law would take effect April 1.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice says he has committed $1 million in state funds to encourage participation in the 2020 census, saying federal officials have told him the state is “behind” in the effort. “We need to get cranking,” he said at a press conference Thursday with Census Bureau officials who encouraged residents to apply for temporary jobs helping with the count. An estimated 74% of West Virginians responded to the previous census in 2010, according to the governor’s office. Justice said a lack of participation in the count has led to the state missing out on “tens and tens of millions of dollars” in federal grant funding. Justice said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross has twice told him that “West Virginia’s behind” in the census.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents approved tuition increases Friday for nonresident and graduate students at six institutions. Increases will range between 1.5% and 25% at UW-Milwaukee, Oshkosh, Platteville, River Falls, Stevens Point and Whitewater starting this fall. The schools say they need more money to cover instruction, raises, recruiting faculty, technology and training clinical professionals. Republican lawmakers have kept tuition frozen for in-state undergraduates since 2013. System officials have long complained that the freeze has hamstrung them financially and have tried to compensate by raising out-of-state and graduate tuition over the years. The board approved the plan unanimously during a meeting at UW-Madison. There was no discussion.\n\nWyoming\n\nRock Springs: A public comment period has started for a draft resource management plan amendment and associated draft environmental impact statement for wild horse management in southern Wyoming, land agency officials say. The Bureau of Land Management has made the draft amendment and related documents available for review and comment until April 30, the Rocket-Miner reports. The draft amendment would update wild horse management direction within the White Mountain, Great Divide Basin, Adobe Town and Salt Wells Creek herd management areas, officials say. The analysis considers strategies for the herd management areas, which encompasses about 4,400 square miles, agency officials say. The Bureau of Land Management hopes to protect wild horses and burros on public land through its wild horse and burro program, agency officials say.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/28/claudette-colvin-port-penalties-bay-renewal-news-around-states/49298599/", "title": "Claudette Colvin, port penalties: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Months before Rosa Parks became the mother of the modern civil rights movement by refusing to move to the back of a segregated bus, Black teenager Claudette Colvin did the same, in the same city. Convicted of assaulting a police officer while being arrested, she was placed on probation but never received notice that she’d finished the term and was on safe ground legally. Now 82 and slowed by age, Colvin has asked a judge to end the matter once and for all. She wants a court in Montgomery to wipe away a record that her lawyer said has cast a shadow over the life of a largely unsung hero of the civil rights era. “I am an old woman now. Having my records expunged will mean something to my grandchildren and great grandchildren. And it will mean something for other Black children,” Colvin said in a sworn statement. Supporters sang civil rights anthems and clapped as Colvin entered the clerk’s office and filed the expungement request Tuesday. Her attorney, Phillip Ensler, said he was seeking all legal documents to be sealed and all records of the case erased. Montgomery County District Attorney Daryl Bailey later said he agreed with the request to clear Colvin’s record, removing any doubt it would be approved. “I guess you can say that now I am no longer a juvenile delinquent,” Colvin told a crowd that included relatives, well-wishers and activists.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Legislature is in special session, but it’s quiet at the Capitol, where many legislative offices have been dark, floor sessions in some cases have lasted seconds, and little progress has been made toward resolving the state’s fiscal issues. Since the session started Oct. 4 in Juneau, House committees have had five meetings on fiscal-related topics, all in Anchorage; the Senate has had no such hearings. “I don’t think it’s making a lot of sense to be here doing what we’re doing right now. So if we’re not going to do anything, gavel out,” said Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, one of four House members present last week for a so-called technical floor session held to satisfy a meeting requirement but at which no business is taken up. Outside the first day, there has been one regular floor session. That was in the House, and after bill introductions, much of the time was spent on speeches, some memorializing people who died recently, others on topics like COVID-19 vaccines. There has been interest in finding a long-term solution to a yearly, divisive fight over what size dividend to pay residents from the state’s oil wealth. A legislative working group recommended a constitutional guarantee of a dividend as part of a package with elements including new revenue, budget reductions and a revised spending limit. The recommendations weren’t binding.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Activists protested outside a wedding where U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema was officiating over the weekend – the latest confrontation between demonstrators and the Arizona Democrat who opposes key parts of President Joe Biden’s social services and climate change package. A video posted to YouTube shows the bride’s mother tearfully pleading with protesters not to disrupt her daughter’s wedding, which was held at an outdoor venue separated by a wall from a public street in Bisbee, Arizona. Several demonstrators yell at the mother until one peacemaker suggests they walk quietly with their signs so the wedding can begin. At one point, the bride says: “Thanks for ruining my wedding. I really appreciate it.” Among the costumed guests at the wedding were people wearing Native American costumes with a headdress and face paint. “While the Senator knows the bride and groom, she does not know and did not interact with the wedding guests who wore disrespectful and racist costumes to the ceremony, and she strongly condemns such behavior,” Sinema spokeswoman Hannah Hurley said in an email to the Arizona Daily Star. Sinema has faced mounting pressure from Democratic activists over her refusal to eliminate the filibuster and her work to scale back a spending package that started at $3.5 trillion.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Meatpacking giant Tyson Foods says more than 96% of its workers have been vaccinated against COVID-19 ahead of the company’s Nov. 1 deadline for them to do so. The Springdale-based company said the number of its 120,000 workers who have been inoculated has nearly doubled since it announced its mandate Aug. 3, when just 50% of Tyson employees had gotten their shots. “This is an incredible result – not only for our company, but for your families and our communities across the country, ” Tyson President and CEO Donnie King said in a note to employees Tuesday. Tyson, which has long been dealing with worker shortages, said employees who don’t get vaccinated before the company’s deadline will be fired, but the former employees will be welcomed back if they do get inoculated later. “Our doors are open,” King wrote. Spokesman Gary Mickelson said very few employees had left the company over the mandate. The industry was hit hard by the pandemic in spring 2020 when the coronavirus tore through meatpacking plants and forced many to close temporarily because so many workers became ill or had to quarantine. King said Tyson saw a significant decline in virus cases in its workforce as more employees got vaccinated. Tyson remains the only major company in the meatpacking industry to require vaccinations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: In an effort to ease congestion at the nation’s busiest port complex, officials said Monday that they will start fining shipping companies whose cargo containers linger for too long at marine terminals. The twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach said in a statement that arriving containers scheduled to be moved by trucks will be allowed to stay for nine days before fines start accruing. Containers set to move by rail can stay at the ports for three days. After that, ocean carriers will be charged $100 per container, increasing in $100 increments per container per day, the statement said. The new rules will go into effect Nov. 1. “The terminals are running out of space, and this will make room for the containers sitting on those ships at anchor,” Port of Long Beach Executive Director Mario Cordero said in the statement. It’s the latest step aimed at relieving the logjam of cargo ships that has interrupted the global supply chain. The backlog prompted the Biden administration to allow the port complex to operate 24 hours a day to try to get goods unloaded and out to consumers. About 40% of all shipping containers entering the U.S. come through the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports.\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville: After spending hours looking for a hiker who was unknowingly the subject of a search and rescue effort, a search team is urging people who are late in returning from the outdoors to answer their phones if they get repeated calls from an unknown number. According to the Lake County team, it made multiple unsuccessful attempts via cellphone to reach a person reported overdue from a hike on Mount Elbert on Oct. 18, leading rescuers to launch a search that night. Not long after rescuers resumed their search around daybreak the following day, the overdue hiker, who was not identified, was independently able to find a way off the mountain, the state’s tallest, and drive back to a lodging site, the team said in a Facebook post Thursday. The person who reported the hiker overdue notified authorities. The team said one takeaway was that the “subject ignored repeated phone calls from us because they didn’t recognize the number.” However, in response to questions from commenters, one team member acknowledged that it was not known if the hiker had the phone’s ringer and notifications turned off. The member said the team also sent texts to the hiker.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A former marina owner was sentenced Monday to two years of probation and fined $45,000 for intentionally sinking abandoned boats in Long Island Sound. John Magness, 72, of Bristol, Maine, pleaded guilty last November to a federal charge of obstructing navigable waters by sinking a vessel. Magness was in the process of selling the Bluefish Cove Marina in Bridgeport in 2018 when he made a deal with an employee and another man to scuttle several sailboats and motorboats that had been abandoned at the marina, prosecutors said. Investigators discovered that at least five boats were sunk between Black Rock Harbor and the Pennfield Reef Lighthouse at Magness’ request between October 2018 and April 2019, prosecutors said. The two other men involved, Peter Albrecht, of Norwalk, and Carlos Santos, of Westbrook, each previously pleaded guilty to the same charge and were each sentenced to a year of probation. Prosecutors said Magness agreed to forgive Santos’ unpaid dockage fees in exchange for his help sinking the vessels.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The death of an 18-year-old who was shot Sunday night marked a grim milestone for the city, bringing the total number of people killed by gunfire this year up to the level for all of 2017, Wilmington’s deadliest year on record. The teen, whom police identified Tuesday as Zion Davis-Shelton, was the 32nd person to die by gunfire this year in Wilmington, according to police. In 2017, the city’s deadliest year for gunfire, 35 homicides were recorded – one by stabbing and two by drowning. While the total number of people shot so far this year, 133, is down from 2017, which saw a total of 197 shot, 2021 is on track to be a deadlier year for gunfire. In a statement, Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy in part blamed the number of illegal guns on the street for the violence. Already this year, he said, his officers have made more than 250 gun arrests, “on pace with last year’s record-breaking numbers and leaps and bounds over the totals we saw in years past.” Mayor Mike Purzycki said in a statement that he grieves for the victims’ families and that the two young men killed over the weekend – another 18-year-old was fatally shot about a day before Davis-Shelton – “are a grim reminder that while so much good is taking place in the city, there is too much isolation from healthy societal norms among our young men.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A coyote was recently spotted on a wildlife camera in Rock Creek Park, WUSA-TV reports. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo posted an image of the female coyote on its Facebook page, saying it was part of the Snapshot USA project, a nationwide study using camera traps in suburban, rural, wild and urban areas across all 50 states. The zoo said conservation biologist Tremie Greogry would upload images into the Wildlife Insights database, which is the world’s largest camera trap database. Anyone can upload analyze and share camera trap photos with the conservation community in order to sample mammal populations. The Smithsonian Zoo said the eastern coyote captured in the photo is a recent arrival to Rock Creek, migrating to the area around 2016. The National Park Service has said the first recorded sighting of a coyote in the park was in May 2004. Last year, a coyote was spotted on the National Mall, and another coyote had to be killed after it attacked three people in the Rockville area.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The state’s surgeon general said that conversations while wearing masks aren’t productive and that he offered to meet elsewhere when a state senator didn’t let him in her office without a mask, citing a serious health condition. Dr. Joseph Ladapo said in a statement released Tuesday that he offered to meet outside or in a hallway for his scheduled meeting last week with Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky. He said he doesn’t believe he can communicate clearly and effectively while wearing a mask. Polsky was not satisfied, he said. “Having a conversation with someone while wearing a mask is not something I find productive, especially when other options exist,” Ladapo said in a statement posted on Twitter. The incident drew broad attention over the weekend after Polsky revealed that she had breast cancer, though at the time of the meeting last Wednesday she hadn’t disclosed that publicly and told Lapado only that she had a serious health condition. Ladapo said in his statement that he’s “saddened” by that news and wished her “blessings and strength.” Polsky said in a statement that Ladapo’s excuse for not wanting to wear a mask was “absurd” and “insulting.” She said that after the meeting was abruptly canceled, Ladapo was heard saying to his aides that he was “having fun” arguing with the senator.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Faced with deadlocked jurors, a judge on Tuesday declared a mistrial in the case of three former sheriff’s deputies accused of murdering a Black man whom they had repeatedly shocked with stun guns during a 2017 arrest. Senior Judge H. Gibbs Flanders Jr. granted the defense motions for mistrials on the charges against Henry Lee Copeland, Michael Howell and Rhett Scott in the death of Eurie Martin, 58. The jury foreman told the judge that no jurors in the Sandersville courtroom had changed their minds since Friday, the first day of deliberations, and that more time was unlikely to lead to the unanimity needed for convictions or acquittals. Martin had a history of schizophrenia and was walking through the central Georgia town of Deepstep on a scorching day in July 2017, taking a 30-mile journey to see his relatives for his birthday. A resident called 911 to report Martin as suspicious after he approached the person and asked for a drink of water. Responding officers said Martin refused to stop walking, threw down a soda can and took an aggressive stance, prompting them to fire their stun guns when he didn’t follow instructions. Beyond murder, the fired deputies faced charges of involuntary manslaughter, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, simple assault and reckless conduct.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Some Native Hawaiians are objecting to President Joe Biden’s choice for U.S. attorney in the 50th state, saying Clare Connors treated dozens of elders like criminals when her office prosecuted them for blocking a road while protesting the construction of a mountaintop telescope. “She has acted aggressively towards the Hawaiian people during all of our stand for Mauna Kea,” said Kealoha Pisciotta, one of the protest leaders. Pisciotta and other Native Hawaiians who oppose the telescope believe the summit of Mauna Kea is sacred. They say building the Thirty Meter Telescope on the state’s tallest mountain would further desecrate a place already defiled by a dozen other observatories. The 38 Native Hawaiian elders prosecuted for obstruction were in their 60s through 80s, and many of them are community leaders. Pisciotta said she’s concerned about Connors being named U.S. attorney because Native Hawaiians have been deprived of their land and their right to self-determination since the U.S.-backed overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. “I think of her as a danger to many situations in Hawaii because she doesn’t have to seem to have the compassion or the aloha that is needed considering our political situation,” Pisciotta said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal court has rejected a request by the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee, which argues its rights were violated while campaigning at a school on Election Day. The court last week denied the committee’s request to grant a permanent injunction that would have forced the Coeur d’Alene School District to allow groups to hand out election materials on school grounds even if they interfered with kids getting to school. The court didn’t rule on the merits of the case, which continues. But the court found that the group was unlikely to win the case because, among other things, it misinterpreted Idaho’s campaign-free-zone election law. Specifically, the committee argues that it can hand out election materials anywhere on school grounds as long as the group is more than 100 feet from the building where voting is taking place. While campaigning is allowed at schools, the district contends it can prevent electioneering within 100 feet of campus grounds if groups are interfering with kids going to class. “While Plaintiffs seemingly believe that Idaho (law) is meant to protect their right to electioneer 101 feet or more from the polling place, the language of the statute instead illustrates that it is meant to protect voters from interference,” Chief U.S. District Court Judge David C. Nye wrote.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state Senate voted Tuesday to repeal a law requiring that parents or guardians be notified when girls younger than 18 are seeking an abortion. Building on momentum among abortion rights activists after September’s Texas “heartbeat” law banned most of the procedures there, Democrats who control the General Assembly in Illinois want to dump the 1995 law requiring notification, which both sides of the debate call the last restriction on abortions in the state. But with a 32-22 tally in favor of repeal, the count fell short of approval of all who make up the Democrats’ 41-18 advantage, showing the reticence among moderate Democrats on a law whose proposed repeal now moves to the House with two days left in the General Assembly’s fall session. Republicans have repeatedly pointed out that notification has the support of nearly three-quarters of Illinoisans responding to a poll conducted last spring. And they publicized the nearly 50,000 notices of opposition filed electronically before the vote. Opponents say the notification law, adopted by GOP majorities in 1995 but not in effect until 2013 amid legal challenges, is a means of denying abortion rights to teenagers by delaying the procedure. They say it’s a hindrance to those who live in abusive environments and are intimidated by an alternative process – pleading their case to a judge.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An external review of state police agencies found they need to bolster the recruitment and promotion of minority and female officers and increase training about racial bias. The findings are part of a 100-page report released Monday that was commissioned by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb following demonstrations across the country and state last year protesting the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The consulting firm Hillard Heintze acknowledged attempts by Indiana State Police to recruit more diverse officer candidates, while citing that white men made up more than 80% of promotions and reassignments in 2018-20. One agency strategy of sending white officers to barbershops and restaurants in predominately Black communities to talk about the job was viewed as “offensive or patronizing” by some Black ISP officers, according to the report. “The ISP provides its members with cultural awareness education and training taught by command-level personnel, demonstrating its importance to the organization. However, this training does not include a discussion of implicit bias or actions officers could take to reduce the influence of implicit bias when interacting with their colleagues and community members,” the study said.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A woman who alleged she was sexually assaulted at a University of Iowa fraternity is suing two men and the fraternity. The lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges two members of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, also known as Iowa FIJI, assaulted her at a party at the fraternity in September 2020. She also alleges the assault was filmed and photographed, with the images widely circulated. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages from the two men and the fraternity. It also names Mu Deuteron, the corporate entity under which FIJI’s chapter at the school operates, and the Phi Gamma Delta Educational Foundation, a nonprofit based in Kentucky. The two men were expelled from the fraternity. The lack of charges prompted several protests on the University of Iowa campus, including on Aug. 31, when about 1,000 people gathered outside the fraternity house and a second location calling for action on the case and to abolish the fraternity. An online petition making similar demands had more than 167,000 signatures as of Tuesday.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: A sheriff’s deputy caught on dashcam video running over a Black man who was fleeing shirtless across a field is now working at the Hutchinson Correctional Facility while under criminal investigation, according to the attorney for the injured man. Lionel Womack, a former police detective from Kansas City, Kansas, alleges in an excessive-force lawsuit filed last year that Kiowa County Sheriff’s Deputy Jeremy Rodriguez intentionally drove over him during the Aug. 15, 2020, incident that was captured on dashcam video. Womack says he sustained serious injuries to his back, pelvis, and right thigh, knee and foot. In a court filing responding to the lawsuit, Rodriguez denied he intentionally swerved his truck to run over Womack. The deputy said he learned later that Womack did not possess a weapon. Rodriguez is currently under criminal investigation by federal and state authorities over the incident. Attorney Michael Kuckelman, who represents Womack, wrote in a letter Tuesday to Kansas Secretary of Corrections Jefferey Zmuda and Warden Dan Schnurr that he was “shocked” to learn in a deposition that they would employ Rodriguez, who works as a master sergeant at the facility.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library book gifting program is expanding throughout Kentucky, the state’s Department of Education announced Tuesday. With the goal of inspiring a love of reading, the voluntary program gives books each month to children from infancy to 5 years old, free of charge to families, through funding shared by Parton, Kentucky’s state government and community partners. “I’m so excited and want to thank everyone partnering with us to make more dreams come true for children and families in Kentucky,” said Parton, a country music icon, actress and philanthropist from neighboring Tennessee. State funding will help increase registration in existing Kentucky Imagination Library programs and find community partners to start new ones, the state said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state will receive $595 million in federal disaster block grant aid to help with housing restoration and other recovery needs from last year’s back-to-back blows of hurricanes Laura and Delta, Louisiana’s U.S. senators announced Tuesday. While welcomed by officials as critical to rebuilding efforts in southwest Louisiana, the money falls far short of the multibillion-dollar estimates of need, offering only about 20% of the $3 billion in assistance requested by Gov. John Bel Edwards. It also comes 14 months after Laura wrecked the Lake Charles region – a delay that had locals questioning whether the nation had forgotten them. “It has been over a year since Louisiana was hammered by Hurricane Laura and this relief has taken far too long,” Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy said in a statement. “This funding is a welcome first step, but there is more work to be done to return southwest Louisiana to wholeness.” GOP U.S. Sen. John Kennedy said the money will provide “a helping hand as we rebuild” but said residents “are still reeling.” Edwards said Louisiana already is drafting its spending proposal for submission once the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issues its regulations. But the Democratic governor also suggested the state will be requesting more federal assistance.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor has announced a series of programs including tuition forgiveness to help the state navigate a need for more health care workers. One of the programs will provide $4 million in tuition support via scholarships and student loan relief to help students pursuing careers in nursing and other health professions, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said Monday. The state will also use $8.5 million for tuition forgiveness to provide money to health care employers and workers to help the workers gain new skills and earn advanced credentials, she said. Another program will use $1.5 million to create a public service campaign to promote health care professions and try to recruit people into the fields, Mills said. The Democratic governor said the state will implement the moves by the end of the year. Maine has lost jobs during the pandemic, and more than 10% of that loss has come in the health care workforce. Health care facilities across the state “have had to grapple with a shortage of workers, and the pandemic has only made the problem worse,” Mills said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A congressman announced Wednesday that he has deactivated his official congressional and campaign Facebook and Instagram accounts until their parent company and Congress make substantial reforms to protect children, health and democratic values. Democratic U.S. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger said his decision follows disturbing whistleblower reports about the company’s own research revealing harm to democracy, the mental health of teens and the amplification of hate speech. In a news release, Ruppersberger cited a report in The Washington Post that Facebook’s algorithm at one time treated “angry” reactions as five times more valuable than “likes,” disproportionately promoting content that was likely to include “misinformation, toxicity and low-quality news.” “Facebook’s basic business model sows division and disinformation and I can no longer use it – and promote it from my official mediums – in good conscience for the time being,” Ruppersberger said. “While Facebook must do better to police themselves, Congress must also act and pass reasonable social media reforms.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously disputed portrayals of the company as one that puts profit over the well-being of its users or pushes divisive content. Ruppersberger said his Twitter account will remain active. He also emphasized that he and his staff are available to take constituents’ calls, emails – even faxes.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Officials are weighing creating a commission to account for the city’s role in slavery and potentially provide reparations to Black residents. The City Council’s Committee on Civil Rights held a hearing Tuesday to hear from Black community activists, academics and the public on how the city can approach the issue. Dr. Jemadari Kamara, a professor of Africana Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston, was among a number of people who spoke in favor of forming a commission on reparations, noting that San Francisco and other major cities have already taken similar steps. Kevin Peterson, founder of the New Democracy Coalition that’s been pushing for years for the city to recognize its role in the slave trade, was among those who stressed that the Black community needs to drive the reparations process. “Any committee must be Black-led and Black-controlled,” he said. “Let Black people lead on the issue.” Many of those testifying said racist policies that persisted in Boston long after slavery ended have led to wide disparities in family incomes, homeownership and other measures between Black and white residents. The city was rocked by violent, racial protests in the 1970s and 1980s as public schools were forcibly desegregated through court order.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would eliminate the so-called tampon tax on menstrual products, sending the bill to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is expected to sign it into law. Michigan would join over 20 other states that have either ended the sales tax on menstrual products or never had one, according to Period Equity, a legal organization that advocates for making menstrual products tax-exempt. Though several bills to end the tampon tax were introduced in the Legislature in the past five years, none of those bills made it to a floor vote. Both chambers in the Republican-controlled Legislature have voted in the past month to approve lifting the tax. The Democratic governor has backed efforts to abolish the tax in Michigan. One of the sponsors of the bills passed Tuesday, Sen. Winnie Brinks, said it’s been a long road to get the elimination of the tampon tax this far, but she is thankful for everyone who has supported the effort in the past. “This is a commonsense move that will reduce an unfair tax burden that is placed on only half of Michigan’s population for a significant portion of our lives,” the Grand Rapids Democrat said. “These bills will move Michigan toward a fairer tax structure, which is a goal I think we all share regardless of which side of the aisle we sit on.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The case of a man who waited two days for an intensive care bed and later died is among several examples that have frustrated officials in rural hospitals whose facilities are overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. Bob Cameron, 87, spent two days in his hometown hospital in Hallock, Minnesota, where caregivers searched nonstop for space in a larger hospital that could find and fix the source of his severe gastrointestinal bleeding and treat his COVID-19. The bleeding exhausted the hospital’s blood supply, so state troopers shuttled new units 130 miles from Fargo, North Dakota, to Hallock to keep Cameron alive. A bed was secured Oct. 12 at Sanford Health in Fargo, but his condition worsened after surgery there to find the source of his bleeding. He died Oct. 13, the Star Tribune reports. “We can’t say for certain, of course, that if he got to an ICU bed sooner that he would have survived, but we just feel in our hearts that he would have,” said Cameron’s granddaughter, Janna Curry. During a three-week stretch this month, rural hospitals were caring for more COVID-19 patients than Twin Cities hospitals. “We’re playing tag back and forth between Aitkin, Crosby, Brainerd and Princeton,” said Dr. Arden Virnig, supervisor of a five-bed ER at Mille Lacs Health System in Onamia, Minnesota.\n\nMississippi\n\nMadison: A racially diverse school in central Mississippi is honoring its namesake – a woman who was a leader in ensuring Black children received education when the state was deeply segregated. Descendants of Rosa Scott were on campus Monday at Rosa Scott High School, a campus for about 400 ninth graders in the Madison County School District. “Because of her, many African American children began to be educated,” Scott’s great-granddaughter, Maryann Gaylor Kennedy, told WLBT-TV. Scott was born in 1874, was educated at Fisk University, and worked as a teacher and principal in Madison County. She led an effort to raise money for a school that opened in Madison in the 1920s. Scott died in 1938, and her gravesite is part of the courtyard on the current campus. When a new school was built in 1959, it was named for Scott. During the ceremony Monday, principals, educators and alumni talked about the school’s impact and Scott’s mission of advancement. Her family gave the school a copy of Scott’s biography written by one of her granddaughters, Rose Mary Collum Gaylor. Students designed a flag for the school, giving replicas to the family. “Rosa Scott was a powerhouse,” another of her granddaughters, Margaret Bernstein, told WJTV-TV. “She really understood that education is the key to success, and she wanted to unlock that for Black children, so that’s why it was important to be here today.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A man alleges in a lawsuit that police officers punched, kicked and stomped on him before illegally searching the apartment he shared with his girlfriend after claiming he had committed a minor traffic violation. The lawsuit was filed in federal court Monday on behalf of Tranell Stewart, 38, and his former girlfriend, Lisa Jones, against five Maryland Heights police officers and the city of Maryland Heights, a St. Louis suburb. It accuses the officers of unlawful seizure, excessive force and unlawful search. It also accuses the city of liability, charging that Maryland Heights has not addressed years of police stopping and searching Black motorists at rates far above their representation in the city. The city, the police department and the police union did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Stewart pulled into the parking lot of his apartment complex Oct. 26, 2016. Officer David Devouton pulled behind his car and told him he had failed to use his turn signal, which Stewart denied, according to the lawsuit. When Stewart tried to get out of his car to get to his infant son from the back seat, Devouton grabbed Stewart’s hair and tried to pull him to the ground, saying, “You’re going to die today,” the lawsuit says. Stewart said he suffered a fractured nose, a black eye, and emotional pain and fear.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A preliminary report on an Amtrak train derailment last month that killed three people and injured dozens more offered no clues about what triggered the accident but said that the train’s emergency brakes were activated and that Amtrak estimated the damage at more than $22 million. However, one attorney whose client is suing Amtrak and BNSF Railway said he wanted to learn more about the crashworthiness of the train’s observation car, and an attorney for a crew member said she reported seeing a 30-foot dip along the railroad, where it appeared the track bed had given way. The National Transportation Safety Board issued its preliminary report Tuesday on the Sept. 25 derailment of the westbound Empire Builder just west of Joplin, in north-central Montana. It was mostly factual, saying that there were 154 people on board and that 44 passengers and crew were taken to area hospitals with injuries. Passengers without serious injuries were bused to the nearby town of Chester, where residents provided food and other aid. The train was traveling at between 75 and 78 miles per hour, just below the speed limit of 79 mph on that section of track, when its emergency brakes were activated. The two locomotives and two railcars remained on the rails, and eight cars derailed.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts has split with former President Donald Trump over which Republican candidate should become his successor as governor. Trump on Monday endorsed Falls City businessman Charles Herbster, a close political ally. Shortly after the announcement, Ricketts released a statement arguing that Herbster isn’t qualified to serve in the role. “While I agree with President Trump on many things, I strongly disagree that Charles Herbster is qualified to be our next governor,” said Ricketts, who can’t seek reelection in 2022 due to term limits. In a statement, Trump praised Herbster as “an extraordinarily successful businessman who will fight for our farmers and ranchers, support our military and vets, and protect and defend your under siege Second Amendment rights.” Ricketts hasn’t formally endorsed a candidate in the GOP governor’s primary race, but he has made several public appearances with University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, and several of his close political allies work on Pillen’s campaign. Several other other Republicans have launched campaigns, including state Sen. Brett Lindstrom, of Omaha, and Breland Ridenour, an information technology manager. Former Gov. Dave Heineman has said he may run as well, as has Herbster’s former running mate, former state Sen. Theresa Thibodeau.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A private-public partnership has expanded a local program providing mobile shower trailers for homeless people through the Clean the World nonprofit, officials said. Clark County, Caesars Entertainment and the Caesars Foundation announced a three-year commitment Monday to split what Clean the World founder and CEO Shawn Seipler said is about a $250,000-a-year cost. Trailers offer four individual shower stalls with a toilet and sink, and users are provided hygiene kits including soap, shampoo, toothbrush and toothpaste. One stall is compliant with disability accessibility requirements. Visits usually last 20 to 30 minutes. Clean the World trailers have made the rounds in southern Nevada since 2017, providing some 28,000 showers and 30,000 hygiene kits, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Trailers typically park for about four hours at nonprofit service centers in and around the city. Seipler said shower users might also seek help with job placement, drug rehabilitation, mental health care or legal issues. “As folks come to us to shower on a regular basis, they start to build relationships with those that are there,” he said. Partner agencies sometimes also offer health screenings, vaccinations for hepatitis and COVID-19, along with other services.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A drive-in theater and a bandstand are among the historic properties on this year’s “Seven to Save” list from the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance. The list, announced Tuesday, highlights vulnerable historic resources and related threats to community life and economic well-being. The Weirs Drive-In Theater and surrounding land are on the list. It’s the largest of three remaining drive-in theaters in the state and is currently for sale. The theater stands on land that was heavily used by Indigenous people for fishing-related activities as much as 10,000 years ago. Also on the list is the Milford Bandstand, which was built on the town’s Oval in 1896 for the Milford Cornet Band’s summer concerts. “This significant Victorian bandstand now requires extensive renovation to continue to serve future generations as a focal point for community gatherings and activities,” the alliance said in a news release. Two Cornish Colony properties in transition share a spot on the list: the Blow-Me-Down Farm and the Percy MacKaye Home. Opera North is renovating part of the farm, and descendants of MacKaye are seeking new preservation/stewardship solutions for his home and studio. Also listed are the United Baptist Church in Laconia, built in 1892; the Wilder-Holton House in Lancaster, built in 1780; and the Newington Railroad Depot, built in 1873. The alliance also is featuring a thematic listing of the state’s historic theaters, many of which were already struggling when the pandemic struck.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBerkeley Township: Governments, academics and scientists are proposing an ambitious effort to improve the health of Barnegat Bay, a fragile waterway that “has been loved to death.” The Barnegat Bay Partnership, a constellation of groups dedicated to helping the bay, on Tuesday unveiled a detailed and far-reaching plan to improve water quality, increase the number of days that bay beaches are open for swimming, increase the amount of shellfish, and address an explosion of jellyfish in the bay that are making parts of it difficult to use. Officials from federal, state and local governments signed the pledge, but it remains to be seen what, if any, specific actions will be taken in furtherance of those goals. “The Barnegat Bay in its current state is a jewel of the Jersey Shore, but it has some serious problems,” said Stan Hales, director of the partnership. “The bay has been loved to death.” Environmentalists and government officials have long recognized threats to Barnegat Bay, including rampant development along its shorelines and interior watershed areas, as well as the resulting flow of pesticides and nitrogen from lawn fertilizer and agricultural uses that makes its way into the bay. That helps contribute to decreased oxygen levels, which harms fish, shellfish and plant life and can turbocharge jellyfish populations, which thrive in degraded water.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: It’s been years in the making, and now officials say the first leg of a major renewable energy transmission line has been energized. The New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority made the announcement Tuesday, saying the Western Spirit project is expected to be in operation by the end of the year. The transmission line will carry wind-generated power to the grid in New Mexico and other Western markets. The project involved a novel public-private partnership between the transmission authority and Pattern Energy, which is developing a collection of wind farms in the state. New Mexico’s largest electric utility, Public Service Co. of New Mexico, will acquire and operate the transmission line when it’s complete. State officials said the transmission line will be important as New Mexico aims to eliminate carbon emissions within the utility sector over the next two decades. RETA Board Chairman Robert Busch said in a statement that the successful development of the transmission line and the state’s energy policies are spurring interest from renewable energy and transmission developers. He said the line enables new investment of more than $1.5 billion in renewable generation and transmission in the state.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayoral candidates lobbed accusations at each other about palling around with gangsters and acting like children or clowns, but their second debate ended on a surprisingly tender note involving cats and veganism. A week before the city of 8.8 million people votes to pick a new mayor, Democrat Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa laid out their plans Tuesday for addressing rising violent crime and how to chart a path out of the pandemic’s deadly wake. It was the second meeting between Adams, the Brooklyn Borough president and former New York City police captain who is widely expected to win the election in the heavily Democratic city, and Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol who’s known for his signature red beret, streetwise proclamations and penchant for stunts. On the pandemic, Adams supports a mandate from outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio that city workers such as police officers and firefighters get vaccinated against COVID-19 or be placed on unpaid leave. But Adams said he would have had more discussions with the workers’ unions before announcing the policy. The rivals were asked to pay each other compliments as they wrapped up the debate. Adams complimented Sliwa for adopting and rescuing cats, 16 of which he and his wife keep in their small Manhattan apartment. Sliwa praised Adams for promoting his vegan lifestyle, saying it “has already probably helped dozens, maybe hundreds, maybe thousands of people.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Dozens of residents have weighed in to say Republicans should shelve proposed congressional district maps that would likely give the GOP the most seats for the foreseeable future while needlessly fracturing the state’s largest counties. Republicans and Democrats have spent the past few weeks creating separate redistricting maps. During the first of two days of public hearings on them, speakers criticized GOP proposals that could make at least 10 of the state’s 14 U.S. House districts favorable to Republican candidates. Republicans currently hold an 8-5 advantage in the state’s congressional ranks, but North Carolina will get another member through at least 2032 because of population gains recorded by the 2020 census. Maps most favorable to Republicans would split predominantly Democratic Mecklenburg and Wake counties among at least three districts, some of which would spill into more conservative and rural surrounding counties, thereby making it harder for Democrats to win. “This is not fair, since North Carolina is a half-and-half state with the two parties,” Kathy Wheeler of Guilford County told redistricting committee members at the Legislative Building. “The maps proposed by Republican members dilute Democratic votes and deprive communities of effective representation.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Enrollment declines at the state’s institutions of higher learning since the COVID-19 pandemic began haven’t been as steep as elsewhere, and some have bucked the trend entirely. According to a new report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, enrollment across the country at colleges and universities is down 6.5% compared to two years ago – the largest two-year enrollment drop in the past 50 years. North Dakota’s numbers haven’t been nearly so steep, and in the case of some universities, including Dickinson State University, enrollment has increased, KFYR-TV reports. “Students that are interested or deciding to go college, that number is kind of going down. But we, in this specific area of the country, don’t have that quite as much as other areas. So we still have a pretty good pool of students that are graduating and going to college,” said Stephanie Osborne, DSU’s admissions director. Overall, North Dakota colleges and universities experienced a 3.4% decrease in enrollment from 2019 and a 1.4% decrease from 2020. Other schools that have actually seen enrollment increases since 2019 include Dakota College at Bottineau, Valley City State University and the University of North Dakota.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state is adjusting its quarantine recommendations for schools in hopes of keeping students and educators in class more even if they’re exposed to someone with the coronavirus in a school setting or activity. The guidance is optional for schools and applies only when direct exposure happens in a school environment, not outside school. Under the “mask to stay” part of the approach, even exposed students who were unmasked and unvaccinated could remain in class rather than quarantining at home as long as they wear a mask for 14 days after their last exposure, monitor for COVID-19 symptoms and get tested if they have symptoms. If they don’t develop symptoms and test negative for the virus between the fifth and seventh days, they could stop those extra precautions. The other part of the guidance, dubbed “test to play,” allows asymptomatic contacts to keep participating in extracurricular activities if they wear a mask when able and get tested both when they’re notified they’ve been exposed to the virus and again between the fifth and seventh day. A negative result on that second test would allow them to resume normal activity after the seventh day. The guidance also encourages districts to consider same-day testing for athletic competitions with potential for school-to-school exposure.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A federal judge ruled Monday that the state can move forward with scheduled lethal injections for five death row inmates, including Julius Jones, whose case has drawn international attention and who is scheduled to die Nov. 28. Judge Stephen Friot denied a motion for a preliminary injunction sought by the five inmates, paving the way for the state to proceed with seven lethal injections scheduled over the next six months. The state is scheduled to conduct its first execution in more than six years Thursday, when John Marion Grant, 60, is set to receive a lethal injection for the 1998 killing of a prison cafeteria worker. Grant, Jones and three other death row inmates were removed from a federal lawsuit challenging the state’s three-drug lethal injection protocol because none of the five offered an alternative method of execution. A trial on that challenge is scheduled before Friot in February. “The case is complete in this court as to these five plaintiffs,” Friot said. Twenty-six of the 32 Oklahoma death row inmates who were on the original challenge provided the court with an alternative method of execution, including the use of different drug combinations or firing squad. Attorneys for the five inmates vowed to immediately appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city’s school board ended an in-person meeting amid controversy over a proposed COVID-19 vaccine mandate for children 12 and older after unmasked protesters showed up and refused to don face coverings. The board that oversees the state’s largest school district resumed its meeting with online streaming Tuesday after protesters refused to comply with requests from security guards to put on masks, according to a statement from Portland Public Schools. Some of the protesters were not from Portland but traveled from elsewhere in Oregon and Washington state, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Conversely, earlier in the day, about 500 students walked out of class in support of the proposed vaccine mandate. Rules to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in schools, such as a statewide school mask mandate for all children, have generated protests in other districts and school boards, and superintendents are often the focus of such actions. In Redmond, critics of state mandates have crowded board meetings and dominated public comment periods. In Adrian, school board members voted to fire Superintendent Kevin Purnell when he refused to buck state policy, the newspaper reports. The Portland school board is set to vote on the vaccine mandate for students older than 12 on Nov. 2.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Prosecutors have dropped a felony theft charge against a man who underpaid for a bottle of Mountain Dew by 43 cents. Perry County prosecutors dropped the theft charge this month against Joseph Sobolewski, 38, and downgraded another charge, the Patriot-News reports. In August, Sobolewski went into an Exxon in Duncannon and saw a sign advertising two 20-ounce Mountain Dew bottles for $3, he said. He took one bottle, slapped $2 on the counter for what he thought was a $1.50 soda and walked out, not realizing the discount did not apply to a single bottle. The bottle really cost $2.29, so including tax, he owed the store 43 cents. State police found Sobolewski and arrested him on a felony charge. A judge ordered him held on $50,000 cash-only bond. He was in jail for seven days before his public defender successfully argued for his release, the newspaper reports. Sobolewski had twice in the past 10 years been charged with theft, once for not paying for a tank of gas and another time for stealing a pair of shoes from a store. Under Pennsylvania’s three-strikes law, a third theft charge must be a felony, regardless of the amount or value involved. He faced up to seven years in prison.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The land where the Rhode Island Narragansett tribe survived near-annihilation in a battle with English colonists in 1675 has been transferred to the tribe. The transfer of the land from the Rhode Island Historical Society was finalized Friday. Tribal members gathered Saturday in the woods in South Kingstown at a monument commemorating what they believe to be the site of the Great Swamp Massacre, The Public’s Radio reports. They lit three fires representing the past, present and future and recognized the return of 5 acres of land they consider sacred. The tribe’s leaders in 1636 granted land to Roger Williams, an exile of the Puritan Massachusetts Bay colony who founded what became the city of Providence. Good relations with English colonists ended in the 1670s when the tribe was nearly destroyed in King Philip’s War. The battle was fought Dec. 19, 1675. Hundreds of tribal members were killed. In 1906, the family that owned the land gave it to the historical society to preserve it. The society has been working on the transfer for four years so the tribe itself could protect the land. It required court approval because the land was held in a trust. The Narragansetts are thankful, the tribe’s medicine man and historic preservation officer, John Brown III, told The Boston Globe. “For many years, the Narragansetts were visitors to a place that was theirs,” he said. “Now that this has happened, we know we can go back to a place of our forefathers, where there was happiness and sorrow, and we can go there as rightful owners.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The acting head of the state’s Office of Juvenile Justice says she faces a staffing crisis, with few applicants for hundreds of vacancies. Juvenile Justice corrections officers get $35,000 a year to start, but the shifts are grueling, and violence is an ever-present danger. Eden Hendrick, who was appointed after Freddie Pough resigned under fire a month ago, told legislators last week that she has more vacancies than working correction officers, The Post and Courier reports. “The applicant pool is the main problem,” she said. “There’s just no one that is applying right now,” The State newspaper reports. Hendrick told a state Senate corrections subcommittee that every recruiter in the office has left, so she plans to hire a recruiting company to find people interested in the 232 corrections officer vacancies. For now, she’s hired a part-time expert who used to recruit for the state Department of Corrections, The State reports. Hendrick also said she is stopping two programs started by Pough, who moved administrators to a building outside the main juvenile jail complex in Columbia and pushed to house juveniles with long sentences in regional facilities rather than the Broad River Road Complex. Regionalization is on indefinite hold because there isn’t enough staff or money, she said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBelle Fourche: Plans are in the works to build one of the largest ramen-producing facilities in the country in a small Black Hills community. CEO Bill Saller of California-based Albany Farms said the complex in Belle Fourche will include a flour mill, production factories and packaging areas that would produce more than 100 million packages of ramen each year and eventually employ up to 900 people. Belle Fourche Rail Park and the state’s agricultural economy are part of the plan, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Wheat will be brought to the factory, while ramen cups and packets will be shipped by train, Saller said. Albany Farms recently bought a building in Belle Fourche for its factory and is working on purchasing 11 of the surrounding acres, according to company spokeswoman Stephanie Magoon. The company manufactures its products overseas but decided it needed to switch gears once the pandemic hit. “With the onset of COVID, importing food became problematic. Transportation has become a major issue for food companies and certainly for us,” Saller said. Saller said the price for the company’s shipping containers has increased an average of $18,000 per container, doubling import costs. So the company decided to move all manufacturing to the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two bills introduced by lawmakers would forbid state licensing officials from disciplining doctors for how they treat COVID-19 or what they say about vaccines, potentially undermining a new effort to crack down on doctors who spread misinformation in the midst of the pandemic. State Reps. Debra Moody, R-Covington, and Chris Todd, R-Madison County, introduced bills Tuesday that each bar the Board of Medical Examiners and Board of Osteopathic Examination, which license and discipline physicians throughout the state, from taking any punitive action against a physician for the recommendations they make about COVID-19 treatment, mitigation or prevention. Moody’s bill protects any recommendation made “so long as the physician exercised independent medical judgment and believes the medical treatment is in the best interest of the patient.” Todd’s bill outlaws disciplining a physician “relating solely (to their) prescription, recommendation, use, or opinion relative to a treatment for COVID-19.” Dr. Stephen Loyd, a member of the Board of Medical Examiners who reviewed Todd’s bill, said he did not believe the legislation as written would have a great impact but conceded it might open the door for a doctor to argue that false claims were opinions protected under the law.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Voting rights advocates are suing the state again, this time with support from a former U.S. attorney general, over newly redrawn congressional district maps that favor the GOP, claiming the maps dilute the vote of communities of color after growth in America’s largest red state came overwhelmingly from Hispanic, Black and Asian American people. The lawsuit was filed Monday by Texas voters and Voto Latino, a voter advocacy organization, in an Austin federal court just moments after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the redrawn districts into law. Texas was the only state to be allocated two new congressional seats earlier this year after U.S. census figures showed the state’s population grew by 4 million people, nearly half of whom were Hispanic. The latest lawsuit alleges the new U.S. House maps violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act by not giving people of color a fair opportunity to elect their representatives. The maps do not include any additional districts in which Black or Hispanic voters make up more than 50% of eligible voters. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Jr., who leads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and whose affiliate organization, the National Redistricting Action Fund, is supporting the lawsuit, said the maps, which pave potentially safer paths for Texas’ majority GOP incumbents to remain in office, were a “desperate grasp for partisan political power.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop abruptly quit the state’s independent redistricting commission after criticizing it for favoring urban areas. Bishop, a Republican, said Monday that the commission’s congressional map proposals favored Democrats. The commission will present its map proposals to the Legislature’s redistricting committee Nov. 1. “This is a metro-centric group,” Bishop said during the meeting. “When five of the seven are from the Wasatch Front … the majority are from Salt Lake County, we see things in a different way.” House Speaker Brad Wilson, who appointed Bishop to the panel, said he shared Bishop’s frustrations with the commission and does not plan to appoint a replacement. “His decision to step down at this point in the process is further evidence that the duly elected representatives of the people are best suited to redraw district boundaries, as the courts have repeatedly affirmed,” Wilson said in a statement. Better Boundaries, the group behind the 2018 ballot initiative that created the independent commission, said it was disappointed by Bishop’s resignation. “Moving forward, we are encouraged by the work of the remaining six commissioners to suggest objective and qualified maps to the state legislative redistricting committee through this fair and transparent process,” Executive Director Katie Wright said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that he wouldn’t reimpose a state of emergency that would authorize him to put a statewide mask mandate back in place as the delta variant has driven an increase in coronavirus cases. Speaking at a weekly briefing about Vermont’s response to the pandemic, Scott said he doesn’t want to overuse the emergency power he has as governor. “There’s a time and a place for a state of emergency, and I can assure you this isn’t it,” he said. “And I believe that we’ll get through this with all the measures, all the mitigation measures we put into place and doing all the right things and taking some self-responsibility.” Scott said he’s also more optimistic about the future of the pandemic than he has been in weeks: Booster shots have been approved for most people over 18 who have already been vaccinated, the federal government is expected to authorize in the coming weeks vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, and COVID-19 case numbers are starting to decrease across the country and in Vermont. Still, a group of lawmakers, school nurses, and other medical professionals on Monday urged Scott to reinstate the state of emergency and indoor mask mandate, saying school staff, parents, hospitals and health care workers are stressed coping with the pandemic, some to the breaking point.\n\nVirginia\n\nPortsmouth: Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy will partner with Dominion Energy on a $200 million factory making turbine blades for offshore wind projects, creating 310 jobs, Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday. Virginia-based Dominion previously selected the Spanish company as its partner for its $7.8 billion energy generation project 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. The Siemens Gamesa factory at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal will produce turbine blades for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project as well as other offshore wind energy generators around North America. The factory project includes more than $80 million in investments for buildings and equipment at the terminal, where about 50 new service jobs are expected to support the effort. Over the next 10 years, building and operating the offshore wind industry will be worth $109 billion to businesses in its supply chain, according to a recent report from the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind. That figure is up from the group’s $70 billion estimate just two years ago. “Virginians want renewable energy, our employers want it, and Virginia is delivering it,” Northam said in a statement. “Make no mistake: Virginia is building a new industry in renewable energy, with more new jobs to follow, and that’s good news for our country.”\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: An investigation headed by a former U.S. attorney has found a sheriff violated policies against bias-free policing and other standards during a controversial January encounter with a Black newspaper carrier. The 48-page report by Brian Moran, released Tuesday, faulted Pierce County Sheriff Ed Troyer’s late-night decision to follow a car driven by then-24-year old Sedrick Altheimer and subsequently call in a large emergency response with claims that Altheimer threatened to kill him. “We are unable to substantiate Sheriff Troyer’s claim that Mr. Altheimer threatened to kill or harm him during that incident,” a summary of Moran’s report said. “We also find that a reasonable person could conclude that Sheriff Troyer exhibited an improper bias in his confrontation with Mr. Altheimer.” The Seattle Times reports the findings, commissioned by the Pierce County Council, found Troyer, who is white, violated professional conduct policies against bias-free policing and engaging in law enforcement activities while off duty, among others. It concluded Troyer may not have known Altheimer’s race when he first began following him in the early morning hours of Jan. 27, but he did know when he called a 911 emergency dispatcher.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Halloween is still days away, but the West Virginia Division of Highways is thinking ahead to keep drivers safe in snow and ice this winter. Drivers in the division’s District 1 just finished “dry runs” for winter snowplow routes. “We want to make sure that our trucks are well-maintained, greased and that all the equipment is working properly,” said District 1 Maintenance Engineer Kathy Rushworth. Running snowplow routes early allows drivers to familiarize themselves with their routes and get used to driving the plows. District 1 has 215 drivers assigned to drive plows in the snow and ice. They’re the same men and women responsible for cutting grass, trimming trees, cutting ditches and doing other maintenance work during spring, summer and fall. The district has plows dedicated to Boone, Clay, Kanawha, Mason and Putnam counties. Other snowplows are responsible for clearing snow and ice on U.S. 35 and interstates 64, 77 and 79.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Republican-controlled Assembly gave final approval Wednesday to a package of anti-abortion bills, many of which Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed two years ago and is all but certain to reject again. Republicans do not have enough votes in the Legislature to override a veto. Republicans said they were trying again because the measures are a priority, and there’s a chance Evers will change his mind. Democrats, who all voted against the bills, accused Republicans of only taking up the bills to energize conservatives ahead of the 2022 midterm election. One bill, which Evers vetoed in 2019, would impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance in which a baby is born alive following an abortion attempt. Violators would be guilty of a felony punishable by up to six years in prison. The bill also would make intentionally causing the death of a child born alive as a result of an abortion a felony punishable by life in prison. Doctors insist the bill is a solution in search of a problem. They and other opponents say babies are almost never born alive during failed abortion attempts, and in the rare instances in which they are, doctors are already ethically and legally bound to try and keep them alive.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Requiring workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 would result in up to $10 million in fines and at least $500,000 in damages under bills state lawmakers will consider in a rare special session that began Tuesday. In all, they plan to look at 20 proposals – including a few having nothing to do with President Joe Biden’s plans to require COVID-19 vaccination for certain workers – over the next several days after legislators debated whether to adjourn without considering anything at all. The House and Senate voted to move ahead despite rejecting timesaving rules to limit testimony and debate and prohibit bills unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination in an effort to wrap up the session in just three days. “In five days we are going to have hundreds of people, potentially thousands, who are going to lose their jobs because of a mandate,” said Rep. Chuck Gray, R-Casper, the lead sponsor of a bill that would allow people denied work because they’re not vaccinated to collect at least $500,000 in civil damages. A bill sponsored by Rep. Bill Fortner, R-Gillette, would fine any public servant who tries to enforce any COVID-19 vaccine mandate up to $10 million. Schools would be barred from enforcing student mask-wearing and vaccination against any disease under a bill sponsored by Rep. Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie. Wyoming has been one the most vaccine-resistant states, behind only West Virginia, and as a result has one of the highest case rates in the U.S. over recent months.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/28"}]}

Capano, was trying to answer that question when she wedged herself into the white Igloo cooler that played a grisly role in one of the most sensational and dramatic court cases in Delaware history.\n\nIt was a key piece of evidence in the haunting case that still resonates 20 years after Capano's November 1997 arrest because it echoes current headlines: men in positions of power trying to exert absolute control over their alleged victims.\n\nThe 12-week trial kept the public riveted from October 1998 to January 1999.\n\nCapano had apparently stuffed the 5-foot-10-inch body of his younger, secret girlfriend, Anne Marie Fahey, into the ice chest after she was shot to death at his home with a gun bought by Deborah A. MacIntyre, one of his other longtime mistresses. Capano, married with four daughters, would later blame MacIntyre for Fahey's death.\n\nThe day after Fahey's mysterious June 1996 death, Capano, with the help of his youngest brother, Gerry, used the cooler to transport Fahey's body to Gerry's boat Summer Wind at Stone Harbor, New Jersey.\n\nSummer Wind motored east about 60 to 75 miles, Gerry testified, where he then gave his brother an anchor and chain and turned his back on the scene unfolding on deck. Gerry told the court that Tom Capano vomited, then put a body into the ocean. According to testimony, he turned around in time to see a human foot sink into the deep waters.\n\nTom Capano told his attorney Joseph S. Oteri that he first rejected putting Fahey's body into a brand-new garbage can. Instead, Capano used a 40½-gallon cooler, purchased two months before Fahey's death. Capano’s brother Joseph, who died of a heart attack in 2015, said he told Tom to buy the cooler as a gift for brother Gerry.\n\nTwo and half years after Fahey died, the jury hearing Capano's murder trial was sequestered at the Hilton Wilmington/Christiana near Stanton.\n\nDeliberations lasted three days.\n\nCapano case:For complete coverage, including past stories, videos and more\n\n\"Honestly, a lot of people would be surprised to know that when we first went in to deliberate, first thing we did was take a poll to see where everybody stood and it was half and half,\" said Lee, who counted herself among the not-guilty votes.\n\nLee recalled one of the jurors said: \"'We should see if she could really just fit [into the cooler].'\"\n\nLee, 28 years old at the time and known as Erin Reilly, was just a few inches shorter and weighed about the same as Fahey. Sitting at a big table in a hotel conference room, she felt all eyes on her.\n\nAlthough one of her fellow jurors said she didn't need to do it, Lee agreed to climb into the 3-foot-8-inch hard-plastic cooler that served as a makeshift coffin. She left her high heels on to compensate for Fahey's height.\n\n\"This is important,\" Lee remembers telling herself. \"It's important for everybody. It's important for me because I didn't know.\"\n\nJurors helped the young woman into the cooler and then watched as Lee tried to \"squoosh myself smaller\" to give others an accurate picture.\n\n\"My eyes were closed for sure,\" she said. \"I'm not sure why. Probably because I didn't want to see.\"\n\nAs jurors attempted to shut the cooler's lid, Lee recalls being surrounded by a darkness she had never known.\n\nIn court testimony, Capano said he laid Fahey's body into the cooler on her side. He said he pushed her knees into a fetal position but insisted he broke no bones to make her body fit. Capano also said he had wrapped her body in a cotton blanket.\n\nBut Lee and the other jurors soon learned it wasn't the gentle tuck-in Capano had described.\n\nAs Lee squirmed inside the cooler, the lid wouldn't close. And that's when some of the jurors realized Fahey's bones might have been broken, or worse, to make the corpse fit.\n\nThe macabre situation, and the enormity of what had happened to Fahey, suddenly became real and overwhelming.\n\n\"OK,\" Lee remembers another juror saying. \"That's enough. Let's get her out.\"\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, a traumatized Lee asked a bailiff to escort her to her hotel bedroom. Lee sat alone and sobbed.\n\nTears fell for Fahey, a troubled, insecure, single woman who wanted to end an off-and-on, three-year affair with the then 46-year-old Capano, a controlling, jealous, married lover who wouldn't let her walk away.\n\nAs she cried, Lee, only two years younger than the victim, said she spoke to Fahey: \"I'm just so sorry. I'm so sorry that this happened to you.\"\n\nThe climb into the cooler-turned-casket convinced Erin Reilly Lee and the jury of five other women and six men that Capano was a manipulative liar, a cold-blooded killer.\n\nIt was Capano who shot Fahey, the jury determined.\n\nWilliam Swain Lee, the Superior Court judge who presided over the trial, said he was walking on the beach Saturday, January 16, 1999, when his beeper went off.\n\n\"I had to run about a mile to get back to my car, drive to my house to get to a telephone, and call in,\" he said.\n\nThe jury had reached a verdict.\n\n\"We had to go find everyone,\" Judge Lee added. \"The lawyers were in different restaurants in a three-state area. So, the soonest we could get together was Sunday morning and I did not think that once it was announced that the jury had reached a verdict that we could take a day off.\n\n\"We needed to get it out, so I scheduled the unusual Sunday morning session.\"\n\nSunday morning the jury found Capano, then 49, guilty of the first-degree murder of 30-year-old Fahey, a scheduling secretary for then-Gov. Tom Carper.\n\nJudge Lee sentenced Capano to death.\n\nIt was a stunning fall from grace for the prominent Wilmington attorney who had once counseled a Delaware mayor and governor and was the privileged, eldest son of a well-known Italian custom home builder. In just 31 months, Capano had gone from admired power broker to pariah.\n\nFrom Fahey's disappearance on June 27, 1996, to Capano's conviction on Jan. 17, 1999, the public devoured every morsel of information uncovered. The trial spawned four books and a 2001 TV movie that starred Mark Harmon as Capano.\n\nMore:Prosecutor Colm Connolly: Tom Capano tried to take a hit out on me\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Search set for Carper assistant\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: 300 Join in Fahey search\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: FBI search for Fahey may go on\n\nThe case was revived again in 2006 when Capano's death sentence was overturned. A life sentence was his punishment.\n\nBy then, years of confinement and isolation on death row had begun to take its toll. Capano, overweight with sallow skin and a wispy, white beard, no longer resembled the fit, polished, man-about-town he had once been.\n\n\"He had gained a massive amount of weight since the trial,\" said Colm F. Connolly, the unflappable federal prosecutor who led the investigation and endured Capano's intense hatred, which included verbal attacks and, at one point, plans to put a hit on him.\n\nCapano died of a heart attack on Sept. 19, 2011, at age 61 at the Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, where he was serving the life sentence.\n\n\"He ate himself to death; there's no question about it,\" Judge Lee said.\n\n\"His father died of a heart attack, he knew he had a heart condition. Once his appeals ran out, I think it was suicide by food,\" said Lee, who retired from the bench nine months after the trial and now lives near Rehoboth Beach.\n\nMore:'This is Tom, Tom Capano,' said the man on the phone\n\nCapano's obituary said he \"was many things to many people, but most of all he was a loving father who will be greatly missed by his [four] daughters.\"\n\nIt touched upon Capano's love of music and places in Wilmington, some no longer open. The man the family called \"Tommy,\" the obituary said, was known for \"his impeccable taste: blasting old classics – the Temptations, the Four Seasons, Aretha Franklin, Frank Sinatra, or the Rolling Stones – at full volume while waiting to pick up pizza from Gallucio's; allowing his daughters to skip school on their birthdays for a luxurious lunch at the Rodney Square Club; ordering an assortment of mouthwatering seafood from DiNardo's with extra Old-Bay seasoning.\"\n\nThe obituary did not mention the murder conviction.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Capano held in murder of Anne Marie Fahey\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: The Capanos: A house in ruins\n\nTwenty years after he was arrested, the Thomas J. Capano murder mystery continues to fascinate because of its alluring – and grim – elements: sex, power, wealth, politics, secret affairs, lurid moments and an extraordinary reversal of fortune that wouldn't ring true if written in a crime novel.\n\n\"It was amazing the twists and turns throughout the case, especially during the trial,\" said Connolly, then an assistant U.S. attorney who had never before tried a murder case.\n\nWorking with Ferris W. Wharton, a seasoned state prosecutor with nearly 20 years' experience running murder trials, Connolly and his team won a first-degree murder conviction and a death sentence – even though there was no body, no witnesses to the killing and no found murder weapon.\n\nMore:Prosecutor Ferris Wharton: The moment I remember the most is the cooler\n\nIt would be Connolly's one-and-only murder trial. He is now managing partner of the Wilmington law office of Morgan Lewis.\n\n\"I do think the reality is, and I'll have to accept, it was the ultimate professional experience I will ever have, and I was very young to have had it,\" said Connolly, who was 33 when the trial began.\n\nOn the other side of the courtroom, Capano's defense was made up of four well-known criminal defense lawyers who frequently squabbled with their client.\n\nMore:Defense attorney Maurer: I wanted to withdraw from Tom Capano case\n\n\"Often dubbed the ‘Dream Team,’ the defense in this case became a nightmare,\" Eugene J. Maurer Jr. wrote in an essay for The News Journal.\n\n\"Tom was an impossible client, pushing the envelope at all times and making the representation quite unpleasant. Ethical boundaries were of no consideration to him in formulating his defense strategy, as was demonstrated by the evidence at trial.\"\n\nAdded Maurer: \"Instead of a challenging and fulfilling professional experience, the representation of Tom Capano was one of the most depressing and disappointing professional experiences of my life.\"\n\nJoseph S. Oteri, the Boston lawyer who led Capano’s “Dream Team,” was more blunt about representing Capano: “I made a bad mistake in taking a lawyer for a client.”\n\nOteri said he is usually the man in charge. But Capano’s insistence on running the case got in the way.\n\n“He was taking advice from people in the jail rather than the people he was paying for and it was tough,” Oteri told The News Journal. “It didn't make me feel anything but pissed off because I kept saying, ‘You're paying me an enormous fee and you're not listening to me. How stupid can you be?’”\n\n“‘Nah, nah,’” Oteri quoted Capano as saying. “We're doing fine. We're all right.\"\n\nJudge Lee said it was tough going for the defense.\n\n“Capano was always confident he was going to win and it was clear he considered himself smarter than his excellent group of lawyers,” the judge said.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Cooler found in Fahey case\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: FBI sought weapons in Capano's home\n\nAnne Marie Fahey wanted – and believed – she had escaped Capano's dominance and intimidation.\n\n\"For one whole year, I allowed someone to take control of every decision of my life,\" she wrote in her diary April 7, 1996 – one of the final entries.\n\nHer plan was to move forward with a kind man younger than Capano. It was not to be. A little more than two months after that last entry, Fahey was reported missing.\n\nFahey's remains have never been found. One of the few places to mourn and remember her is a memorial bench erected in 2006 that sits in Wilmington's Brandywine Park. “In our hearts forever,” reads the inscription.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Power broker now pariah\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Guilty as charged\n\nEvidence from the case, relatively untouched since 1999, today collects dust in a vault at the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center on Wilmington's King Street, formerly called the New Castle County Courthouse.\n\nIt serves as both an elegy and a 1990s time capsule with cassettes and videotapes of interviews with Capano's brothers, handwritten lists of state and defense witnesses –– and pieces of a life that ended much too soon.\n\nUsually, evidence is given away to the defense or destroyed after a defendant’s death.\n\n\"This is the only dead person I still have evidence for,\" said Colleen Redmond of the Prothonotary's office as she looked over items from the trial.\n\n\"The court said we shouldn't get rid of it,\" despite Capano’s death six years ago, she said.\n\nFolded up is a then-fashionable, size 6, cream-and-blue floral Laura Ashley dress. It is possibly the long, springtime dress Fahey bought to wear to Winterthur's Point-to-Point steeplechase races with her boyfriend Michael Scanlan, then community affairs chief of MBNA America Bank, whom she hoped to marry.\n\nAuthorities believe one of the reasons Capano killed Fahey was his jealousy of Scanlan, a devout Catholic who testified his relationship with Fahey was not sexual. Scanlan didn't know about Fahey's involvement with Capano until after her death.\n\nAccording to his Linkedin profile, Scanlan left MBNA in June 1999 and is now assistant headmaster at St. Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey. He also works as a photographer shooting high school sports, portraits and does some commercial work.\n\nGone from the evidence vault are Fahey's wallet, jewelry box and the diary that gave investigators much-needed clues that pointed to her murderer. Her family took those items years ago, court officials say.\n\nBut, still in the vault are the copies of letters mistress MacIntyre wrote daily to Capano in prison before she turned on him in February 1998 and became a key witness for the prosecution. Some of the letters from the divorced MacIntyre, a Capano girlfriend for more than 15 years, begin with the greeting, \"Hey Handsome.\"\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Death for Capano\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Capano found dead in prison\n\nFinally, there are two 162-quart Igloo ice coolers – one used as a demonstration in court, and one the actual cooler, and Fahey's coffin. Inside of it rests a 12-gauge shotgun.\n\nIn one of the case's most surprising twists, the abandoned cooler was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean by four fishermen about a week after Gerry Capano unsuccessfully tried to sink it by firing a slug into it with a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun.\n\nThe fishermen, who kept it in a shed, turned it over to prosecutors the day after reading media accounts of Capano's arrest in November 1997.\n\nJudge Lee, in a recent interview, said it is astonishing that the cooler had been discovered off Indian River Inlet, 100 miles from where it had been thrown into the ocean.\n\n\"It's certainly stranger than fiction, the truth,\" Judge Lee said. \"My reaction was Tom Capano should know there really is a God now.”\n\nConnolly said bringing the actual cooler into court on Dec. 2, 1998, just before the state rested its case, still stays with him nearly 20 years later.\n\n\"I will never forget that moment. It was dead silent. It was a dark day, so not much light was coming in the windows of the courtroom,\" he said. \"Ferris and I walked the cooler in front of the jury. It was as if we were pallbearers carrying the coffin into the court.\"\n\nJuror Erin Reilly Lee, no relation to Judge William Swain Lee, still gets chills seeing pictures of the Igloo cooler.\n\n“Oh my gosh,” she told The News Journal after viewing photos. “You talk about divine intervention. There’s a great example.”\n\nWharton, now a Superior Court judge, said the court retains all the evidence while there's still ongoing litigation. But, after a defendant's death, it is then offered to the defense and/or destroyed after a period of time.\n\n\"It would surprise me if they got rid of all that evidence just because of the interest in it. People kept wanting to look at it for various reasons,\" Wharton said.\n\nOn the anniversary of Capano's arrest, The News Journal has asked some principal players to recall their memories of the investigation and trial.\n\nEssays and \"As Told To\" stories include thoughts from Connolly and Wharton, defense attorneys Maurer and Oteri, retired Judge Lee, former News Journal reporter Valerie Helmbreck, former Wilmington restaurateur Anthony Stella, juror Erin Reilly Lee and psychiatrist Neil Kaye.\n\nTime has a way of fraying memories and, 20 years later, some participants have slightly different versions of the same story and others share never heard before details. The News Journal has tried to clarify and add context to some of their words using information from court records and articles from the paper's archives.\n\nStill, some of the people who were caught up in Capano's web of lies are more than ready to put the past behind them.\n\nMacIntyre is remarried and now working at the American Society of Cytopathology, a nonprofit organization in Wilmington. The office is near the old Daniel L. Herrmann Courthouse, now the home of the law firm Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor. In the old courthouse two decades ago, she talked about her longtime affair with Capano and about buying a gun for him six weeks before Fahey died.\n\nMacIntyre, known now as Debby MacIntyre Sheldon, declined to be interviewed.\n\nWhen reached by The News Journal via email on Nov. 13, she replied: \"I have no interest in talking about the case. Best regards, Debby MacIntyre Sheldon.\"\n\nThe Fahey family declined to be interviewed or write about their memories.\n\nAfter Anne Marie’s disappearance, her brothers, sister and extended family said they decided as a group to talk to media to keep attention on the case.\n\nWhile family members were concerned they would appear as seeking attention, they felt it was proper to keep the case in the public eye, and keep pressure on the Capano family.\n\nAfter the trial, the Faheys decided as a group to stop talking to the media, and to draw no more attention to themselves.\n\nMembers of the Capano family reached by The News Journal declined to comment.\n\nThe Thomas J. Capano case captivated Delaware that's known, for better or worse, as a clannish community, especially concerning its native sons and daughters.\n\n\"What's your name? Where did you grow up? Where did you go to high school?\" are frequent questions that start a connect-the-dots conversation about common acquaintances.\n\nTies could be made to Capano and Fahey, both from large Wilmington-area families with high-profile jobs.\n\n“You have Anne Marie Fahey who worked for the governor and she had a family that a lot of people knew. She was very attractive and very personable, and young,” Wharton said.\n\n“Everybody knew of the Capanos. He (Tom) was very prominent. He had been a prosecutor, a public defender, the administrative assistant to the Wilmington mayor. Capano had been a partner in a couple big law firms, Morris James and Saul Ewing. He had been the governor's legal counsel. And everybody knows of Capano because of all the development that they did,” Wharton said.\n\nFor a few days in the summer of 1996, the disappearance of Anne Marie Fahey seemed to be little more than a missing person case.\n\nYears before being selected as a juror, Erin Reilly Lee remembers longtime friends talking about search parties being formed for a missing woman who’d grown up near her childhood neighborhood.\n\nFahey, a pretty and vivacious woman, went to dinner on June 27 with Capano at Ristorante Panorama on Front Street in Philadelphia. The eatery, which is still there, was considered one of the city's great wine destinations and featured classic Italian cuisine.\n\nCapano, married for 24 years, had recently separated from his wife. Going to Philadelphia was his routine. He had multiple mistresses and liked to take them on dates far away from his home and nosy, prying eyes in New Castle County.\n\n\"Wilmington is a small town, a gossipy place,\" he said on the witness stand on Dec. 17, 1998.\n\nAccording to a waitress that night, dinner wasn’t going so well. Capano ordered the food without consulting Fahey. They drank wine and picked at calamari and bruschetta, both looking miserable.\n\nFahey had met Capano in 1993, and wrote in her diary she fell in love with him on her January 1994 birthday. He lavished her with attention, gifts and visits to expensive restaurants. Capano also knew some of Fahey’s hidden secrets, such as she suffered from eating disorders.\n\nIn September 1995, Fahey met Scanlan, who was unmarried and closer to her age. She wanted to end the affair with Capano. But when they left the Panorama restaurant at about 9:30 p.m. June 27, it would be the last time Fahey was seen in public.\n\nTwo days later, family and friends, concerned that she failed to keep a dinner date with Scanlan at her brother’s house, went to her 1718 Washington St. apartment on the third-floor and found it empty. They also find a diary Fahey kept where she wrote that Capano was “a jealous maniac.”\n\nCapano was questioned twice on June 30 at his $2,000 a month rental home at 2302 Grant Ave. in the city’s Highlands neighborhood. Police looked through his home and a Jeep Grand Cherokee, but, at that time, found no signs of Fahey.\n\nMissing person photos of Fahey, a blue-eyed beauty with dark, curly hair, and yellow ribbons begin appearing on telephone poles, trees and signs around Wilmington. A billboard went up on I-95. Her family started a vigil on the front porch of the Washington Street apartment. They frequently met up at O’Friel’s Irish Pub, a then-popular bar in downtown Wilmington. Time marches on and the bar has closed. The building went up for sale in 2001 and later became a salon and spa.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton called Fahey’s boss, Gov. Tom Carper, now Delaware's senior senator, whom Fahey had worked for since her 1991 graduation from Dover's Wesley College.\n\nOn July 5, 1996, Clinton said the federal government would help with the search. However, it seems he forgot to notify the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware, according to Connolly.\n\n“I was in the grocery store, the Acme on [U.S.] 202, and I ran into Judge Greg Sleet, who was the U.S. attorney, my boss. The lead story of The News Journal that day was President Clinton offered federal assistance. Judge Greg Sleet and I laughed because Greg Sleet was the U.S. attorney, so he was the chief federal law enforcement officer, and nobody had contacted him,” Connolly said.\n\n“If you were really going to get the feds involved, you would contact him. He said, 'Well, I'll call over to Wilmington, and we'll offer our services.' The next working day, July 8, the FBI called us.”\n\nState prosecutors later agreed to bow out of the picture. A federal grand jury investigation, which had to remain secret, began.\n\nConnolly, leading a team of investigators, began methodically chipping away at the investigation by conducting interviews, searches, and combing through phone and financial records.\n\nOn July 26, 1996, he and Wilmington police investigator Bob Donovan discovered, through financial records, Capano had made a purchase at a company listed as Wallpaper Warehouse two days after Fahey was last seen in public alive.\n\n“I knew enough about Capano at that point, because we're a week or so into the investigation, I know that he was not the kind of guy who does home improvements himself. I know he's living in a rental house, so he wouldn't be buying wallpaper. I thought it was very weird,” Connolly said.\n\nThey called the number, the person who answered said, “Airbase Carpet.”\n\n“Immediately, Bob and I looked at each other, and thought, 'Oh my goodness, he rolled her up in the carpet. That's what this is all about,'\" Connolly said.\n\nInvestigators also learn later Capano has replaced a love seat, and an employee of Capano’s brother, developer Louis L. Capano Jr., tells them on July 1 he was ordered to have a half-filled trash bin emptied from a Concord Pike construction site.\n\nThey also find Capano has visited a Happy Harry’s store in Trolley Square on June 30 and asks about a blood remover.\n\nInvestigators search Capano’s house for 11 hours on July 31 and find two tiny drops of blood that they later learn matches a sample of Fahey’s blood plasma.\n\nA search takes place Aug. 12-16 of two local landfills to try and find the rug, sofa and other evidence. The search is messy, and officers come up empty.\n\nA turning point arrives in October 1997 when federal agents raid the Wilmington home of Capano's brother Gerry and find illegal drugs and guns.\n\nCapano's brothers Gerald and Louis agree to began cooperating with the authorities in November 1997 to avoid federal charges.\n\nGerry becomes a cooperating witness. He tells authorities that he took out his boat, Summer Wind, and helped Capano dispose of a body in the Atlantic Ocean on Friday, June 28, 1996. He provided other incriminating evidence, including getting rid of a sofa with a basketball-sized bloodstain, and a rug.\n\nHis brother Louis says the stained sofa and rug were put into a dumpster on one of his properties.\n\nAfter the brothers began cooperation with the prosecution as part of a plea agreement, Capano is arrested on Nov. 12, 1997.\n\nWharton said Capano seemed to think he could get away with murder. Why?\n\n“Because he always had. He had done a lot of bad things that nobody ever called him into account for and he thought he could control things,” Wharton said.\n\n“He thought the investigation would be confined to the Wilmington police looking for a missing person which they were never going to be able to find.”\n\nIn February 1998, Deborah MacIntyre, a longtime Capano girlfriend, also signs a plea agreement and becomes a witness for the prosecution. She shares that she bought a .22-caliber gun at Capano’s request. It has never been recovered. MacIntyre also turns over her steamy letters she wrote to Capano and begins taping phone calls he makes to her from prison.\n\nAn outraged Capano asks an inmate, Nicholas Perillo, to arrange to burglarize MacIntyre’s house to intimidate her. The burglary never happened.\n\nDefense attorney Maurer will later accuse MacIntyre of firing the shot that killed Fahey. She vehemently denies it.\n\nThe case takes a twist when Capano attorney Joseph A. Hurley announces in early April 1998 he's quitting the defense team. Hurley, who had been friends with Capano for at least eight years, at that time would give no reason saying only that he will take it \"to his grave.\"\n\nOn Friday – 19 years later – he shared for the first time exclusively with The News Journal that a moment of moral clarity came to him while attending a funeral Mass at St. Helena's Catholic Church in Penny Hill for public defender James F. McCloskey Jr.\n\nHurley sat in a pew, in his childhood church, and said he had a conversation with God.\n\n\"I can only surmise that there was something making me feel like I was falling into an evil pit and this conversation, if that's what you have with God, [went] 'Joe, you're not like this. You can't be this way.'\"\n\n\"I think I was probably facing the reality he was, in fact, guilty of premeditated murder,\" Hurley said.\n\nHe said he'd never asked Capano what happened the night Fahey disappeared.\n\n\"I didn't want to ask him and hear the answer,\" Hurley said.\n\nHe left church, went to see Capano in prison and quit the case.\n\nNo longer considering him a friend, Hurley never saw Capano again.\n\n\"Killing a human being? No. That's the end of friendship,\" Hurley said.\n\nCapano’s trial begins Oct. 6, 1998, with jury selection. Capano’s attorneys try to talk him out of selecting young women.\n\n“The last thing we wanted on a jury was women under 30 with a college education because they would identify immediately with the victim,” Boston lawyer Oteri said.\n\nJudge Lee recalled after the women were included on the jury, he was approached by Oteri who said, \"'Can I go off the record, Judge?' And I went, 'Sure. Off the record.'\"\n\nOteri said: 'The dumb son of a bitch thinks they are going to fall in love with him.'\"\n\nOteri told The News Journal last week that he didn't recall the conversation.\n\nJudge Lee said he didn't know Capano when \"he had the reputation of being a charming man, but in the setting in which I knew him, he was more rodent-like. He was a frightening, scary figure. There was nothing charming about him at all.\"\n\nOteri, who joined the defense team only months before the trial started, drops a bombshell in his opening statement: He says while Capano did dump Fahey’s body at sea, she died from an “outrageous, horrible, tragic accident.”\n\nCapano claims Fahey was shot to death accidentally by MacIntyre in a jealous fit of rage, while she was attempting suicide. \"His story is nonsense,\" Wharton said.\n\nAnd it just gets keep getting stranger.\n\nNeil S. Kaye, a psychiatrist who met Fahey hours before she meets Capano for dinner, shows up to testify in a wooden hat. It earns almost as much attention as what he has to say about Fahey’s fear of ending her relationship with Capano because of his “rage and anger.”\n\nKeith R. Brady, who is then Delaware’s chief deputy attorney and Wharton’s superior, is called to testify about a sexual encounter he had five years earlier with MacIntyre while Capano watched. Capano has said he was supposed to golf with Brady the day after Fahey's death. Connolly questions him on the stand for the prosecution, and Oteri delves into the encounter with MacIntrye. Brady takes an unpaid leave of absence after leaving the stand.\n\n“I don't think Keith ever really accepted the fact that he was going to be a witness. He always thought that was not going to happen,” Wharton said. “We were very discreet about that, the way we phrased our questions, but Oteri was not. Keith looked like he was a dead man up there.”\n\nConnolly reads up on Capano’s cases when he was prosecutor and believes the Wilmington lawyer killed Fahey based on a 1976 murder Capano had prosecuted. Connolly says a man called Robert “Squeaky” Saunders shot a victim in the head, threw the body in a canal and disposed of the gun.\n\nConnolly also continues to get under Capano’s skin. In a burst of anger, he calls Connolly “a heartless, gutless, soulless disgrace of a human being” and is removed from the courtroom.\n\nA final last-minute surprise comes when a neighbor of MacIntyre comes forward in the remaining few days of the trial to say she saw a sobbing MacIntyre stumble out of her car on the night around when Fahey is killed. The neighbor claims the area was lit by floodlights.\n\nBut Connolly tracks down a Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, handyman who says he installed a new, brighter light fixture at MacIntyre’s house – six months after Fahey’s death.\n\nNearly 20 years later, the trial continues to be surreal for Erin Reilly Lee, whose willing venture into Fahey's plastic coffin helped bring focus to a divided jury and sealed Capano’s fate.\n\nHer journey began in Trolley Square, where Lee lived nearly oblivious to the developing Capano-Fahey saga.\n\nShe received a jury duty summons but was certain there were too many similarities between her and Fahey to be picked for jury duty. Lee went to the courthouse believing she would be sent away soon.\n\nWharton remembers that day. “Erin Reilly was a potential juror. She came in, in a plaid sort of jumper. She could have been Anne Marie Fahey. Tall, attractive. The defense lawyers wanted to strike her, but Capano insisted on keeping her because, I think, he thought, he could charm her.”\n\nAt voir dire, the process through which potential jurors are questioned by either the judge or a lawyer, Lee was interrogated then asked to leave the courtroom. When she returned, she was stunned when the judge said she’d been selected.\n\n“My brain just kind of stopped,” she said. “I was so shocked that I looked at him and I said, ‘I’m sorry. Excuse me, what did you say?’”\n\nShe remembers the somewhat taken aback judge reiterating that she’d been selected as a juror.\n\n“I kind of didn’t really hear a whole lot after that because I was thinking, ‘My mom is going to kill me. How am I going to be on this trial?’” Erin Reilly Lee said.\n\nAs the monthslong trial began, Lee watched the attorneys present evidence and question witnesses who would later help her, and others jurors, reach their conclusions. This includes Connolly questioning Capano about how he placed Fahey in the cooler.\n\n“Colm Connolly did such a phenomenal job of getting us to think about, could he really place this girl’s body into a big fishing cooler,” she said. “The way he would just keep pushing Tom.\n\n“Tom said, ‘I had this cooler that I was going to give to my brother and I panicked and so I just figured I’d put her body in there.’ ”\n\nBut Connolly kept pushing, wanting to know – and the jurors – if the body easily fit in or if bones had to be broken to make it fit.\n\n“When we were deliberating, it’s something that we kept coming back to,” Lee said. “You know, could she just fit?”\n\nWhen Lee didn’t fit, jurors realized that Capano was lying. It made it easier to find holes in other parts of his testimony.\n\nConnolly’s ability to bring out the anger in Capano, showed jurors another picture of the former prosecutor who, on the stand, was portraying himself as a meek man.\n\n“Colm did a great job at letting us see [Capano’s] anger and how he could turn,” she said.\n\n“It definitely was surprising. It’s not something I ever would even thought of happening in Wilmington, Delaware.”\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.

Christopher Leach and Senior Firefighter Jerry Fickes died in a Canby Park rowhouse fire.\n\nServices were held Friday for the two firefighters.\n\nThe program for the memorial Saturday was \"Our fallen brothers: A celebration of life.\"\n\n\n\nGreat silver and gold bells tolled somberly as thousands stood utterly silent.\n\nThe crackle of a fire department radio reverberated through the auditorium of the Chase Center on the Riverfront.\n\n\"Captain Christopher Leach.\" Lieutenant Jerry Fickes,\" the dispatcher intoned, as hundreds of firefighters in full dress uniform stood with their arms raised, saluting.\n\n\"Rest in peace, brothers.\"\n\nIt was their final alarm.\n\nThousands of Delawareans came to pay their respects to Leach, 41, and Fickes, 51, who died in the line of duty last weekend while battling a blaze in the Canby Park section of Wilmington. They were joined by hundreds of firefighters from all over North America – there were companies from New Hampshire, California, Washington state and Winnipeg, Canada, to name a few.\n\n\"It means more than you can ever know that you have come into our dark night,\" said Brad Martin, Wilmington Fire Department chaplain.\n\nThe families of Leach and Fickes were treated reverently. They walked past lines of cadets standing at attention, and each of the speakers paused to address them personally.\n\nVice President Joe Biden told them he and his wife Jill knew the pain they were going through, referencing the \"black hole in your chest\" he felt when his son, Beau, died last year.\n\n\"Jill and I know there's not a damn thing anybody can say,\" Biden said. \"We hope you, as we did, gain some solace from the fact that so many people, so many people understood, appreciate, knew, admired and absolutely are in awe of what your son, your dad, your brother, your husband did.\"\n\nLeach and Fickes were killed when the floor collapsed in the rowhouse and they were trapped in the basement.\n\nBeatriz Fana-Ruiz, 27, has been accused of setting the fire and faces charges of murder, arson, assault and reckless endangerment. Ruiz, who lived in the townhouse, told investigators she was drunk and on anxiety medication when she started the fire, according to court records.\n\nTwo other firefighters, Ardythe Hope and Brad Speakman, remain hospitalized.\n\nSaturday's two-and-a-half-hour ceremony was laden with sadness, but it also soared with moments of pride.\n\nIt opened with row upon row of flags and musicians parading through the aisles.\n\nA lone bagpiper mourned Amazing Grace -- then dozens more roared in answer, and the drums thundered victoriously.\n\nCranston Heights Firefighter Curtis Allen said the scope of the ceremony was appropriate for the loss Delaware suffered. In remembering the deaths of Leach and Fickes, he said those in attendance exemplified the unity which is a constant.\n\n“It was moving,” Allen said. “It’s a brotherhood. Everyone comes together and everybody knows everybody. We’re a small group, but when it comes to it everyone comes together as a family and takes care of what they have to take care of. Everybody in this network are brothers and sisters, and we treat them as such.”\n\nWilmington Fire Chief Anthony Goode, whose father, fire Lt. James Goode Jr., died of a heart attack at a city fire station, said he has struggled all week to come up with words that would be \"elegant enough or strong enough to capture my feelings.\" He settled on three.\n\n\"We love you,\" He said. \"We will be forever grateful for the sacrifices that Christopher and Jerry and their families have made for us.\"\n\nGoode posthumously promoted Leach, previously a lieutenant, to Captain and Fickes, previously a senior firefighter, to lieutenant, and awarded both men the department's Medal of Honor. The auditorium sat silent, riveted, as he presented the new rank badges and medals to the men's family.\n\nIt was one of many moments in which total quiet was broken only by sniffling in the audience. Another came when Senators Chris Coons and Tom Carper presented the families with American flags that flew over the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.\n\nHow firefighters send fallen first responders 'home'\n\n2 firefighters dead in 'tragic day' for Wilmington Fire Department\n\n\"We realize there is little that any of us can say or do to make up for the loss of the men you love,\" Carper said. \"But we want you to know that you are not alone, that we will shelter you with our love, with our kindness and with our prayers.\"\n\nCoons told the families: \"As you cope with this loss, I hope that you know that not just Wilmington is with you, not just the state of Delaware is with you, but our entire nation is with you.\"\n\nMany of the speakers said the two men's sacrifice showed how courageous and important firefighters are.\n\n\"I visited the scene with the chief, and all I could think was 'What incredible courage it took for all of them to step through that door,'\" Biden said.\n\nEchoed Coons, \"Whatever might possibly be wrong with America, I am convinced it can be fixed with what's best in America. And your sons represent what is best in America.\"\n\nFollowing the service, Houston, Texas, firefighter Marty Lancton reflected on the idea expressed by the vice president that firefighters have the nation’s most unappreciated job.\n\nLancton traveled a great distance to show, at the very least, such losses are fully appreciated within the ranks.\n\n“What moved me is seeing not just everyone from across the country but seeing Vice President Biden, seeing everybody come together to support the family. It’s pretty amazing,” Lancton said. “It’s always amazing to me to see how departments across the country take care of their own. I have been extremely impressed at the levels to which they’ve taken care of the families.”\n\n“Our department, we had a double line-of-duty death in 2013,” said Gerald Burnett, a fire inspector from Bryan, Texas. “It really made a big difference when so many people came, stepped forward to help us. A lot of folks from this region helped us. It was a priority. Our fire chief puts a high priority on it.”\n\nBurnett and others from his department traveled by air to attend the ceremony. Those plans, he said, were in the works almost from the moment the news reached the Lone Star State. Having known personally the men lost in 2013, Burnett said there was no question of his attendance Saturday.\n\nCraig Durgin knew Leach and considered him a friend.\n\nLeach, an Eagle Scout, served as an assistant Scout Master for Troop 67 Aldersgate Church. Durgin and a handful of members attended Saturday’s service.\n\n“Being brave and loyal are in the Scout motto,” Durgin said. “As an Eagle Scout, I think he kept that as a firefighter. I took away from this a lot of people respect firefighters and the people who do things like what he’s done for his community.”\n\nThe \"Last Alarm\" ceremony for fallen colleagues has developed over more than a century.\n\n“It’s an amazing show of solidarity in the fire service. It shows how close the brotherhood is among firefighters,” said Paul Johnson of the Delaware City Fire Department. “It’s certainly not a routine or regular thing. It’s new to all of us and very unfortunate.”\n\nThere was no question in that long line of firefighters that the loss of two professionals was a blow to morale, but it would leave the city’s citizens no less protected than the day before the tragedy.\n\nThe enormous and diverse presence of first responders at Saturday’s ceremony served a twofold purpose, firefighters said. They were there to honor the fallen, but just as importantly to remind the families who’ve lost members they aren’t alone.\n\n“We just, unfortunately, had a line-of-duty death. We know what they’re going through and we’re just here to support them,” said Capt. Clifford Gilliam from the Philadelphia Fire Department. “For them to pull up and see a line of firefighters as long as they can see lets them know their loved ones were part of another family, and they are truly missed.”\n\nLine-of-duty deaths haunt first responders, whether they’ve experienced them as closely as Wilmington or as infrequently as has the Annapolis, Maryland, Fire Department. Annapolis Battalion Chief Tim McDowell said his team hasn’t felt such a loss personally but are always prepared and reverent when it happens to comrades.\n\n“The brotherhood is solid in the fire department,” McDowell said, “Unfortunately, we go to a lot of funerals.\"\n\n“It’s a sad thing,” said Linda Eklund, of Newark, who came with a daughter and granddaughter to the Chase Center where they stood outside and watched the firefighters pass below a great U.S. flag draped between fire ladders. “It made me cry. It’s just sad. It’s just unnecessary that it happened.”\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/08/31/apartment-poisoning-lawsuits-now-involve-dnrec/89576850/", "title": "Playing the blame game after carbon monoxide deaths at apartments", "text": "Adam Duvernay\n\nThe News Journal\n\nFour carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in March are the subject of a legal battle.\n\nNancy Uniacke, Timmy Dunfee, Veronica Mousely and Andrew Spankakos died.\n\nTheir deaths quickly were linked to broken exhaust system for the boiler operating under their units.\n\nFour carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in March are the subject of a legal battle that has roped in the state department responsible for boiler inspections, prompting the state to explore regulations for owners of buildings operating boilers.\n\nOn March 25, Nancy Uniacke, Timmy Dunfee, Veronica Mousely and Andrew Spankakos died inside their homes in Building G of the Evergreen Apartments at Riverfront Heights near Elsmere. Their deaths quickly were linked to a broken exhaust system for the boiler operating under their units, which released the deadly gas into living spaces.\n\nThe Delaware Division of Forensic Science ruled the deaths accidental in April, freeing the complex's owners from criminal liability. But civil lawsuits started almost immediately, and though none have yet gone to trial the apartment complex is under fire from wrongful death claims and personal injury suits.\n\n\"Our firm policy is to not comment on pending litigation,\" said Sara DeLong, assistant director of marketing and public relations for Weber Gallagher Simpson Stapleton Fires and Newby, who employs Evergreen Apartments' attorney Mary Sherlock.\n\nSTORY: Legal steps considered in apartment building deaths\n\nEvergreen Apartments denies responsibility for the deaths and injuries in their responses to some of the lawsuits, instead filing a third-party complaint against the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control; the boiler inspector and his employer, CNA Insurance Co.; and the apartment's previous owners.\n\nEvergreen Apartments argues in the lawsuit responses that because it purchased the complex inside the two-year inspection window for the site's boiler, which was not flagged when inspected in 2014, those parties should be held responsible instead of the boiler's owners at the time of the deaths.\n\nMartin Uniacke, Nancy Uniacke's sister, said he understands the need to develop a legal defense, but said the response from Evergreen Apartments is distasteful and amounts to little more than passing the buck for four deaths. He assumes the reasons the families never got an apology is because that would be tantamount to admitting fault.\n\nSTORY: Riverfront Heights apartments deaths ruled accidental\n\n\"It infuriates me. You're there running a business. You're liable. Remember, the gas heaters are hot water and heat, so they were working from day one. If anyone wanted a hot shower, those things had to be working. To act as if you weren't involved in some type of maintenance with them is kind of crazy,\" Martin Uniacke said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Evergreen Apartments appeared in Superior Court of Delaware seeking to dismiss a claim filed by Dunfee's mother and brother on the grounds only his daughters have the right to file such a lawsuit.\n\nVIDEO: Victim in carbon monoxide death laid to rest\n\nAttorney Timothy Dillon said he argued against the dismissal and now awaits the court's decision, but also said he filed to have his lawsuit combined with the daughters' lawsuit. Dillon also represents William Skates, who was living with Nancy Uniacke and claims injury from the carbon monoxide.\n\nOne wrongful death lawsuit was filed July 5 by Gerald Uniacke, Nancy Uniacke's father. No response yet has been made in that lawsuit, according to attorney Nelli Walsh.\n\nDamages are the best the family can hope for in terms of legal recourse, but for the family forced to spend the first summer of the rest of their lives without her, it's hardly enough.\n\n\"I would very much like to see someone go to jail, the owner of the Evergreen Apartments, whoever else had any hands on any of that equipment,\" said her brother, Martin Uniacke. \"They lawyered up from top to bottom. There's no one who's standing up to say they thought this was wrong. They're not taking responsibility; they're all hiding behind lawyers. Let them all deal with the consequences.\"\n\nSTORY: 4 dead at NCCo apartment complex; 7 treated at hospitals\n\nOne victim was born in the months that followed the gas leak. Deja Goldsberry and Jalil Dorsey were among the first to file a lawsuit against the apartment owners, staking part of their complaint on Goldsberry's pregnancy at the time.\n\n\"My clients' baby was born, and thankfully seems to be doing well. However, the baby will be monitored and evaluated to see if developmental milestones are reached appropriately,\" attorney Laura Simon said in an email. \"We can not specify damages at this point, but will do so in accordance with the court's order on discovery once it's been set.\"\n\nThe Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control would not comment directly on the lawsuit, but newly proposed rules appear directly related to the cause and outcome of the Evergreen Apartments deaths.\n\nRevisions to the current \"Boiler Safety Regulations for Boilers, Pressure Vessels and Nuclear Administrative Code 1353\" must be workshopped over the coming year and have an effective date of July 2017.\n\nSTORY: Residents forced to relocate, pay own expenses\n\nThey are expected — and currently proposed — to include rules requiring boiler owners to provide the state with preventive maintenance records.

However, disaster followed soon after as Leo Boyd threw an interception on a miraculous pick by the defense. The Hornets capitalized on the Bearcats' turnover as they scored on a 40-yard run.\n\nThe Bearcats offense was set up nicely after a long run by Boyd and the Bearcats took advantage after Dae’cion Echols rushed the ball into the end zone to cut the Hornets’ lead in half.\n\nThe speed of Beech Grove and the offensive miscues continued to be a factor as the Hornets would score yet another long touchdown on a 65-yard pass. The Bearcats then fumbled on their next possession to set up the Hornets at Muncie Central’s 35-yard line.\n\nBeech Grove scored on the Bearcat fumble to begin the second quarter and Muncie Central trailed 28-7. However, the Bearcats scored on two long receptions by De’Markis Cole to help facilitate a momentum switch.\n\nBeech Grove put the game out of reach early in the fourth quarter after a rushing touchdown. Central’s offense scored one last time on a miscue by the Hornets' offense as they fumbled on their goal line. — Gus Martin, The Star Press\n\nBeech Grove 20 8 8 6 — 42 Muncie Central 7 14 0 7 — 28\n\nBG — Jarron Murry 65 pass from Jay’mar Davis (Jeremiah Lee run)\n\nBG — Lee 40 run (run failed)\n\nMC — Dae’cion Echols 9 run (Brady McNabb kick)\n\nBG — Murry 65 pass from (pass failed)\n\nBG — Lee 1 run (Lee run)\n\nMC — De’Markis Cole 11 pass from Leo Boyd (McNabb kick)\n\nMC — Cole 80 pass from Boyd (McNabb kick)\n\nBG — Lee 24 run (Lee run)\n\nBG — Lee 2 run (run failed)\n\nMC — Boyd 1 run (McNabb kick)\n\nRushing — Beech Grove: Lee 37-172, Saul Hernandez 10-42, Murry 2-49, Davis 2-25.

Shelley left the game and didn't return, pairing a backup center with Conner Soper, who hadn't played since Week 4 because of a hand injury he needed surgery on. Danville had multiple muffed snaps throughout the rest of the game, including three fumbles that Tri-West recovered in the Warriors' territory. The Bruins' three fumble recoveries eventually led to three touchdowns, which put Danville in a place of no return.\n\nPlay of the game: Tri-West's Brady Hamstra, a wide receiver/defensive back that plays both sides of the ball, hopped on two of the Bruins' three fumble recoveries from Danville's muffed snaps. The play of the game, though, came on his second recovery with just three minutes left, allowing Tri-West to go into victory formation with a running clock.\n\nPlayer of the game: Malachi Walden. He showed up and showed out when he needed to, accounting for all six of Tri-West's touchdowns on Friday night. His dual-threat style confused the Danville defense, allowing him to rush for four touchdowns. — Chloe Peterson\n\n3A, Sect. 29: Monrovia 56, Purdue Poly 8\n\nPurdue Poly 0 0 8 0 — 8 Monrovia 14 28 7 7 — 56\n\n(Scores are not in order)\n\nM — Brayton Belcher 43 run (Emery Newlin kick)\n\nM — Belcher 31 run (Newlin kick)\n\nM — Belcher 36 run (Newlin kick)\n\nM — Dominic Kindle 17 run (Newlin kick)\n\nM — Jozy Hand 9 run (kick failed)\n\nM — Eli Welch 14 run (Asher Clements run)\n\nP — Jonquil Muse 2 run (Solomon Livingston run)\n\nM — Kindle 3 run (Newlin kick)\n\nM — Coewan Stinson 4 run (Newlin kick)\n\nRushing — Monrovia: Belcher 16-209, Kindle 7-174, Brodie Green 5-30, Clements 2-28, Welch 5-16, Isaiah Ramos 2-16, Stinson 4-16, Hand 3-10, Landon McGann 1-1.

I have a lot of competitors in the race. I come back next year, and I’m looking forward to it. I’m definitely glad I made the move (from Eastmoor). The coaches and athletes are a right fit for me. They’re supportive and encouraging.”\n\nMentlow said Kiluvia was a welcome addition.\n\n“She’s a great kid and she’s a special athlete,” Mentlow said. “She’s amazing. She was just short in the long jump.”\n\nHuber Heights Wayne’s Sanai Lynch won the long jump with a 19-1/4.\n\nSophomore Olivia Pace finished second in the 100 (11.71) and seventh in the 200 (24.73).\n\n“I'm happy with the team finish,” she said. “We were all really excited, especially with the small number of girls we had to deal with. It was something we were thinking about, but we were all more focused on our individual events and the relay.”\n\nSenior Taylor Hickman, junior Deja Curry-Brown and freshmen Alyvia Mentlow and Angel Ward finished fourth in the 800 relay (1:41.83).\n\nWith Hickman the lone senior to compete at state for Central, coach Mentlow said the future looks bright for the program.\n\n“The good thing is we’re only losing one of them,” he said. “A big one, but we’re just losing one. We have a great freshman class and obviously a really good sophomore class with Olivia. We’re feeling pretty good. These girls can really grow.”\n\nComing off winning its first regional title May 27 at Pickerington North, the boys team had set its sights on the program’s first state championship.\n\nThose hopes were dashed, however, when senior sprinter and USC commit Justin Braun was forced to withdraw before the preliminaries June 3 with a lingering quad injury.\n\n“It was the same quad that he was nursing a little bit since last summer at an AAU national meet,” coach Jason Loughman said. “He pulled up in the open 200 and strained it a little bit. He was having a little bit of an issue with it at indoor. He thinks he might have re-tweaked something at regional.”\n\nWith Braun out, the Warhawks collected just two points.\n\n“It was a sad weekend, a weekend that started after regional with a lot of momentum and just excitement around the possibilities of the state meet weekend,” Loughman said. “When we finally learned that Justin wasn’t able to go, a lot of air came out of the balloon. My heart broke for Justin not being able to compete at the state meet his senior year.”\n\nIn his first season at Central a year ago, Braun won state titles in the 100 (10.47), 200 (21.13) and 400 (46.14).\n\nJunior Marcus Gordon Jr. accounted for the Warhawks’ points, finishing seventh in the 110 hurdles (14.53). He also was 11th in the 300 hurdles (39.2), while freshman Jaystin Gwinn was 12th in the high jump (6-4).\n\nWith Braun out of the 1,600 relay, Gordon, senior Chip Smith, junior Cullen Hronek and sophomore Parker Thompson finished 18th (3.33.49).\n\n“We had a great season as a program,” Loughman said. “A lot of our boys finished the season as all-conference and all-district runners and state qualifiers. We’re regional champs and district runner-up. I know we would’ve liked to have been at full strength for the state meet, but it just didn’t happen this year.”\n\n•Competing in her second Division I state meet, junior Marissa Saunders led the South girls team by finishing fourth in the 100 hurdles (14.03) and seventh in the 300 hurdles (45.24).\n\n“Marissa is very track savvy and has a good understanding of what’s going on in the bigger picture,” coach Jimmy Gaul said. “You’re one of the last nine people running and the fourth fastest 100-meter hurdler and the seventh fastest 300-meter hurdler in the state of Ohio. There's a lot of people who would give a whole lot to be in that same position.”\n\nSophomore Alexus Roberts finished fifth in the 100 hurdles (14.36).\n\n“That was fun to have a teammate this year and not be alone,” said Saunders, who helped the Wildcats finish 20th with 11 points.\n\nLast season, Saunders won the 100 hurdles (14.05) and finished eighth in the 300 hurdles (46.71).\n\nFor the boys team, senior Reign Winston finished fifth in the high jump (6-7).\n\n“The atmosphere here is amazing,” he said. “I really enjoyed jumping here. Westerville South will always be home. I came here from Gahanna my ninth-grade year and I loved it.”\n\nWinston plans on competing in track in college, but remains undecided on a school.\n\n“(Winston’s) been jumping for two years,” Gaul said. “When you think about the difference from one year to the next, what the level of disappointment is. Last year he didn’t have a great day at the district meet and we couldn’t move on. This year, he’s an OCC champion, a district champion, a regional champion, sets the regional record (6-10 3/4) and stands on the podium at the state meet.”\n\nSenior Michael Donkor finished sixth in the 300 hurdles (38.88) and senior Ashton Diller was 14th in the pole vault (13-6).\n\n•Ben Gabelman of North’s boys team earned the Warriors’ best finish at state, placing fourth in the 1,600 (4:12.15) to end a successful sophomore year.\n\nAfter setting OCC-Capital Division records in the 800 (1:56.31) and 1,600 (4:19.14) during the league meet May 14 at home, Gabelman was district 1 runner-up in the 1,600 and finished third at regional to earn his first state berth.\n\nLast fall, Gabelman finished 26th in the state cross country meet.\n\nAlso for the Warriors, freshman William Baumann was 11th in the long jump (21-6 1/2) and the 800 relay of seniors Bryce Abston and Koltyn Scarantine, sophomore Okiki Adeniyi and Baumann reached state but was disqualified.\n\nNorth’s only girls qualifier, senior Lauren Hilderbrand, was 12th in the high jump (5-2).\n\nThe Warriors were represented at state for the first time since 2018.\n\n—Dave Purpura\n\n•DeSales sophomore Kenyetietta Quinn capped a breakout season by finishing third in the high jump (5-6) at state.\n\nThat was the same height that earned Quinn a fourth-place finish at regional and two inches better than her fourth-place finish in the Division I, district 3 meet.\n\n“It was an all right day. The weather was nice but my knee was kind of messing with me,” Quinn said. “This was my first time running track in general (this season). I ran in middle school and was pretty good, but I didn’t do high jump until eighth grade. There were just a lot of people telling me to come out and I felt like I needed it.\n\n“I’m glad to be here because I know a lot of people don’t get to be here. It was a pretty good season for the girls team.”\n\nQuinn also anchored the 10th-place 400 relay (48.6) with junior Liz Meeker and classmates Katherine Dortmund and Isabella Swallow.\n\nThey were DeSales’ first girls state qualifiers since 2012, when Sophia Nnadi finished seventh in the shot put.\n\nQuinn almost qualified in a second individual event as she was fifth in the 100 at regional in 12.5, just 0.06 of a second out of fourth place.\n\n—Dave Purpura\n\nsports@thisweeknews.com\n\n@ThisWeekSports\n\nCENTRAL\n\n•OCC-Ohio standings: Boys — Gahanna (174), Pickerington North (141), Westerville Central (114.5), New Albany (55), Grove City (21.5), Westland (17);

Power can't be taken or asserted.\"\n\nAs his opponent's campaign has spent most of the day declaring fraud and much of the campaign casting Biden and Democrats as enemies, Biden offered his normal message of unity.\n\n\"To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies,\" he said. \"We're not enemies.\n\n\"We are campaigning as Democrats, but I will govern as an American president.\"\n\nShortly after he got off stage, Michigan was called for Biden by CNN, moving him to 253 electoral votes. He is ahead in two states, Arizona and Nevada, that would deliver him to the White House.\n\n\"Every vote must be counted,\" Biden said. \"No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now. Not ever.\"\n\n— Jeff Neiburg\n\n3:35 p.m. All eyes on Philadelphia\n\nPresident Trump said recently that \"bad things happen in Philadelphia.\"\n\nWell, things are certainly happening in Philadelphia. The president's campaign is sending lawyers, including Rudy Giuliani, to the city to monitor the ongoing counting of the city's ballots.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Pennsylvania \"turned away pleas from county elections officials across the state\" to agree on allowing counties to start counting mail-in ballots early, Spotlight PA reported.\n\nTrump showed an early lead in the crucial battleground state Tuesday night, but the gap has tightened – Biden's deficit is less than 300,000 votes – and there are still thousands, potentially more than one million, votes to be counted.\n\nThe president's son, Eric, tweeted at 3:28 that the Trump campaign won Pennsylvania. Campaigns do not call election results and many votes remain uncounted.\n\nAll of this drama in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania may be meaningless as far as determining who wins the election.\n\nIf Biden holds on in Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, he would reach 270 electoral votes and clinch the presidency while votes in Pennsylvania continue to be tabulated.\n\nMichigan is expected to be decided in the next few hours, and Biden has a narrow lead. Arizona, which the AP has called for Biden, is expecting another update tonight at 9 p.m. EST and Nevada, where Biden holds a slim lead, expect to have an update Thursday morning.\n\n— Jeff Neiburg\n\n3:15 p.m. What would recounts look like?\n\nThe Trump campaign has already indicated it will request a recount in Wisconsin given the less-than-one-percent margin in Joe Biden's victory in the state.\n\nBut Wisconsin isn't the only state that could see votes counted a second time.\n\nArizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania could still be contested.\n\nFULL STORY: What are the recount rules? We break them down in key states\n\n— Jeff Neiburg\n\n2:16 p.m. Biden wins Wisconsin\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden has won the state of Wisconsin, a key “blue wall” state that had crushed Hillary Rodham Clinton’s hopes in 2016.\n\nBiden’s win in Wisconsin, which came a day after polls closed and as absentee ballots from the Democrat-heavy city of Milwaukee poured in, represented a major shift in the tight race toward 270 Electoral College votes between Biden and President Donald Trump, widening the former vice president's already growing path to the White House.\n\nBiden overtook Trump Wednesday when Milwaukee reported its roughly 170,000 outstanding absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Late returns from Green Bay and Kenosha only added to his slender lead. The state, with 10 Electoral College votes, had long been considered a top-tier battleground with the potential to give huge momentum to Biden or Trump.\n\nIf Biden also captures Michigan, it should allow him to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House even if he loses Pennsylvania, where votes were still being counted in a close contest.\n\nIn a closing crescendo of campaign travel, Trump made five trips to Wisconsin in the final month of the race amid surging coronavirus cases. His last stop, in Kenosha, came the day before the election.\n\nBiden made his only October visit to the state on the Friday before the election. He outspent Trump heavily in the home stretch on TV in Milwaukee and Green Bay, the most important media markets.\n\nTurnout in the state topped 3.2 million — the most votes ever cast in a Wisconsin election. At least 71% of the state's voting-age adults cast ballots — the highest turnout rate ever after the 2004 election.\n\nIn the end, the result was much tighter than polling had predicted. For much of Wednesday morning, Biden led by a mere 20,000 votes, close to Trump’s winning margin in 2016. Polling conducted before the election had regularly shown Biden with a near double digit lead in the state.\n\nIt was the fourth time in six presidential elections that Wisconsin was decided by less than a percentage point, and the sixth time in eight presidential races that the winner failed to reach 50%.\n\nWisconsin was not only at the epicenter of the presidential race. It was also at the center of the two national crises that shaped the campaign's final months: the pandemic, and the clash over policing and protest. Its coronavirus caseload rose faster than any other top battleground.\n\nDemocrats were devastated by the loss there in 2016, marking the first time a Republican presidential candidate carried the state since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Trump mercilessly mocked Clinton for not campaigning frequently enough there, suggesting she had taken it for granted at her peril.\n\n— Craig Gilbert (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) and John Fritze (USA TODAY)\n\n2:10 p.m. Trump campaign files lawsuit to 'halt counting' in Michigan\n\nPresident Donald Trump's campaign said Wednesday it filed a lawsuit in a Michigan state court to \"halt counting\" ballots in the state until the Republicans could gain access to the tallying process.\n\nThe lawsuit, which the campaign did not immediately make available for review, appears to be one of the first filed in the wake of tight contests in several battleground states.\n\n\"We have filed suit today in the Michigan Court of Claims to halt counting until meaningful access has been granted,\" Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a statement. \"We also demand to review those ballots which were opened and counted while we did not have meaningful access.\"\n\nThe prospects of the lawsuit are not known.\n\n— John Fritze and David Jackson of USA TODAY\n\n1:45 p.m. Biden eclipses Obama's record for most votes for presidential candidate\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, former Vice President Joe Biden has received more than 70 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record for the most votes received by a presidential candidate.\n\nIn 2008, Obama received 69,498,516 votes. AP has credited Biden with 70,203,832 as of 1:45 p.m. Wednesday. Trump trails in the popular vote by about 3 million votes.\n\nThere are still several thousand votes yet to be counted in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\n1 p.m. Where is the race in each state mid-day?\n\nThe race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is still too close and too early to call, but several key states could have results Tuesday evening that give onlookers some clarity. Here's a breakdown by state.\n\nArizona: The Associated Press and Fox News have projected Arizona for Biden. He leads by about 100,000 votes with 84% of the vote reported. The largest remainder of uncounted votes are in Maricopa County (Phoenix). The state is expected to release more results Wednesday at 7 p.m.\n\nThe Associated Press and Fox News have projected Arizona for Biden. He leads by about 100,000 votes with 84% of the vote reported.

Wisconsin: Election officials say Biden has the lead with all precincts reporting. According to unofficial results, he leads by around 20,000 votes. Meagan Wolfe, the director of the state Elections Commission, told NBC News that all ballots have been counted, though the results have not yet been made final. The Trump campaign said it plans to call for a recount of the vote.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\n12:45 p.m. Trump campaign signals for a recount in Wisconsin\n\nIn a statement, Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said Wednesday afternoon Trump will request a recount of Wisconsin.\n\nBiden currently leads Trump 49.6%-48.9%. If the race stays within 1 percentage point, the losing candidate can force a recount. If the margin is larger than that, there's no chance for one.\n\n\"Wisconsin has been a razor-thin race as we always knew that it would be,\" Stepien said.\n\nIn the statement, he referred to public polling as a \"voter suppression tactic,\" and raised unfounded doubts about the \"validity of the results.\"\n\nMeagan Wolfe, the director of the state Elections Commission, told NBC News on Wednesday that all ballots have been counted, though the results have not yet been made final. The unofficial results show Biden ahead by about 20,000 votes.\n\nBiden overtook Trump in early morning hours when the city of Milwaukee finally reported its roughly 170,000 absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Then late returns from Green Bay and the city of Kenosha added to his slender lead. Trump had nurtured a lead of more than 100,000 votes before that.\n\n— Brandon Holveck, Craig Gilbert (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\n11:30 a.m. The latest in Wisconsin\n\nBiden holds a razor-thin lead of around 20,000 votes over Trump in Wisconsin with the majority of unofficial returns in.\n\nHowever, the presidential race in Wisconsin has not yet been called.\n\nTrump earlier led in the Midwestern battleground state but Biden made up ground through the night as mail-in ballots substantially broke for the Democratic challenger.\n\nBen Winkler, chairman of Wisconsin's Democratic Party, tweeted that \"when all votes are counted, we're confident Joe Biden will win Wisconsin.\"\n\nThe state's 10 electoral college votes will not, on their own, be enough to push Biden to hit the 270 electoral college ceiling needed to win the presidency.\n\nBefore the mail-in ballots started to be counted in Wisconsin, Trump had nurtured a lead of more than 100,000 votes. Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016.\n\n— Kim Hjelmgaard and Craig Gilbert of USA TODAY\n\n11:15 a.m. Pennsylvania has 1.3 million mail ballots to count\n\nPennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar told reporters at a press briefing Wednesday morning roughly 1.3 million mail ballots still need to be counted.\n\nBoockvar said the election \"could not have gone more smoothly,\" but emphasized it will take a long time to count \"every single vote.\"\n\nPennsylvania received about 2.6 million mail ballots. Mail ballots across the country have overwhelming favored Biden, while in-person ballots have strongly favored Trump.\n\nEarlier Wednesday morning, Philadelphia officials said the city has more than 200,000 mail ballots to count. Both campaigns on Wednesday said they are confident they will win Pennsylvania.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\n10:30 a.m. Campaign 'confident' Joe Biden will win 2020 election\n\nBiden’s campaign manager said Wednesday morning that the campaign is \"confident\" Biden will win the 2020 election, believing the Democrat will claim victory in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada.\n\n\"Joe Biden is on track to win this election, and he will be the next president of the United States,\" Jen O'Malley Dillon, campaign manager, said during a briefing. \"We believe we are on a clear path to victory by this afternoon.\"\n\nBiden is expected to address the American public at some point Wednesday.\n\nIn the race to 270 electoral votes, the campaign laid out what they believe is Biden’s path to the White House. While thousands of votes are still being counted, the Democrat is now leading Trump in Wisconsin and Michigan — though the races have yet to be called.\n\nO'Malley Dillon said the campaign believes the races in Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia (considered a toss-up at this point) will be called Wednesday, while the results for Nevada and Pennsylvania will come tomorrow.\n\nNorth Carolina, the Biden campaign believes, is leaning for Trump and the results will come in a few days.\n\nIn the early hours of Nov. 4, President Donald Trump falsely declared an election win in the White House’s East Room, despite millions of votes still needing to be counted. He said he is \"winning\" in a number of states, despite races still not being finalized and thousands of votes still not counted.\n\nHe also noted that he plans to go to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop counting votes, though it’s unclear how he would do that.\n\nBiden senior adviser Bob Bauer said during the briefing that if Trump and his lawyer went to the Supreme Court then \"He will be in for one of the most embarrassing defeats a president has ever suffered.\"\n\nAs of this morning, Biden was leading Trump in Michigan and Wisconsin, though votes were still being counted.\n\nAfter the Biden campaign announced a briefing at 10 a.m., the Trump campaign announced advisers for the president would hold a briefing at 9:55 a.m. The president’s campaign manager Bill Stepien said Trump is in a \"very good position,” despite returns showing Biden taking a lead in states like Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\n— Meredith Newman\n\n9:50 a.m. Philadelphia officials provide update on ballot counting\n\nPhiladelphia election officials said Wednesday morning they've counted 141,000 ballots as of 4 a.m. and will share additional updates as soon as possible.\n\nThey asked for patience from the city, estimating Philadelphia will end up with between 350,000 and 400,000 mail-in ballots.\n\n\"It is more important we do it right than we meet an artificial deadline,\" Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt said.\n\n\"Days and nights are beginning to blend together for all of us,\" he said earlier Wednesday on CNN. \"If everything keeps up, we’ll have the total results in the next couple of days.\"\n\nSchmidt told reporters the votes that came in after 8 p.m. Tuesday are at the end of the counting process. Votes in Pennsylvania received by Friday will be accepted if they were postmarked before the polls closed.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\n9:15 a.m. The latest in Michigan: Biden overtakes Trump\n\nWith roughly 90% of the vote in, Trump led Biden by roughly 13,000 votes early Wednesday morning, but there were still hundreds of thousands of ballots that needed to be counted before Michigan knows its final election results.\n\nBiden overtook Trump around 9 a.m., leading by about 10,000 votes with 94% of the vote in.\n\nMost of the votes being counted Wednesday are absentee ballots, and are expected to help Biden over Trump.\n\nThese numbers can change at any minute, as tallies continue to come in.\n\nThe delayed results were expected and is a sign clerks are deliberate in their counting process, said Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.\n\n\"Michigan update: Election officials worked through the night to #CountEveryVote. That work continues,\" Benson tweeted at approximately 7 a.m.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of ballots in our largest jurisdictions are still being counted, including Detroit, Grand Rapids, Flint, Warren & Sterling Heights. Every vote will count.\"\n\nBenson expects to have most of the ballots counted at some point today.\n\n— Dave Boucher, Detroit Free Press\n\n8:40 a.m. The latest in Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania is waking up Wednesday without a winner, as its 20 electoral votes are poised to play a decisive role in a close presidential race.\n\nTrump is leading Biden 55%-43% in the Keystone State, but that could change after more than 1.4 million outstanding mail-in votes are counted.\n\nThose mail-in votes are expected to heavily favor Biden because more Democrats voted by mail, while more Republicans voted in person. Also, the mail-in votes are largely uncounted in counties won by 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton: Philadelphia, Allegheny, Chester, Bucks, Delaware and Montgomery.\n\n— Candy Woodall (USA TODAY Network Pennsylvania Capitol Bureau)\n\nWhere does the presidential race stand?\n\nAs of 7 a.m. Tuesday, Democratic nominee Joe Biden has 238 electoral college votes and President Donald Trump has 213 electoral college votes. To win the election, 270 electoral college votes are needed.\n\nThe most key win of the night was Biden's victory in Arizona, which had not picked a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996. Biden also won three of Maine's four electoral college votes and Nebraska's second congressional district worth one electoral college vote (Maine and Nebraska don't award all of their votes to the statewide winner).\n\nTrump maintained control of Texas, Florida, Ohio and Iowa — states Democrats hoped would swing in their favor in a dream \"blowout\" scenario.\n\nBut several battleground states remain too close to call, largely due to record-setting numbers of mail and absentee ballots.\n\nResults in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are not expected until Wednesday morning at the earliest. In each state, Republican-controlled legislatures blocked legislation that would allow mail votes to be processed ahead of Election Day.\n\nAll three states swung to Trump in 2016, but polls had favored Biden entering Election Day.\n\nThe southern states of North Carolina and Georgia are too close to call, which, if either swing to Biden, would be gains from years past.\n\nTrump holds a slight lead in Georgia, with 94% of the vote reported, however several highly-populated areas in and around Atlanta that historically favor Democrats have not reported full results.\n\nThe result in North Carolina, where Trump also leads, may not be known for several days. Mail-in absentee ballots, which have widely favored Democrats, will be accepted there until 5 p.m. on Nov. 12 if they were postmarked on or before Election Day.\n\nThere is also still uncertainty in Nevada. With about two-thirds of the vote counted, Biden holds a roughly 8,000-vote lead. The Nevada Secretary of State said on Wednesday morning that the state will not release any more results until Thursday.\n\nDid the candidates speak last night?\n\nYes. Around 12:30 a.m. Biden made a brief speech from the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington to a parking lot of honking cars.\n\nHe said he believes he's on track to win, expecting victory in Pennsylvania and \"feeling good\" about Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nAddressing supporters around 2:20 a.m. in the White House's East Room, Trump falsely declared he won the election and made other false statements about the state of the race. He said he is \"winning\" in a number of states, despite races still not being finalized and thousands of votes still not counted.\n\nFROM WILMINGTON: Biden declares 'We’re on track to win' with key states unknown\n\nWhat happened in Delaware?\n\nGov. John Carney, Sen. Chris Coons and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester all handily defeated their Republican challengers to remain in office.\n\nIn the state legislature, history was made when Sarah McBride won the District 1 state senator seat. McBride, the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, is the first transgender state senator in the nation.\n\nDemocrats picked up two seats in the legislature — the Republican Party will no longer hold any Senate seats in New Castle County.\n\nDemocrats Kyle Evans Gay and Spiros Mantzavinos narrowly defeated Sen. Cathy Cloutier (R-Heatherbrooke) and Sen. Anthony Delcollo (R-Elsmere), respectively.\n\nSen. David Lawson (R-Marydel), meanwhile, held onto his seat, beating Democratic challenger Jaci Hugg.

After thriving on the run, North got huge plays from wide receiver Preston Bowman, whose first three catches went for 153 yards and two touchdowns — including an 85-yarder on the second play from scrimmage. Bowman, who finished with five catches for 205 yards, also pulled in a touchdown with just his right hand in the final seconds before the half. “We knew it would be an ‘air raid’ game and we prepared for that,” Bowman said. “Going back to summertime, (quarterback) Landon (O’Connell) and I worked on this kind of stuff every single day. All this comes from little stuff like that.”\n\nThe Panthers passed for 277 yards and ran for 206. Michael Taylor had 54 yards and two scores on 10 carries, Sam Williams-Dixon led the way with 97 yards on 14 carries and Dorian Hamilton added 10 touches for 50 yards. But perhaps the 18 most memorable yards North gained on the ground came from Angelo McCullom, a defensive lineman and Illinois commit, who took a handoff on fourth-and-1 from the Central 18 with 1:37 to go and rumbled his way outside, then up the sideline for what became the clinching touchdown. It was McCullom’s second carry of the year, and both were successful first-down conversions. “I started running toward the B-gap, bounced it out, somebody blocked the (cornerback) and then I was able to cut it inside,” said McCullom, who had a sack near midfield two drives earlier. “They just wanted me to get that first down, but I wanted to do my best.”\n\nEven in the immediate aftermath of a rare loss in the rivalry, Central coach Jeff Lomonico cracked a smile and delivered a deadpan answer when asked where his team goes from here. “Gahanna,” he replied, referring to the Tigers’ opponent next weekend. But he also patted himself on the chest in discussing the defense, which he continues to coach in his first season leading the program, and the most points Central has allowed in a game since a 44-3 loss to Cincinnati St. Xavier in the 2020 Division I state final. “39-34, that’s on the defense, that’s on me,” Lomonico said. “Our effort is there. I have to make better calls. We’ll be fine.”\n\nCentral was almost as balanced as North, passing for 171 yards and rushing for 167. Quarterback Rocco Williams was 11 of 20, throwing touchdowns to Chris Turntine (12 yards) and Sherone White Jr. (48). Aaron Heller ran 10 times for 50 yards and two touchdowns, and Kaejuan Alexander added 55 yards and a score on 14 carries. The Tigers took leads of 21-20 and 27-26 in the second half on White’s touchdown catch and Heller’s 1-yard run, respectively, and got within five points with 17 seconds left on the pass to Turntine.\n\n—Dave Purpura\n\nHilliard Bradley 38, Marysville 14\n\nIn a game that was tied at 7 after one quarter, the Jaguars scored 31 unanswered points to pull ahead 38-7 late in the third. Bradley avenged losses to Marysville the past three seasons and now trails the series 4-2. Senior quarterback Bradyn Fleharty helped lead the Jaguars, completing 10 of 20 passes for 255 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for 142 yards and two scores on 17 carries. “It’s a great start to the season,” said Fleharty, a Yale commit. “Our game plan is 1-0 every game. We had a great halftime and our coaches got us motivated going into the second half. We had a great game plan and we started trusting our guys more and our guys started making plays.”\n\nWhile Fleharty led the offense, the defense stymied Marysville (2-2) for most of the second half as the Jaguars pulled away. After allowing 193 yards in the first half, the defense allowed 121 in the second half. “We made a ton of mistakes in that first half, a bunch of penalties,” Bradley coach Mike LoParo said. “We looked like we weren’t sure of ourselves. The kids were really pressing. Luckily, we have an old defense. We have a lot of older guys on defense with a lot of experience and they held it together for us and gave us a chance to get it going on offense.”\n\nMarysville coach Brent Johnson was pleased with his team’s effort in the first half and a 14-7 deficit at halftime. He pointed to two turnovers in the second half as keys to the loss. Matt Krutowskis led the Monarchs, rushing for 93 yards on 14 carries and scoring his team’s first touchdown (3 yards) on the final play of the first quarter to tie the game at 7. “The third quarter was awful,” Johnson said. “We came out and made them work to go down the field and held them to a field goal and then, bam, the (dam) broke. We turned the ball over and they scored a quick touchdown. That’s what Hilliard Bradley does. They’re a good football team.”\n\nIt’s the Jaguars’ first 4-0 start since 2017, when they went on to finish 11-1, losing to Pickerington Central 42-31 in the second round of the Division I, Region 3 playoffs. Bradley hosts Dublin Jerome (2-2) in Week 5. “We absolutely can play better,” LoParo said. “That’s what I’m going to impose upon our staff. We have to get better. We have to press now. It’s not time to slow it down.”\n\n—Frank DiRenna\n\nCanal Winchester 35, Worthington Kilbourne 0\n\nFor a few moments, Kilbourne (0-4) had the upper hand against visiting Canal Winchester (4-0). Braden Pullins intercepted a Maxton Brunner pass early in the first quarter and returned it 34 yards to the Canal Winchester 6. The Wolves, however, could not punch it into the end zone on the next four plays, and the Indians went down the field to take the lead. Brunner atoned for the interception, hooking up with Karson Martino for a 50-yard touchdown pass. Kilbourne had a chance to keep the game at 7-0 late in the second quarter, but Braylon Beckwith got open over the middle and made a sliding catch in the end zone on fourth-and-18 from the 23. Martino helped set up the touchdown with a 48-yard catch and run. Those were the only three completions for Brunner, who made it 21-0 with a 70-yard touchdown run early in the third. Brunner finished with 90 yards rushing on 10 carries, pacing a ground attack that ran 40 times for 238 yards. Kilbourne was held to 43 yards rushing and 36 yards passing.\n\nIt’s the first time since 2019 that Canal Winchester is 4-0 and Kilbourne is 0-4. That season, the Indians went 9-2 and lost in the first round of the Division II playoffs, while the Wolves finished 1-9. This was the OCC-Capital opener for both teams. Next week, Canal Winchester hosts Franklin Heights (1-3) and Kilbourne visits Dublin Scioto (0-4) in the Battle of Hard Road.\n\n—Andy Resnik\n\nLancaster 20, New Albany 0\n\nLancaster (2-2) recorded its first shutout in six years while dropping visiting New Albany to 1-3. The Golden Gales were coming off back-to-back losses in which they allowed a combined 99 points. They limited the Eagles to 229 total yards and stopped them 11 times on 15 third-down conversion attempts. New Albany never made it past midfield in the second half. “Mentally, 100 percent, it was a make-or-break game for us,” senior J.D. Thomas said. “But at the same time, for us, it was all about practice and preparing the right way, and we needed to bring the energy into practice. The past two weeks it just wasn’t there, and this week, we focused on doing our job, bringing energy and focusing on each play.”\n\nThomas kicked a 36-yard field goal as time expired in the first half and a 35-yarder with 4:20 left in the third quarter to make it 6-0. Lancaster’s defense helped set up two fourth-quarter touchdowns with stops on fourth down. Cole Dickerson scored on a 3-yard run with 10:24 left, and Xavier Goss’ 1-yard TD run put the game away with 7:03 remaining. Quarterback Brody Burke completed 10 of 15 passes for a career-high 156 yards. Lancaster’s offense finished with 160 yards rushing and 156 passing. Dickerson had 96 yards rushing on 24 carries.\n\n—Tom Wilson, Lancaster Eagle-Gazette\n\nWeek 4 Ohio high school football scores\n\nSaturday's games\n\nAkr. Hoban 39, Akr.

The housing boom in Sussex County is working in their favor, too.\n\n“I think we’re in an area that’s been found out about, and it’s good for us,” said Michael Klecko of Jack Lingo Realtor in Lewes.\n\nShort-term rentals in Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach, Bethany Beach and Fenwick Island are starting to fill up for summer 2023. Repeat visitors have already staked their claim, rental managers said. The sooner you book your spot, the better.\n\nMore:Rehoboth Beach staple closing its boardwalk area shop after 43 years. What's next?\n\nHere are five tips on how to plan the perfect vacation for you and your family.\n\n1. Know the differences between beach towns\n\nThe Delaware beaches consist of a handful of towns, each with its own distinctive charm.\n\nIf you've vacationed in one town for years but happen to find a great deal in a different town this year, be prepared for a very different experience. And, of course, if you decide to venture west of the beach towns, keep in mind the vibe will be totally different. (Which can be a good thing!)\n\nIn a recent \"Good Neighbor\" brochure, Lewes described itself as a town of \"busy days and quiet nights.\" Rehoboth Beach is known as \"The Nation's Summer Capital.\" Dewey Beach has numerous legendary bars and is so tiny you can walk from one end of town to the other. The Bethany-Fenwick Area Chamber of Commerce calls the area \"The Quiet Resorts.\"\n\nIt's impossible to fully describe the character of each town in a sentence, so research is key.\n\nMore:As The Starboard eyes bigger bathrooms, the Dewey bar also buys Mama Celeste's Pizzeria\n\n2. Consider properties west of Coastal Highway\n\nCoastal Highway is a mecca of commerce, with Tanger Outlets, many other shops and some of Delaware's best restaurants. The Delaware beaches all lie to the east, with the highway being the juggernaut from which they can all be accessed.\n\nGetting to the beach from the west, of course, involves the headache of navigating highway traffic. It can be worth it, according to Wilgus Associates rental manager Charissa Jachimowski.\n\n\"People are going have to drive, bike or take a shuttle, but they're going get a property that costs less and may be bigger and have more amenities,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed to the Bear Trap Dunes community in Ocean View, a 4-mile drive from Bethany Beach.\n\n\"They have a shuttle, golf course, restaurant, playground, but it's a third of what you'd pay for downtown Bethany,\" Jachimowski said.\n\nMore:How Grotto Pizza could transform the Dolle's corner of the Rehoboth Beach boardwalk\n\n3. Get familiar with public transportation\n\nRegardless of where your vacation rental is in proximity to Coastal Highway, there will be some local driving required. Public transportation eliminates much of the stress of traffic and parking, and it's cheap and efficient at the Delaware beaches. Options include:\n\nThe Delaware Department of Transportation's DART operates a multitude of bus routes in the summer. Using the Park & Ride lots in Lewes and Rehoboth can save time, money and frustration. A day pass is $4.\n\nIn the late afternoons and evenings, the Jolly Trolley runs a loop between Rehoboth Avenue in Rehoboth Beach and Dickinson Street in Dewey Beach. Rides are $4.\n\nTake a scenic boat ride on the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal to get back and forth between the two towns with Cape Water Tours and Taxi. Rides are $17 for adults.\n\nThe Dewey Beach Rides pedicabs are great for bar-hopping.\n\nThe town of Bethany Beach operates its own trolleys for 25 cents a ride. They pick up and drop off as far west as Route 26 and Turtle Drive.\n\nMore:Leaning on beach nostalgia, Lewes Oyster House hopes to become a modern tavern by the sea\n\n4. Plan for pets\n\nCheck to make sure the property you're booking allows pets and how many. Unless on private property with permission or within an off-leash dog park, Delaware law requires dogs to be leashed at all times.\n\nWhether or not your dog is allowed on the beach with you varies from town to town.\n\nIn Lewes, leashed dogs are allowed on the beach only before 8:30 a.m. and after 6 p.m. May 1-Sept. 30. They are allowed on the beach at all times the rest of the year.\n\nIn Rehoboth Beach and Fenwick Island, dogs are permitted on the beach only between Oct. 1 and April 30.\n\nMore:Coast Hotel to take over Sandcastle Motel in Rehoboth\n\nDewey Beach allows dogs on the beach year-round, except between 9:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. between May 15 and Sept. 15. Dogs must have a Dewey Beach dog license.\n\nIn Bethany Beach, dogs are allowed on the beach and boardwalk except between May 15 and Sept. 30.\n\n5. Check out the scheduled summer events\n\nThere's a free outdoor concert, movie night or festival nearly every day in the summertime at the Delaware beaches.\n\nMost towns host weekly farmers markets. Dewey Beach hosts weekly beach bonfires. You probably won't be able to help happening upon a show at the Rehoboth Beach or Bethany Beach bandstands. There are craft fairs, car shows, even a Sea Glass Festival.\n\nThe best way to find out what's happening near you is through the comprehensive event calendars of Chamber of Commerce websites.\n\nMore:From packed hotels to parking meters: Just how busy were the Delaware beaches in 2022?\n\nCheck them out:\n\nOne more: Visit Southern Delaware\n\nMore:Facing criticism, state sets Cape Henlopen State Park restaurant proposal adrift\n\nShannon Marvel McNaught reports on Sussex County, Delaware, and beyond.

A perfect day at the Delaware beaches.\n\nThe bad news is a lot of other people have the same idea, and beach rentals — like in a lot of small beach towns across the country — are selling out fast.\n\nWhile people can often wait until the end of April to book their summer stays, property owners and online travel agencies like Vrbo and Airbnb are encouraging people to book now because many popular rentals are getting locked down early.\n\nDelaware rentals are booking fast - and early: 2021 summer may look different\n\nAs people scramble to book their trips, here are some tips or messages of hope from rental agencies and owners in the area.\n\n1. Properties are still available.\n\n“It’s absolutely not too late,” said Sheila Davolos, rental manager with Jack Lingo, Realtor. “They should just contact their rental agent and have them start looking for a vacation rental for them.”\n\nNew listings continue to come in, but it's wise to book as soon as possible, she said.\n\nWhile browsing websites like Airbnb, it may be helpful to know that some owners will not open their summer calendars until late March or April, so their properties only appear booked.\n\nAt 3 Seas Cottages in Rehoboth, for example, owners Susan McNally and Kevin McGuire just opened their summer calendars because they have different rates and cancellation policies in the off-season.\n\nSome newly bought houses may become available for rent, too.\n\nThe housing market is hot in Delaware — McNally and McGuire said four of their neighbors sold their homes recently — and some of these houses may open to renters later in the season.\n\nHOUSING MARKET:Delaware's hottest real estate markets: Pandemic spurs flight to the First State\n\n2. Avoid service fees by booking directly\n\nWhile some owners book mostly through Airbnb and Vrbo, Anne Boyle, owner of the rental Dewey Getaway, said people can save money if they book directly through the property owner’s website.\n\nA hint? If the description of the rental on Airbnb includes a property name, try searching for that name on Google and it might lead to the owner’s website.\n\nAIRBNB:Delaware's top Airbnbs include everything from tiny houses to historic mansions\n\nBoyle said she understands that people may feel a sense of security through these online travel agencies, but if they are worried about COVID-19 messing up their plans, she recommends they book directly and opt for a travel insurance policy that covers coronavirus-related cancellations.\n\nAt the same time, many of these sites and individuals have relaxed cancellation policies – but remember to review those policies before committing.\n\n3. Be flexible\n\nYes, coordinating family schedules can be chaotic. But if families can be flexible with vacation dates, they may find more availability.\n\nAirbnb and Vrbo also allow people to place filters on their searches to narrow in on what kind of rentals they’re looking for.\n\nLastly, once the task of booking a rental at the Delaware beaches has been conquered, follow along that city or town's website (or the local news organization!) to stay up to date with COVID-19 restrictions and what businesses are doing to prepare for this expected busy season.\n\nEmily Lytle covers Sussex County from the inland towns to the beaches.

Passengers can travel by vehicle, bicycle or on foot to meet Cape May’s shores in about 85 minutes.\n\nEnjoy the open waters and breathtaking views along the 17-mile journey, along with visits from animal friends along the way like dolphins, seals, bald eagles and whales, before docking at Cape May and starting your adventure.\n\nWhile in Cape May, you can visit Cape May Point State Park, the Cape May Lighthouse, Washington Street Mall, the Lobster House, Cape May Brewery, Beach Plum Farm and much more.\n\nCape May (and Lewes) have electric bikes available for rental during your trip that can help expand your exploration of the area and give you a workout!\n\nMore Cape May area attractions include the Cold Spring Village, Naval Air Station Wildwood Aviation, Cape May County Park and Zoo, Willow Creek Winery and Farm, Emlen Physick Estate (a historic Victorian house and museum) and many annual events.\n\nThe 2023–2024 fall/winter scheduling and fare began on Nov. 1 and remains in effect until March 31, 2024.\n\nAccording to the winter fare, adults, ages 14 to 61 years old, pay $8 for a one-way ticket and $14 for a round trip.

Consult the winter schedule for more information about arrival and departure times.\n\nSpend a few hours at the zoo\n\nFor those needing family-friendly entertainment, especially for younger children, the zoo is the perfect adventure.\n\nThe Brandywine Zoo in Wilmington features animals from the tropical and temperate areas of North America, South America, Asia and Africa, ranging from common species to those that are highly endangered. Animals you can find are the Florida bobcat, red pandas, toco toucans, a western burrowing owl, a radiated tortoise, a scarlet ibis, a prehensile tailed skink a green tree python and more.\n\nNot only will visitors get to enjoy the animals on exhibit in natural settings, a trip to the zoo is also a great way to get some educational fun in through a normal visit or participation in one of the zoo's many special events. And who could pass up seeing the pudu fawn and crowned lemur born at the zoo this year?\n\nThe Brandywine Zoo is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (closed on Christmas Day) and is free to enter from Dec. 1 to March 17 due to limited visibility of some animals on exhibit. The zoo is wheelchair and stroller accessible.

Admission is $6 per person.\n\nFor more information about the zoo and to RSVP to the winter event, visit 3palmszoo.org/.\n\nVisit Delaware beach towns\n\nDelaware beaches are a blast in the summer, but the cold weather doesn’t mean there isn’t fun to be had in local beach towns during the winter.\n\nRehoboth Beach, Lewes, Dewey Beach, Fenwick Island and Bethany Beach are home to an ample amount of outlet stores and small businesses and plenty of restaurants serving local cuisine. And there are plenty of lesser-known beaches to finally explore, too.\n\nSpend a weekend trying a new brunch spot you didn’t get a chance to visit during the summer before perusing nearby shops and ending your day with a sunset walk along the beach or boardwalk. Another perk of visiting Delaware beach towns in the winter? Fewer crowds and more parking available.\n\nThe best part is that there’s so much to do in Delaware’s coastal towns that you’ll more than likely want to come back several times before the cold weather is through.\n\nDelaware 'Friends' connection:Flashback: The one where Matthew Perry came to Rehoboth after 1st season of 'Friends'\n\nTake the train out of town\n\nSometimes winter in your city can get a bit boring. If you’re hankering to get out of town for a quick trip or want to catch up with some pals you didn’t get to see during the holidays, take the train elsewhere for a quick trip.\n\nNot only does Amtrak eliminate the dreaded middle seat dilemma by offering two seats per row, but the company also allows you to travel in green style by producing 72% less carbon emissions than flying and 83% less carbon emissions than driving, according to Amtrak.\n\nTrains also are a much cheaper option than flying if your wallet is on the rebound from Black Friday and holiday purchases.\n\nDelaware has Amtrak stations in Wilmington and Newark with passenger trains traveling through major cities like Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Providence, Rhode Island; Boston, Massachusetts and more. Other passenger trains like the Carolinian can take you to one of 24 destinations located between New York City and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nWilmington Train Station upgrades:The Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station unveiled new upgrades in Wilmington on Oct. 23\n\nCheck out new stores at the mall\n\nWe know, we know. The Christiana Mall is older than many Delawareans, and it has long been a staple of the First State.\n\nAlthough it’s easy to sleep on its appeal, it’s worth checking out the new stores you can shop in if you haven’t visited in a while. From Lululemon to Kendra Scott and more, plenty of retailers have set up shop at the beloved retail hub.\n\nEven if you don’t want to buy anything, spending a day at the Christiana Mall and Christiana Fashion Center – which recently welcomed Bloomingdale’s Outlet and Crumbl Cookies – is a triple whammy of walking the grounds for exercise, dining out at one of the many eateries on location and wrapping up your day with some laser tag and arcade games at Main Event.\n\nMake this trip a two-in-one by dropping off some holiday returns or using new gift cards while you’re at it.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

Here's how to save money at the pump", "text": "Gas prices have spiked, and there’s no immediate relief in sight.\n\nAcross the country, concerned drivers continue to see prices on gas station signs tick upward, reaching an eight-month high.\n\nIn Delaware, prices per gallon have hovered around, and often surpassed, the $3.50 mark. And according to AAA, fuel at the pump is expected to stay pricey throughout August.\n\n“It’s pretty easy to predict that gas prices will be considerably higher for the short term,” Jana Tidwell, manager of public and government affairs for AAA Mid-Atlantic, told Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about gas prices in Delaware in August.\n\nGAS PRICES TODAY:We've got your guide to finding the cheapest Delaware gas prices\n\nWhy are gas prices rising?\n\nAround this time last year, the nationwide average for a gallon of gas was a whopping $4.33. So with averages decently under the $4 mark, it would make sense to be satisfied with the year-to-year comparison.\n\nBut many are rightfully worried about a recent jump in the short term. AAA reported last week that the national average rose 13 cents over a one-week period to $3.71. Delaware motorists are seeing lots of stations in the $3.50 range, and for those in Kent County, even above the $3.60 barrier.\n\nOne of the factors in this recent rise is the price of crude oil. Tidwell said crude oil prices have gone up about $10 per barrel in the last month to around $80 per barrel.\n\nBefore the summer spike, crude oil prices were hanging steady around the $50 to $60 per barrel range. Per barrel costs were around a hefty $120 last year.\n\nStill, the short-term increase is a factor in rising gas prices. A gallon of gasoline is made up of around 50% to 60% crude oil, Tidwell said.\n\nUp at the pump?:See weekly, monthly and yearly trends for gas prices\n\nAnother cause to blame: The heat wave\n\nTidwell mentioned another reason that gas prices have risen is the recent heat wave that finished July off with a glean of sweat.\n\nConsecutive days with 100-plus temperatures forced some oil refineries to shut down temporarily, which has pushed gas prices higher and higher.\n\n“Refineries are, for lack of a better word, sputtering,” Tidwell said.\n\nWith most refineries in the south and near the Gulf of Mexico, temperature concerns are well-placed. Tidwell said she’s never truly seen a pattern like this summer’s in years prior, with record-breaking heat and refineries having to temporarily close.\n\nChill out:As temperatures soar, keep your cool with these 10 indoor activities in Delaware\n\nWhen will gas prices decrease?\n\nThe trajectory of crude oil prices and refineries in August is likely to remain mostly unchanged, meaning there’s not likely to be an immediate drop in gas prices for Delawareans.\n\n“Many analysts believe that crude oil will remain within that $70 to $85 per barrel range for the remainder of the year, of course, barring any unforeseen circumstances,” Tidwell said.\n\nAnd with summer temperatures pervading throughout August, it's possible refineries might experience another quick shutdown if heat waves occur.\n\nTidwell also noted that AAA has seen a notable rebound in summer travel this year — more people are taking the \"great American road trip,\" and August will only continue the trend of travel this summer.\n\nEspecially in Delaware, Tidwell said, motorists will be looking to enjoy their final beach trips before summer wraps up. Increased travel will create an increased demand for gas, and thus, higher prices.\n\nOnce September rolls around, though, prices are more likely to settle back down.\n\n“There will be relief in sight once we settle into September. When people return to normal driving patterns, you’re back to work, kids are back to school, kids are back to college.”\n\nWatch out for hurricane season\n\nTom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service, told USA TODAY that \"there is the fear of more refinery downtime along with the major fear of a hurricane probability cone in the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nThat'll impact the Mid-Atlantic states, including Delaware, Tidwell said. Because those oil refineries are so critical to gasoline everywhere, it won't matter if a hurricane or tropical storm is headed for the First State or not.\n\nIn fact, gas prices could rise due to just the threat of a hurricane.\n\n“It could just be a precautionary measure to shutter refineries in the Gulf Coast,\" Tidwell said, \"or we see a major hurricane hit the refineries in the Gulf Coast and they’re offline for a significant amount of time.”\n\nTips to save gas\n\nAAA has a laundry list of ways to save on gas, especially during trips to the beach or vacation drives this summer.\n\nGet your vehicle checked. Make sure your car is maintained well, so it's running effectively and not burning extra gas. Check your owner's manual to see how often car maintenance is recommended.\n\nMake sure your car is maintained well, so it's running effectively and not burning extra gas.

Play by the speed limit. \"Each 5 MPH you drive over 60 MPH is like paying an additional $0.15 per gallon of gas,\" AAA says. Especially when going down to the beaches, don't excessively speed, or else your trip to the gas station will come sooner than expected.\n\n\"Each 5 MPH you drive over 60 MPH is like paying an additional $0.15 per gallon of gas,\" AAA says. Especially when going down to the beaches, don't excessively speed, or else your trip to the gas station will come sooner than expected. Don't sit in your car. It's easy to take a handful of minutes after or before your drive, or to sit in the drive-thru lane with your car's engine running. But AAA recommends against those things, as sitting idle for more than 10 seconds will use more gas than simply turning your car off and restarting it.\n\nReporting from Medora Lee, USA TODAY, contributed to this story.\n\nContact Konner Metz at kmetz@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter @konner_metz.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2021/06/03/joe-biden-rehoboth-beach-home-summer-delaware-visit/7492577002/", "title": "How Joe Biden's trips to his Rehoboth Beach home may shake up ...", "text": "Summer was in the air Wednesday afternoon – but there was a different kind of buzz in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nA customer in Browseabout Books was buying a Joe Biden candle when she leaned toward the staff member behind the counter and asked her in an excited, hushed tone, “Do you know if he’s in?”\n\nStaff member Emma Connelly responded that she hadn’t heard whether the president had arrived, but other customers told her that they thought they saw his cars around town.\n\nThese customers, like others who were visiting the beach Wednesday, had heard the news: President Joe Biden would be visiting his Rehoboth Beach home for the first time since moving into the White House.\n\nThe Bidens' vacation home is technically out of city limits in the North Shores community just north of Rehoboth Beach overlooking Cape Henlopen State Park.\n\nTheir midweek trip comes as Jill Biden celebrates her 70th birthday on Thursday.\n\nSome visitors, like Rosalie and Heidi Dech from Arlington, Virginia, had only just heard that the president and first lady were in town, and they hoped to catch a glimpse of them before the week was up.\n\nFor those who are longtime visitors or live in the area, sightings of the Biden family have been common. Mayor Stan Mills said Biden has been called “famously friendly” because he would always stop and say hello to people.\n\nMORE:Why some of Biden's Delaware neighbors are speaking up\n\nAnd while the Bidens would often pop into bookstores, stop by french fry stands or ride through town on their bicycles, Mills said this summer will likely be different.\n\n“Now that he’s president, we’re hopeful that he still does the same thing and comes to town,” he said. “But we recognize that there’s likely going to be a much, much higher level of security.”\n\nWith that, people may see extra “barriers and impediments and longer lines and traffic jams and even areas cordoned off,” Mills said.\n\nBeyond traffic delays caused by his security detail – which northern Delaware has already experienced during Biden’s trips to his Greenville home – this summer could look different as the already popular summer destination shifts further into the spotlight and the strong connection between the First State and the White House extends to the beach.\n\nThe Biden effect on traffic\n\nIt's likely the biggest impact that President Biden will have on beachgoers is on the roads.\n\nRight now, only one closure for this trip is confirmed: the entrance to Cape Henlopen State Park at Gordons Pond was closed Wednesday and will be again Friday, according to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.\n\nThe southernmost portion of the Gordons Pond trail will also be closed during intermittent periods, the agency said.\n\nWhen the president comes, agencies like the Rehoboth Beach Police Department and Delaware State Police support the Secret Service in controlling traffic. These agencies cannot disclose the routes or timing of any delays or closures for security reasons, their representatives said.\n\nWhile traffic stayed fairly normal throughout Wednesday afternoon, some like Alex Morari, manager at Kohr Bros. on the boardwalk, said traffic will likely become an issue. If CNN and Fox News trucks show up, he said he knows the president is in the area and might cause some vehicle and foot traffic.\n\nBIDEN VISIT:Flight restriction in place ahead of Biden trip to Rehoboth Beach this week\n\nLt. Jaime Riddle, Rehoboth Beach police spokesperson, said Rehoboth Beach is just a piece of the route that Biden will likely travel and the officers plan to support the Secret Service in any way they can.\n\n“We will try to keep it as brief as we possibly can and we will try to inconvenience people as little as possible,\" he said, \"but we obviously have no control over that.\"\n\nAdding to possible traffic jams is the increased volume of people coming to Rehoboth Beach.\n\nKent Buckson, beach patrol captain at North Shores, said the combination of loosening COVID-19 restrictions and the draw of people wanting to vacation where the president vacations could mean an extra busy summer.\n\n“I anticipate large crowds every day throughout the summer, and more so probably if and when the president is in town or nearby,” Buckson said. “That’s always going to create a buzz throughout the community.”\n\nLocal pride\n\nThat excitement around sharing a vacation spot with the president of the United States could influence people's trips to Rehoboth Beach, too.\n\nThe resort town is no stranger to celebrity visitors ranging from \"Today\" show host Hoda Kotb to Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor to famous NASCAR drivers.\n\nBut when Joe Biden became president, this was a new level of fame and pride.\n\nMEMORIAL DAY:President Joe Biden delivers remarks at Memorial Day event Sunday\n\n“President Biden and Jill are the first really to have a home here, and so that’s pretty special to us,” Mills said.\n\nMills expects people will be on “Biden watch” when the president comes to visit, saying that in the past he has seen as many as 100 people lined up along the road to Biden’s home cheering and holding old campaign signs.\n\nRosalie Dech said she noticed a sign hanging above a business on Wilmington Avenue that declared “Delaware Joe.” It's just a sliver of the Biden pride that seems to remain in Rehoboth Beach.\n\n“I was like, that wasn’t here last summer,” she said, laughing.\n\nWhen driving to North Shores, some houses also proudly show support for Biden with brightly colored signs and lawn decorations that have likely been there for months.\n\nREHOBOTH:Dolle's, unofficial candy of Biden White House, hopes for sweet season in new location\n\nOn Wednesday, though, the private neighborhood initially seemed quiet with few hints of the president’s pending arrival.\n\nA handful of people rode their bikes around the curving roads while construction workers powered up chainsaws or climbed out of service trucks.\n\nBut around another bend, concrete stanchions blocked off a fork in the road where SUVs and police vehicles parked. There also seemed to be more people and activity around a large white tent set up over the road.\n\nBuckson said it’s exciting for the community to have a president of the United States who is from Delaware and spends time in the Rehoboth Beach area.\n\nAnd while the lifeguards will maintain professionalism as they would for any visitor or homeowner, they are not exempt from that pride.\n\n“We are also excited and we are ready to serve the community and protect all the swimmers that travel out onto North Shores Beach,\" Buckson said, \"as well as the first family and the president of the United States.\"\n\nEmily Lytle covers Sussex County from the inland towns to the beaches.

The owner of that chair probably just left to get an ice cream cone or use the restroom, and they will not be enthused when they find you suddenly popping their personal space bubble.\n\nBut this isn’t just for comfort, either. People often come to the beach to at least stick their toes in the water, if not take a dip. Please try not to barricade the path to the beach, preventing others from easily walking to the ocean.\n\nOh, and this space issue? It applies to you sports people, too.\n\nWant to throw a football? Play some corn hole? If the beach is super crowded, this activity may be best reserved for your actual backyard.\n\nDO pick up your trash\n\nRonnie Wimmer, who was visiting the beach from Virginia, said it’s simple: “If you bring it, take it back with you.”\n\nPicking up your trash was one of the most popular pieces of advice.\n\nPeople do the same thing on the beaches, and pretty much everyone has had enough.\n\nThere are trash cans at many of the beaches, but people should remember to bring a grocery bag or trash bag with them to carry out anything they want to throw away.\n\nMore:As COVID fades, Americans are returning to beach towns.

But just around 2 p.m., a group of teenagers got up from their spot a few feet away, and when they shook out their towel, sand went flying in her direction.\n\nShe laughed as she recalled the small nuisance.\n\n“It’s just natural,” she said. “You pick a towel up or a blanket up and you just want to shake it out.”\n\nBut many agree: Think twice before shaking out any of your sand-coated belongings.\n\nDO NOT play loud music\n\nBluetooth speakers are great for many things – dance parties in your kitchen, singing along out at the pool, chilling in the backyard.\n\nBut when you blare your music over everyone else, some beachgoers get a little cranky. And is it really their fault for wanting to hear the ocean waves while at the beach?\n\nDO fill in any holes dug in the sand\n\nFew things can put a damper on a beach trip like a twisted ankle.\n\nIf you want to dig holes, that's great. Wonderful, we love to see creative moats around sandcastles and shallow ponds for kids to play in.\n\nBut, please, remember to fill them in when you're finished.\n\n'The beaches are open':Florida welcomes tourists amid red tide outbreak\n\nAnd do not dig holes that are too deep. Some beaches have written and unwritten rules about how deep a hole can be – a foot deep, up to the belly-button of the smallest child in your group, etc. – because deep holes can cave in and be seriously dangerous.\n\nDO have fun!\n\nIt's a cheesy rule, but you're at the beach, right?\n\nSit back, relax and enjoy your vacation – whether it's a few hours, a weekend or much longer.\n\nAnd if you follow this beach etiquette or simply respect those around you, maybe this could just be your best summer yet.\n\nEmily Lytle covers Sussex County from the inland towns to the beaches.

She's employed full time, but the mom-and-pop restaurant she serves at in downtown Rehoboth Beach was closed in January.\n\nWest isn't worried about finances though. She'd rather take off when it gets slow, and she was prepared.\n\n\"I save my money,\" said West, who has been in the restaurant industry for five years.\n\nAs the tourism season expands and more restaurants open, both diners and servers can expect increased options. But the longer season, while boosting the local economy, still has its pitfalls for those who rely on the food and beverage industry for work.\n\nServers like West are choosing to stay year-round in Delmarva’s resort communities, learning how to be financially savvy without needing to work elsewhere in the offseason.\n\nWhile more restaurants are considered year-round, many still operate in cold-weather months with reduced staff, reduced hours or reduced days.\n\nMore:Ocean City named one of the 'Best Family Beach Vacations': TripAdvisor\n\nOwners will cut staff to ensure the remaining servers can earn enough money to pay their bills. Some close a few extra days a week, leaving workers scrambling to find second or third — usually part-time — jobs, reducing an already slim chance of receiving benefits like health care.\n\nSome restaurants in Ocean City that used to stay open on the weekends throughout the winter \"are now shutting down totally in January,\" wrote Susan Jones, executive director of Ocean City Hotel-Motel-Restaurant Association.\n\n\"Maryland’s increase in minimum wage and sick and safe leave laws have forced many owners to analyze hours and pay and make adjustments,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nRelated:What a $15 minimum wage in Maryland would mean for the Eastern Shore\n\nNo resort community is the same, and while not every restaurant is jumping on the relatively new year-round trend, southern Delaware shows strong signs more businesses will follow suit.\n\n\"Many of our restaurants are open year-round because we have more of a year-round community,\" said Karen Falk, executive director of Rehoboth Beach Main Street.\n\nMore:Delaware beaches transform into year-round destination\n\nFalk has lived between Ocean City and Rehoboth Beach since 1998. What was a typical four-month season has recently doubled in some places.\n\nIn Dewey Beach, longtime Starboard owner Steve \"Monty\" Montgomery said about eight to 10 restaurants stay open now throughout the year, compared to the tiny beach destination becoming a ghost town just a few winters ago.\n\nMaria D'Ambrogi’s Mexican eatery, Sirveza (known for its viking ship bowls of nachos) is one of those places. She opened in July 2018 intending to feed guests beyond the summer.\n\nBrian Bolter opened two Ocean City restaurants in late 2017 with a similar mentality of serving locals, not just tourists.\n\n\"We never thought about being seasonal to begin with,\" Bolter said of Red Red Wine Bar and Dry 85, which are sister restaurants to his Annapolis locations. \"Being year-round was a commitment to the community we wanted to serve eight months out of the year.”\n\nHow to survive the offseason sl\n\nServers in Sussex County earn a median hourly wage of $9.60, below the countywide average renter's wage of $12.92 and about a $6 wage gap from being able to afford a two-bedroom rental at fair market rate. Maryland servers earn about the same, at $9.54.\n\nWest can afford to live in Rehoboth Beach because she rents a place with fellow restaurant employees. It's a popular choice within the service industry in coastal Sussex County and Ocean City, where the housing demand is high — and, therefore, expensive — among relocating retirees and those with second homes.\n\nRelated:Live where you work, unless at the beach. Affordable housing slim at resorts\n\nFor servers who are new to the seasonal resort economy or don't know how to save money from the summertime rush, the tourist drop-off can be a shock.\n\n\"I try to explain it really slows down,\" West said of her offseason advice to new servers, emphasizing \"really.\" \"If you’re from a resort area, you know, but if you're not you just have to experience it.\"\n\nYet West stays.\n\n\"You have to be smart about where you’re working,\" said West, who first snagged a hostessing gig at Greene Turtle Sports Bar in Lewes before transferring to the Rehoboth location, which she called a \"completely different world.\"\n\n\"The people come in waves,\" she said of Rehoboth tourists. \"They're in and out, and it's super demanding. But at the end of the day, you see all the money you made.\"\n\nBut that's not a year-round guarantee.\n\n\"You make the same as everyone else,\" West said. \"It's just condensed into a few months.\"\n\nLast summer was a nonstop hustle for Bluecoast Rehoboth server Eric Overman.\n\nThe Arizona transplant worked in the wine distribution industry for 27 years before deciding on a whim to move to Lewes, where his brother lives. That was four years ago.\n\n\"You could sock your money away because you know the winter’s going to come and you’re going to have to live off the fat that you’ve saved up,\" Overman said.\n\nHe plugs the tips he makes into his smartphone's calendar, which tracks how much he's making.\n\nOverman, who is in his 50s, was working nine shifts every week in the summer. Now he's down to five.\n\n\"I have to make a certain amount every night,\" he said. \"And if I don't, I have to pick up a shift.\"\n\nIn coastal Sussex County, housing comes at a premium, and Overman has no plans to move out from the Lewes en suite he rents from his brother.\n\nUnless he goes inland — further from his work — the Rehoboth server says he's looking at up to $1,200 a month, which he can't afford without a roommate.\n\n\"I would like to have my own place, but I can’t afford it,\" he said. \"I can’t afford to live on my own.\"\n\nMore Ocean City restaurants open in winter\n\nIn Ocean City, about half of the Hotel-Motel-Restaurant Association's restaurant members stay open in the winter months, according to Jones.\n\nBolter keeps both his Ocean City restaurants running, drawing more locals after the waves of tourists depart during the cooler months. Bolton's original Annapolis locations have a busy cycle, too, but it's flipped: With the capital's legislative session, the Red Red Wine in Annapolis is bustling now but tends to slow down in the summer.\n\n\"We’re busy year-round,\" Bolter said. \"It just depends on which city you’re in.\"\n\nMore:Ocean City extends season but strives to be year-round\n\nWith a long-standing history of seasonal employment, the shift to year-round has left a gap in the number of available workers.\n\nSussex County saw a nearly 14 percent increase in population between 2010 and 2015. While Worcester County’s population only grew by about 2 percent in the same period, with Ocean City dropping nearly 2 percent in residents.\n\nSeasoned employees know which restaurants have good management and which schedule fewer servers during a shift, leaving the opportunity for more tips. But this demand requires a higher skill set.\n\nOn the flip side, West, the Rehoboth server, says summer is tough for owners with regard to quality workers. While they get an influx of employees, not everyone wants to \"actually work\" the long hours required.\n\nDuring peak season, a server can work every day of the week, sometimes up to 14 hours a day, rushing to get orders in, drop off drinks and keep guests happy with little to no time for a break.\n\nThe temporary flood of workers along with the seasonality is something Bolter knew when he invested in his Ocean City restaurants.\n\n\"It’s a mindset,\" Bolter said. \"There are those that want to only be open for the season and that’s their mindset. Whether it’s slower some weeks than others — that’s not what we focus on. We focus on the bigger picture.\"\n\nRestaurant groups changing the industry\n\nWhen SoDel Concepts President Scott Kammerer first came to Rehoboth Beach in 1994, he did what a lot of college kids do when they flock to resort towns in the summer: He worked at a restaurant.\n\nKammerer knew he wanted to run a restaurant group since he was a teenager. While he washed dishes, he was learning the ins and outs of the business.\n\nAfter graduating college, he and his wife came back to the beach town, a young son in tow, and Kammerer picked up serving. He worked through the summer, sometimes juggling three or four jobs.\n\n\"It wasn’t your normal 9-5, 40 hours a week,\" Kammerer said. \"It was never that way for me.\"\n\nBack then, the hospitality industry could squeeze out revenue for about four months.\n\n\"Now it’s kind of flipped, and I would say it’s busy for eight months and it’s quiet for four months,\" Kammerer said of the industry in coastal Sussex County.\n\nThe prime revenue season has been stretching out for the past 25 years, he added.\n\nKammerer's goal? Stabilize the industry for his employees by upping the skill level required and making it clear to SoDel workers that they are valued.\n\n\"We’re trying to redefine the culture and the professionalism that’s involved in what we’re doing,\" he said.\n\nOffseason specials draw locals to hot spots, and restaurant groups like SoDel Concepts are changing the industry from just a summer hostess gig to a career path with room for professional growth.\n\n\"If you make your own 401(k), if you know what months are slow and budget for it, you're fine,\" West said.\n\nServing runs deep in West's family. Her mother was a server, and her great-grandmother worked at the Dinner Bell Inn, where the Bellmoor Inn currently sits.\n\n\"My grandmother joked that when she got a 25 cent tip, it was a good day.\" West said, laughing. \"When I explain it to her now, she's like, 'Wow, you're really rolling in it.' \"\n\nReach reporter Taylor Goebel at tgoebel@delmarvanow.com or on Twitter @TaylorGoebel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/01/18/great-wolf-lodge-to-open-largest-park-along-i-95-near-delaware/69798889007/", "title": "Great Wolf Lodge to open largest park along I-95 near Delaware", "text": "Need a \"staycation\" getaway? You won't have to wait much longer. The largest and newest Great Wolf Lodge waterpark is set to open near Delaware by Aug. 1.\n\nGreat Wolf Lodge is a chain of indoor waterparks and family fun centers that features winding water slides, obstacle courses, interactive \"quests\" and more.\n\nThe chain prides itself on being a one-stop shop for a quick family getaway. It's not meant to replace a trip to the beaches or national parks. It's designed for busy families who find themselves with a free weekend and an itch to step outside their comfort zone.\n\nGreat Wolf Lodge Maryland will be located just off I-95 at 1240 Chesapeake Overlook Parkway in Perryville, less than half an hour from Newark. The location sits adjacent to Perryville's Hollywood Casino.\n\nThe over $250 million project will be the biggest waterpark in the chain's history so far, taking up 48 acres of space with 128,000 square feet of waterparks (at a comfortable 84 degrees year-round), 57,000 square feet of family entertainment and a 700-room resort.\n\nPlans have been in motion for this park for about two years. After being slightly delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company broke ground on the site a little over a year ago and is slated to complete work in the upcoming months before officially opening for business on Aug. 1.\n\nWhat to expect: Exclusive first looks\n\nThe waterpark will feature 22 water slides, including two brand-new ones, that can be seen twisting from outside the confines of the building, with something to appeal to every age.\n\nThe new slides appeal to thrill-seekers, featuring 360-degree loops and steep drops through dark tunnels. But for the patron who prefers their feet on the ground, the park offers the \"Otter Cave Waterworks,” a multilevel play structure with six smaller, attached water slides and the signature Great Wolf Lodge tipping bucket that pours 1,000 gallons of water every four minutes.\n\nAn outdoor pool will also be featured in the Great Wolf Lodge with cabanas for those in need of some R&R.\n\nIn addition to the waterpark, there is an adventure park with even more activities for families to enjoy including bowling, ropes courses, mini golf, a mirror maze and an arcade.\n\nThose familiar with Great Wolf Lodge already may remember the \"Magiquest\" interactive journey designed for families to partake in. Along with the improvements of the new waterpark come more complex storylines and \"enchanted forest-esque\" interior designs for guests to immerse themselves into.\n\nPerryville's Great Wolf Lodge will feature a 700-room resort with suite options to suit parties of up to 12 people.\n\nLastly, the all-in-one staycation destination will feature plenty of dining options for the whole family including a Dunkin’, a buffet-style campfire restaurant with options that include hamburgers and Tex-Mex and an upscale dining restaurant.\n\nPlanning your trip\n\nTo book your stay, visit the Great Wolf Lodge website for its Maryland location. Overnight rates for rooms range from around $200-$400 per night, depending on availability and the size of the party. The park is typically busiest when school is out, so if you're looking to avoid crowds and high costs, squeezing in a mid-week trip may be best.\n\nIf you're looking for some money-saving tips, general manager Nadine Miracle and VP of Great Wolf's corporate communications Jason Lasecki recommend signing up for email alerts. In honor of the park's consistent 84-degree heating, flash sales for $84 nightly room rates are occasionally advertised to those on the email database.\n\nLike knowing what stores, restaurants and developments are coming and going in Delaware?

And he's happy to see who ended up buying the home.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, the longest-serving Delaware senator, and his wife, Jill, fulfilled a longtime dream by purchasing a vacation home at the Delaware seashore. Fittingly, their purchase is steps away from land Joe Biden helped return to federal status.\n\nThe Bidens will keep their primary home in Greenville, a spokeswoman told The News Journal.\n\nMORE: Biden buys home in Cape Henlopen State Park area\n\nA listing for the contemporary indigo blue house, which has since been removed, boasts a “spectacular one-of-a-kind North Shores Beach House” that backs up to Cape Henlopen State Park with ocean views and multiple outdoor decks. The six-bedroom house (including three master bedrooms) features 5½ bathrooms, a gourmet kitchen, three indoor fireplaces, an elevator, golf cart, outdoor showers and “a doggy wash too,” according to the listing.\n\nOn the inside are light-filled, spacious rooms; built-in, floor-to-ceiling bookcases; and high-end finishes, according to photos that accompanied the listing.\n\nSussex County property records show that the property, which last sold for $1.5 million in 2006, is owned by Diane Smith and Jayne Kettles of New Hope, Pennsylvania. The pair runs a recruitment software firm.\n\nSmith confirmed the sale Friday but declined to discuss the details, including the closing date and purchase price.\n\n“I know how much Delaware loves the Bidens, she said. “We respect everyone’s privacy.”\n\nRehoboth real estate agent Ava Cannon works for Jack Lingo Realtors, which handled the property listing.\n\nAsked if the Bidens moving to town would create more chaos, she said: “We have a lot of nice, influential people that fold in and out throughout the summers. I don’t think it’s going to get worse.”\n\nMossman, having seen the inside of the home, marveled over the “great third-floor master that looks all the way out into the ocean.” He said he met Biden recently when he was out looking at homes. They spoke for about 10 or 15 minutes, Mossman said, about the neighborhood, the homes and the beach. No politics.\n\n\"The guy is first class,\" Mossman said.\n\nMossman said his neighbors next door are good friends of the Bidens. And when the Bidens previously paid visits, Mossman's lot was used for extra parking by the Secret Service.\n\nIf it were up to Mossman, though, Biden should be too busy these days to be purchasing a beach house.\n\n“Quite frankly, I wish he would have run for president,\" Mossman said. \"And I hope he continues to speak openly, regardless of whether he decides to run for office again.\"\n\nWhile that's still up in the air, both Joe and Jill are likely to spend a lot of time writing in their new home. Joe will be writing two nonfiction books, and Jill is writing one.\n\nIf history is any indication, they'll probably spend time at Browseabout Books on Rehoboth Avenue, where general manager Susan Kehoe recalled tales of previous book signings.\n\n“I’m sure we will see him more often,\" she said. \"I hope so.\"\n\nHot sauce Hall of Famer Chip Hearn, who owns the Ice Cream Store in Rehoboth, expects the same. Biden is a noted ice cream fan. On the walls inside Hearn's ice cream shop are pictures of Biden from previous summers, smiling big with workers young and old.\n\n“Here’s the VP of the United States or (previously) a big-time senator taking the time to say hi to 19- and 20-year-olds working their butts off in the summer,\" Hearn said. \"That’s a big deal to them. That says a lot about what a guy he is.\"\n\n\"He's just regular Delaware Joe,\" said Melinda Mullen, 50, vacationing from Newark.\n\nRehoboth-Dewey Chamber of Commerce President Carol Everhart said Biden's arrival could bring only good things to the area.\n\n“You have someone who is internationally known, making a purchase in this area; it brings it to the forefront,” Everhart said.\n\nEverhart said Biden was already a valuable member of the Rehoboth community. She said from time to time he would attend the Rehoboth-Dewey chamber’s general membership meetings.\n\n“We’re looking forward to seeing him more often,” Everhart said.\n\nNo matter their political alignment, most people say.\n\n\"I don't care if you're a Democrat, Republican or worship bologna,\" Hearn said. \"He cares a lot about Delawareans.\"\n\n“He sort of defies party lines,” Kehoe said. “I think no matter what side of the political fence you are, you kind of just have to love Joe. I think it’s going to do nothing but promote goodwill because he’s just so genuine and friendly, just such a kind person. It’s only going to be a good thing.”\n\nMossman, of course, feels the same, though he took a more political route.\n\n“The thing about the vice president is he’s just down to earth,” Mossman said. “He’s just another guy. He’s not pretentious. He’s certainly not Trump. And you can tell he cares. I think he’ll be a great neighbor.”\n\nThat’s if given a chance. Sometimes party lines do indeed get in the way.\n\nApproached by a reporter, two men sitting on a bench outside the Rehoboth Beach Variety store were asked for a reaction to the new celebrity in town.\n\n“I’m a Republican, and I have no comment,” one said.\n\nCan't please everyone.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/09/12/not-even-florence-can-keep-delaware-beach-lovers-away/1281532002/", "title": "Not even Hurricane Florence can keep Delaware beach lovers away", "text": "Michelle and Jerry Battersby weren't going to let anything keep them from going on vacation this year — not even a hurricane barreling up the coast.\n\n\"My husband was in a coma last summer, so we didn't get the chance to go away,\" Michelle Battersby said. \"He was in the hospital for three months.

There were a number of families on the boardwalk, despite a thick layer of fog that didn't burn off until late in the morning.\n\nWhen the sun came out, it revealed sandbags stacked in front of storefront windows and battered-looking fences at the feet of the dunes. A few surfers were out, taking advantage of the frothy waves.\n\n\"It's deceptively beautiful,\" Michelle Battersby said. \"I actually said if it gets really, really bad, we might leave Friday.

So they loaded their 7-, 5- and 3-year-old kids in the car and drove north.\n\n“We’ve been in the pool, but we didn’t want to take the kids in the ocean,\" Erin said. \"It looked a little rough.”\n\nIf the weather takes a turn for the worst, \"I figure there’s plenty to do up here,\" Erin said. \"We can do indoor things. As long as we’re not home, doing projects around the house, I’m not too worried.\"\n\nMark and Pattie Hughes, from Pennsylvania, usually vacation in the Outer Banks in North Carolina, which separate the Atlantic Ocean from the mainland. After being ordered out of the area, they came to holiday with some friends in Dewey Beach.\n\n\"We've never had an evacuation until this year,\" Mark Hughes said. \"It was a mandatory evacuation and it's probably the first time we said, 'Let's get out of here.'

Of them, 18% said they'd personally experienced antisemitism in the past year.\n\nHATE IN DELAWARE:Delaware man who stormed U.S. Capitol, menaced officer with Confederate flag gets prison\n\nThe Jewish Federation’s report also found that 67% of Jewish people in the region said they were concerned about antisemitism globally. Over half of respondents said they were worried about antisemitism nationwide, and about 30% were concerned about it at the local level.\n\nThe 11 antisemitic incidents reported in Delaware last year involved five acts of vandalism, one incident of harassment, two bomb threats and three distributions of “offensive literature,” the ADL reported. Eight of the incidents happened in New Castle County, and there are likely more that weren’t reported.\n\nOnly three antisemitic incidents were recorded in Delaware in 2021, the lowest in recent years. Goretsky said that is likely because many businesses were still shut down because of the pandemic, so there were fewer opportunities for antisemitism.\n\nHATE CRIMES:Man who made 160 racist, sexist calls to governor's office sentenced for hate crime\n\nAnd while Delaware’s numbers remain smaller than those of neighboring states — Pennsylvania recorded 114 antisemitic incidents and New Jersey reported 408, the third highest in the nation — Goretsky said it’s still a major cause of concern.\n\n“The reality is one incident of hate — whether it's antisemitism, racism, anti-LGBTQ hate, anti-Muslim hate, anti-Asian hate, any hate I'm missing — is one too many,” Goretsky said. \"No one should be targeted and be harassed or be made to feel unwelcome in their community because of their identity.\"\n\nLinks to white supremacy\n\nThe rise in antisemitism coincides with a rise in white supremacy, both in Delaware and nationwide. In multiple incidents recorded by the ADL last year, groups passed out propaganda that had both antisemitic and white supremacist messages.\n\nMORE:White supremacist propaganda hits a five-year high, according to annual survey by ADL\n\nGoretsky said the keys to combating antisemitism, white supremacy and other forms of hate is a dedication to speaking out against it by community leaders — particularly those in the government — as well as more inclusive education in schools.\n\n“We need everybody at the local level to fight up against this.”\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Hannah Edelman at hedelman@delawareonline.com.

As of this point in his presidency, Biden has spent more than a quarter of his time working from his home state of Delaware, either at his house in Wilmington or his Rehoboth Beach property.\n\nSome 21 months into his term, Biden has made 55 visits to Delaware, totaling some or all of 174 days as of Sunday, according to a CNN analysis of presidential schedules and a tally kept by Mark Knoller, the longtime unofficial statistician of the White House press corps. In addition, Biden has made 19 visits, or all or part of 64 days, to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland.\n\nHe has now surpassed even the getaway time of former President Donald Trump, so often criticized by Democrats for his regular departures from the White House to stay at one of his personal homes. At this point in his tenure, Trump had spent about 135 days at either his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, or his home at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump also had spent 23 days at Camp David.\n\n“President Biden is deeply proud of his roots and his family and it has been a staple of his time in public life to never lose touch with either,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said to CNN. “Presidents of the United States are constantly on the job, regardless of their location – whether they’re on a state visit overseas or just 100 miles from the White House for a short trip to Wilmington, DE. And as all Americans can agree, it’s important for leaders to avoid becoming ensconced in Washington, DC.”\n\nThe comforts of home can be a salve for the commander in chief while carrying out one of the world’s most demanding jobs. The American president is never truly “off,” and – in fact – Biden, like all presidents, has a whole remote White House apparatus that travels with him to facilitate that round-the-clock enterprise, with the most state-of-the-art capabilities, resources and technology traveling with him wherever he goes.\n\nSome argue that Biden can now lean into the normalcy of working from home, which millions of Americans had to rely on when Covid-19 forced isolation from offices and public spaces. “WFH” is not just a shorthand for being productive at the home office, it’s become a professional way of life for many.\n\n“It is 2022, not 1922. If the rest of the country can work from home, so can the president of the United States,” said Michael LaRosa, a director at a DC-based public affairs firm and former press secretary to first lady Dr. Jill Biden.\n\n“He spent (practically) every weekend in Delaware during his 36 years in the Senate, and his eight years as vice president,” LaRosa said. “This is nothing new. The Bidens have never lived in Washington, DC.” When he was a senator, Biden commuted back to Delaware almost every night by train – earning the nickname “Amtrak Joe” – and the train station in Wilmington is named for him.\n\nThe physical presence of a president is, however, meaningful for some, at least in ritual.\n\nThe statistics – 236 days away from the White House in Delaware and Maryland in less than two years on the job – are significant for the modern presidency. The job has been set in the nation’s capital near the Congress and the Supreme Court, in part for its symbolic power, for more than 220 years. Being in that power center brings a higher level of transparency thanks to the proximity to the national media, along with White House rules about press access and public records about who comes and goes.\n\nWhenever the president is actually in the Oval Office, for example, that presence is honored by the solemn watch of a stone-faced US Marine posted outside the West Wing.\n\n“A special challenge that Biden faces, because of his age, is that people will assume the worst if he’s not always visible. That is something that comes with being the oldest president in office,” said Tim Naftali, a CNN presidential historian, who notes presidents have had a “moveable Oval Office” for decades. “Perception is important in American politics.”\n\nThe optics of WFH or WFWH\n\nA president of the United States who doesn’t consider the White House his primary home does not go unnoticed by the media, or critics. But the executive mansion’s primary residents have generally found it stifling.\n\n“I always say I don’t know whether it’s the finest public housing in America or the crown jewel of the prison system,” former President Bill Clinton famously mused during a 1993 interview.\n\nKnoller, who during his 32-year career with CBS News covered the personal habits of six presidents, concurs.\n\n“It may look luxurious, but it can be suffocating to live and work there day in and out,” Knoller said.\n\nTrump’s trips to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster were fodder for op-eds and lent themselves to critics painting a portrait of a president unwilling to give up the trappings of a luxe off-duty lifestyle. And though many days were spent on the golf course – 125 or so at this point in Trump’s presidency, compared to Biden’s 19 on the links – Trump was still the leader of the free world. Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, traveled home much less frequently while in office but was frequently dinged – by Trump, among others – for the amount of golf he played.\n\n“(Ronald) Reagan and (George W.) Bush both spent lots of time at their private ranch homes,” said Knoller of two other former presidents who escaped the White House with regularity.\n\nKnoller tabulated time away for presidents, he says, because the numbers “added color to my reporting and gave insight to the president’s needs and activities.”\n\nAccording to Knoller’s count, George W. Bush spent all or part of 490 days – more than a year – at his Texas ranch during his eight years in office. Reagan spent nearly a year, all or part of 349 days, at his California ranch during his two terms. If Biden were reelected and kept up his current pace of trips to Delaware until the end of a second term in office, he would far surpass both Reagan and Bush in time away from the White House.\n\nHowever, post-pandemic culture has blurred the boundaries of what defines a workplace.\n\n“Our concept of being ‘on the job’ has shifted, and that may actually change the way we think about where our president needs to be,” Naftali said.\n\nSome of Biden’s biggest political wins came this summer, after all, when he was isolating in the residence of the White House after testing positive for Covid-19. Photos showed him tie-less, often working in the second-floor Treaty Room or reading papers with his feet up on the Truman balcony, Commander by his side.\n\nIt was a view into what Biden’s work from home life may be like when he’s in Wilmington or Rehoboth.\n\n“It’s a bit antiquated to think that because he is not physically in the White House on the weekends, that he is not working,” LaRosa said. “He never stops being President and he never stops working. Just ask the first lady.”\n\nA weekly ritual\n\nBiden has the advantage of a more normalized routine in his trips away from Washington.\n\nThe White House residence staff has by now perfected the choreography of managing, packing and planning the departure of the President and first lady most Fridays, the day, statistically, the Bidens normally split town.\n\nThe ushers know which bags are to be brought downstairs – it’s a light-pack, most of the couples’ needed belongings are already in their Delaware homes, a person familiar tells CNN. While Biden occasionally plays golf at a local course when in Wilmington, his other activities – seeing his grandchildren, taking casual social visits, going to church – don’t require multiple outfit changes.\n\nIn Rehoboth, he rides his bike and he and the first lady like to set up a big, blue umbrella on the sandy beach in front of their house and sunbathe or read in reclining chairs. Outside of swimsuits, joggers and polo shirts, it’s not a multiple-suitcase situation.\n\n“The biggest issue is usually the pets,” said the person familiar with the weekend planning for a presidential getaway to Delaware.\n\nCommander, now one year old and no longer a small puppy, and Willow, the barn cat adopted by Jill Biden, are “almost always” on the Delaware visits. While many American families leave their pets at home with caretakers for the weekend, or book them at pet-sitting facilities, the Bidens take theirs with them.\n\nThey like to be around their pets at all times – when Joe Biden was isolating at the White House with Covid-19 this summer, he was kept company by Commander; likewise, when Jill Biden had her bout with Covid, she spent the her rebound case isolation period in Rehoboth, with Willow.\n\nThe animals frequently travel to Delaware via van, with support staff, but occasionally they are in vehicles solely dedicated to their transportation, says the person. Willow, in particular, is not a fan of noisy, whirring helicopter blades, said another person familiar with the feline’s habits. In June, there was a rare sighting by White House press members of Willow in her crate, being carried by a residence staffer to Marine One for a weekend at Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Biden’s Delaware visits, of course, no matter how quick, have a significant footprint beyond those of the paws of their pets.\n\nSecret Service coordinates with law enforcement on all movements – several highway exits must close for the presidential motorcade, locals in both Wilmington and Rehoboth must at times wait on traffic patterns or be swept by agents with handheld magnetometers just to walk down the beach if one of the Bidens is there, as one neighbor of the Bidens in Rehoboth Beach told CNN.\n\nThe large presidential apparatus helps ensure that the President is able to perform his duties with the full input of his advisers, even if they’re not with him in person.\n\n“Unless we discover his being away from Washington results in him bobbling the ball as JFK did on the eve of the Bay of Pigs operation, there shouldn’t be an issue,” says Naftali, referring to Kennedy’s canceling of an air strike on a Sunday, without full consultation and full consideration, a move the former President later regretted.\n\n“But if Biden is in touch virtually and telephonically, in this era, leadership doesn’t have to involve always being physically present in Washington, D.C.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/02/11/parents-charged-thursday-killing-infant-girl-september/6748512001/", "title": "Delaware parents charged with killing their infant in September", "text": "A Magnolia couple has been charged in connection with the September death of their 5-month-old girl, Delaware State Police announced late Thursday.\n\nThe infant, whose birth and death were never reported to authorities, died as a result of \"issues associated with malnourishment,\" said Master Cpl.

Rob Franek, editor-in-chief of The Princeton Review Books, says it's a position the university has been flirting with for years. It was No. 6 on the list last year and No. 12 in 2016-17.\n\n\"The schools on our top party school list have a very active social scene,\" he said, adding that the rankings are based entirely on student opinion.\n\nPrinceton Review also ranks the most Stone-Cold Sober Schools. Brigham Young University in Utah, which is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has topped that list for more than 20 straight years.\n\nThe Princeton Review derived its 2019 rankings from a survey of 138,000 students (an average of 359 per campus) attending 384 different colleges and universities, Franek said.\n\nThe survey asked students 84 questions about their school's academics, administration, student body and themselves. The format uses a five-point scale to convert qualitative student assessments into quantitative data for school-to-school comparisons.\n\nFor the top party school list, Franek said he and his team looked at five different metrics:\n\nBeer consumption Liquor consumption Drug consumption Hours student spent outside of the classroom daily The popularity of the fraternity and sorority scene on campus\n\nBased on the same results, UD was also rated:\n\nNo. 1 on Lots of Hard Liquor\n\nNo. 1 on Lots of Greek Life\n\nNo. 9 on Lots of Beer\n\nNo. 11 on Students Who Study the Least\n\nThe University of Delaware was additionally ranked No. 7 on a list of most popular study abroad programs.\n\nAdam Cantley, dean of students at UD, said the Top Party ranking is \"another piece of the puzzle in how we look at alcohol and substance abuse on our campus.\" Because the Princeton Review lists are based on student surveys, it gives UD administrators another perspective on how drinking is viewed on campus, he said.\n\nOf course, UD collects its own data on the issue, Cantley said, which shows that student behaviors are trending in a positive direction.\n\nAt 54 percent, UD's 2017 binge drinking rate was the lowest it's been in more than a decade, according to the annual report, Binge Drinking and Other Risk Behaviors among College Students.\n\nDRINKING AT UD:\n\nUD Rugby team blamed for near riot at 'I'm Shmacked' event\n\nStudent's death reveals gaps in policing parties\n\nSuit claims university, sororityand party host are liable in student's 2013 death\n\nAdditionally, University of Delaware Police told The News Journal in March that the department has seen a 44 percent reduction in alcohol violations, going from 511 in 2010 to 285 last year.\n\nCampus police also work closely with local law enforcement and when Newark police break up a party, they frequently call in officers from campus so that students can be immediately referred to the Office of Student Conduct and the BASICS class, a seminar that helps students make changes to their drinking habits.\n\nStudents can also take the class voluntarily, and many of UD's fraternities and sororities participate.\n\nFranek admitted that some of the rankings — like those involving drugs and alcohol — can be contentious.\n\n\"If a school ends up on a less-than-coveted list ... people react in different ways,\" he said, describing how some colleges and universities disparage The Princeton Review and its methodology after they get the results.\n\n\"But we're simply giving the opinion of those hundreds and thousands of students a voice,\" he said.\n\nFranek said UD is included in the rankings in the first place because of its excellent reputation and academic chops. It has been featured in Princeton Review's book, \"The Best 384 Colleges,\" for the last 27 years.\n\nThe guide, which is updated annually, also includes detailed profiles on each institution, supplemented with quotes from students that took the survey.\n\n\"For students who aren’t on the hunt for a party, 'there are more and more alternatives to parties for the students who are not big into partying,' such the weekly events at the student center on Friday and Saturday nights,\" said excerpts from UD students in the 2019 edition of the book.\n\nIt describes UD's campus as \"so pleasing\" students immediately fall in love with it.\n\n\"Students have 'a plethora of opportunities to get involved with any number of\n\nclubs and activities all over campus,' and the majority are involved with 'Greek life, club sports, interest clubs or working for the university,'\" the book said. \"Though UD is 'not very diverse in a sense of … ethnicity,' it is 'very diverse … regarding personality' so 'everyone should be able to find the right group for them.' \"\n\nUD's most popular majors are finance, nursing, marketing, exercise science and mechanical engineering, according to Princeton Review.

The complaints included claims that many sexual assaults have gone unreported for fears they will not be taken seriously.\n\n\"We're just trying to bring awareness to student rights,\" said one freshman in attendance, Micaih Lloyd. \"Not all students feel safe on campus.\"\n\n\"We're supposed to be at a place where we feel loved, where we feel at home,\" Lloyd added. \"Administration needs to make a change.\"\n\nDirector of News Services Carlos Holmes stressed that all students have a right to free speech, and some university officials watched the afternoon demonstration themselves. This included Police Chief Bobby Cummings, who spoke to students gathered in front of his department.\n\n“Bottom line is, students have expressed serious concerns about this,” Holmes said. “And the university is listening.”\n\nHow DSU is responding\n\nPresident Tony Allen plans to meet formally with student organizers to gather more perspectives on these concerns, Holmes said. Every sexual assault reported to campus police is investigated, he added.\n\nFrom August 2022 to the day before this protest, Jan. 17, the university’s public crime log shows seven reports of rape on campus. Each case is marked as pending.\n\nChief Cummings told students even one assault report is too many.\n\n\"It’s never acceptable,\" Cummings said. \"But we investigate every incident.\"\n\nOne hurdle, he said, is trying to get information from witnesses. Cummings encouraged anyone with information on these cases to speak with campus police.\n\nHis comments were met with shouts from students, matching choruses of “Less conversation and more action.” Students also said campus police have been slow in responding to incidents, and when they arrive, nothing results from reports.\n\nPhotos:Angry DSU students speak out during anti-sexual assault protest\n\nCalls for action, answers\n\nDelyah Fleury said she often feels afraid walking across campus at night, and the sophomore hopes a protest will bring more accountability.\n\n“I hope to see some changes and better safety measures,” Fleury said. “They need to be truthful if the Police Department is understaffed. And if it is, they need to do something about it.”\n\nCommunication needs to be improved, too, she said, between students, police and administrators.\n\n“When something happens, you just get a text message. There’s no big announcement, no meetings. We need to know what we can do to protect ourselves,” Fleury said. “There’s nobody we can go to. Who do we call?”\n\nShe said resident advisers are helpful, “but they’re not MMA fighters. We need people who are trained to protect us.”\n\nSenior Morghan Walker of Baltimore said it was important for her to attend the protest to show solidarity against sexual assault because she's had friends who say they experienced it.\n\nWalker feels safe half of the time at DSU, she added. But recently, she said, she began carrying a stun gun because the claims of sexual assault have become more frequent lately.\n\nWhile she stands with sexual assault victims, Walker said she wishes victims would provide more context about their claims because the term \"sexual assault\" sometimes gets misconstrued.\n\n\"Sexual assault is not always rape. Sexual harassment is not always rape. It could've been a grope, a touch, or it could've been something that someone said,\" Walker explained.\n\nStudents also demanded action from administrators and student government leaders. Many asked for details about what the administration is going to do to respond to reports of sexual assault and to improve safety.\n\n“The university is ready to make any adjustments necessary,” Holmes told Delaware Online/The News Journal. “We just need to have more discussions.”\n\nWhat's been happening at DSU?\n\nThe protest comes as the Dover institution just celebrated enrollment milestones.\n\nDelaware State University marked a 40% expansion in the last decade by fall 2022, welcoming the largest class of 1,700 freshmen and more than 6,200 total students for the first time in its 131 years.\n\nDSU also shared a No. 2 ranking among public schools and No. 8 ranking among all Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country that fall — vying among other institutions of higher education established before the Civil Rights Act aiming to foster African American students.\n\nMORE TO READ:Colleges are shrinking.

The President’s vacation home near Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, is in the middle of a flood zone, and an analysis by a climate research group shows that the house is facing “extreme” flooding risk that is expected to get more severe over time.\n\nThat means the nation’s homeowner-in-chief is among the millions of Americans who are facing climate-linked danger to their properties – and he has a big personal financial stake in the fight against the climate crisis.\n\nBiden’s multi-million-dollar vacation home, which he has visited nearly a dozen times during his presidency, is in a quiet community tucked between a canal, the wetlands of a state park, and the Atlantic Ocean. Delaware has the lowest average elevation of any state, leaving neighborhoods like his in danger of being swamped during storms.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks to reporters as he walks on the beach in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on June 20. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nBiden and his wife Jill bought the home in 2017 after he left the vice presidency, and the structure is elevated to avoid major damage from all but the most catastrophic floods.\n\nElevation can be a powerful tool to protect against flood damage. Some climate advocates, while applauding Biden’s legislative accomplishments, argue that his administration should do more to help other residents of flood zones raise their homes – in a similar manner to the President’s summer retreat.\n\nAnd they note that areas like Biden’s wealthy neighborhood, where streets are dotted with elevated homes, are far better protected from the impacts of climate change than poorer communities hit by disastrous flooding, from rural Kentucky to Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n“When rain falls, it falls on those in power and those without power as well,” said Daniel Gilford, a researcher at the nonprofit Climate Central. “Climate change comes for all of us, but only some are wealthy enough to protect themselves.”\n\nRising waters, rising risks\n\nBiden’s home is in North Shores, an unincorporated community about a mile north of Rehoboth Beach’s tourist-filled boardwalk. The area was first developed in the 1950s and 60s on marshland that was filled in, government records and historic aerial photos show.\n\nEarly newspaper articles promoted the development’s “rustic simplicity” and “maximum privacy.” But the low-lying area also faced flooding and damage during multiple storms over the years, at times leaving streets inundated with up to six feet of water.\n\nBiden’s six-bed, five-and-a-half-bath house was built near the development’s north end in 2007, according to real estate listings. In June 2017, soon after signing a multi-million-dollar book deal, the Bidens bought the home for $2.74 million, property records show. Thanks to a pandemic-era jump in home prices, it’s now worth nearly $3.8 million, according to an estimate from the real estate website Redfin.\n\nThe home overlooks the salt marshes of Cape Henlopen State Park – a former military site that Biden helped return to Delaware when he was a US senator, and where he’s often spotted biking on weekends. The Rehoboth-Lewes Canal borders one side of the neighborhood, and North Shores’ private beach is about a half-mile walk away.\n\nThe proximity to water from multiple directions comes with a downside. The home has an extreme risk of flooding – 10 on a scale of 10 – according to the climate research group First Street Foundation, which has used environmental science and computer modeling to estimate flood risk for every property in the US.\n\nThere’s a 98% chance of flood water reaching Biden’s house within the next five years, First Street found. Less than 5% of properties nationwide have as high a flood risk.\n\nThe home is in FEMA’s Special Flood Hazard Area – the zone that would be inundated during a 100-year flood. A rarer 500-year flood would be likely to inundate the property with just over 10 feet of water, according to First Street’s national model. As climate change advances, the same flood would be expected to reach a depth of 11.4 feet in 30 years.\n\nAnd as Biden himself has noted, “what used to be once-in-a-century storms are now happening every few years.”\n\nDefended by building up\n\nIn an apparent response to that risk, Biden’s home was designed with flooding in mind. The living area is elevated about 10 feet off the ground, according to county records, with a broad exterior staircase leading to the double front doors and the ground floor used as a garage.\n\nMany of the first couple’s neighbors live at similar heights, with some huge homes suspended on stilts. New and significantly renovated homes are required by the county to be raised to a height known as the base flood elevation – five feet for much of the neighborhood.\n\nSteven Hollman, who owns a home around the block from Biden’s and serves as the president of the North Shores Board of Governors, said the community has taken efforts to mitigate the risk from floods. That includes maintaining and replenishing their private beach’s sand dunes “at not insignificant expense,” he said.\n\nThe dunes are “our first safeguard,” Hollman said. “If we have a breach of the dunes because of a cataclysmic weather event, then that’s going to affect the entire community.”\n\nRehoboth Beach as seen on July 20, 2022. Julia Weeks/AP\n\nStill, as climate change advances and sea levels rise, flooding that seeps up from the low-elevation marsh that borders Biden’s property will likely become more common, according to University of Delaware professor John Callahan, who studies flood risk in the state. Eventually, it could mean high-tide flooding, with water regularly reaching streets even on days without major storms.\n\n“A lot of flooding in neighborhoods like this is not from the ocean but from behind – the streams, marshes, and canals that all fill up and flood,” Callahan said.\n\nThe White House didn’t respond to requests for comment about the home’s flood risk, or whether the Bidens have flood insurance. While the first couple aren’t required to have flood insurance because they don’t have a mortgage on the home, Hollman said flood insurance in North Shores is “very common” even for homeowners without mortgages.\n\nBiden’s neighborhood is an example of how development near the coast can lead to more people facing flood danger decades later – a trend that’s still happening today. The surrounding Sussex County has seen a boom in housing construction, and had more homes built in areas at high risk of flooding than almost any other coastal county in the US, according to a 2019 report from Climate Central.\n\nThat kind of development is “gambling on people’s future resilience,” said Danielle Swallow, a coastal hazards specialist with the environmental organization Delaware Sea Grant. “It’s passing the risk on to homebuyers and future generations.”\n\nFrom Rehoboth to Mar-a-Lago\n\nOwning a home at risk from climate change doesn’t necessarily make a president more likely to address the crisis. But Biden has advanced measures to help protect flood-prone areas – although experts say his administration could go further.\n\nChad Berginnis, the executive director of The Association of State Floodplain Managers, said the administration’s accomplishments included allocating more funding to build flood mitigation infrastructure projects, update rainfall frequency information, and expand flood maps. He called the progress on those issues “very encouraging.”\n\nStill, Berginnis said more should be done to help individual homeowners in flood zones raise or relocate their homes – key adaptation measures that have successfully protected communities.\n\n“Going property by property is a slower slog, but it’s an effective solution, especially for many smaller communities that can’t afford or maintain” larger projects like seawalls, Berginnis said.\n\nWhile the infrastructure bill Biden signed last year increases funding for home elevations and other flood mitigation projects, experts say it doesn’t meet the growing need.\n\nAnd the bulk of grant funding for home elevations has gone to wealthy and White neighborhoods, in part because federal programs take into account the higher property values in those areas, an investigation by Politico earlier this year found. FEMA has said it is working to address the disparity and help disadvantaged communities. (No homes in Biden’s Rehoboth Beach-area zip code have received federal elevation grants, according to FEMA data.)\n\n“Elevating homes can be pricey, and it’s easier to make the money work when properties have higher value,” said Kristin Smith, a researcher with the nonprofit Headwaters Economics. That can end up excluding “some of the people who need help the most,” especially in low-income areas, she said.\n\nResearch has found that poor and minority neighborhoods have been disproportionately affected by some climate change-linked flooding, and are likely to see the greatest increases in risk over time. Less privileged communities are also more likely to struggle to recover from flooding – especially compared to places like North Shores, where most houses are vacation homes, not primary residences.\n\nMore broadly, Biden’s recent climate legislation is the farthest-reaching bill of its kind in US history, and includes hundreds of billions of dollars to reduce the carbon emissions that lead to sea level rise. However, the spending package didn’t fund programs like subsidized flood insurance that had been included in previous versions of the proposal.\n\nBiden isn’t the only executive branch leader who has a home facing climate danger: Vice President Kamala Harris has spoken publicly about how her house in Los Angeles has been threatened by wildfire.\n\nAnd former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has a similar level of flood risk as Biden’s vacation home, according to First Street.\n\nTrump spurned the scientific consensus on climate change, and unraveled or weakened dozens of environmental regulations during his time in the White House. Notably, Trump axed an Obama-era executive order that toughened building standards for federally funded construction projects in flood zones – and Biden brought it back.\n\nThat contrast between two presidents who both like to vacation in areas threatened by rising seas shows the wide variations in how Americans respond to climate risk, Berginnis said.\n\n“Presidents are people, and human nature is a funny thing,” he said. “They are going to come to their own approaches and conclusions.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}]}

Auburn University professors Richard Burt and Keith Hebert, working with a group of honors college students, have established a Facebook page where people can look through photographs from March 7, 1965, and identify themselves or others in the black-and-white images. Online since August, the page titled “Help us identify the Selma Bloody Sunday Foot Soldiers” features multiple images of marchers who are labeled with red numerals, and users can add the names of people they recognize in the comments section. Some people already have been identified, and the creators hope more will join them as word spreads about the page, particularly in Selma, where the effort is being promoted. A class at Selma High School is helping as students enlist relatives to help identify marchers. The project “highlights the need for additional historical research and documentation for one of the most famous moments in American history,” Hebert said in a statement released by the university.\n\nAlaska\n\nStevens Village: For the first time in memory, both king and chum salmon on the Yukon River have dwindled to almost nothing, and the state has banned salmon fishing there, even the subsistence harvests on which Alaska Natives rely to fill their freezers and pantries for winter. The remote communities that dot the river and live off its bounty – far from road systems and easy, affordable shopping – are desperate and doubling down on moose and caribou hunts in the waning days of fall. “Nobody has fish in their freezer right now. Nobody,” said Giovanna Stevens, 38, a member of the Stevens Village tribe who grew up harvesting salmon at her family’s fish camp. “We have to fill that void quickly before winter gets here.” Opinions on what led to the catastrophe vary, but those studying it generally agree human-caused climate change is playing a role as the river and the Bering Sea warm, altering the food chain. Many believe commercial trawling operations that scoop up wild salmon along with their intended catch, as well as competition from hatchery-raised salmon in the ocean, have compounded global warming’s effects on one of North America’s longest rivers. Many Alaska Native communities are outraged they are paying the price for generations of practices beyond their control, and many feel state and federal authorities aren’t doing enough to bring Indigenous voices to the table.\n\nArizona\n\nLake Havasu City: The city is playing up its roots with a month of celebratory events marking the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the London Bridge after its piece-by-piece rebuild in the western Arizona resort town along the Colorado River. Scheduled October events include a parade, powerboat racing, theater and musical performances, a costume contest and sports competitions. Lake Havasu City founder Robert McCulloch bought the stone bridge in 1968 for approximately $2 million and had it transported by ship and truck from London in pieces across the Atlantic Ocean and via the Panama Canal and Los Angeles. That process and reconstruction took three years, leading to the October 1971 dedication. The city of London had decided to replace the bridge because it was sinking and unfit to withstand increased automobile traffic. In Lake Havasu City, which has population of about 57,000, the bridge spanning a channel between the shoreline and an island in the river has become a major tourist attraction. Following a Friday ribbon-cutting, the 50th anniversary celebratory events got underway in earnest over the weekend with a candlelit feast and ball Saturday evening, followed by a Sunday morning garden brunch and tea leading into a costume contest, the Today’s News Herald reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday said it wouldn’t allow the state to enforce its ban on mask mandates by schools and other government bodies, while lawmakers clashed over efforts to prohibit businesses from requiring employees get COVID-19 vaccines. In a one-page order, justices denied the request by the state to stay the August decision blocking enforcement of Arkansas’ mandate ban. More than 100 school districts and charter schools have approved mask requirements since the ruling against the law. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who signed the law but later said he regretted it, had asked the court to deny the request to stay the ruling. Meanwhile, the GOP-led Senate voted to send eight bills limiting or prohibiting employer vaccine mandates back to a committee following complaints that they were rushed through a day earlier without public comment. The bills proposed include one that would allow employees to be exempted from vaccine mandates if they have philosophical or religious objections or have medical contraindications. Another would allow employees to be exempted from vaccine mandates if they’re tested weekly for the coronavirus or can prove they have antibodies, even though health officials say antibody tests should not be used to assess immunity from COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Black women in the state are more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than women of other races, prompting a wave of policy changes this year that culminated Monday with Gov. Gavin Newsom signing a new law aimed at reducing the disparity. The law, among other things, creates a new committee within the Department of Public Health to review maternal deaths throughout the state by interviewing family members and doctors while exploring records and other reports. The law is the the last piece of what’s been nicknamed the “Momnibus” bill – a reference to the legislative term “omnibus” that generally means one bill that combines multiple pieces of legislation on a number of topics. Most of the “Momnibus” changes this year happened in the state budget, which Newsom signed into law over the summer. California now will give lower-income women health insurance for up to one year after pregnancy instead of for only two months. The state’s Medicaid program, a government-funded health insurance plan for the poor, will also now pay for doulas – trained professionals who support mothers before, during and after childbirth. And the state is spending $35 million to help pay for programs that give low-income pregnant women monthly cash payments with no restrictions on how they can spend it.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver Zoo has apologized more than a decade after a Black man died after a confrontation with police on zoo grounds. Zoo President Bert Vescolani publicly apologized to Gail Waters on Friday for her son Alonzo Ashley’s July 2011 death, The Denver Post reports. The 29-year-old was visiting the zoo when he reportedly started acting strangely and ran to find a water fountain. A zoo volunteer called for police, who tackled Ashley and shocked him with a stun gun. According to a coroner’s report, Ashley was placed face down on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back and his legs crossed and pressed toward his buttocks. He began convulsing and stopped breathing before paramedics arrived. The coroner ruled Ashley’s death was caused by cardiorespiratory arrest brought on by heat, dehydration and exertion during the struggle. The district attorney’s office cleared the eight officers involved, but the city paid Ashley’s family $295,000 in 2016 to settle a lawsuit. For years, the zoo refused to acknowledge any responsibility. The death led to protests and calls for accountability for staff and volunteers for failing to recognize Ashley was in distress and no danger to the public. Many in the Denver’s Black community boycotted the zoo. On Friday, a water fountain and cooling station were dedicated in Ashley’s honor.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The city’s Civilian Review Board plans to investigate the actions of an officer who punched a man in the head three times during a trespassing arrest and was later cleared of wrongdoing by the police department. Police officials said the use of force by officer Justin Cole during the January arrest was “reasonable and not excessive” as the man fought with officers, and the finding was reviewed by an independent use-of-force expert, Hearst Connecticut Media reports. Richard Crouse, a member of the Civilian Review Board, said the panel has decided to look into the police department’s internal affairs investigation, which cleared two other officers involved in the arrest, and will report its findings to the public. Acting Police Chief Renee Dominguez said the officers were found to have complied with policies and procedures, but the outcome of the call was not ideal. Police responded to an office building Jan. 29 for a harassment complaint made by the man who authorities said struggled with officers and was punched by Cole. Another person at the scene complained the man was disruptive and trespassing, which he denied. Police officials say officers tried to de-escalate the situation for about an hour before arresting the man.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A civil rights organization is calling for the firing and arrest of a police officer seen on video repeatedly slamming a man’s head during an arrest last month at a Southbridge convenience store. During a Monday afternoon press conference, NAACP members said they will also call for the resignation of Wilmington Police Chief Robert J. Tracy and for a federal investigation of the incident. “This is another example of police brutality and police disrespect for the Black community,” Delaware NAACP President Richard Smith said. “The attorney general of the United States really needs to come in and take over the police department or come in and help us with the Wilmington Police Department, New Castle County Police Department and other police departments that abuse us in the Black community.” The officer involved in the incident has not been identified, but Wilmington police have said the three-year member of the force has been placed on administrative duty. The pressure on Wilmington Police Department to be forthright about what happened during the Sept. 21 incident in which a 44-year-old man’s head was repeatedly slammed into plexiglass is increasing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The weekend saw the return of live music with two outdoor festivals in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. On Saturday, dozens of people gathered on front lawns and in front of commercial buildings in the Adams Morgan neighborhood for the popular Porchfest festival. More than 60 local bands participated on makeshift stages throughout the area. Then on Sunday, the third annual Southeast D.C. Porchfest returned to the Penn Branch neighborhood. The seven-hour festival featured dozens of performers and local vendors. A similar event happened earlier this year in Petworth, with bands performing on front porches of volunteer houses down a 3-mile stretch of the neighborhood.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Miami Beach wants to turn down the volume in the South Beach party neighborhood, citing increasingly raucous crowds, public drinking and growing violence, but efforts to curb the carousing have raised complaints about racism, classism and business practices along one of the nation’s most glamorous waterfronts. The 10-block stretch of Ocean Drive known for art deco hotels, restaurants and bars is sandwiched between two areas that cater to more affluent tourists. The tension has been bubbling for years as party crowds grew from a few weekends a year into a year-round presence. The situation worsened during the pandemic as city officials closed the main drag to vehicles and allowed restaurants to offer more outdoor seating, which invited a carnival atmosphere on the street. More than 1,000 people were arrested during this year’s spring break, when the city imposed a rare 8 p.m. curfew. Authorities sent military-style vehicles to disperse predominantly Black crowds with rubber bullets, prompting criticism from Black activists and spawning a parody on “Saturday Night Live.” Last month, the city increased the number of law enforcement officials covering the neighborhood to a record high. Mayor Dan Gelber, who called it a stopgap measure, has proposed rebranding the blocks known as the entertainment district by hosting higher-end concerts and fairs, focusing on family-friendly events, and marketing the city’s often-overlooked museums and symphony. He also wants to limit loud music and halt alcohol sales at 2 a.m.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Four parents are suing the Cobb County school district on behalf of their children, saying its failure to require masks means their students cannot safely attend in-person classes because of their disabilities. The suit filed Friday in federal court in Atlanta says the 107,000-student suburban district is violating federal law, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Those laws govern how students with disabilities are treated in public schools. “Rather than using the known and available tools to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and protect plaintiffs’ access to school services, programs, and activities, the district has acted with deliberate indifference to plaintiffs’ rights to inclusion, health, and education,” the complaint alleges. Last week, when the Southern Poverty Law Center threatened the lawsuit on behalf of the students, Cobb schools told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that “as is the case with any issue, individual student needs are supported on a student-by-student basis, and we actively encourage any student or family to discuss their needs with their local school.” The lawsuit asks that U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten Sr. order the district to follow guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionn on masks, ventilation, physical distancing and contact tracing.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: An invasive plant species that is toxic to cattle and highly flammable has been found on the Big Island. Chromolaena odorata, also known as “devil weed,” was found on the east side of the island earlier this year, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Officials worry the invasive plant, first detected in the state on Oahu in 2011, could harm the cattle industry and fuel future wildfires on the Big Island. Devil weed has small, sticky seeds that can be transported easily, said Franny Brewer, spokeswoman for the Big Island Invasive Species Council. “Right now, we’re actually lucky that it’s just on the east side of the island,” Brewer said. “It usually likes the warmer and drier areas, so if it gets over (to the west side), that could be very bad.” An additional concern for cattle ranchers is an invasive species of insect that is also invading local pastures. Brewer said the two-lined spittlebug is attracted to nutrient-rich grass on which cows graze and can devour a pasture, leaving the land open to the introduction of devil weed. The plant’s leaves contain a substance that is highly flammable, Brewer said, which could increase the threat of increasingly common wildfires in Hawaii.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A partial recount of ballots cast during the 2020 presidential election has validated the accuracy of the results, state officials say, despite manipulation claims by Trump ally and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. The Idaho secretary of state’s office said Wednesday that a hand inspection of ballots in Camas and Butte counties found margins of error of less than 1% – far below what Lindell had claimed in saying votes for former President Donald Trump went to President Joe Biden. Lindell has made unsubstantiated claims and floated conspiracy theories about last year’s election in multiple states in an attempt to undermine voter confidence in the outcome. That has extended even to Idaho, where Trump easily won the deep-red state with nearly 64% of the vote. “The office of the Idaho Secretary of State takes free, fair, and accurate elections seriously,” Republican Secretary of State Lawerence Denney said in a statement. “So when we are presented with allegations that come with specific details which we can examine, we want to do so.” The secretary of state’s office said a document questioning Idaho’s vote count appeared on a website with a copyright belonging to Lindell. It claimed votes cast for Trump were electronically switched to Biden in every county. Denney’s office recorded video of both counties’ recount processes.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A new relief fund launched by city officials could give a boost to hundreds of artists and entertainment industry workers who have lost income during the pandemic. The $2.3 million Chicago Creative Worker Assistance Program will benefit members of the arts and entertainment industry with grants ranging from $2,000 to $5,000, the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events announced Thursday. Arts administrators, teaching artists, artisans, curators, independent cultural producers and technicians who lost income over the past 18 months because of coronavirus restrictions will be eligible for the aid, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement that she hopes the funding can provide relief for creatives, as many of them are gig workers whose pandemic unemployment insurance benefits have expired. DCASE Commissioner Mark Kelly said he’s looking forward to the city’s talented artists returning to the spotlight this fall along with the resurrection of entertainment venues, which are gearing up for a busy end of the year. The relief fund’s announcement comes nearly a week after Navy Pier hosted “Chicago LIVE Again!” – a two-day outdoor festival that celebrated the return of live performances.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A longtime Democratic state senator from northwestern Indiana has decided to leave her seat in frustration over iron-fisted Republican control of the Legislature. Sen. Karen Tallian of Ogden Dunes submitted a letter Thursday to Senate leaders that she would be resigning effective Nov. 1, about a year before her term ends. Tallian was sharply critical of Senate Republicans, saying that “after 16 years I’ve had enough.” “The process has become degraded. Every bill is vetted, in secret, by the Republican caucus,” Tallian told The (Northwest Indiana) Times. “So it becomes impossible to have real debate on the floor most of the time because they’ve already decided what gets to be heard and what won’t.” Tallian has been a longtime advocate of legalizing marijuana, an issue that’s been blocked from debate by Republicans who have a 39-11 Senate majority. Tallian raised that issue as she spoke on the Senate floor Friday. “Some time in the future, maybe near, maybe nearer than you think, Indiana will join the rest of the country and address the marijuana question,” Tallian said. “And when you do, think of me.” Democratic precinct committee members in Tallian’s district will select a new senator for the 2022 legislative session.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city has canceled a contract with a private security company more than two months after reports revealed troubling remarks by its CEO, who referred to local racial justice protests as “terrorism.” The city’s contract with the Conley Group was to end at midnight Monday. City Manager Scott Sanders said in a statement that both parties reached an agreement to end the contract, while an attorney for company CEO Tom Conley said the Conley Group asked the city to end its contract early, citing “high customer demand.” The company was set to see its $250,000 city contract more than double in July, until Conley’s remarks surfaced in a Des Moines Register investigative report. It had been providing security services to the city since early 2020 at locations including City Hall, the Argonne Armory, the municipal services center and the former Dico Superfund site. The city launched an internal investigation in July after Conley sent inflammatory emails to Des Moines officials, including some that made disparaging remarks about George Floyd and members of the central Iowa-based Black Liberation Movement.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Some counties are seeing youth vaccination rates for COVID-19 far below the national average, according to state data released last week. A school pandemic workgroup established by Gov. Laura Kelly received data from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment showing that in about a quarter of the state’s counties, less than 20% of vaccine-eligible children ages 12 to 17 had received at least one dose as of Sept. 24. U.S. regulators in May expanded the use of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to children as young as 12. The national vaccination rate for youth is 57%, according to a presentation by Marci Nielsen, a special advisor to Kelly. Most of the low-vaccine counties are in western Kansas or other rural areas. By comparison, no Kansas county has less than 20% of its total eligible population fully inoculated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Johnson, Douglas and Riley counties exceed the national rate for youths, Nielsen said. Decatur County in northwest Kansas reported the lowest rate with 3% of youths receiving a first dose. Parents have commented on social media that they won’t get their kids vaccinated because they value free choice or think kids are less likely to become severely ill, said Derek Chambers, lead pharmacist at Ward Drug in Oberlin.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A deteriorating bridge that was home to thousands of endangered gray bats has been repaired in way that makes the span safer for motorists and wildlife, officials said. A project team from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make a habitat-focused design as crews replaced the bridge superstructure with new beams, deck and railing and made repairs to the existing abutment and piers, state officials said in a statement. Repairs on the rural, two-lane span were made in a way that provides more roosting space for the bats. After construction, officials estimated more than 1,000 bats had returned to the bridge. Officials didn’t release the span’s exact location in an effort to prevent interference with the bat habitat. “This bridge project is the first of its kind in Kentucky, using an innovative and collaborative approach to mitigate the effects of much-needed bridge repairs on an important endangered species,” Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: Southwest Louisiana leaders say the disaster assistance approved by Congress will be too little to solve the lingering housing crisis and other needs caused by Hurricane Laura, which struck the region more than a year ago. Billions of dollars in federal disaster aid were included in legislation passed by Congress on Thursday that also helped avoid a government shutdown. Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter said the package has $1.6 billion in disaster block grant aid to split among states for all the 2020 disasters, with southwest Louisiana anticipated to get $600 million for Laura and the follow-up blow of Hurricane Delta. “When you look at other singular hurricanes over the last 20 years and the billions of dollars that have flowed down to those communities, $600 million is crumbs,” he said. Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration has estimated the unmet needs for Hurricanes Laura, Delta and Zeta at roughly $3 billion. Calcasieu Parish Police Jury President Brian Abshire said in a statement that while the parish has waited patiently for federal aid, “Washington politics has diluted the relief bill,” which he called a “feel-good bill” that “makes no one but the federal politicians actually feel good, and it will do very little for Calcasieu Parish.”\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: A Canadian company plans to bring ferry service back to Bar Harbor next year, restoring service between Maine and Nova Scotia. Bay Ferries operated ferry service from Bar Harbor to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, for more than a decade before moving to Portland and ending service in 2009. Bay Ferries tried to return for the 2019 season but failed to get the ferry terminal renovated and approved in time. Then came the pandemic that scuttled service in 2020 and 2021. Now the company is ready to try again with a high-speed catamaran-style ferry called “The Cat.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Officials say the state will again spray pesticide Permanone 30-30 to control mosquito populations, after EPA testing determined it does not contain dangerous PFAS. The Baltimore Sun reports the Maryland Department of Agriculture temporarily halted use of the pesticide in the state this year “out of an abundance of caution” after testing by an outside lab found 3,500 parts per trillion of one type of PFAS and 630 parts per trillion of another, said MDA spokesman Jason Schellhardt. But testing by EPA scientists at Fort Meade returned a different result. PFAS, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, are also known as “forever chemicals” because they can linger in the human body for long periods of time. Laboratory tests have shown that accumulated PFAS can cause tumor growth in animals, in addition to problems with kidney, liver and reproductive function. Ruth Berlin, executive director of the Maryland Pesticide Education Network, one of the groups that commissioned the earlier test of Permanone 30-30, said she wasn’t satisfied by the new results from EPA scientists.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former police union boss in the city has pleaded guilty to collecting more than $16,000 in fraudulent overtime pay while working at the department’s evidence warehouse, federal prosecutors said Monday. Thomas Nee, 64, of Quincy, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit theft concerning programs receiving federal funds and embezzlement from an agency receiving federal funds. A plea hearing has not yet been scheduled. Nee submitted false and fraudulent overtime slips from at least January 2015 through February 2019 and personally collected about $16,642 for overtime hours he did not work, prosecutors said. He’s the 15th former or current officer charged in connection with the investigation into overtime abuse at the police department’s evidence warehouse. Nine officers have so far pleaded guilty. Federal officials say more than $250,000 was embezzled. Nee was a longtime president of the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association who served until 2014. The embezzlement charge carries a sentence of up to ten years in prison and the conspiracy charge up to five years.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed several Republican-sponsored election bills, saying they would have perpetuated falsehoods to discredit the 2020 presidential election and made it tougher for people living in large senior facilities and apartment complexes to vote. Two measures would have codified existing practices by limiting access to Michigan’s voter database and keeping electronic pollbooks and voting systems from being connected to the internet on Election Day. The bills implied that outside parties had access to the files and that electronic pollbooks were connected online when neither was the case, the governor wrote to lawmakers. She also blocked a measure that would have expanded the types of buildings that can be polling places to include private conference centers and recreation clubhouses. It included a provision to let municipalities put polling places at senior facilities and apartment complexes with at least 150 residents, as they can now, but only if public buildings like schools were “not reasonably available for use or convenient to use.” Whitmer vetoed the legislation Sunday night at the NAACP Detroit branch’s annual Fight For Freedom Fund Dinner. The bills, she said, “attempt to suppress the vote or perpetuate the ‘Big Lie’ – the calculated disinformation campaign to discredit the 2020 election.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Renville County must conduct an environmental review to determine whether a proposed drainage ditch improvement could harm one of the last free-flowing creeks in the heavily agricultural western county, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled Monday. The appeals court reversed a decision by the county board, which concluded the study wasn’t necessary. The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, which challenged the county’s decision, said the court’s ruling sets a precedent that means any drainage project across the state that affects public water will require an environmental review. The dispute involves proposed improvements to a century-old ditch that empties into the upper reaches of Limbo Creek. Backers say the project would lead to better drainage of farmland. The Renville County Board declined in 2020 to order an environmental assessment worksheet because the creek’s upper reaches didn’t appear on an official inventory of “public waters” kept by the state Department of Natural Resources. But the Court of Appeals ruled that upper Limbo Creek nevertheless meets the state’s definition of public waters, so the review is mandatory. Limbo Creek flows directly into the Minnesota River, which has long been a major contributor of silt and farm chemicals to the Mississippi River.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: The city is planning to spend most of its federal pandemic relief money on parks and recreation, and critics say elected officials are ignoring people who need housing. Starkville is receiving $6.2 million from the American Rescue Plan Act. Aldermen voted Sept. 21 to spend $5.5 million of it for parks and recreation, $500,000 to hire police officers and $200,000 to improve water infrastructure in a subdivision, the Commercial Dispatch reports. Cate Van Hurdle, a representative with the Starkville Strong community action group, said homelessness and evictions are increasing in Starkville. “Because there is no money going to help these people, the city may be forcing people to possibly live in the parks or sleep in those parks,” Van Hurdle said. Federal guidelines say the pandemic recovery money may be spent on things including tourism; water, sewer and broadband infrastructure; assistance to businesses and families disproportionately affected by COVID-19; and premium pay for public employees. Mayor Lynn Spruill developed Starkville’s spending plan with the help of city attorney Chris Latimer, focusing heavily on tourism. While Spruill acknowledged homelessness and other infrastructure needs, she said other sources of money can be used to address those issues.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Pope Francis has joined the chorus of people calling on Gov. Mike Parson to grant clemency to a death row inmate who is set to be executed for killing three people during a 1994 convenience store robbery. In a letter last week, a representative for Pope Francis wrote that the pope “wishes to place before you the simple fact of Mr. Johnson’s humanity and the sacredness of all human life,” referring to Ernest Johnson, who is scheduled to be executed at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the state prison in Bonne Terre, about 50 miles south of St. Louis. Parson, a Republican, has been considering whether to reduce the 61-year-old Johnson’s sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Johnson’s attorney, Jeremy Weis, has said executing him would violate the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits executing intellectually disabled people. He said multiple IQ tests and other exams have shown that Johnson has the intellectual capacity of a child. He also was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and in 2008 lost about 20% of his brain tissue to the removal of a benign tumor. Racial justice activists and two Missouri members of congress – Democratic U.S. Reps. Cori Bush of St. Louis and Emmanuel Cleaver of Kansas City – have also called on Parson to show mercy to Johnson, who is Black.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A district judge has denied a request by several parents to halt mask mandates in city schools while a legal challenge of the mandates is underway. The parents sued several Missoula schools in August over their mask requirements, arguing they violated the state’s constitution, which guarantees individuals the right to make their own medical decisions. Missoula District Judge Jason Marks denied the request for a preliminary injunction Friday, saying in his decision that such an injunction could lead to increased spread of COVID-19 and quarantining of children and school staff. The decision came the same day dozens of Montana residents gathered at the state Capitol on Friday to decry mask mandates for schoolchildren. The rally was led by Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen, a Republican. Lawyer Quentin Rhoades, who represents several parents suing Missoula public schools over their mask requirements, said in August that there isn’t sufficient scientific evidence that children wearing masks prevents the spread of the coronavirus for the government to override parents’ rights to make decision about their children’s’ health. But several studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found school districts without a universal masking policy in place were more likely to have COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A woman believed by many to be the oldest living American has celebrated her 115th birthday. The Omaha World-Herald reports Thelma Sutcliffe marked her birthday quietly at the facility where she lives in Omaha. Sutcliffe was born Oct. 1, 1906, in Benson, Nebraska, which is now part of Omaha. Her parents owned a farm. At age 17, she married Bill Sutcliffe, who worked for the Postal Service. He died in the early 1970s. The Gerontology Research Group said Sutcliffe became the nation’s oldest living person April 17 when Hester Ford died in North Carolina at age 115. The oldest person in the world is believed to be 118-year-old Kane Tanaka of Japan, who was born Jan. 2, 1903.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: A flurry of laws passed by the Legislature this year took effect Friday, ushering in reforms that Democratic lawmakers who have majorities in the state Senate and Assembly have long campaigned to implement. Five years voters approved legalizing recreational cannabis in Nevada, business owners can now apply for licenses to establish on-site consumption lounges, where adults can smoke, “dab” or eat THC-laced edibles that they buy. Once licensed, the lounges will become the first public places in Nevada where pot products can be consumed recreationally. The state’s emerging cannabis industry has promoted the lounges for their economic development potential and pitched them as a draw for the millions of tourists who visit Las Vegas annually but can’t legally use the products in places like hotels. The permitting system created under the new law prioritizes Black and Latino applicants who have been “adversely affected by provisions of previous laws which criminalized activity relating to cannabis.” A points-based system to score applicants was introduced after data showed the state’s cannabis industry to be disproportionately white and male – a finding that concerned lawmakers and advocates who said it pointed to the racial disparities in how drug offenses were prosecuted.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Granite State filmmakers have explored the life of composer Amy Beach in a newly released documentary, highlighting her success story of the early 1900s as a widely recognized female pianist and composer. Beach was a New Hampshire native who taught herself how to compose symphonies while performing with world-renowned orchestras, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. John Grfoerer, the documentary maker, said that options for Beach were quite limited in the 1900s and that she might otherwise have gone on to appearing in more performances instead of composing. Grfoerer said even though she was denied the proper education to become a trained composer, she found a way to teach herself. The film premiered Friday on the Bank of New Hampshire stage.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The nation’s most expensive Superfund cleanup to remove cancer-causing pollution from the Passaic River will be expanded to include 9 more miles in Bergen, Passaic and Essex counties under a plan approved Monday by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But the $1.84 billion project to clean all 17 miles of the lower Passaic is still several years away from launching, officials said Monday. The $441 million expansion plan would excavate 387,000 cubic yards of contaminated river mud and place a barrier over the rest in a stretch of the river from North Arlington to the Dundee Dam, which spans the waterway between Clifton and Garfield. The plan comes more than seven years after the EPA unveiled an ambitious $1.4 billion “bank to bank” cleanup of the lower 8 miles of the Passaic from Newark Bay to Belleville where much of the pollution is concentrated. That dredge and cap project has not yet begun. “We know we can’t turn around a century of pollution overnight, but today as part of the solution we’re taking a very important step,” EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said during a virtual news conference Monday. EPA officials have wanted both projects on the river to be done concurrently to minimize disruptions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: New Mexico State University says less than a third of its students submitted proof of vaccination for COVID-19 by a Thursday deadline to otherwise undergo weekly coronavirus testing or leave the university. While 72.3% of the school’s employees provided proof of vaccination, only 30% of students did, officials said Friday. It’s not clear how many students who didn’t submit proof of vaccination by the deadline plan to submit weekly test results, officials said. “We’re not where we want to be with our vaccinated students,” said Jon Webster, the school’s COVID-19 project manager. “We want to make sure we’re protecting all of our students.” Failure to submit vaccination information or weekly test results can result in student suspension or staff termination, officials said. Students can get inoculated at any point in the semester and cease the weekly required testing once achieving full vaccination, Webster said. “We are seeing new submissions continue to come in, so we expect our final verified total to be significantly higher than what we’re seeing today and to continue to rise over the next several weeks as some students and employees receive their second dose and update their cards,” Webster said. Several students said Friday that they were unaware of the mandate’s details.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A statue honoring George Floyd in Union Square Park was vandalized Sunday, police said. According to police, a video showed an unidentified man on a skateboard throwing paint on the statue about 10 a.m. then fleeing. Sunday’s act wasn’t the first example of vandalism to the statue memorializing Floyd, whose killing at the hands of police in Minneapolis last year galvanized a racial justice movement across the country. The statue was unveiled on Juneteenth on Flatbush Avenue, in Brooklyn, and was vandalized five days later with black paint and marked with an alleged logo of a white supremacist group. Members of the group that installed the statue cleaned it, and local residents and one of Floyd’s brothers gathered in July as it was prepared to move to Manhattan. Meanwhile, city officials have suspended nine firefighters without pay in connection with a string of racist messages and memes they shared on their phones, including ones mocking Floyd’s death, The New York Times reports. A spokesperson called the suspensions the most severe punishments ever handed down in the history of the Fire Department of the City of New York, according to the paper. Black firefighters told the Times they believed the suspensions fell far short of deep-rooted problems in the department, where leaders have acknowledged that racism, sexism and harassment have been tolerated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSmithfield: A school board has passed a policy barring critical race theory in its classrooms after county commissioners threatened to withhold nearly $8 million in funding. The Johnston County school board on Friday unanimously approved an updated policy on how history and racism will be taught, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Under the new policy, teachers could be disciplined or fired if they teach that American historical figures weren’t heroes, undermine the U.S. Constitution in lessons or describe racism as a permanent part of American life. The all-Republican Johnston County Board of Commissioners was withholding $7.9 million until the school board passed a policy keeping critical race theory out of local classrooms. A revised code of ethics policy includes new wording such as “the United States foundational documents shall not be undermined,” and “all people who contributed to American Society will be recognized and presented as reformists, innovators and heroes to our culture.” April Lee, president of the Johnston County Association of Educators and an eighth grade social studies teacher, said the school system is “selling our souls to the devil for $7.9 million” and called the new policy “basically extortion.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Progress is being made on making the state Capitol more accessible to those who are physically disabled. State leaders have approved constructing new bathrooms and making other renovations to better accommodate wheelchairs. Over the next year, a meeting room will be made into three larger family restrooms that will be handicap accessible. “Just thinking about what it’s like to walk around here if I were visiting the Capitol with little kids, there are not accommodating spaces to take kids to the bathroom, other than to take them all into the women’s restroom or whatever,” said Sen. Erin Oban, D-Bismarck, KFYR-TV reports. There will also be wider doors installed for some meeting rooms. Contractors will be hired in the coming months, and construction will start shortly thereafter.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio State University has now tallied more than 2,800 instances of alleged, decades-old sexual misconduct by the late team doctor Richard Strauss, according to its latest campus crime data. The school says more than 170 total instances of rape and more than 2,600 instances of fondling attributed to Strauss came to light between 2018 and 2020, much of that through a law firm investigation for the university and lawsuits filed against OSU. The crime statistics are disclosed under the federal Clery Act, and incidents are counted in the year they’re reported, not the year they occurred. The 2020 data in the report adds dozens of instances of rape and about 470 instances of fondling attributed to Strauss. Hundreds of men allege he abused them at campus athletic facilities, a student health center, his home and or an off-campus clinic, and some of those men reported multiple instances. They say the school failed to stop Strauss despite students raising concerns during his 20 years at the university. Ohio State has apologized, and it announced settlements with 185 plaintiffs totaling nearly $47 million and with dozens more people for amounts not yet disclosed. A judge recently dismissed some of the biggest unsettled lawsuits, citing legal time limits. Plaintiffs in those plan to appeal. Still other cases are pending.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: A retired Army colonel is helping the city prepare to host dozens of refugee families from Afghanistan. U.S. Army Col. Mike FitzGerald, a 20-year veteran and current operations manager for Catholic Charities of Eastern Oklahoma, said the first families are expected to start arriving Nov. 1. “These are people that are asking for our help,” he told the Tulsa World. “They are young families with small children. These aren’t the bad guys.” Accommodations are being provided by Oklahoma State University and private landlords, FitzGerald said. “Stillwater is a very welcoming community and home to a lot of international students as part of OSU and has been a very diverse community because of our status as a university town,” Mayor Will Joyce said. “I would expect that any new refugee or other international visitors will find it to be a very welcoming place.” Organizers have also set up a committee structure to help with transportation, adult and children’s education, jobs, household supplies, furniture and groceries. The children may enroll in Stillwater Public Schools, FitzGerald said, and English language classes will be available. The U.S. Department of State is also providing $1,225 per person in a family, and work authorizations are being expedited so family members can find work quickly.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Three neighborhoods will soon be home to the city’s first “safe rest villages.” Commissioner Dan Ryan is leading the effort to construct six city-sanctioned outdoor homeless villages by the end of the year, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. He announced the downtown, Brentwood-Darlington and Hazelwood locations Thursday, saying the sites are a critical response to the “humanitarian crisis” unfolding on Portland’s streets. While there hasn’t been an official count of the city’s homeless population since 2019, encampments appear to have proliferated during the pandemic. These villages will be outdoor shelters where people experiencing homelessness can safely stay and receive basic services. Showers, beds, bathrooms, and support services including case management and mental health support will be offered. Ryan, who oversees the city-side of the Joint Office of Homeless Services, emphasized that each village will be fenced, with each individual possessing their own “sleeping pod.” Combined, the city expects the three sites to host about 120 people. “We can’t wait for affordable housing to be ready for every houseless person,” Ryan said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Powerful labor leader Johnny “Doc” Dougherty went on trial Monday in a City Hall corruption case that accuses him of keeping a City Council member on the union payroll to push his agenda. Dougherty, 61, who has steered more than $30 million in union funds to political candidates, faces a later extortion trial over other union activities. He expressed confidence that he would clear his name as he arrived for jury selection Monday at the federal courthouse, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. “I have had zero crimes,” Dougherty said outside the courthouse, making a zero with his hand for emphasis. “So this is a relief. I can’t wait to get in and get this done.” Dougherty had been in the FBI’s sights for years before the 2019 indictment charged him with more than 100 crimes, including keeping City Council member Bobby Henon in a $70,000-a-year union job while he worked full time in the $140,000-a-year City Council post. Dougherty has held a tight grip on construction jobs in the Philadelphia region during more than two decades at the helm of Local 98 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which has nearly 5,000 members. He also leads the city’s Buildings Trades Council, an umbrella group of local unions with 70,000 members.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: Researchers at the University of Rhode Island and their colleagues at Penn State have been awarded a four-year, $1.5 million grant to study the effects of sea level rise and how it may worsen the impact of extreme weather, URI said in a statement. The goal is to help communities, the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service adapt and improve their resilience as the climate continues to change and hurricanes and nor’easters continue to increase in frequency and severity, the statement said. The grant is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which says the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. Sea level plays a role in flooding, shoreline erosion and other hazards, affecting nearly 40% of the U.S. population. Yet there is a lack of research available when it comes to how the impacts of nor’easters and hurricanes may be amplified as a result. “There are a number of studies that have been done looking at just sea level rise or just extreme weather, but what we’re really lacking in terms of clear understanding is the combined impact of these two phenomena,” said oceanography professor Isaac Ginis, who is leading the study.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Dylann Roof wants an entire appellate court to reconsider a decision to recuse itself from hearing his case, as the appeal of his death sentence and conviction in the 2015 racist slayings of nine members of a Black congregation winds its way through the judicial system. Last week, Roof’s attorneys made that request of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, writing that the judges who opted to sit out his case should reinstate themselves to consider his petition for a new hearing before the court. Without that move, or changing a court rule prohibiting judges visiting from other circuits from considering such requests, Roof’s lawyers wrote that “no judges exist to consider” his rehearing petition, depriving him of “a critical level of appellate review.” All of the judges from the 4th Circuit, which covers South Carolina, have recused themselves from hearing Roof’s case. No explicit reason was given in the court’s notice of that move in May, although one of the judges, Jay Richardson, prosecuted Roof’s case as an assistant U.S. attorney in 2017, when Roof became the first person in the U.S. sentenced to death for a federal hate crime. Authorities have said Roof, then 21, opened fire during the closing prayer of a Bible study at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, raining down dozens of bullets on those assembled.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Dozens of National Guard members from the state will answer a call from the Pentagon to help at the country’s southern border, with 125 members of the 1742nd Transportation Company being deployed for 9 to 12 months. Gov. Kristi Noem, Sens. John Thune and Mike Round, and Rep. Dusty Johnson were on hand for an activation ceremony Sunday at the University of Sioux Falls Stewart Center, KELO-TV reports. “So they’re going to go down there, try and reinforce the border, bring some order and stability, and obviously do it in a humanitarian and compassionate way,” Thune said. “We want them to know that we have their back,” Johnson said. “We understand that they’re going to be sacrificing a lot; their families are going to be sacrificing a lot over the next year. But we’re going to do the kind of things that we can do in Washington to make sure that they have the proper training, the proper equipment, but also in our communities to make sure their families are taken care of during the difficult time.” In July, Noem sent 50 South Dakota soldiers to the border following Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s request for help.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: In the first case of a new session, U.S. Supreme Court justices heard allegations that the city is essentially stealing groundwater from underneath Mississippi. That argument faced skepticism from members of the court Monday in Mississippi’s effort to get millions in damages for what officials say is Tennessee’s trampling over its sovereignty when it comes to water. At issue is whether Memphis city government, city-owned utility Memphis Light, Gas and Water, and the state of Tennessee have been pumping water in a way that has harmed Mississippi and siphoned off the water that was underneath it in the Claiborne Aquifer, of which the Memphis Sand aquifer is a region. Mississippi argues that, essentially, the water underneath the state belongs to it and no other state despite the fact that the aquifer in question is under eight states, not just Mississippi. It wants its northern neighbor and Memphis to pay millions in damages for past pumping of water – damages, that, if awarded, would be a huge financial liability for the city. Mississippi’s argument is one that it has made for years and that several courts have found lacking. A special master, a term for an official appointed by a court to oversee a case and hear arguments, also disagreed with Mississippi’s take.\n\nTexas\n\nLeague City: Police have arrested a man who was accused of stabbing a restaurant manager with a pocketknife after being told he needed to wear a mask. The stabbing happened in March at a Jack in the Box restaurant in League City, just southeast of Houston. Authorities had issued an arrest warrant for James Schulz Jr. shortly after the stabbing occurred, but he wasn’t taken into custody until last week, police said. At the time, police said Schulz refused to follow the restaurant’s policy requiring him to wear a mask to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. Police said he then attacked the manager. The manager had three stab wounds in the arm and upper torso, police said. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated and released. Schulz was arrested Wednesday on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct. Jail records did not list an attorney who could speak on his behalf.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Hundreds of maskless people packed a legislative hearing Monday to urge lawmakers to fight President Joe Biden’s plan to require most workers to get either vaccinated against COVID-19 or regularly tested for the coronavirus that causes it. The vast majority of people who attended the hearing in person criticized Biden’s plan, saying they fear it will infringe on personal freedom and cripple Utah’s economy. Sen. Curt Bramble said about 600 to 700 people attended the hearing in person, with another 200 who attended virtually. Last week, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox threatened to veto any legislation that blocks businesses from mandating employees to get the vaccines. He has said he opposes government mandating vaccines but supports businesses implementing their own mandates. Biden’s Sept. 9 announcement is expected to cover as many as 100 million Americans – private-sector employees as well as health care workers and federal contractors. Some mandates seem to have converted hesitant workers, but employers are still dealing with holdouts. The COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. were tested on tens of thousands of people and have proven to be both safe and effective at dramatically reducing the risk of serious disease and death.\n\nVermont\n\nVergennes: The state’s earliest known Black sheriff and police chief has been commemorated with a historical marker. The marker for Stephen Bates, who served as sheriff and police chief from 1879 until his death in 1907, was unveiled in Vergennes on Sunday at an event attended by at least 100 people, WCAX-TV reports. “Stephen Bates’ life and service represents immense perseverance overcoming enslavement to become a prominent member of the community in Vermont and dedicating his life to serving the people of Vergennes,” Gov. Phil Scott stated in a proclamation deeming Oct. 3, 2021, Sheriff Stephen Bates Day in the state. Bates was born in 1842, was enslaved in Virginia and gained his freedom through serving with Union soldiers during the Civil War, according to the governor’s proclamation. A team of community members and historians have been researching Bates’ life for the past year. “People started to join us from historical areas,” said Alicia Grangent of the Historical Marker Team. “Conversations about who to reach out to started to happen, and people just started to naturally gravitate towards this process.” Team members found and talked with some of Bates’ descendants, including great-grandchildren Larry and Nicholas Schuyler, who attended Sunday’s ceremony.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A medical glove manufacturing facility promising to employ nearly 2,500 people is coming to southwest Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday, calling the news the biggest job-creation announcement in the struggling region in a generation. Backed by significant federal spending, the project in Wythe County, 250 miles west of the state capital, is expected to create a number of jobs per capita equivalent to Amazon’s new headquarters in Arlington, according to the governor’s office. Northam called the project a big win for southwest Virginia and said the pandemic and associated supply chain problems had shown the need for more domestic production of personal protective equipment. Two companies, Blue Star Manufacturing and American Glove Innovations, have agreed to form a joint venture and invest $714 million to create both a nitrile butadiene rubber manufacturing facility and a nitrile glove production operation, according to a news release. The facilities are expected to occupy more than 200 acres at an industrial park near the junction of interstates 77 and 81. The project will increase the raw material production and manufacturing of gloves now primarily made in Asia, Northam’s office said.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: An invasive fungus that causes white-nose syndrome in bats continues to spread in the state, after the fungus was detected in late spring near Rimrock Lake. During spring and summer field work this year, scientists with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and U.S. Forest Service detected the fungus or disease in Yakima, Chelan and Mason counties, according to a news release. Scientists collected samples in the spring from a bat colony on Forest Service land near Rimrock Lake. Testing confirmed the presence of the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome, the Yakima Herald-Republic reports. The syndrome is harmful to hibernating bats but does not affect humans, livestock or other wildlife. The disease is caused by a fungus that attacks the skin of hibernating bats and damages their wings, making it difficult to fly. Infected bats often leave hibernation too early, which causes them to deplete their fat reserves and become dehydrated or starve to death. Washington is home to 15 bat species that are important predators of night-flying insects. These bats benefit humans by eating insects that can negatively affect forest health, commercial crops and human health.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A popular riverfront festival is returning to the city next year after a decade­long absence. The Charleston Sternwheel Regatta will take place over the Fourth of July weekend next year, Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin said in a news release Friday night. The Regatta was held as an end-of-summer festival from 1971 to 2009. It ran for as long as 10 days and included fireworks, concerts, carnival rides and food vendors. Goodwin said people have asked her to bring the Regatta back since she took office in 2019. “Regatta means so much to so many,” she said. “Because of the overwhelming amount of feedback we received, it was a priority for us to bring back this famed Charleston event.” The statement said a full schedule of events will be announced in the coming months.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Department of Natural Resources officials on Monday dramatically scaled back the number of wolves hunters can kill during Wisconsin’s fall season in open defiance of its policy board, setting up another clash between liberal-leaning department leaders and conservative board members. Department biologists originally recommended setting the quota at 130 wolves, saying they were uncertain what effects the state’s spring hunt had on the wolf population. The policy board bumped the limit to 300 animals in August, prompting outrage from conservationists and wolf advocates, who have filed two lawsuits seeking to stop the hunt. The DNR announced in a news release Monday that it was unilaterally moving the quota back to 130 animals. Under treaties established in the 1800s, the state’s Chippewa tribes can claim up to half of the quota, but the Chippewa consider wolves sacred and won’t hunt them. The DNR said the tribes have claimed 56 animals, leaving state-licensed hunters 74. The DNR’s defiance left board member Greg Kazmierski flabbergasted. He said state law makes clear that the board directs and supervises the department. “They are not free to just do that,” Kazmierski said. “It’s in violation of the statute that establishes the board. They’ve gone rogue is what they’ve done.”\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: An autopsy has determined that a man whose body was found on the shore of a Yellowstone lake died of hypothermia, park officials said Wednesday. Mark O’Neill, 67, of Chimacum, Washington, had been on a four-night backcountry trip to Shoshone Lake with his brother, Kim Crumbo, 74, of Ogden, Utah. A relative reported them overdue Sept. 19. Searchers found O’Neill’s body Sept. 20 on the lake’s eastern shore. A search for Crumbo on foot and by boat will continue, weather permitting, for several days, park officials said in a statement. A vacant campsite was found on the lake’s south side. What happened remains under investigation, they said. The men were experienced boaters and former National Park Service employees, and Crumbo is a former Navy SEAL who served in Vietnam. Crumbo co-founded the conservation group Grand Canyon Wildlands Council, which later merged with another group to form Wild Arizona.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/05"}]}

Now one Wilmington community is ...", "text": "Northeast residents were pummeled by Hurricane Ida's remnants in 2021, and the memories of flooding, displacement and panic remain fresh on the minds of many.\n\nResident organizers are launching \"Northeast Rising,\" a team and climate resilience hub aimed at community engagement and climate-change-fueled disaster preparedness.\n\nIt aims to offer training, resources and safe shelter in the wake disaster — or during extreme summer heat.\n\nMud was caked up to their knees.\n\nA mom, a dad, their little boy, an image of them walking up the street stays soaked in her mind. It joins displaced families packing local hotels, babies with diaper rashes, damp clothes and hungry faces. Months of new images, more people in need.\n\nStacey Henry remembers coming home exhausted each night after Hurricane Ida, after its remnants brought extreme flooding to her neighborhood in September 2021. She organized relief efforts; she disseminated supplies; she helped families find housing; she was recognized as a woman of the year. But the self-appointed people’s advocate also remembers more private moments, venting through a clutched phone.\n\n“At night, I would literally go home and there was one friend of mine, she would just listen to me,” the Wilmington native remembered. “I just kept saying, I didn't know the name of it. I didn't know what to call it, but I have to build something.”\n\nShe would start keeping a list of those unhoused. She would spend hours cooking, bringing trays of pasta to hotels. She would start fielding calls from all over the city, frantically organizing food distribution, asking state officials if they'd buy diapers or dry socks. Days following the flooding were chaotic, and residents in the Northeast were terrified.\n\n“I have to organize something,” Henry continued, recalling her evening musings. “So that when there's a disaster, there's a place or a group that can come in immediately, until the plans that they have in the file cabinets with dust on them are pulled out.\"\n\nMemories of flooding, displacement and panic are still fresh on the minds of many residents in Wilmington's Northeast. Organizers who stepped up after this storm never want to see the same devastation again. Or, face it unprepared.\n\nToday they hope to have the beginnings of an answer: a Delaware Resilience Hub.\n\nHenry and other residents banded to launch a climate resilience hub, focused on community engagement and climate-change-fueled disaster readiness. The team has found a funding partner in Philadelphia-based Green Building United, alongside other partners across Delaware.\n\nPacked into Wilmington’s PAL Center, a community center and the base for the new outfit, organizers marked an official launch April 29 with information sessions, workshops and free emergency preparedness kits. It's a first for the neighborhood, Henry said, and a first for Delaware.\n\nShe hopes the vision expands to more Wilmington neighborhoods.\n\n‘I wouldn’t take no for an answer’:Lifelong Wilmington resident recognized for advocacy\n\nIntensifying future storms, accelerating sea-level rise, extreme heat — Henry knows the brunt of disasters is borne by under-resourced, vulnerable neighborhoods like her own. Riverside, 11th Street Bridge and Eastside neighborhoods were some of the most affected by Ida.\n\nNow, a vision of preparedness is taking shape. And step one might be getting people's attention.\n\nHave a story to tell? Delaware Online/The News Journal is placing special emphasis on reporting about heat impact this summer, as part of an ongoing Perilous Course project across USA TODAY Network Northeast examining the human-centered damage and risks driven by the climate crisis. Reach out: kepowers@gannett.com.\n\nUnderstanding a vision for resiliency in Wilmington\n\nResidents peered into their buckets.\n\nFlashlights, first aid kits, bottled water, blankets, rope, more packed against smooth blue plastic. Many residents who had to replace personal documents just two years ago looked down at plastic sleeves made to store copies of birth certificates and other identification. Over 30 attendees filed into the center, perched on North Market Street’s higher ground, and were handed these stuffed kits.\n\n“Grab the bucket while they're grabbing you,” Henry put it simply. Her team believes many neighbors would be much better off if they had supplies like these during Ida.\n\nThe kits are an early step for the group, Northeast Rising. It meets aims for training on first aid, evacuation routes and more for members and interested residents. Unlike working alone in a makeshift hotel office in 2021, Henry and her team want residents to know there’s a place to go in the wake of disaster.\n\nThe hub boasts communication, resources, dry clothes and cool air. And it would support more than post-disaster recovery.\n\nEven on the soggy April morning, Henry knows summer is fast approaching. Core to the hub’s plan, she described, will also be offering a place to escape a different threat.\n\nStill flooding their neighborhood, still sweeping between homes and across pavement, already claiming more lives than any other weather-related cause in the U.S. — it’s heat.\n\n“It’s a place for them to be for the hours that the heat index is dangerously high,” Henry said. Heat index, or how hot a day \"feels,\" combines both temperature and humidity. When it's more humid, it's much harder for the body to cool off by sweating.\n\nNortheast Rising plans to open the air-conditioned gym when conditions call for it, providing water and food. Research shows the brunt of increasing heat will not be felt equally. It will fall on households with lower incomes, renters without access to efficient air conditioning, those facing homelessness and others most vulnerable.\n\nUrban heat island?Not all Wilmington neighborhoods experience the same summer heat. Here’s why.\n\nBack in the PAL, hardly able to keep still as she watched residents listen to the Aug. 29 speakers, Henry knows she has yet to see anything quite like her vision in the First State. She called it a catalyst.\n\nBut, Northeast is just one pocket of Delaware’s largest city.\n\n“This is small,” she said.\n\n“It's large for me, but it may be small for the city. I don't have money to do what I need to do — but I've started to bring awareness to the support that we're going to need from the community, from the government, from everyone, to make this hub one of many.”\n\nStorms like these...\n\nHurricane Ida’s remnants brought floods to a 20-block radius of the city.\n\nA maximum crest of 23.1 feet — measured near Rockford Park on the morning of Sept. 2 — had the Brandywine set a new record, as previously reported.\n\nFloodwaters lifted cars, swallowed bridges. Emergency responders rescued over 200 people from homes, wading through the streets in boats. Displaced residents struggled for months to find housing, as city and state response came under fire.\n\nA changing climate will play a role in the prevalence of these strong storms. A warming planet draws more water into the atmosphere, contributing to heavier storms, and a rising sea.\n\nIt’s everywhere:Sea-level rise is damaging much more than beach homes and East Coast shoreline\n\nLooking back:Displaced by September floods, Wilmington residents still living in shelters, cars in January\n\nFrom the Chesapeake to Massachusetts bays, Ida brought surges several feet above typical high tide levels. Rising seas can spell problems for more inland communities, too, as high tides and strengthened storm surges push water higher in nearby rivers during extreme storms, and into floodplains.\n\nRivers across the region broke records. Higher tides push back on these rivers, preventing flow back into the sea — while fresh water from extreme rainfall starts stacking up.\n\nIf it can’t drain into watersheds, it will find new routes. Without regard for neighborhoods.\n\nDangerous moisture can be more insidious, too.\n\nFor every 1-degree Celsius temperatures rise, according to First Street, the air holds about 7% more water vapor. This contributes to more humid days, with a higher likelihood of hazardous heat.\n\nHeat claims more lives than flooding and hurricanes combined.\n\nDense urban areas feel heat exacerbated, as concentrations of dark materials like asphalt, steel and brick trap heat between buildings and streets. A difference of a few degrees of extreme heat can affect the body’s ability to regulate, and extended exposure compounds stress on organs. Those with respiratory illnesses, diabetes and obesity maintain the highest risk.\n\nWilmington already sees an average of seven more days a year over 90 degrees than it did 50 years ago.\n\nThe state is tied with Arizona as the fourth-fastest warming state based on temperature trends since 1970. Average temperatures in Delaware are projected to increase 2.5 to 4.5 degrees by 2050, from 2012 averages. That could rise up to 8 degrees by 2100, in the worst emissions scenario, according to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.\n\nHistorically just one day above 100 degrees would be rare in Delaware, coming about once a year, if that. But by 2050, the state’s Climate Action Plan warns of two to eight each year, alongside projections of up to five nights with temperatures above 80.\n\nThe perilous list continues.\n\nThis more extreme future will likely demand physical adaptation, according to a national report on hazardous heat, as well as planning for emergency heat events, such as checking on residents, creating more cooling centers and ensuring people can reach them.\n\nThat means communities and governments unfamiliar with extreme heat will have to adapt and prepare for it.\n\n“The conversation needs to be about people,” Henry said, back in Wilmington. “It’s about our climate and what we're going to do to prepare ourselves for what's coming.”\n\nHave a story to tell?

They drove to a nearby gas station to escape the oncoming floodwaters.\n\nWithin minutes, water from the Brandywine rushed down their street in northeast Wilmington.\n\n“The water just kept coming,” Hurst said. “It was like the whole creek just kept coming down Governor Printz.”\n\nThe remnants of Hurricane Ida caused record floods in Wilmington on Thursday, pushing the Brandywine beyond its banks and into surrounding neighborhoods. The flooding displaced more than 200 people from their homes, hitting the city’s Riverside and 11th Street Bridge neighborhoods the hardest – largely Black neighborhoods facing high rates of poverty.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE:Hurricane Ida remnants in Delaware: Record floods prompt home evacuations in Wilmington\n\nIt wasn’t until Friday morning after floodwaters receded that neighbors returned home to assess the damage. Until massive cleanups and repairs can happen, their waterlogged homes are uninhabitable.\n\nAt the same time, displaced residents said that by Friday afternoon, no plan or direction for getting those in need into housing had been communicated by the city, state or American Red Cross.\n\nAt the Police Athletic League on North Market Street, where an emergency shelter was set up Thursday afternoon, displaced residents arrived on Friday trying to find whatever help they could get.\n\nInstead, they arrived to find a handful of volunteers in a near-empty gymnasium. They were unsure if the shelter would stay open through Friday.\n\n“The city dropped the ball,” said Durrell Dollard, who arrived at the shelter around noon Thursday.\n\nHe and his family used the last of their money to secure a hotel room for the night, worried about staying in a shelter during the ongoing pandemic. With no family in the area, they didn't know where they’ll stay Friday night. And they haven’t received any direction or help from any entity yet.\n\nUPDATE:Resources for Wilmington residents affected by flooding and how to donate to those in need\n\n“It’s in disarray,” he said of their home on East 15th Street. The family left the house at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday with the clothes on their backs. “I’m traumatized. I’ve been patient. We’ve talked to nobody yet. There’s no vouchers, no nothing.”\n\nOn Thursday, Mayor Mike Purzycki declared a state of emergency in the city, urging residents to call 211 if they were in need of additional services. Gov. John Carney also suggested the state’s hotel voucher program as an option for displaced residents.\n\nAfter some confusion, the emergency shelter at the Police Athletic League was to remain open Friday for anyone in need, volunteers said.\n\nBut getting longer-term resources into the hands of people in need has proven difficult. Residents said they called 211 and no one answered.\n\nHurst and Blake and their four children spent Thursday night on blankets and air mattresses in the living room of family friend Stacey Henry, who had gathered donated baby supplies for their 10-month-old.\n\n“This city and state have no plan, no effective plan,” Henry said. “Yeah, you’ve got your trucks cleaning up, but what about your people?”\n\nRAIN TOTALS:Ida 24-hour rain totals in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York\n\nStanding outside their home on Thatcher Street, Blake and Hurst assessed the damage. A clogged pipe kept water from their basement from emptying onto the already muddy street. The air smelled of sewage. Inside their home, water had climbed about a foot high, leaving the tile floors soaked.\n\nTheir four children, still wearing their pajamas and now-muddy shoes, talked to an uncle trying to keep them distracted.\n\n“When are we going home?” they asked.\n\nAt a minimum, it’ll be a week until the family is able to re-enter their home, the landlord told them.\n\nIt’s the beginning of the month, and the family just paid their rent and bills. There’s no budget for a hotel when you live paycheck to paycheck, Hurst said.\n\nThey have no clue what comes next.\n\nNatalia Alamdari covers equity and underserved communities for The News Journal.

Kids, families, local officials and others filled a room fitted for presentations on disaster preparedness and response. Back in September 2021 these residents saw flooding, displacement and panic across their northeast neighborhoods in the wake of Hurricane Ida. This week, they hoped to hear how to keep history from repeating.\n\nThe Delaware Resilience Hub — a resource hub focused on community engagement and climate change-fueled disaster readiness launching earlier this year — hosted an Emergency Preparedness Day. The outfit brought a presentation and resources from Wilmington's Office of Emergency Management, DEMA, Red Cross and the Delaware Sea Grant.\n\n\"What are the steps that I need to take to make sure me and my family are safe?\" Hub organizer Stacey Henry posed ahead of the meeting. \"This is what we've been asking for, for two years.\"\n\nNot all residents' questions were answered in the meeting, but Henry noted monthly trainings and further events will be hosted by the hub. As she put it: \"We will make sure the conversation doesn't end here.\"\n\nHere are some key takeaways on how families can prepare for environmental disaster across Delaware.\n\nHow can I sign up for emergency alerts?\n\nThe Delaware Emergency Notification System , or DENS for short, is the primary system for public warnings and emergency action information in the First State, according to DEMA. Cities, counties and state agencies can send alerts to Delawareans, once they register.\n\n, or DENS for short, is the primary system for public warnings and emergency action information in the First State, according to DEMA. Cities, counties and state agencies can send alerts to Delawareans, once they register. Speakers also called attention to Smart911.com — a site allowing 911 operators and first responders to know key information about your household in the event of an emergency. The idea is this information could help responders care for your family on any call coming from a number registered with an account.\n\nWhat should I do in a flood?\n\nDelaware's rate of sea-level rise is about twice the global average.\n\nFlooding is the top environmental hazard in the state, explained Danielle Swallow, a coastal hazards expert with Delaware Sea Grant. Heavy rain and storms offer particular threat, while high tide flooding also continues to increase in prevalence.\n\nEvery storm is different, but there are steps to take to be better informed if that day comes.\n\nUnderstand your risk . Is your home close to a wetland? What elevation is it? If you live within or close to a floodplain, you know you could be in the path of possible flooding and can prepare for it. Regardless, roughly 20% of flood claims to FEMA are outside \"high risk\" zones, so households also should assess their own vulnerabilities, if they have kids, older adults or anyone more sensitive to possible impacts. Renters and homeowners should consider investing in flood insurance.\n\n. Is your home close to a wetland? What elevation is it?

Or as DEMA puts it, \"Know Your Zone.\" Evacuation Zones, A to D, encompass low-lying areas, susceptible to flooding and storm surge, according to the agency, and should be understood before the day of disaster. If you're signed up through DENS, you would receive an alert to evacuate. Local coverage may also convey which zones are supposed to evacuate before or during an emergency. If you're sheltering in place, be sure it's not while being alerted to evacuate.\n\n.

As Willie Patrick put it: Winging it is not a good plan. \"With our experience from Ida, we have learned so much,\" said Wilmington's director of emergency management. \"Everyone has identified those things that need to be done better, and we're working toward that.\" Register for notifications and Smart911, keep information updated, inform your contacts to do the same, Patrick noted. Many Northeast residents in attendance said they didn't receive notifications ahead of Ida remnants' pummeling the neighborhood, but these questions were not addressed directly. Have a plan for how you will leave and where you will go, following evacuation guidance. Take an emergency supply kit, ideally fit with cash, key numbers or email addresses for family members, copies of important documents and proof of address. \"Who are your preparedness buddies?\" posed Jeffrey Baggett. Designate an emergency meeting place for reunification.\n\n. As Willie Patrick put it: Winging it is not a good plan. \"With our experience from Ida, we have learned so much,\" said Wilmington's director of emergency management. \"Everyone has identified those things that need to be done better, and we're working toward that.\"\n\nHow do I create my own emergency preparedness kit?\n\n“Grab the bucket while they're grabbing you,” Henry put it simply earlier this summer.\n\nVolunteers encouraged attendees to think of essentials they may need in an emergency that they could place in a sealed bucket or other container until disaster strikes. One of the Delaware Resilience Hub's earliest efforts came in similar packaging, preparing emergency kits for every resident attending its launch or other informational meetings.\n\nFor that effort, hub members packed flashlights, first-aid kits, bottled water, wipes, blankets and more into large plastic buckets.

They also are able to carry that power farther inland, bringing areas that used to be safe from hurricane-strength winds and devastating rains − since as temperatures rise, warmer air carries around more water vapor − in danger of being in the firing line.\n\nFinally, powerful hurricanes are pushing farther north along the Eastern Seaboard as they ride the increasingly warm waters up the coast. The result is areas that are generally safe from strong hurricanes, like the Mid-Atlantic and New England areas, are getting battered. In September 2022, the remnants of Hurricane Fiona hammered Canada's Nova Scotia with coastal wind gusts that reached more than 100 mph. According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, Fiona was the most costly extreme weather event ever recorded in Atlantic Canada and the tenth largest in Canada in terms of insured damages.\n\nDr. Michael Mann, professor with the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania, said 2021's Hurricane Ida and the devastating flooding it did all the way to Philadelphia and into the Northeast after forming in the Gulf of Mexico is a prime example of these more intense storms maintaining their tropical characteristics for much longer after making landfall.\n\n\"But there’s also evidence (including some of our own work) that the change in prevailing wind patterns associated with human-caused warming is leading to more northerly trajectories of storms, away from the Southeast and toward the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and we seem to be seeing that too,\" he said via email.\n\n'Unavoidable financial impacts'\n\nA report released earlier this year by the First Street Foundation echoed the dangers posed by these hurricanes as they push into areas where people aren't used to and buildings aren't often built to handle powerful storm impacts.\n\nCrunching together computer modeling of hurricane tracks, high-resolution topographical information and property data, the study forecast wind-risk changes and damage estimates for much of the Eastern U.S. from these more powerful storms in the coming decades.\n\nNot surprisingly, the report found the Florida and Gulf Coast communities will continue to have the largest potential for economic loss from hurricanes. The shift in location and strength of hurricanes in Florida alone results in the number of properties that may face a Category 5 hurricane jumping from 2.5 million in 2023 to 4.1 million by 2053.\n\nThe study also found that inland regions away from the coast and states that historically have rarely seen hurricanes would be at greater risk. For example, the report says that by 2053 all of North Carolina will be at risk from damaging wind speeds, with some areas in the Mid-Atlantic seeing maximum wind gust speeds increase by 37 mph and corresponding damages increase by 50.3%.\n\nOverall, the report found that in the next 30 years 13.4 million properties in the U.S. will be exposed to a level of tropical storm or higher wind risk that they do not currently face today.\n\n“Compared to the historic location and severity of tropical cyclones, this next generation of hurricane strength will bring unavoidable financial impacts and devastation that have not yet been priced into the market,\" said Matthew Eby, First Street Foundation's founder and CEO, in a release accompanying the report's late February release.\n\nWeighing risk while determining rates\n\nThe impacts of these changing weather conditions are likely to have profound impacts on insurance markets, and not just in areas like Wilmington that are seeing regular significant jumps in their rates as companies factor in their vulnerability to insuring properties in \"hurricane alley.\"\n\nGeorge Hosfield, senior director, home insurance at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, said historically insurance companies look at past performance to see what's going to happen in the future when determining rates. But in a world warped by climate change, that future is looking a lot more risky for insurance companies − and rates are rising in response. That includes rates in areas where property owners might feel they're being asked to shoulder some of the risk of consumers living in more exposed areas, like at the coast.\n\nRISING RATESInsurance on NC beach rentals is going up again, potentially by a lot. Here's why.\n\nRATING THE RISKPlan to assess risk of climate change on insurance, including in NC, courts controversy\n\nIf the risk is deemed to be too great, or state regulators balk at allowing insurance companies to charge rates that allow companies to cover their potentially liabilities, then insurers will pull out of a market. That's what's happening in Florida and Louisiana due to concerns over hurricane exposure and in California due to the risk of wildfires.\n\nHosfield said property owners can mitigate some of the risk posed by the storms of the future by getting flood insurance, even if they're not in a historic floodplain. States can also prepare for tomorrow's weather by strengthening building codes, although North Carolina legislators recently rejected plans to strengthen the state's residential building code over concerns it would price new homebuyers out of the market, and making smarter land-use decisions.\n\n\"When it comes to recovery, do we continue to rebuild the exact same home in the exact same spot, which is what we've historically done,\" Hosfield said.\n\nWith much of the Earth's future warming already baked in thanks to decades of massive greenhouse gas emissions, researchers know change is coming. But Vesanto and Hosfield said it won't happen overnight, and means there's still time for us to get prepared and adapt if needed.\n\n\"We're not really seeing a full picture of it yet,\" Hosfield said. \"It will be a gradual change.\"\n\nReporter Gareth McGrath can be reached at GMcGrath@Gannett.com or @GarethMcGrathSN on Twitter.

In the course of the next month, the state will receive requests from government agencies and nonprofits.\n\nThe exact funding figure will then be based on these requests, which will likely not be determined for another couple of months, said Jeff Sands, spokesman for the Delaware Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThe historic flooding that resulted from Hurricane Ida in September displaced more than 200 people from their Wilmington homes. It mostly hit the city’s Riverside and 11th Street Bridge neighborhoods, which are largely Black areas facing high rates of poverty.\n\nLast month, Gov. John Carney sent a lengthy letter to the president, seeking funding to help with the aftermath. The governor’s request included individual assistance, public assistance and hazard mitigation grant programs, as well as aid from the Small Business Administration.\n\nThe requests for public assistance and SBA aid were approved for New Castle County, and hazard mitigation grant program funding was approved for the entire state, officials said.\n\nOne area federal funds could go is to the Bancroft Bridge in Alapocas Run State Park, which experienced extensive damage from Hurricane Ida. The bridge has “bowed and shifted on its support beams and foundation, which has cracked,” according to a news release. It was a result of debris as floodwater rose to its lower structure.\n\nThe declaration may result in federal funds going toward the bridge, but there’s no cost estimate at this time, said a Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control spokesman.\n\nFollowing this initial announcement, Delaware was informed on Monday afternoon that FEMA denied the state's request for individual assistance. This was considered to be the most impactful request since it could have provided money directly to homeowners and renters.\n\n\"The determination was made by FEMA that 'the impact to individuals and households in New Castle County is not of the severity and magnitude to warrant designation of Individual Assistance,'” according to a news release.\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration low-interest disaster loans will be available to certain homeowners and renters in New Castle County, as well as nonprofits and businesses in the area.\n\nNearly two months after the storm, many Delawareans are still struggling with the aftermath. Residents of Claymont Street Apartments, which had 29 subsidized units, were forced to find their own housing as temporary lodging expired Oct. 15.\n\nTo make matters worse, the COVID-19 pandemic has put a significant strain on the state’s emergency housing options. Many have had to wait for years on a waitlist, even before the pandemic.\n\nBACKGROUND:An apartment building was displaced by last month's flood. As sea levels rise, it's a sign of what's to come.\n\nHomeowners, like Juanita Gonzalez, are realizing they have few options, as their flood insurance – or what they thought was flood insurance – covers little. The most significant assistance some residents have received has been from other Wilmington neighbors, who filled the gaps when the city and state were still mobilizing a response.\n\nGonzalez’s home in Wilmington experienced five feet of flooding in the basement, resulting in significant damage. The moldy, damp smell still lingers. Most of her daughter’s belongings are ruined.\n\nShe estimates she will have at least $20,000 in repairs, though one estimate valued it at $12,000, which she thinks is too low. For weeks, Gonzalez has been calling different state and federal agencies but has yet to get much help or answers.\n\nSo far, Gonzalez has only received $500 in aid, in the form of a gift card.\n\n“We're in limbo and nothing,” she said, “nothing is being done.”\n\nDisaster loan information and application forms can be downloaded at sba.gov/disaster, by calling 800-659-2955 or emailing DisasterCustomerService@sba.gov.

Also knowing if you are in a storm surge evacuation zone is vital.\n\nSuch a designation is based on water levels and not on wind velocity.\n\n\"Figure out where you would go if you were told to evacuate,\" Feltgen said. \"It doesn't need to be hundreds of miles inland, just out of the zone.

Do you know ...", "text": "The effects of Earth’s changing climate are being felt now.\n\nTemperatures are increasing. Seas are warming; oceans rising. And scientists have said both heat and sea-level rise are helping make some natural disasters more extreme.\n\nLook two or three decades ahead, and the picture worsens.\n\nClimate change is ramping up long-term risk just about everywhere on the globe. But even in the United States alone, it will not be felt equally. Some areas may experience more heat, more floods, more extreme weather, more wildfires or all of the above.\n\nSome locations might surprise you; some may not.\n\nDelaware lies among them.\n\nUSA TODAY looked at data from First Street and Moody’s Analytics — two organizations examining climate risk — to see what areas of the country are most vulnerable over the next 30 years. Consequences vary widely over time, reports USA TODAY’s Dinah Voyles Pulver this week, but a growing body of evidence has helped highlight general trends.\n\nNATION:Climate change is bad for everyone. But this is where it's expected to be worst in the US.\n\nWho’s at risk of climate change impact?\n\nClimate change has been pumping up the rain in some tropical storms, while the heavier, wetter systems are also likely moving more slowly down their destruction paths. This research is ongoing, USA TODAY reports.\n\nIn a Moody's Analytics study on climate risks in the United States, published earlier this year, author Adam Kamins ranked states on acute physical risk. This is based on weather-related events, like hurricanes, as well as disasters like flooding and wildfires.\n\nDelaware came in at No. 5.\n\nThat makes the small state the fifth most at risk of the threats of physical disaster fueled by climate change. When considering the economic costs of climate change, damage to physical assets could be “the most intuitive starting point,” Kamins writes.\n\nMore extreme weather takes a greater toll when population and development increase in these areas. Long term, scientists say areas could start to experience “out-migration” to areas less exposed to climate risks.\n\nAcute physical risk rankings:\n\nFlorida Louisiana South Carolina North Carolina Delaware Rhode Island New Jersey Virginia Massachusetts Connecticut\n\nNortheast:They struggled during Ida. Now one Wilmington community is finding a better way to respond\n\nNew Jersey also had several counties among the top of First Street’s lists for potential increases in average annual wind losses, extreme fire risk and properties at risk of flooding. New Jersey already suffered three hurricanes or their remnants in 2021-22.\n\nExperts from Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said many risks are shared with nearby states in the region.\n\nWhat about risk that doesn’t grab headlines?\n\nMoody’s Analytics also took a look at places with more gradually increasing risk — think sea level creeping up, nights getting warmer, average temperatures swelling.\n\nSome cities are particularly exposed to change over time, compared with single events.\n\nWilmington fell in at No. 8 in this chronic physical risk ranking.\n\nFor Delaware’s largest city, vulnerability to increasing heat, sea-level rise and water stress compounded in Kamins’ analysis. In a 2021 Climate Action Plan, Delaware similarly identified increased average temperatures, hotter and longer summers, rising sea levels and increased precipitation as key consequences of climate change in the state.\n\nDelaware's average overall temperature has already increased by 3 degrees Fahrenheit since about 1900, Susan Love, DNREC's Climate and Sustainability section administrator, told USA TODAY Network.\n\nThis combines with rising seas. DNREC’s Coastal Program has projected 1.7 to 5 feet of sea-level rise by the year 2100, according to a 2022 report. In addition to Delaware’s low-lying topography, the state is also experiencing land subsidence, or sinking.\n\nFrom Earth Day:Scientists told us what 2050 could be like. Their answers might surprise you.\n\nEPA:People of color face disproportionate harm from climate change\n\nChronic physical risk appears widespread:\n\nSan Francisco Cape Coral, Florida New York City Long Island, New York Oakland, California Phoenix Tucson, Arizona Wilmington, Delaware West Palm Beach, Florida North Port, Florida\n\nWarming, warming, warming\n\nWilmington already sees an average of seven more days a year over 90 degrees than it did 50 years ago.\n\nThe state is tied with Arizona as the fourth-fastest warming state based on temperature trends since 1970. Average temperatures are projected to increase 2.5 to 4.5 degrees by 2050, from 2012 averages. That could rise up to 8 degrees by 2100, according to DNREC, in the worst emissions scenario.\n\nLove said the climate in Delaware, over time, \"is going to start tracking more like the climate in Georgia.\"\n\nHistorically just one day above 100 degrees would be rare in Delaware, coming about once a year, if that. But by 2050, the state’s plan warns of two to eight each year, alongside projections of up to five nights with temperatures above 80.\n\nWhat's an urban heat island?Not all Wilmington neighborhoods experience the same summer heat. Here’s why.\n\nBreaking down the science:Is climate change fueling massive hurricanes in the Atlantic?\n\nThis puts human health — elevating risks of heat exhaustion, heat stroke, various respiratory issues and other diseases — natural resources, agriculture and even infrastructure at risk. Populations particularly at risk from high heat include children, older adults, people who work outside, people with underlying health conditions and people with limited access to cooling.\n\nHigher temperatures also increase the evaporation of water from soil and can increase water demand, which could affect drinking water supplies, according to DNREC, particularly in New Castle County.\n\nWith much of this impact, the coming severity remains somewhat in human hands.\n\nThis more extreme future will likely demand physical adaptation, according to First Street’s national report on hazardous heat, as well as planning for emergency heat events, from checking on residents, to creating more cooling centers or ensuring people can reach them.\n\nScientists also say substantial action to hold warming below 3 degrees Fahrenheit could limit the worsening of extreme weather, though certain sea level increases would already be locked in from existing emissions.\n\nRegardless, areas outlined in First Street and Moody’s Analytics reporting remain exposed.\n\nHave a story to tell?
