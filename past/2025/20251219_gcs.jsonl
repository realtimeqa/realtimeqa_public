Unemployment across the country hit a four-year high, according to the latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many Americans remain on edge that the president’s high tariffs will drive up prices.\n\nTrump’s bonus for servicemembers is the latest of several steps the president has taken to offer support for U.S. troops. Among them, the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), passed by Congress and sent to President Trump's desk in December 2025, includes a 4% pay raise for service members. The law also includes $2.9 billion to fund new barracks and family housing, as well as to increase investment in childcare fee assistance.\n\nThe president also previously signed the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act into law, which creates a partial claim program to help veterans who have fallen behind on their mortgages avoid foreclosure.\n\nTrump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" additionally provides broad benefits for service members and their families, including $100 million in Department of Defense Impact Aid to support public schools serving large numbers of military children.\n\nIn both his presidential terms, Trump has drawn favorability from the military and their families.

At least that's what je continues to say.\n\nDuring his Tuesday, Dec. 2, cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump said \"Next year is projected to be the largest tax refund season ever, and we're going to be giving back refunds out of the tariffs, as we have taken in literally trillions of dollars.\" Adding, \"We're going to be giving a nice dividend to the people in addition to reducing debt.\"\n\nIn early November, the president began floating the idea of issuing a $2,000 dividend to \"middle income people and lower income people\" from the \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" collected with promises of tariff rebate checks.\n\nLast week, Trump also said the tariff revenue could eventually be \"so great\" that the government could cease levying income taxes, \"I believe that at some point in the not too distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay, because the money we're taking in is so great, it's so enormous, that you're not going to have income tax to pay. Whether you get rid of it or just keep it around for fun or have it really low, much lower than it is now, but you won't be paying income taxes.\"\n\nTrump said last month, \"The tariffs allow us to give a dividend, if we want to do that. Now we're going to do a dividend, and we're also reducing debt we have because of Biden and others; we have $37 trillion in debt,\" said Trump. \"So we're going to be doing a dividend, which people will enjoy and spend and do what they want. But we're also going to be reducing debt very substantially.\"\n\nSo what is the latest on $2,000 stimulus check 2025 status?\n\nBudget experts and lawmakers aren't sure though.\n\nErica York, a policy expert at the Tax Foundation, said in a post on X, \"If the cutoff is $100,000, 150M adults would qualify, for a cost near $300 billion. If kids qualify, that grows. Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far.\"\n\nAs of Sept. 30, the federal government had generated $195 billion in tariff-related revenue, according to officials, which compared to the possible payout of the dividend check proposal would come up short.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson also said in an interview with Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo the country \"can't afford\" Trump's $2,000 dividend idea, “Look, we can’t afford it. I wish we were in a position to return the American public their money, but we’re not.”\n\n“We’ll have at least a $2 trillion deficit this year,” Johnson warned, \"That compares to prior to the pandemic. President Trump had deficits about $800 billion. Obama, in his last four years, $550 billion a year. Now we’re $2 trillion? Completely unacceptable. We have to start focusing on that and doing something about it.”\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office last month projected the federal deficit would hit $1.8 trillion for 2025, according to news reports.\n\nHowever, officials note that in theory, Trump and his administration could potentially look to make the payout based on \"anticipated\" tariff revenue as the Treasury Department has forecast $3 trillion in tariff revenue over the next decade.\n\nNote that Trump's $2,000 tariff dividend payment is still being floated with no formal proposal and little details thus far.\n\nHere's when and what to know about Trump's tariff dividend checks and who would be eligible for the $2000 stimulus check.\n\nAre we getting a fourth stimulus check 2025?\n\nTrump previously floated the idea of using part of the government revenue being generated by the new tariffs and returning it to taxpayers of a certain income level in the form of a rebate check, similar to the stimulus checks sent during the pandemic, back in July.\n\nThat tariff rebate check idea was then introduced in a bill by Sen. Josh Hawley, called the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025, that would send checks between $600 and $2,400 to American taxpayer families. However, it has not passed through Congress as of yet.\n\nIn February, Trump also said he would consider the plan to pay out $5,000 stimulus checks to taxpayers in the form of a “DOGE dividend” during a summit in Miami. He explained it as using part of the 20% of the savings identified by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and giving it back to taxpayers. However, he has not shared any further specifics or details about the possible “DOGE dividend” or its certainty since then.\n\nThere were three prior stimulus checks tied to COVID-era stimulus programs, the third and last of which had an April 15, 2025 deadline to claim. The opportunities to claim or file for the first stimulus payment (issued in March and April 2020) or the second stimulus check (issued by Jan. 15, 2021) or the third stimulus check (issued between March and December 2021) have now passed.\n\nA rebate is a partial refund of the purchase price that a consumer paid, often upon meeting certain conditions, while a dividend by definition, is a distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders and refund is a payment made back to a user that previously paid for something.\n\nA stimulus check, on the other hand, is a direct payment to encourage spending and stimulate the economy by putting money directly into the consumers' hands.\n\nWhile speculation about a fourth stimulus check has surfaced on social media and unverified websites, there has been no official confirmation from Congress or the IRS to support this claim and any such news should be taken with caution as it could be misinformation or attempted fraud.\n\nWhen will the $2000 tariff dividend payment be paid?\n\nTrump's $2,000 tariff dividend payment is still being floated with no formal proposal and little details thus far; however, he has made clear that the payments would not be issued before the holidays this year, but rather sometime in 2026, before the midterms.\n\nIn November, Trump vowed to issue dividend checks to \"individuals of moderate income\" sometime in 2026, before the midterm elections. Adding, \"We've taken in hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff money. We're going to be issuing dividends later on. Somewhere prior to, you know, probably in the middle of next year, a little bit later than that. Of thousands of dollars for individuals of moderate income, middle income.\"\n\nWho would be eligible for Trump's $2000 tariff dividend?\n\nBased on Trump's recent comments about the $2,000 tariff dividend, the income qualifications would exclude \"high income people.\"\n\n\"We're going to issue a dividend to our middle income people and lower income people of about $2,000,\" Trump said on Nov. 10. \"And we're going to use the remaining tariffs to lower our debt.\"\n\nDuring two prior pandemic-era stimulus checks authorized by Trump, they were made available to individuals bringing in as much as $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000 and higher earners were eligible for smaller payments.\n\nWhat is considered middle class income in America?\n\nThe middle class is defined as those earning up to double the median household income, while high-income earners can make 10 times that — or more. Lower income is often defined as those making 150% of the federal poverty level or less.\n\nPew's Research Center and the U.S. Census Bureau reports that the 2024 median household income was $83,730.\n\nUsing Pew's definition of middle class as households that earn between two-thirds and double the median household income, the middle class consists of people making somewhere between $55,820 and $167,460 in 2024. Those earning less than $55,820 make up the lower-income bracket, while those earning more than the $167,460 make up the upper-income bracket.\n\nHowever, income class can be directly impacted and influenced by family size and location as the median income can look very different in all 50 states depending on their cost of living.\n\nStates with the highest median household incomes exceeding $95,000 include Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, New Hampshire and California, according to SmartAsset, while states with the lowest median household incomes below $60,000 were Arkansas, Louisiana, West Virginia and Mississippi.\n\nCities with the highest median income were Arlington, Virginia and San Jose, California where it exceeded $136,000 versus Cleveland, Ohio or Detroit, Michigan where it was less than $40,000.\n\nYou can find your income class via Pew Research Center's income calculator or click here.\n\nMaria Francis is a Pennsylvania-based journalist with the Mid-Atlantic Connect Team.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/12/09/trump-claims-2000-stimulus-coming-when-who-in-georgia-gets-it/87687636007/", "title": "Trump claims $2,000 stimulus coming. When? Who in Georgia gets it?", "text": "Dec. 9, 2025, 2:34 p.m. ET\n\nThe global tariffs have had wide-ranging impacts, but one promise President Trump has made about them again and again is that they will result in $2,000 stimulus checks for people. So, where are they?\n\nLast month, Trump posted on Truth Social that \"low- and middle-income USA Citizens\" would receive the payments. However, this remains a proposal only and has not been approved by Congress.\n\nWill Trump issue a stimulus check before Christmas 2025?\n\nIn a recent announcement, Trump said the checks would not be distributed before the holidays, adding, \"No, no. Not for this year. It'll be next year sometime.\" He's gone on to say checks should not be expected until the middle of 2026 or sometime before midterm elections.\n\nAs of Nov. 24, no new federal stimulus checks have been authorized by Congress, and the IRS has confirmed that no payments are scheduled for 2025.\n\nHow do I know if I qualify for Trump's $2,000 tariff checks?\n\nTrump has commented that qualifications for his idea of a proposed tariff dividend were that it would be paid to everyone, excluding \"high income people.\"\n\nNo new stimulus program has been approved, and no eligibility requirements have been set. Be cautious of texts or emails claiming payments, as the IRS has warned that these are often scams.\n\nWhat is considered middle class income in Georgia?\n\nThe middle class is defined as those earning between two-thirds to double the median household income.\n\nPew's Research Center and the U.S. Census Bureau reported in 2024 that the median household income was $83,730. However, income class can be directly impacted by family size and location. The median income can also vary in all 50 states, depending on their cost of living.\n\nAccording to GOBankingRates, to be considered middle class in Georgia, a household would have to make at least $49,776. Here's what is needed for families:\n\nTwo-person family middle-class income range : $53,287 to $159,860\n\n: $53,287 to $159,860 Three-person family middle-class income range : $60,853 to $182,560\n\n: $60,853 to $182,560 Four-person family middle-class income range: $73,824 to $221,472\n\nAccording to 2024 data from the Census, about 31% of Georgia households have a collective income of less than $50,000. Almost 16% make between $50,000 and $74,999.\n\nMiguel Legoas is a Deep South Connect Team Reporter for USA Today.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a video posted on X Thursday morning, said the payments will be tax-free, and will arrive before Christmas.\n\nHegseth said payments will be sent to the lowest entry-level rank of private (E-1) to the O-6, considered the 6th officer paygrade in the military, such as captain in the Navy, Coast Guard and other branches. But still, much remains unanswered: Do I qualify? Is it actually taxable? Does this affect by pay raise? Do Guard or Reserve members get paid?\n\nHere's what to know about military members who live in New Jersey, and what comes next.\n\nWhat is 'Warrior Dividend'? Trump's 1776 check\n\nDuring President Donald Trump's address to the nation last night, Wednesday, Dec. 17, Trump announced a \"Warriors Dividend\" bonus check, saying a $1,776 one-time payment was \"already on the way\" before Christmas to 1.45 million U.S. military members. Trump signaled the money would come from higher-than-expected federal revenue, particularly tariffs — and a quick a calculation means an overall payout of $2.58 million.\n\n\"Nobody deserves it more than our military,\" Trump said from the White House, promising the Christmas bonuses. The paycheck amount of $1,776 is a nod to the nation's founding in 1776, he noted.\n\nIs the 'Warrior Dividend' real? Is there a Trump military bonus?\n\nYes, President Donald Trump's \"Warrior Dividend\" bonus checks are real. Trump is sending $1,776 bonus checks to U.S. service members in honor of the nation's founding in 1776, he announced during a broadcast last night, Dec. 17, from the White House.\n\nHowever, the following has to occur to military members to get their bonus checks: Payment execution from the Department of Defense, a clear identification of funding authority, and official guidance from the military's finance agency, DFAS.\n\nWho qualifies for 'Warrior Dividend'?\n\nEvery active-duty service member of the U.S. military (Army, Marines, Navy, Coast Guard, Space Force) is eligible to get Trump's \"Warrior Dividend\" check, from the lowest entry-level rank of private (E-1) to O-6, the rank of colonel (or Navy captain equivalent). But final eligibility rules have not yet been released by the Department of Defense.\n\nAre National Guard, reservists getting the 'Warrior Dividend'?\n\nIt remains unclear if National Guard and Reserve members get the \"Warrior Dividend\" check. Trump broadly identified \"every soldier\" when announcing the military bonus check; however, the Department of Defense has yet to publish guidance on eligibility requirements.\n\nHistorically, Guard and reservists have been included only if they meet certain active-duty criteria, per Military.com, such as activation and Title 10 requirements, minimum days served, and specific qualifying windows.\n\nWhen is Trump sending checks?\n\nTrump said checks were \"already on the way,\" meaning the \"Warrior Dividend\" bonuses would arrive before Christmas. Bonus payments should process Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), the agency that handles military pay, according to Military.com. However, despite Trump's claim checks were on the way, as of Dec. 18, there's been no DFAS guidance or timeline of when service members will get the bonus payments.\n\nHow many military members in the U.S.?\n\nIn the U.S., there are about 2.06 million military service members in the U.S., including active-duty and those in the Reserves and National Guard.\n\nThere are about 1.33 million full-time military members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and Space Force, plus about 739,000 National Guard and Reserve members, the latter of whom are typically part-time in civilian careers, although can be deployed to federal active duty.\n\nHow many military members in NJ?\n\nIn New Jersey, there are around 7,851 active-duty members across the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, and Space Force, plus 16,665 in the Reserves and National Guard, according to World Population Review data from 2025. Overall, NJ ranks 26th of the 51 states in the number of active-duty personnel.\n\nLori Comstock is a New Jersey-based journalist with the Mid-Atlantic Connect Team.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/18/trumps-1776-warrior-dividends-pentagon-tariffs/87833418007/", "title": "Trump's $1,776 'Warrior Dividends' covered by housing aid, not tariffs", "text": "Dec. 18, 2025 Updated Dec. 19, 2025, 9:45 a.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON ‒ When President Donald Trump announced in his primetime White House address that all military members would receive $1,776 bonuses, he suggested revenue from tariffs would be paying for it.\n\nBut a Pentagon official confirmed that Defense Department funding is covering the $2.6 billion price tag for the so-called \"Warrior Dividends\" ‒ not revenue from the president's steep tariffs on imports.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon to pay for the bonuses from $2.9 billion in military housing funds that Congress appropriated in Trump's sprawling \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law, according to the official, which was approved last summer.\n\n\"We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the bill helped us along,\" Trump said in his 19-minute address to the nation on Dec. 17. \"Nobody deserves it more than our military.\"\n\nThe funds covering the \"Warrior Dividends\" were originally intended to boost the Basic Allowance for Housing, which helps service members pay for off-base housing costs. The remaining $300 million left from the housing program will support future Basis Allowance for Housing requirements, the Pentagon said.\n\nTrump said the $1,776 checks ‒ a value selected to match the founding of the United States in 1776 ‒ will go to each of the nation's 1.45 million service members before Christmas.

Such a proposal would likely need Congressional approval, according to The Hill. Trump and his administration have also previously signaled that their priority is to use tariff revenue to tackle the national debt.\n\nWhen will a tariff dividend be paid?\n\nThe president didn't provide details about how these checks would be sent out or when. It's unclear if these checks are even a possibility, given that such a proposal would likely require Congressional approval.\n\nWhat happened with tariff rebate checks?\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has floated the idea of giving taxpayers' money accrued from tariffs. In July, Trump answered a reporter's question about the \"possibility of a rebate to the American public.”\n\n\"We're thinking about that actually,\" he said before adding, \"we have so much money coming in, we're thinking about a little rebate. But the big thing we want to do is pay down debt. But we're thinking about a rebate.\"\n\nMissouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley then proposed the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025 in late July.

Unemployment across the country hit a four-year high, according to the latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many Americans remain on edge that the president’s high tariffs will drive up prices.\n\nTrump’s bonus for servicemembers is the latest of several steps the president has taken to offer support for U.S. troops. Among them, the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), passed by Congress and sent to President Trump's desk in December 2025, includes a 4% pay raise for service members. The law also includes $2.9 billion to fund new barracks and family housing, as well as to increase investment in childcare fee assistance.\n\nThe president also previously signed the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act into law, which creates a partial claim program to help veterans who have fallen behind on their mortgages avoid foreclosure.\n\nTrump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" additionally provides broad benefits for service members and their families, including $100 million in Department of Defense Impact Aid to support public schools serving large numbers of military children.\n\nIn both his presidential terms, Trump has drawn favorability from the military and their families. A 2019 Pew Research Center report found that U.S. military veterans were largely supportive of the way Trump led the nation’s armed forces.\n\nPew's survey of veterans found that a majority (57%) approved of the way Trump handled his duties as commander in chief, with about half (48%) saying his administration’s policies made the military stronger. Veterans’ assessments of the president on these and other military-related issues are more positive than those of the general public, Pew found.\n\nIn his latest run for office, most veterans voted for Trump. About six-in-ten registered voters who said they served in the U.S. military or military reserves (61%) supported former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. About 37% backed Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in September 2024.\n\nNot all of the Trump administration's financial moves have benefited the military. At a series of town halls in March, veterans angrily confronted Republican members of Congress as they defended the cuts made under Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTrump has made broad use of the military during his second term, deploying armed forces off the coast of Venezuela and to American cities. The moves have prompted some servicemembers to call on others to resist \"illegal orders.\"\n\nContributing: Michael Loria, USA TODAY.

Trump said that he “inherited a mess,” and that under the Biden administration, life became “unaffordable for millions and millions of Americans.\"\n\n\"This happened during a Democrat administration, and it's when we first began hearing the word affordability,\" Trump said in comments from the White House Diplomatic Room, which was adorned with Christmas decorations.\n\nTrump's comments come as the economy is showing signs of weakening, with unemployment climbing to 4.6% in November, the highest level since September 2021. The president's approval rating has simultaneously dipped, with just 36% of Americans approving of his economic stewardship, according to a December NPR/Marist poll.\n\nThe first year of Trump’s second term is coming to a close with challenges looming for the president both at home and abroad, but he largely steered clear of foreign policy in the remarks as domestic concerns increasingly take center stage ahead of the 2026 midterm contest that will decide control of Congress. Trump also didn't mention shocking acts of violence that have riveted the nation in recent days.\n\nLooking ahead, Trump said there are reasons to be optimistic, saying tax cuts he passed and other policies would spur economic growth. He also announced a Christmas payment to military members and promised other actions next year, including \"some of the most aggressive housing reform plans in American history.\"\n\nHere are takeaways from his remarks.\n\nBlaming Biden for the border, economy\n\nTrump’s highly political speech quickly turned into a greatest hits of his favorite attacks as he blamed Biden and Democrats for leaving him a disaster on the economy, the border and more.\n\n“Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I’m fixing it,\" Trump said in his opening line, in a theme he returned to repeatedly.\n\nThe address came as Trump's job approval rating has been waning ‒ with NBC News reporting a 42% approval rating in a poll released Dec. 14 ‒ as the president struggles to turn around Americans' gloomy outlook on the economy and the cost of living.\n\nDemocrats have put Trump on defense as they blame the president's policies for worsening an \"affordability crisis.\" Trump’s response? Blame Biden, whom he mentioned seven times in the speech and Democrats who he mentioned eight times.\n\nHistory suggests the blame-the-previous-guy strategy rarely works, however, and it will become harder to execute the longer Trump is in the White House.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, painted a dark picture of the America he inherited, saying “drug dealers, gang members and murderers” were pouring across the border. He said the United States had “men playing in women’s sports,” falsely claimed crime was at “record highs” and declared the country had “the worst trade deals ever made.”\n\n“Our country was laughed at from all over the world, but they’re not laughing anymore,” Trump said. “Over the past 11 months, we have brought more positive change to Washington than any administration in American history. There’s never been anything like it.”\n\n'Warrior dividends' from tariff revenue\n\nTrump said every military member will receive a bonus of $1,776 for Christmas from money collected from tariff revenue.\n\n\"The checks already are on the way,\" the president said, referring to the bonuses as \"warrior dividends\" for the nation's 1.45 million service members.\n\nIt was one of the few policy announcements in Trump's speech. He also teased major changes to housing policy in the next year. He blamed rising housing costs on immigrants without legal status and said his deportation efforts will help bring costs down.\n\nTrump's plans for military bonuses come as the Supreme Court will soon decide the fate of his use of emergency powers to impose the tariffs. If the nation's high court rules against the president, it would seemingly jeopardize the military bonuses.\n\nWhether Trump even has the power to write the checks isn't entirely clear. Congress holds the purse power when it comes to spending public dollars.\n\n'Not done yet,' Trump says of lowering prices\n\nTrump touted prices that have decreased from the post-pandemic high during the Biden administration, yet he still acknowledged there's more work ahead.\n\n\"It's not done yet, but boy, are we making progress,\" Trump said. \"Nobody can believe what's going on.\"\n\nDemocrats have used affordability as their underlying campaign message en route to overperforming in off-year elections across the country. Democrats are set to double down on affordability in the 2026 midterms, when they hope to regain control of the House and Senate during Trump's final two years in the White House.\n\nIn remarks leading up to his address, Trump has mocked \"affordability\" as a campaign issue manufactured by Democrats. But he took a different route in his speech, instead emphasizing policies aimed at driving down drug, housing and energy prices and touted his administration’s tariffs, even as economists say they could contribute to rising prices.\n\nNo mention of Venezuela, shootings\n\nTrump's focus on the economy illustrates the biggest political liability for his administration right now, one that has increasingly consumed his attention even as other high-profile issues dominate headlines.\n\nTrump’s monthslong campaign to push Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro out of power is reaching an inflection point amid a series of aggressive maneuvers, including seizing an oil tanker, announcing a blockade on other sanctioned tankers, a large military buildup and deadly strikes on suspected drug boats.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said in a Vanity Fair interview that Trump intends to pressure Maduro until he “cries uncle.” But Trump didn't mention the military campaign or the other big foreign policy issue facing his administration: the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe president also didn't discuss the high-profile acts of violence that have gripped the nation in recent days, including a mass shooting at Brown University and the death of acclaimed Hollywood director Rob Reiner.\n\nTrump plows through his speech\n\nTrump is accustomed to giving long, meandering rally-style speeches that go off script and touch on a wide range of topics – whatever comes to Trump’s mind.\n\nBut as he stuck to the teleprompter for Wednesday night's address, Trump seemed to barely catch his breath.\n\nTrump recited his speech with furious speed, sometimes making it difficult to tell when he was jumping from one topic and moving to the next.\n\nIt was a different-sounding Trump before a prime-time audience than Trump at his campaign rallies.\n\nWhether he convinced skeptical Americans that he’s moving the country in the right direction is debatable.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/12/19/what-is-1776-warrior-dividend-military-bonus-payment-when-is-trump-2000-tariff-stimulus-check-2025/87790412007/", "title": "What is Trump's warrior dividend, who gets $1776 payment, when?", "text": "Dec. 19, 2025, 1:58 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced that a \"warrior dividend\" payment of $1776 is on the way for 1.45 million service members, to be received \"before Christmas.\" Here's who, when and what to know about Trump's military bonus, tariff rebates other stimulus check 2025 proposals for Americans.\n\nDuring Trump's address to the nation on Wednesday night, the president said \"Military service members will receive a special ... 'warrior dividend' before Christmas, a warrior dividend in honor of our nation's founding in 1776.\" Adding \"The checks are already on the way … Nobody deserves it more than our military.\"\n\nTrump signaled that these warrior dividends would be coming from tariff revenue, \"We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs.\" However, the $1,776 payments are coming from a congressionally-approved housing supplement that was part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed back in July, according to officials.\n\nIn addition to the $1,776 announced this week, the U.S. Coast Guard said the Department of Homeland Security is giving members of the Coast Guard another bonus, called the \"Devotion to Duty\" payment, “in acknowledgement of the tremendous dedication, bravery, and innovation demonstrated by service members throughout a landmark year of transformation for the armed service.”\n\nThe $2,000 Devotion to Duty payments were announced by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem shortly after Trump's warrior dividend announcement, \"The men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard have demonstrated unparalleled heroism this year as the service transforms to meet the demands of the 21st Century and Make America Safe Again.\"\n\nAdding \"under President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. Coast Guard has been defending our maritime borders, stopping the flow of deadly narcotics and illegal immigration into our country, and countering America's adversaries in the Western Hemisphere and around the world — and they’ve been shattering records in the process. I am so proud of what our Coast Guard has achieved this year. We want to show our country’s profound appreciation for their devotion to duty and the countless sacrifices they make to protect our nation.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the warrior dividends, devotion to duty payments, tariff dividend rebates, and other Trump stimulus check 2025 proposals.\n\nWhat is the $1776 warrior dividend? When will it arrive?\n\nThe warrior dividend is a one-time pay stipend of $1,776 that will be sent to 1.28 million active-duty and 174,000 reserve component military members, according to the Department of War, formerly known as the Department of Defense. \"It is a nontaxable supplement to their regular monthly housing allowance,\" funded by the One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July.\n\nThe dividend bonus amount of $1,776 is an ode to the year the United States became an independent nation and the \"250 years the U.S. military has been defending the nation, according to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth.\n\nIn Wednesday's speech, Trump announced that the warrior dividend \"checks are already on the way\" to be received before Christmas and according to the U.S. Department of War website, \"service members can expect to see the payment before Dec. 20.\"\n\nVeterans are not slated to receive this warrior dividend payment.\n\nWhat is the $2000 Devotion to Duty payment? Who gets it?\n\nThe “Devotion to Duty” payment is a one-time $2000 taxable payment sent to active duty Coast Guard members in paygrades O-6 and below who are on active duty through December 31, 2025 and reserve service members on active duty for 31 or more consecutive days as of Dec. 31, 2025, according to the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard. Cadets are not eligible and service members not entitled to basic pay are also not eligible.\n\nAccording to reports, the one-time payments are all being distributed before Christmas, with some payments already distributed as of Dec. 18.\n\nWhat is $2000 tariff dividend rebate? Trump stimulus check 2025\n\nIn early November, Trump floated the idea of a $2000 dividend rebate check for middle to lower income Americans, generated from tariff revenue and to be issued some time in mid- 2026, before the midterms. While the president has made continued promises about this tariff dividend idea, there has been no formal proposal or details.\n\nTrump previously floated a similar idea of sending tariff rebate checks to Americans back in July, after which Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill called the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025, that would send checks between $600 to $2,400 to American taxpayer families. However, it has not passed through Congress as of yet.\n\nIn February, Trump also said he would consider the plan to pay out $5,000 stimulus checks to taxpayers in the form of a “DOGE dividend” during a summit in Miami. He explained it as using part of the 20% of the savings identified by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and giving it back to taxpayers. However, he has not shared any further specifics or details about the possible “DOGE dividend” or its certainty since then.\n\nThere were three prior stimulus checks tied to COVID-era stimulus programs, the third and last of which had an April 15, 2025 deadline to claim. The opportunities to claim or file for the first stimulus payment (issued in March and April 2020) or the second stimulus check (issued by Jan. 15, 2021) or the third stimulus check (issued between March and December 2021) have now passed.\n\nUnsupported speculation has spread online about a fourth or new stimulus check or direct deposit relief payment in varying amounts of $1,390 or $1,702 or $2,000 coming to Americans this year, according to reports. There has been no official confirmation from Congress or the Internal Revenue Service to support these claims, and any such news should be taken with caution as it could be misinformation or attempted fraud.\n\nThe IRS issued warnings against text scams and impersonators that may mislead you about tax refunds, credits, payments, or new stimulus check amounts by pressuring people for personal and financial information about themselves.\n\nMaria Francis is a Pennsylvania-based journalist with the Mid-Atlantic Connect Team.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/19"}]}

With a brass band playing on the wharf, the Carnival Sensation docked at the Mobile Cruise Terminal, where staff members from USA Health planned to go on board to provide first doses for 110 crew members. The ship will return in three weeks for second doses, the city said in a statement. U.S. ports are closed to cruise lines because of the global pandemic, but Mayor Sandy Stimpson said such vaccinations are a major step toward getting the industry back in business. Carnival said crew members have received vaccines at other ports including Miami and Port Canaveral in Florida and Galveston, Texas. Sensation will be based in Mobile offering trips to the western Caribbean once cruises resume, but it’s unclear when that will happen.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Legislative leaders voted Friday to make mask-wearing optional at the state Capitol and then shed their own face coverings after the vote. The decision by the Legislative Council followed new guidelines the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The council is composed of House and Senate leaders. Under the new policy, masks are optional in legislative facilities, with some exceptions. For example, lawmakers can require masks in their respective offices. “Sen. Reinbold, you can remove your mask now,” Senate President Peter Micciche said to the council vice-chair after the vote, with people in the meeting room laughing and clapping. Sen. Lora Reinbold has been an outspoken critic of mask rules. Other council members also peeled off their masks. Rules were changed last month to ease coronavirus testing requirements for legislators, staff and others allowed in the Capitol, requiring once-a-week tests for those unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated and exempting those who are fully vaccinated from testing, with some exceptions. Testing earlier this session was more frequent. The policy adopted Friday recommends weekly testing for those who aren’t vaccinated and for those with COVID-19 symptoms or who return to Juneau after travel.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Pima County Board of Supervisors rescinded its mandatory face mask policy in most public settings Friday for people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, a day after federal health officials issued similar guidance. The board voted 4-1 to change the mandate to a recommendation for people who are not fully vaccinated and in settings like public transportation and schools for everyone. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero announced she would ask the City Council to vote on a similar action this week, although she expressed reservations because it is impossible to tell who is vaccinated. She also took a shot at Gov. Doug Ducey, who withdrew cities and counties’ ability to issue the mandates in March. “It is because we masked up and followed the advice of our public health experts that we are in a position where cases are low and we can take additional steps to fully return back to normal,” Romero said in a statement. “Unlike our state leaders, here in Tucson we have listened to our public health experts and followed the science since the beginning of this pandemic.” Meanwhile, Arizona’s daily new COVID-19 case count continued a weeklong upward trend Friday with 854 known new cases and nine additional deaths. Another 474 cases and 12 deaths were added to the tally Saturday.\n\nArkansas\n\nNorth Little Rock: The Arkansas National Guard has ended its work at a warehouse in North Little Rock where it helped distribute personal protective equipment amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Arkansas Division of Emergency Management requested closure of the warehouse operations mission because PPE has become more commercially available and the workload more manageable for warehouse staff, according to a Friday news release from the Guard. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports state officials said emergency management staff will send PPE to health care providers as needed. Four to six National Guard members have assisted in PPE distribution at the warehouse since April 2020, and the four who were on site returned to their unit Friday. More than 30 other members of the Guard continue to assist the state with COVID-19 vaccine distribution, management and administrative support.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The governor said Friday that his office is weighing issues of enforcement and workplace safety in considering whether and when to adopt the latest federal guidelines around masking. Gov. Gavin Newsom said his office has been talking with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health officers and other states since the CDC’s announcement Thursday saying fully vaccinated people may skip face coverings and social distancing in most situations. The agency’s guidelines still call for people to wear masks in crowded indoor settings, such as buses, planes, hospitals and prisons, and say residents should follow local rules. But Newsom said he doesn’t know what the federal guidelines would look like in schools, where younger children are not yet able to get vaccinated, and what happens if businesses want to require masks. “There’s a whole host of complexities that we all have to work through,” the Democratic governor said when asked of the guidelines at a budget briefing. He said some governors are quick to “default to the CDC guidelines but now are starting to appreciate some of the nuances and complexities around enforcement or lack thereof.” The state is on track to fully reopen its economy next month, signaling an end to most pandemic restrictions.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A former aide to U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn alleges in a lawsuit that the Republican congressman disregarded coronavirus safety protocols in his Washington office even after he and staff members were infected, let one of his sons live in the basement of the U.S. Capitol and ordered staff to run personal errands for his family. The lawsuit, filed by Brandon Pope in federal court Thursday, contends Pope was fired after raising concerns about safety conditions in the workplace, The Denver Post reports. Lamborn spokeswoman Cassandra Sebastian issued a statement strongly denying Pope’s allegations and said the congressman “looks forward to full vindication as all facts come to light.” On Friday, the eight-term representative from Colorado Springs told Colorado Public Radio the lawsuit consists of a “tissue of lies,” and he allowed his son to stay at the Capitol as his guest because of the tight housing market in Washington. According to the lawsuit, Lamborn repeatedly claimed the coronavirus was a “hoax” and needlessly exposed his congressional staff by keeping his office open and not allowing them to socially distance. Lamborn tested positive for the virus in November, and the lawsuit claims he did not alter course afterward.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Yale University is requiring its faculty and staff to get COVID-19 vaccinations before the fall term, extending a requirement already imposed for students. The private university announced the new requirement Friday, saying faculty members, staffers and academic trainees must be fully inoculated by Aug. 1, though there are provisions for exemptions based on medical conditions and religious or “strongly held” personal beliefs. Many Yale staffers are in unions. The university said it was discussing the implementation of the policy with them. “As a leading global research university, we have a responsibility to demonstrate to others the importance of taking actions based on evidence,” and there’s plenty of it showing the vaccines are safe and effective at preventing the virus’s spread, Yale President Peter Salovey and Provost Scott Strobel wrote in a letter to the Yale community. The Ivy League school announced last month that students must get vaccinated by the start of the fall semester, when Yale plans a full return to on-campus life and teaching. More than 350 colleges and universities around the country are requiring vaccinations for students, at least those living on campus, but mandates for employees are rarer, according to information compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Democratic Gov. John Carney said Friday that he will lift the state’s mask-wearing mandate effective May 21 after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said those who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 do not need to wear masks or practice social distancing. “It’s clear that the COVID-19 vaccines are extremely safe and protective against infection and serious illness,” Carney said in a statement. “Delawareans who are fully vaccinated have significant protection against this virus and can feel comfortable getting back to the things they loved to do before this pandemic. ... In the meantime, Delawareans who are unvaccinated, including children, should continue to wear masks in public places.” The lifting of the mask mandate next Friday coincides with the easing of other COVID-19 restrictions that Carney formalized in an order he signed Wednesday. That order eliminated most business capacity restrictions and lifted a distancing requirement on school buses, while still requiring masks indoors. Wednesday’s order also narrowed social distancing requirements from 6 feet to 3 feet. Administration officials said they would have more details on the state’s social distancing requirements this week.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city hosted its first playoff game since the pandemic began Saturday, and Capital One Arena was able to welcome back 5,000 ice hockey fans as it moved to 25% capacity, WUSA-TV reports. Capitals fans were lined up Saturday evening waiting for the doors to open. “This is my happy place, and you know, it’s been a long time without a happy place,” Melinda Gipson said. “I’m just happy to be in the building, I really am.” Stephanie and PJ Atkinson were also waiting for the doors to open. Saturday marked their third Capitals game of the season – but the first with 5,000 fans in the stands. “I think it’s going to make a big difference,” Atkinson said, because “2,100 (fans) kind of felt like a preseason game. I think the 5,000 with most of the arena open, it’s going to make a difference tonight.” The increased capacity limit also made a difference for businesses surrounding the arena. Bar Deco is newly reopened after closing for more than a year during the pandemic. “We just opened back up about two weeks ago,” said Chelsea Sexton, director of hospitality at Bar Deco. “We’re feeling really great about the restrictions being lessened, and every time we get good news like that, we’re just super excited. The good news is coming a lot faster than we expected it, so we couldn’t be happier.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state’s major theme parks are adjusting their face mask policies after the federal government loosened its recommendations amid rising COVID-19 vaccinations. Visitors to Walt Disney World and Universal Studios-Orlando were allowed Saturday to remove their masks outdoors except when they are on attractions, in line, or riding a tram or other transportation. Masks remain mandatory indoors except in restaurants when seated. Disney requires they be worn except when actively eating and drinking. SeaWorld Orlando and its sister park, Tampa’s Busch Gardens, are going even further, allowing guests who say they are fully vaccinated to remove their masks throughout the parks. They will not require proof of vaccination but are asking guests to “respectfully comply.” Disney CEO Bob Chapek also said Thursday that the company’s parks have started raising the number of people allowed in based on relaxed restrictions from Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office. He didn’t say how many more people were being permitted compared to the previous restriction of a little more than a third of a park’s capacity.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s 26 public universities and colleges do not currently plan to require students, faculty or staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the fall, according to guidance issued Thursday by the University System of Georgia. The 340,000-student university system in March asked all campuses “to plan for resuming normal operations for the Fall 2021 semester.” Thursday’s guidance further elaborates on that theme, saying fully vaccinated people won’t have to socially distance or wear masks, while unvaccinated people “are strongly encouraged to continue” socially distancing and wearing a mask inside. The universities are supposed to make sure vaccinations are available on campus or through a local partnership, but schools won’t be “responsible for assessing current COVID-19 vaccination rates for their institution.” The university system said that it had made the decisions in concert with the state Department of Public Health and that they were subject to change. The Board of Regents insisted on at least some in-person instruction in the fall and spring semesters, even awarding small amounts of money to institutions based on the number of in-person classes. Those moves came despite resistance from some employees. Some faculty members have called for mandatory vaccination.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Despite having among the lowest coronavirus infection and mortality rates in the nation, Hawaii will keep its statewide mask mandate in place for now. Even as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced vaccinated people can now ditch masks and social distancing in most situations, Gov. David Ige said Thursday that he’s not ready to loosen rules on the islands. “We are unable to determine who is vaccinated and who is not vaccinated,” he said. “The best mitigation measure is for everyone to wear a mask.” Ige said he would review the CDC guidance and plans to incorporate vaccination rates into future restriction guidelines, but for now people in Hawaii must keep their masks on. “The state mask mandate continues to be in force,” he said. “The CDC is not able to help us identify who is vaccinated and who is not, and that detail is left to the state and counties.” Ige said he hopes to get more adults and children vaccinated and for the state to be closer to herd immunity before making major changes. About 40% of Hawaii’s residents are fully vaccinated. The state has among the highest vaccination rates in the U.S. Ige is facing opposition from some officials, including Lt. Gov. Josh Green, who said he believes the mask mandate should be lifted for fully vaccinated people.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The city has lifted its mask requirement, but officials say they’ll still work with businesses that choose to require masks on private property. Mayor Lauren McLean made the announcement Friday, one day after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can safely go without masks in many situations. Boise will also stop restricting crowd sizes, McLean said, though residents and organizations are encouraged to continue to take appropriate health precautions. “It is incredible to know that getting a free, readily available vaccine is all that stands between most Boise residents and a post-COVID world,” McLean said. “I can’t wait to see smiling faces. We’ve all worked so hard to get here, and I’m thrilled to celebrate this summer with all of you.” Not all city facilities will make the change right away. “We care deeply about the health and safety of our employees and residents,” city spokesman Seth Ogilvie wrote in a statement. “We will evaluate our current protocols and announce any changes soon.” The Boise School District announced Thursday that masks would still be required on school campuses while administrators review recommendations from local health professionals and any school-specific guidance from the CDC.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker plans to relax his statewide mask mandate after federal health officials said Thursday that mask-wearing is not necessary in most places for people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. An announcement Friday from the Illinois Department of Public Health didn’t say when or how the governor’s executive orders would be changed after new guidance issued Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Springfield officials said they would stop enforcing the city’s mask mandate in light of the CDC and state’s position. The state health department, an agency controlled by the Democratic governor, said in a statement: “The governor believes firmly in following the science and will be delighted to revise his executive orders in line with the CDC guidance lifting additional mitigations for vaccinated people. The scientists’ message is clear: If you are vaccinated, you can safely do much more.” A statement from Springfield city officials included a recommendation to continue wearing masks in certain public situations. “Right now, with businesses serving the public, there is no way for them to know who has received their vaccination and who has not,” the statement said. “This makes it difficult to keep businesses and their employees safe while serving the public..”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Two counties are lifting their local mask mandates after federal health officials eased mask-wearing guidance for those fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The health departments for the counties that include South Bend and Bloomington are rescinding those local orders, while Indianapolis officials are keeping the city’s mask mandate in place. St. Joseph County Health Officer Dr. Robert M. Einterz cited the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks outdoors in crowds and in most indoor settings. But he said he remained concerned about many unvaccinated people remaining vulnerable to coronavirus infection. The CDC reports Indiana has the country’s 12th-lowest rate for uptake of COVID-19 shots, with about 31% of all people fully vaccinated. The St. Joseph County order covering South Bend was rescinded as of Thursday night, while the Monroe County order including Bloomington will end Monday morning. Marion County health department director Dr. Virginia Caine said the agency would review the CDC guidance and Indianapolis vaccination rates before recommending any changes to current restrictions. Caine said work continues on getting more people immunized.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s count of deaths from COVID-19 reached 6,000 on Saturday. “I hope this is evidence enough to whoever may continue having doubts that this pandemic was real,” said Dr. Jorge Salinas, the lead epidemiologist at the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics. “It has impacted the lives of Americans and the lives of humans on Earth tremendously. Six thousand deaths is very tragic, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg.” Salinas pointed to the far higher number of people who’ve been hospitalized with the disease and had to be put on ventilators, among other effects. There have been enough positive coronavirus tests in Iowa – more than 398,000 – for nearly 1 in every 8 Iowans. People sick with COVID-19 have spent a collective 158,975 days in Iowa hospitals, and the health care system was nearly overwhelmed in the fall. Older people faced the most dire outcomes from COVID-19. People 80 or older accounted for 58% of the deaths. The disease killed 2,335 Iowans who resided in nursing homes, nearly 40% of the total death toll, despite nursing home residents making up less than 1% of the state’s total population. Nursing home residents and staff were also among the first groups of Iowans eligible to receive the vaccine. Outbreaks at nursing homes have since nearly disappeared.\n\nKansas\n\nLiberty: The last two counties in the state that require residents to wear masks to slow the spread of COVID-19 will keep the mandates in place for now to discuss new federal guidelines that loosened mask requirements. Health officials in Douglas and Wyandotte counties are reviewing guidelines announced Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said people who are fully vaccinated do not have to wear masks outdoors and in most indoor settings. Gov. Laura Kelly said the state would immediately begin following those guidelines. Dr. Thomas Marcellino, Douglas County health officer, said in a statement that health officials will discuss the new guidelines with county leaders during the county commission meeting Wednesday. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, said Mayor David Alvey will convene the county commission Thursday to discuss possible changes to the county’s mask mandate, which requires masks indoors unless everyone is vaccinated. County spokeswoman Janelle Friesen said health officials continue to recommend that county government maintain the existing health order, noting that 7 out of 10 Wyandotte County residents have not received a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s coronavirus-related capacity restrictions and mask mandate will largely end June 11, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Friday. Masks will still be required on public transportation, in schools, in long-term care facilities and in other locations that serve the “most vulnerable,” Beshear said during a virtual press briefing. “Just one month from today, life will be almost fully back to normal,” the Democratic governor said. “One month gives our 12- to 15-year-olds the necessary time to get vaccinated … one month also gives notice and time to everyone else who has not received their shot of hope.” More than 1.9 million Kentuckians and roughly 53% of adult residents have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Kentucky opened up vaccinations to residents ages 12 to 15 on Thursday. “If you want to take the mask off and be safe, get vaccinated,” Beshear said. “If you are unwilling to get vaccinated, you really need to wear the mask to protect yourself from what is a pretty lethal virus.” The state’s coronavirus test positivity rate is about 3.04%. The positivity rate is an indicator of the extent of the spread of the virus, according to the World Health Organization. If the rate is less than 5% for two weeks, and testing is widespread, the virus is considered under control.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: People who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can go mask-free in most of the city, Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced Friday. And they can celebrate by dancing. The latest easing of restrictions in the city that was once a Southern hot spot for the disease caused by the coronavirus follows last week’s easing of masking recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control. Cantrell said there are some exceptions. Masks will still be required in city government buildings, hospitals and K-12 schools, as well as on public transportation. And she repeatedly urged people to get vaccinated. “We’re not out of the woods. The virus is still amongst us,” she said, stressing that the city is committed to getting all residents vaccinated. City health director Jennifer Avegno said more than half of residents who are eligible have received a full vaccination series. But she stressed that the numbers still need to improve and that people aren’t considered fully vaccinated until two weeks after they have completed their shots. Avegno also happily announced the easing of another restriction in a city that has slowly begun returning to opening bars and allowing live music: A ban on dancing at public venues was ending for people who are vaccinated. “We are no longer the town from ‘Footloose,’ ” she said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials said Friday that the state will align with the latest guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and allow vaccinated people to stop wearing masks indoors. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said the new rules will take effect May 24, the day the state is slated to remove all capacity limits for public indoor venues. Mills said Maine will also lift physical distancing requirements at indoor public settings, including those where people will be eating or drinking. State officials are also echoing the CDC’s recommendations that people who are not yet fully vaccinated wear face coverings in indoor settings. Legislative leaders, meanwhile, said new COVID-19 guidelines for indoor gatherings could open the door to lawmakers to return to session in the State House. Maine Senate President Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, D-Biddeford, issued a joint statement Thursday saying they would explore plans to reopen the building. “Maine people have put in the work, and they’re the reason we are on the edge of normalcy,” they said. Because of the pandemic, lawmakers have conducted committee meetings remotely and have met a handful of times in person at the Augusta Civic Center since the session formally convened in December.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A statewide mask mandate ended Saturday, with Gov. Larry Hogan saying the move followed guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. “Today is the day that so many of us have been waiting for and working toward,” the Republican governor said at a news conference Friday. “We finally do clearly see that light at the end of the tunnel. Our long, hard-fought battle against the worst global pandemic in nearly a century is finally nearing an end.” In alignment with CDC guidance, face coverings will still be required on public transportation and in schools, child care and health care settings, Hogan said. The Maryland Department of Health has issued a public health advisory strongly recommending that all unvaccinated people over age 2 continue to wear face coverings in all indoor settings and in outdoor settings where physical distancing cannot be maintained. Private businesses and workplaces can put in place their own policies. The governor made the announcement as the state’s coronavirus-related health metrics continued to improve. Hospitalizations from COVID-19 dropped below 700 for the first time since November, down to 680. “And today, we have reached 1.91% – our second lowest daily positivity rate ever throughout the entire pandemic,” Hogan said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: As more people are vaccinated, the number of cities and towns considered at high risk for coronavirus transmission has shrunk to just six, the fifth consecutive week the number has fallen, according to state health officials. There were 13 communities on the list a week ago and 26 the previous week. The number peaked at 229 in mid-January. The communities that remain at high risk, according to state Department of Public Health data released Thursday, are Edgartown, New Bedford, Acushnet, Taunton, Lowell and Lawrence. Brockton dropped to moderate risk after spending much of the pandemic in the high-risk zone. “The city has been devastated by COVID but it now appears that we are starting to head in the right direction,” Mayor Robert F. Sullivan said in a statement. “I strongly encourage all residents to get vaccinated and to continue to follow the guidance of public health officials in order to return to normal as safely and quickly as possible.” Nearly 2.8 million Massachusetts residents had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Thursday, according to the public health department.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: People who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 don’t need to wear a mask any longer, and those who aren’t vaccinated don’t have to wear one outdoors, officials said Friday, also declaring that the state’s indoor mask requirement will expire in July. The announcement from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the state health department came a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased mask-wearing guidance for fully vaccinated people. People don’t have to wear a mask outdoors, including in contact sports, regardless of whether they’re vaccinated. While indoors, the fully vaccinated can go without a face covering, but the unvaccinated still must wear one, at least until the state’s mandate ends after July 1. Businesses – including stores – governments, schools and events must make a “good faith effort” to ensure unvaccinated employees and patrons are masked. It wasn’t clear what sort of requirements could remain after the statewide mandate expires, which is nearly seven weeks away and thus will allow time for more vaccinations. More than 55% of Michigananders ages 16 and older have received at least one dose. The state still has the country’s highest two-week coronavirus infection rate, but it has dropped significantly recently.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: On the first day Minnesotans could go without a mask in public, Amber Raitz wasn’t about to do so. It’s not that she disagrees with Gov. Tim Walz dropping the state’s mask requirement in public spaces, but Raitz, 48, said Friday that she plans to keep her mask on in public mainly to make people around her less nervous. Raitz has been vaccinated and said she’s not nervous about contracting the coronavirus. “I think from the beginning, people do what’s in the best interest for themselves and for their neighbors,” she said. Walz’s move to end the mask requirement he issued last July came after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxed mask-wearing guidance for fully vaccinated people Thursday. Walz said he discarded the idea of requiring unvaccinated people to wear masks, saying it would be unenforceable. Raitz agreed. But she expected many people to do as she’s planning – continuing to wear masks in public for a while. Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said at a briefing Friday that the federal guidance is “a sign of progress” in state and federal vaccinations, as well as in the effectiveness of the vaccines. She urged unvaccinated people to seek out the vaccine and to wear a mask in the meantime. The relaxing of restrictions is likely to be followed by growing case numbers, she said.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: A federal judge has dismissed a civil lawsuit a fitness gym filed against the city claiming it violated business owners’ rights when it forced nonessential businesses to close to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves issued executive orders in April 2020 that temporarily shut down nonessential businesses, including fitness gyms, spas, salons and barbershops. Aldermen in Starkville approved local ordinances mirroring the state order, The Dispatch reports. In their suit, Starkville Athletic Club managers John and Joe Underwood said the ordinance violated the state and U.S. constitutions. They said forcing businesses to close is equivalent to taking their property for public purposes without just compensation. They also claimed the city’s ban on fitness gyms is “arbitrary” because the Starkville Police Department continued to leave a gym open for its officers during the time private gyms were ordered to be closed. But Senior U.S. District Judge for North Mississippi Glen H. Davidson said the city has the right to enact such policies during a public health crisis. He said the city did not damage or take any of their real property, and lost potential profits from the city not allowing them to pursue their business interest did not constitute “taking.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A legislative session that began amid a surge in coronavirus cases ended Friday with state lawmakers passing a legal shield against pandemic-related liability lawsuits as their final action. The House vote, taken barely five minutes before adjourning, gives Republican Gov. Mike Parson a priority bill that he had been calling on lawmakers to pass for six months. But even if Parson signs it quickly, the legislation won’t take effect until Aug. 28. The legislation would prohibit COVID-19 liability lawsuits against businesses and health care providers unless plaintiffs can prove that they were exposed and sickened by the coronavirus and that the entity engaged in “reckless or willful misconduct.” Religious organizations would be shielded from COVID-19 exposure lawsuits unless “intentional misconduct” can be proven. Manufacturers who changed their normal business operations to make masks or other COVID-19 products would not be subject to liability lawsuits unless plaintiffs can prove by “clear and convincing evidence” that their “reckless or willful misconduct” caused harm or injury. The Republican-led Senate passed the bill in February, but it remained stalled in a House committee for months before the chamber suspended a rule to bring it up for a vote Friday.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state added 89 new coronavirus cases Saturday, bringing total active cases to 1,031. The state has reported 1,598 total deaths related to the virus and 108,015 recoveries over the course of the pandemic. There were 63 active hospitalizations, of 5,154 hospitalizations in total. Cascade County on Saturday reported eight new cases of COVID-19. Cascade had 229 active cases, which was the largest number of active cases of any county in the state. The Cascade City-County Health Department said last week that most of the county’s active cases were among people ages 20-40, a group that also has shown lower vaccination rates. Great Falls Public Schools reported 21 active COVID-19 cases districtwide as of Friday. Cascade County is hosting COVID-19 vaccination clinics May 21 and 22, open to people ages 12 and older. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be offered to those ages 18 and older, and Pfizer will be offered for those ages 12 to 18. The clinic will be open Friday from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Montana ExpoPark. Montana as of Saturday had administered 768,742 total doses of COVID-19 vaccine, with 368,058 Montanans fully immunized.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: The doors of the Crane Trust Nature and Visitor Center finally reopened to the public May 1 after a 14-month hiatus caused by the pandemic. While hundreds of thousands of sandhill cranes made their yearly migratory stopover along the Platte River in March 2020, thousands of visitors – who annually flock to see one of the world’s largest migrations – didn’t, the Grand Island Independent reports. The cranes’ arrival coincided with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. The travel and tourism industry in particular took a hard hit. At the heart of the sandhill crane migration, thousands of people had already booked airplane flights and hotel rooms to witness the crane migration firsthand. The Crane Trust, a hub of the crane-viewing experience, lost its entire crane season when the doors closed March 12, 2020, the Independent reports. Crane Trust offers guided crane-watching tours that are well-booked ahead of the migration. It’s an important source of revenue to accomplish the organization’s mission to improve the habitat of the Platte River. “What had taken us months to prepare for had to be canceled,” said Wendy Bailey, Crane Trust finance and human resources director. “It was a huge disappointment for staff, volunteers and visitors throughout.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The cancellation of Burning Man for the second year is drawing mixed reaction in northern Nevada, where some businesses and tourism officials say they’ll miss the economic boost from festivalgoers, but health officials are glad they won’t contribute to increasing the risk of spreading COVID-19. The counterculture festival in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno typically attracts nearly 80,000 people who spend an estimated $63 million in Nevada. Officials at Reno-Tahoe International Airport are among those who were hoping the event would return at the end of August after last year’s cancellation due to the pandemic. “Let’s face it, our world needs Burning Man right now. If you want to celebrate coming out of a pandemic, Burning Man is perfect,” airport spokesman Brian Kulpin said. “We missed them last year, and we’ll miss them again this year.” Health officials’ concerns were based in part on the fact the event attracts people from all over the world in places with lower vaccination rates and a range of coronavirus variants. “I’m sure it was a difficult decision to cancel Burning Man this year, but I do feel that in terms of safety of the general public and lowering the risk of COVID-19 transmission that the right call was made,” said Kevin Dick, district health officer for Washoe County.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is planning to ease some of its restrictions related to the coronavirus as of June 1. There will still be COVID-19 screening, mask-wearing and 6 feet of distancing when dining with others and taking part in athletic activities and performances, the college’s COVID-19 Task Force said in a statement Thursday. Visitors to indoor spaces must have a Dartmouth faculty or staff sponsor who would complete a registration form for them. Events can have more than 25 attendees in pre-approved locations but should not exceed 100 people indoors or 200 people outdoors without a special exemption. Informal gatherings will continue to be limited to nine or fewer people. Dartmouth’s goal is to have full access to campus Aug. 1. That would require all students to be fully vaccinated. The college has also said it will allow graduating seniors to bring two guests to next month’s commencement, reversing an earlier decision to prohibit guests at the June 13 ceremony at Memorial Stadium, according to the Valley News. Two tickets will be available to each student receiving an undergraduate degree. Those receiving graduate and professional degrees will be allowed two guests at events hosted by their individual schools but not at the larger ceremony.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Masks are still required indoors, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday, but he and the Democrats who control the Legislature said they plan to end the public health emergency granting him vast powers by next month. Murphy’s announcement that the state will retain an indoor mask requirement because of COVID-19 butts up against federal guidance from Thursday saying that vaccinated Americans can ditch masks outdoors and in many indoor situations. The governor has said that fully vaccinated people can forgo masks outside but hasn’t lifted an indoor mandate. The governor said it’s “only a matter of time,” perhaps weeks, before the mask mandate is lifted in New Jersey. “We’re frankly not there yet,” he said during an event in East Orange, alongside actor Whoopi Goldberg, to urge people to get vaccinated. Murphy and Senate President Steve Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin announced in a statement Friday that the public health emergency, which has been in place since March 2020, will end in the middle of June. “It’s the beginning of the end of a crisis that has tragically claimed the lives of an unimaginable number of New Jerseyans and impacted the lives and livelihoods of nearly everyone,” Sweeney said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state has adopted federal guidance on face masks that says fully vaccinated Americans no longer need to wear masks indoors or outside in most cases, under a revised public health order issued Friday. The state Department of Health announced that masks are no longer required in many public settings for people inoculated against COVID-19, though businesses and workplaces may still make face coverings a requirement for all regardless. “Individuals, including those who are fully vaccinated, should continue to wear well-fitted masks where required by localities, tribal entities, and individual businesses,” the agency said. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said it’s important to keep a mask on hand, but he also sounded a celebratory note. “I can’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to seeing the smiles of friends and neighbors across our city again,” he said in a statement. New Mexico is among more than a dozen states to quickly embrace new federal guidelines on masks. Schools will continue to require staff, teachers and students to wear masks at all times except when eating or drinking, the Public Education Department announced. “The mask requirement is unchanged for school settings for now due to the potential spread of COVID-19 among unvaccinated students,” the agency said in a statement.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has yet to say whether he will change the state’s mask or social distancing rules in light of new federal guidance that eases rules for fully vaccinated people. Cuomo said Thursday that his administration was reviewing the new federal guidance and consulting with health officials in neighboring states. New York’s mask mandate dates to April 2020, when the Democratic governor first required all people over the age of 2 to wear a mask when out in public or unable to distance themselves from others. At the time, health officials across the nation urged mask mandates as it became clear that people without symptoms could unknowingly spread COVID-19. Cuomo has since pointed to research showing that crowded indoor settings like dining pose a higher risk of COVID-19 spread. The leader of an industry group advocating for restaurant and bar owners in New York City is calling on Cuomo to lift more restrictions. “It’s more justification to continue eliminating restaurant and nightlife restrictions, so that these businesses which are vital to the city’s social and economic fabric can reopen further, welcome back customers and help the Big Apple recover,” Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Friday immediately ended the state’s capacity limits on businesses and nearly all remaining statewide mask-wearing mandates, returning North Carolina to almost normal operations after 15 months marked by COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions. The Democratic governor of the nation’s ninth-largest state announced the lifting of gathering limit requirements 21/ 2 weeks before June 1 – the date by which he had previously said he wanted to rid the state of social distancing requirements. Restrictions had been scaled back slowly in recent months as statistical trends for the coronavirus in the state stabilized or improved. “This is a big step forward in living our lives the way they were before the pandemic. That’s good,” Cooper said at a news conference. He said he was prompted to act by Thursday’s guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said fully vaccinated people can stop wearing masks indoors and out in most cases. Still, Cooper warned that the coronavirus remains in the state and urged personal responsibility by those who haven’t gotten vaccinated to protect themselves and others. The decision comes just in time for the Carolina Hurricanes to open the Stanley Cup playoffs with more fans Monday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Downtown Fargo was surprisingly busy over the weekend, due in part to an outdoor fundraiser and an indoor spring fling, and masks were in relatively short supply. Andrew Kodet, 20, a North Dakota State University student, and his girlfriend, Kenzie Nylin, 21, a University of North Dakota student, said they will wear masks where required. Otherwise they will go without because of the new Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for those fully vaccinated. “If you’ve been vaccinated, and you’ve put the effort into it to avoid spreading the disease, it’s about time to begin this rebuilding process,” Kodet said. “There is nothing political about it with me.” Nylin said it’s been a long wait to ditch the face coverings but added one caveat since, unlike Kodet, she’s old enough to enter liquor establishments. “The bars are packed, and no one wears masks,” Nylin said. “That was a little bit surprising at first, but as more people get vaccinated, I feel more comfortable.” Not everyone is ditching their masks just yet. Akayla Rondorf, 23, wore a pink cloth mask while walking and said she’s fully vaccinated but still plans to wear a mask indoors. “It’s just for the safety and comfort of the people around me,” she said. “Hopefully everyone gets vaccinated so we don’t have to wear the masks anymore.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state is removing a mask requirement immediately for people who are fully vaccinated, in keeping with new guidance from the federal government, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine announced Friday. DeWine said in a statement that unvaccinated people should continue to wear masks and socially distance, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends. The governor said existing health orders still won’t be fully lifted until June 2, as he had announced Wednesday, but the wording will be updated to match CDC guidelines. The June 2 date was chosen to give ample time to those who need to get vaccinated. Updated CDC guidance released Thursday says unvaccinated people can go without masks for the most part. They should still be worn in health care settings; on public transportation, including airplanes; and when a business or employer requires them. “The most powerful tool we have to protect against the COVID-19 virus is the vaccine,” DeWine said. “Because of the vaccine, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are decreasing dramatically. The vaccine allows us to live our lives more normally and without fear.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: With no local mask requirements and federal guidelines easing their use for vaccinated people, businesses are now considering whether to relax indoor requirements for customers and employees. But many are keeping the mask on. William Ray, a local delivery driver and grocery shopper for Shipt, said mask usage makes him feel more comfortable at work even though he’s vaccinated. “It actually does. It puts you at ease,” Ray said Friday after shopping for a customer at a local grocery store. “It’s part of the way we’re living now. For the better part of a year and a half, I’ve been wearing my mask now anyway.” Restaurants were sent reeling last year when the pandemic began. The decline in new coronavirus cases and emergence of COVID-19 vaccines, along with the new guidance on social distancing and masks, offer a silver lining for many. In recent weeks, the Oklahoma Restaurant Association polled its members about how they would react to lifting of local mask requirements. It found 58% would still require employees to wear masks, but just 13% would still require customers to wear them. Many chain restaurants will be operating as dictated by corporate offices, the ORA said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state health officer said Friday that businesses will be asked to either enforce mask policies or check whether customers have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The comments by Dr. Dean Sidelinger came as he said the state was still working on releasing more detailed guidance for businesses. Late Thursday, Gov. Kate Brown said Oregon would immediately follow direction from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier in the day that eased indoor mask-wearing and social distancing for fully vaccinated people. Brown said Oregonians who have received a full vaccine series no longer need to wear masks or social distance in most public spaces, adding that the state would provide more specific instructions soon. Sidelinger said for now it’s up to businesses to determine a person’s vaccine status. “We would anticipate that an establishment or business will have to have a system in place for asking about vaccines status and verifying that. Right now I would anticipate that would be seeing a card with the individual’s name, the vaccine site and date they got it – it could be a picture of the vaccine card or record from provider on their phone – but just a way of seeing that,” he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Schools, businesses and other organizations in the state may still require masks, even as the Wolf administration loosened its mask mandate to exempt people who are fully vaccinated, the state Department of Health said Friday. Pennsylvania adopted new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but is leaving the ultimate decision to businesses and schools. “If you are fully vaccinated, it is an incentive to be able to remove your mask, but businesses and workplaces may still require this added layer of protection for their employees or customers that may have underlying conditions that continue to make them vulnerable to this virus,” Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam said in a statement. Pennsylvania’s mandate that unvaccinated people continue to wear masks in public will remain in place until 70% of the adult population is vaccinated. The Gerrity’s supermarket chain said it will no longer require customers and employees who are fully vaccinated to wear a face covering. Giant Eagle supermarkets said it would continue to require everyone to mask up. Similarly, Knoebels Amusement Resort said Friday that the fully vaccinated can go maskless outside, but masks will be required indoors. Hersheypark said it won’t require fully vaccinated people to wear them at all.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state will no longer require residents fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to wear masks and socially distance in most public settings starting Tuesday, Gov. Daniel McKee announced Friday. The Democratic governor’s announcement came a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it was easing mask-wearing guidance for the fully vaccinated by allowing them to stop wearing masks outdoors in crowds and in most indoor settings. Masks are still required in some crowded indoor situations, but McKee said easing mask rules will help the economy recover and schools reopen. “We’re resetting Rhode Island and preparing for all the good things to come,” he said at an outdoor news conference. McKee also announced that on May 21, Rhode Island would remove most of its remaining coronavirus limitations on businesses and social gatherings – a week earlier than originally scheduled. That will allow retailers gyms, offices and other businesses to operate with no capacity limitations if they so choose, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: An event for motorcyclists attracted large numbers of bikers from across the United States this year, after the 2020 gathering was diminished by the coronavirus pandemic. Myrtle Beach Bike Week event began May 7 and wrapped up Sunday. The Sun News reports hundreds of bikers were out Friday in Murrells Inlet, listening to music and shopping during the spring Harley-Davidson motorcycle rally. A bar was surrounded by motorcycles with licenses plates from all across the U.S. Michelle Jamison told the newspaper that she got her first motorcycle 12 years ago when she was 42. Now, she rides one decorated with more than 15,000 Swarovski crystals. Jamison said she decided to bedazzle it to let people know it’s a woman’s bike. “Women don’t want to be put on the back (of motorcycles) anymore,” she said. Jamison, who is from Minnesota, is one of many female bikers who attended Myrtle Beach Bike Week. Hannah Guerra, who was out Friday with her mother, Helen Owens, said there seemed to be many more people this year than last year. Guerra and Owens traveled to Myrtle Beach from Rock Hill, South Carolina, to attend their sixth Bike Week.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Many people who were strolling downtown in the state’s most populous city over the weekend said the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance regarding masks is good news. “I think it’s a great idea, get people back to normal,” Wade Wilkie, an Iowa resident, said Saturday. “I think it’s great for businesses. I own a small business myself, and I think it’s wonderful for that.” Dina Lantzer said she was happy to move to Sioux Falls from Minnesota in part because of the strict COVID-19 restrictions in South Dakota’s neighboring state. She called ditching the masks “a fabulous idea,” KELO-TV reports. “I’ve never worn a mask, so I just don’t agree with the mask rules in the first place, which is one of the reasons why we moved to South Dakota,” Lantzer said. For others, after more than a year of the CDC urging that people wear masks, it might take some time to adapt to the new suggestions. “I’m so used to wearing a mask all the time, indoors, outdoors, and I just got fully vaccinated,” said Jeff Larsen, of Sioux Falls. “It’s been three weeks since my second shot, so I’m feeling a bit more safe, and I’m feeling a little more comfortable going outside, and I’ve still got my mask, just in case.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The city lifted its indoor public mask requirement Friday after federal counterparts relaxed guidance on the COVID-19 pandemic to advise that fully vaccinated people can stop wearing masks outdoors in crowds and in most indoor settings. Local health officials made the determination Thursday in a reversal from earlier that day, when they had maintained the indoor mask requirement just after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased mask-wearing guidance for fully vaccinated people. Metro Public Health Department spokesperson Brian Todd said officials further reviewed the new CDC guidelines, then made the change to remove the mask mandate. Nashville’s mask requirement officially was dropped Friday morning, the same day the city’s remaining pandemic capacity limits expired. Nashville’s Metro Public Health Department still strongly recommends that unvaccinated people wear masks when in crowds, indoors and when unable to socially distance. Businesses can still choose to require masks. Republican Gov. Bill Lee last month removed the option for most local governments to mandate masks in public and urged a few big counties with authority to implement their own restrictions, including mask requirements, to remove them by Memorial Day.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Students and employees in the city’s school district will have to keep their masks on while indoors for the rest of the school year, district officials said Friday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took another step toward post-pandemic normalcy Thursday, announcing that Americans fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can now skip masks while indoors regardless of social distancing. But the district is not moving to eliminate its indoor mask requirement and is still evaluating protocols for summer classes and the upcoming school year, said Alexandra Copeland, the district’s health services director. “Since we have no way to verify vaccination statuses and, until this week, most of our students were not yet eligible to be vaccinated, Austin ISD will continue to require masking through the rest of the school year and with graduation ceremonies,” she said in a news release. Copeland said the district would in the meantime continue increasing vaccination efforts and “devise a system to verify whether individuals are vaccinated.” Following the CDC’s announcement, a handful of parents asked school board members to end the use of masks and plexiglass at schools at their Thursday meeting. Others asked for the district not to further ease protocols, as it did last week, allowing kids to unmask outside.\n\nUtah\n\nLehi: The city will allow medical cannabis drive-thrus after a unanimous vote to remove a local ordinance banning them. The Tuesday City Council vote came after a proposal from Curaleaf, which is the only cannabis pharmacy in the town, the Daily Herald reports. State law allows drive-thru facilities, which have become more popular during the coronavirus pandemic. The facilities must follow all other medical cannabis regulations. Curaleaf’s Stan Lockhart told the council that medical marijuana can be “a lifesaver for some.” Mayor Mark Johnson agreed that it is a better alternative to opioid drugs, and Councilmember Paige Albrecht said her husband is a disabled veteran who uses medical marijuana to treat his chronic pain. “And the V.A. eventually was not able to offer him any further help with his pain, and medical cannabis has helped his quality of life a great deal,” Albrecht said, noting that there were “nights when he wasn’t able to even sleep because the pain was so bad.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has moved to the third phase of its reopening plan two weeks earlier than had been planned. The state moved to the next phase Friday rather than June 1 because it has already exceeded the goal of having of more than 60% of the population receiving at least one dose of a vaccine against COVID-19. The new guidance removes the testing requirement for travel and decreases event and gathering restrictions. The new gathering sizes will allow for one unvaccinated person per 50 square feet, up to 300 people, plus any number of vaccinated people for indoor events; and 900 people, plus any number of vaccinated people, outdoors. On Friday the state also lifted its mask mandate in line with guidance issued by federal officials. Masks are still required in schools, on public transportation, and in health care settings, long-term care facilities and prisons. The mandate remains in place for those who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, including children who are not yet eligible for a vaccine.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The governor has lifted the state’s indoor mask mandate in line with new guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Gov. Ralph Northam made the announcement Friday along with changes to other mitigation measures expanding capacity for sports and entertainment venues and an easing of limits on social gatherings. He also said Virginia will ease all distancing and capacity restrictions May 28, two weeks earlier than planned. Increasing vaccination rates, declines in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, and the lowest statewide test positivity rate since the pandemic began made the changes possible. Masks will still be required in K-12 public schools. Businesses can still require masks. Employees in certain business sectors, including restaurants, retail, fitness, personal care and entertainment, must continue to wear masks unless fully vaccinated. Tony Stafford, president of the Virginia Restaurant Association, said he expects the lifting of the mask mandate to cause some confusion. “It really puts us in a rough spot because I don’t feel comfortable and I don’t think I’m allowed to ask (customers) if they’re vaccinated,” he said. Still, Stafford said, the lifting of the mandate is an encouraging sign for business owners. He said his staff will continue to wear masks.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: The Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board has suspended the license of a bar in Tacoma for 180 days, after months of complaints and citations. The board said last week that it issued an immediate emergency suspension of An American Tavern’s license because of repeated, willful noncompliance and disregard for public health and safety, The News Tribune reports. The board also said during that time it will seek to revoke the license permanently. In total, the board has received 60 complaints about the bar and has issued verbal and written warnings, four administrative violations and $800 in fines. Use of the emergency suspension is rare, the board said, “reserved only for those cases where the public health, safety or welfare is at risk.” Four other businesses have been issued such suspensions in the past year. Efforts to reach owner Kyle Bidwell for comment were not immediately successful. Neighbors reported continued violation of masking, social distancing and general COVID-19 rules for bars and restaurants, in addition to late-night noise and violence in the parking lot. Neighbors also reported seeing highly intoxicated patrons. The Tacoma Police Department has received dozens of calls to the bar, which is on the ground floor of a residential building.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state followed new federal guidance Friday in excluding fully vaccinated people from a statewide mask mandate. Gov. Jim Justice praised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for issuing guidance Thursday that the fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks indoors or out in most cases. “It’s a good day. It’s a great day,” the Republican governor said. The mandate will still apply to those who are not fully vaccinated until June 20, the date Justice has set for lifting the requirement altogether. He added that “you do not have a constitutional right not to wear a mask” and that private businesses and schools may still require face coverings. Justice also announced that the state will end its federal pandemic-era boost for unemployment benefits June 19, including the additional $300 a week for those without a job. He said the state is considering a program that would pay a $1,000 bonus for unemployed people who go back to work. It would require the employer agreeing to pay half of the bonus, with the state covering the other half. “West Virginians will have access to thousands of jobs right now,” he said. “And we need everybody back to work. Our small business and economy depends on it so much.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers on Friday praised new federal guidelines that relaxed mask restrictions for people who have been vaccinated for COVID-19, and he said his administration will review whether it is safe for state workers to return to their offices. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new recommendations Thursday saying the fully vaccinated can resume normal activities without masks except in crowded environments such as on public transportation or inside hospitals, prisons and homeless shelters. During a ceremony outside the state Capitol on Friday to sign a bill recognizing May 14 as Hmong-Lao Veterans Day, Evers applauded the relaxed guidelines. “Obviously, I have to thank the people of Wisconsin who certainly have suffered over these 14 months, in particular the people that have been vaccinated,” said Evers, who wore a mask at the event until he gave his speech. “The people that have been vaccinated have saved lives and have gotten us to this point.” He said his administration would review the new recommendations and evaluate whether to bring state workers back to their offices en masse. He urged reporters not to focus on what he called the “minutiae” of the recommendations and instead celebrate them.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming is easing its indoor mask requirements as of Monday and preparing to remove masking and social distancing rules for fully vaccinated students, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The school also plans to allow full capacity for in-person classes in the fall. COVID-19 vaccines aren’t required, though the university has asked those who do get the shots to report them online to help track the school’s progress, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/23/rockets-last-blast-alaska-drought-million-dollar-ham-news-around-states/39999057/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAug. 23, 2019, 1:39 a.m. ET\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: A Japanese automotive supplier plans to build a more than $60 million plant that will hire about 200 people. A statement from the governor’s office said Vuteq USA will produce parts for the Mazda-Toyota assembly plant being built in Limestone County. Construction on the Vuteq is scheduled to begin in October. The plant is expected to reach full employment in 2021. The factory will make plastic-injected parts and assemblies for vehicles. A partnership between Mazda and Toyota is spending about $1.6 billion on the Huntsville car factory, which will have as many as 4,000 workers. It’s supposed to produce as many as 300,000 vehicles when it opens in two years.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula has gone without rain for more than three weeks, although experts believe some precipitation could arrive this weekend, a report said. Kenai and the central peninsula have not received a measurable amount of rain since July, The Peninsula Clarion reported Tuesday.Rainfall was last measured at 1 inch between July 26 and July 28, officials said. Kodiak Island is also experiencing a drought. Kodiak officials issued a statement Monday asking residents to take steps to help avoid a water supply shortage. Kodiak receives its water from the Pillar Creek Reservoir and the Monashka Reservoir. The Monashka supplies an average of 6.3 million gallons of water per day, officials said. The dry weather has created conditions beneficial to wildland fires. The Swan Lake Fire near Sterling, which grew more than 62 square miles in recent days, was aided by dry, windy conditions, officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The National Weather Service tweeted that Phoenix broke its heat record for Aug. 20 on Tuesday afternoon, reaching a high of 113 degrees just after 2 p.m. The previous record was 112 degrees in 1986. Isaac Smith, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, told The Arizona Republic that the unusually high temperatures were the result of a high-pressure system. Smith said this was the second time Phoenix saw record-breaking heat this month, with the previous being on Aug. 5 with a high of 115 degrees, breaking the record of 114 degrees set in 1969. Smith advised people to limit the time they spend outside as much as possible. He also advised people to always check the backseat of their vehicle to avoid leaving children or pets inside.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home:U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas met with Twin Lakes Area business leaders at a round-table discussion held Tuesday at Arkansas State University-Mountain Home. The Republican began his day by touring the North Arkansas College Technical Center in Harrison and held a lunchtime roundtable with the Boone County Chamber of Commerce before traveling east for the ASU-MH roundtable and a tour of Baxter International. Cotton, who lives in Dardanelle, spent 45 minutes Thursday afternoon at the Vada Sheid Community Development Center meeting with more than 30 representatives from area businesses. Some of the subjects covered at the discussion included the availability of workers, government regulations on smaller banks and partnerships between educational facilities and local manufacturers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPorterville: Visitors to Sequoia National Forest in the southern Sierra Nevada area are being cautioned about the growth of a native plant that can cause severe irritation similar to poison oak and poison ivy. The U.S. Forest Service said poodle-dog bush appears in areas that have recently been burned by wildfire, which has been occurring more frequently in the forest and Giant Sequoia National Monument. Swelling, rashes and itching appear 12 hours to two days after contact and blisters can last longer than two weeks. The plant is covered in sticky hairs which can be easily passed on to passing hikers. Poodle-dog bush can grow almost 10 feet high and has purple, bell-shaped flowers. It emits an unpleasant, slightly pungent odor. It was recently found in the forest’s Converse Basin area.\n\nColorado\n\nBailey: A mountain lion attacked and injured an 8-year-old boy outside his rural home, prompting state wildlife officials to set traps and use search dogs to find the lion. Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesman Jason Clay said the boy was bitten on the head at about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in a rural subdivision near Bailey, southwest of Denver. The boy was hospitalized. His identity and the severity of his injuries were not made public. It’s the third attack by a mountain lion on a person in Colorado this year. A mountain lion last week attacked a hunter who fought it off with a pocket knife. And in February, a mountain lion attacked a runner who choked and bludgeoned it to death.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBloomfield: An animal rights organization is putting up advertisements in Connecticut to remember a calf that was slaughtered in public. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals are running the ads on buses in Hartford for the next four weeks to honor a calf killed behind a Home Depot in Bloomfield. On July 13, a calf escaped the Saba Live Poultry butcher shop in Bloomfield and workers chased the animal to the back of hardware store parking lot where a worker slit the animal’s throat. The halal method of killing an animal includes cutting the throat. The incident sparked outrage and racist comments online against the halal butcher shop. The worker who killed the animal is expected to appear in court on charges related to animal cruelty.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Lifeguards drew criticism for placing a 4-foot-long dying shark into a trash can, but a beach official said the guards acted in the interest of public safety. The Delaware News Journal reported an unresponsive shark that washed up on Rehoboth Beach over the weekend drew a crowd of onlookers, some of which were unhappy when guards disposed of it in a lined bin. Beach Patrol Captain Kent Buckson said putting the shark in the can “wasn’t the right thing,” but that it was the only option for limiting beachgoers’ contact with the lesion-covered fish with a possible parasite infection. He added that lifeguards usually would put it into a trash bag until public works could bury it, but the guards didn’t have a bag that day.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: George Washington University has announced that it plans to phase out fixed tuition for incoming on-campus undergraduate students. WTOP-FM reported the school will start setting tuition rates on an annual basis starting fall 2020. A school statement released Monday said that a review of “the undergraduate experience” led the university to decide the fixed tuition program isn’t realizing “the potential envisioned.” The statement doesn’t provide further detail on what school officials initially envisioned the program would do or how it falls short of that vision. It said the nixed program will lead to an increase in available funds for improving the “student experience.” The school said it will take into account any changes in attendance cost when reviewing need-based financial aid packages.\n\nFlorida\n\nCape Canaveral: A rocket that’s the last of its kind delivered the newest, most powerful GPS satellite to orbit for the Air Force on Thursday. United Launch Alliance’s Delta IV medium-class rocket blasted into a hazy morning sky from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It was a fitting swan song for the rocket. Two hours later, the satellite separated from the upper stage and the company declared success. The Delta IV Medium ended its 17-year run with 29 launches. Denver-based United Launch Alliance said it will be replaced by the still-in-development Vulcan rocket. The Delta IV Heavy, meanwhile, will continue to soar. The newly launched GPS satellite is the second in a series of next-generation navigation spacecraft. It’s nicknamed Magellan after the 16th-century Portuguese explorer. Lockheed Martin, also based in Colorado, built the satellite.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia secretary of state’s office said Tuesday that it plans to reexamine the state’s new election system as required by law after receiving a request from voters. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced last month that the state plans to buy a $106 million election system from Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems. He certified the new system on Aug. 9 and said it will be in place in time for the March 24 primaries. The new system includes touchscreen voting machines that produce a paper record, including a human-readable summary of the voter’s selections and a machine-readable code used by a scanner to tally the votes. A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,450 Georgia voters was submitted Monday to Raffensperger’s office. It says the Dominion system doesn’t meet the requirements of Georgia’s voting system certification rules and doesn’t comply with the state election code. Georgia law allows voters to request that the secretary of state “reexamine any such device previously examined and approved by him or her” as long as at least 10 voters sign onto the request.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A woman was taken to a hospital Tuesday after being bitten twice by a shark while swimming, authorities said. The woman, 27, was reported to be in “good health” and was expected to be released after a shark bit her while she was swimming in Kealakekua Bay on the Big Island’s western side, leaving her with injuries to her lower back and right hip, police said. Officials didn’t provide her name. Soon after the woman was taken to a hospital in serious condition, preliminary information provided to firefighters listed her age as 26 and that the shark bit her in one of her legs and her torso, Hawaii Fire Department Battalion Chief William Bergin said. She was about 50 yards from shore, he said. Bergin didn’t know if she’s a tourist or a Hawaii resident. Police said witnesses described the shark as having a gray tip. Bergin said he was told it’s possibly a 6-foot black-tip reef shark.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A conservation group and hunting technology group said 110 square miles of state-owned land isn’t accessible because there’s no public access. The Idaho Statesman reported Tuesday that the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership and onX published the report after examining data. Idaho manages about 3,750 square miles of endowment lands it received in 1890 when it became a state. The groups also said Idaho has about 305 square miles of federal public land that’s inaccessible. Idaho contains about 54,000 square miles of federal public land. The Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership and onX said some access to public land with easements that aren’t documented might exist.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A lawyer said he city has benefited from 22,000 uncashed checks worth $11 million, some going back to the 1980s. The Chicago Sun-Times reported attorney Clint Krislov made the discovery through a public-records request during a legal dispute between the city and retirees. He said Chicago is supposed to notify the state of Illinois if a check from the city is uncashed after three years. The state has a website for people to look for unclaimed property. The checks include a $44,000 payment in 1991 to Commonwealth Edison. The Sun-Times apparently didn’t cash five small checks from the city. Law department spokesman Bill McCaffrey said Chicago is not bound by the state’s unclaimed property law and has its own procedures for uncashed checks. He didn’t elaborate.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: Some jobs are melting at an ice cream distribution center in Fort Wayne. Nestle Dreyer’s Ice Cream said 40 jobs are being cut, but a large workforce will remain in place. A spokeswoman, Laura Davenport, said the state had been mistakenly told that an ice cream plant and distribution center would close. Nestle said it’s switching to a warehouse model of delivery. The Journal Gazette reported that Nestle acquired a majority stake in Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream in 2002. Dreyer’s ice cream is sold under the Dreyer’s brand in the western United States and as Edy’s in the east.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The National Weather Service said a tornado that damaged or destroyed several buildings in rural Warren County on Tuesday morning was rated an EF3, with peak winds of 150 mph. It touched down near Lacona and ran for nearly 6 miles. It damaged the Iowa Operator and Engineers training facility. No deaths or injuries have been reported. The Des Moines Register reported that another tornado spotted Tuesday touched down a little before 6:25 a.m. near Tracy. It was rated an EF1, with peak winds of 110 mph. It damaged several roofs and trees but didn’t injure anyone.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Large-scale wind power developments would not be allowed and commercial solar installations would be restricted in Sedgwick County under a proposal approved Wednesday by the county commission. The Sedgwick County Commission made the decision to protect aviation interests after planner Dave Yearout told commissioners that large windmills can affect airport and flight operations within a 5-mile radius, The Wichita Eagle reported. A map showing a 10-mile radius drawn around every airport and private landing strip in the county left only four small areas that would not be affected by a wind farm: in the extreme southwest, northwest and northeast corners of the county, and a small strip of land south of Clearwater. Yearout told the Associated Press that the large number of aviation facilities in the county, coupled with increasing nonagricultural development in rural areas and training activities at McConnell Air Force Base, makes large scale wind farms incompatible with the county’s needs.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Attendees of an annual breakfast and charity auction hosted by the Kentucky Farm Bureau were hamming it up with their bids for a prized meat Thursday morning. And with a winning bid of $1million, a Central Bank representative walked away with the Grand Champion Ham of the 2019 Kentucky State Fair. For comparison: you can buy about four 2019 Ferrari Portofinos for that, according to caranddriver.com. (The car is priced at about $215,000). Luther Deaton, the chairman, president and CEO of Central Bank, purchased the winning ham. Central Bank has branch locations across Kentucky. This is not Central Bank's first time betting big on the prized ham. Central Bank and Dr. Mark Lynn won the auction in 2018, each putting $1.4 million toward the ham for a record $2.8 million purchase. Since the start of the auction in 1964, the Kentucky Farm Bureau has raised about $13 million for charity. Blake Penn, of Penn's Country Hams, produced this year's winning ham.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A summer filled with train disruptions has reached its end as Amtrak will restore full service on its Chicago-to-New Orleans line. The McComb Enterprise-Journal reported the line was restored Wednesday after months of terminating in Jackson, Mississippi. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said the opening of the Bonnet Carre spillway near New Orleans cut off service to the city because the tracks are on the flood plain. He said riders were put on buses in Jackson to complete the route to New Orleans. Magliari said track maintenance in parts of Mississippi also lead to ride disruptions going south from Memphis, Tennessee. Amtrak is offering buy-one, get-one fares to celebrate the restoration of full service. Magliari said he’s glad passengers are off the buses and can now experience a real train ride.\n\nMaine\n\nHartland: Officials said they are trying to stop a rat infestation that has hampered their community for more than six months. Hartland residents said garbage and manure left at one home attracted dozens of rats. Resident Michelle Cole told WGME that rats have bitten her dog three times. The rats have also bitten several neighbors. Neighbors voiced their concerns at a town council meeting on Monday. WABI reported that the home is located next to Somerset Elementary School, so the town is aiming to solve the problem before the school year begins next Tuesday. The town manager and attorney said they are working to find a solution, but they are still not sure if the property has been abandoned.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: On July 28, Jeff Wright did something no other angler had done in nearly 35 years. He broke the state record for heaviest mahi-mahi, reeling in a 72.8-pounder. But less than a month later, another massive dolphinfish was caught, and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources declared a new record had been set in the mahi-mahi division. Kristy Frashure of Pasadena caught a 74.5-pounder on board the Haulin N’ Ballin as a participant in the Poor Girls Open fishing tournament. The catch gave Frashure first place in the dolphin category, weighing nearly 35 pounds more than the runner-up. “It took nearly 20-30 minutes to reel in … it felt like an eternity,” Frashure said in a news release. “We were taking bets on how much it weighed.” The department maintains state records for sport fish in four divisions – Atlantic, Chesapeake, Nontidal and Invasive – and awards plaques to anglers who achieve record catches, according to a release. Fish caught from privately owned, fee-fishing waters are ineligible for consideration.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gambling regulators said Massachusetts took in more than $23 million in taxes during the first full month in which all three of the state’s licensed casinos were open. The July revenue report released Thursday by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission sid the Wynn Resorts-owned Encore Boston Harbor casino, which opened in late June, took in about $48.6 million in revenue from table games and slots. MGM Springfield, open since last August, reported about $20.4 million from table games and slots and the Plainridge casino, which does not have table games, reported $12.5 million in revenue. Gambling revenues at Encore and MGM are taxed at 25%, and the Plainridge slots parlor is taxed at 49%. State officials expect to take in nearly $300 million in casino taxes during the current fiscal year.\n\nMichigan\n\nHowell: Authorities have released the names of two men who were killed in a small plane crash in southeastern Michigan. The Livingston County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday that the men who were killed were 68-year-old James Tafralian, of Webberville and 64-year-old Philip Henry Colmer of Chelsea. The Federal Aviation Administration said the single-engine Aero Commander M200 aircraft was taking off at Spencer J. Hardy Airport near Howell when it crashed Tuesday morning. Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy said the plane was landing when it crashed. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Minnesota Department of Public Safety officials said officers cited 678 drivers across the state during the first week of a hands-free cellphone law. The Star Tribune reported that officers handed out 286 citations in Hennepin County, or about 40% of the total tickets issued. State Patrol Lt. Gordon Shank said he hopes to see the number of citations decline as people realize police are pulling over drivers who fail to put down their devices while behind the wheel. He said he issued a warning to a driver from out of state who didn’t know about the law. Minnesota became the 19th state with a hands-free law when it took effect Aug. 1. Fines are $50 for the first offense and $275 for each subsequent violation, plus court costs.\n\nMississippi\n\nAmory: A new company has begun making boats in northeast Mississippi and hired 75 people. Avid Boats in Amory said it’s investing $1.6 million to make aluminum bass boats and center console bay boats. Avid plans to make 750 boats next year and 1,500 annually by 2022. President Phillip Faulkner previously founded Amory boat maker NauticStar. Mississippi Development Authority spokeswoman Tammy Craft said the state is giving Avid $218,000 for building improvements and $75,000 for worker training. Amory and Monroe County are giving property tax breaks estimated at $400,000 over 10 years. Avid will be eligible for a state worker income tax rebate because average workers will earn more than $43,300 a year. Avid could collect $1.3 million over 10 years.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:Two hippo sisters are getting ready to return to their newly remodeled home in Colorado after spending nearly two years at a Missouri zoo. The Springfield News-Leader reported that the hippos came to the Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield in October 2017 because the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs needed a place to put them while it created a new habitat. The Springfield zoo had space for the sisters, named Zambezi and Kasai, because its beloved Henry the hippo was moved in 2016 to a new $8 million enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo. The Springfield zoo’s spokeswoman, Joey Powell, said the sisters were originally just supposed to spend a year in Missouri but construction delays made the stay last longer. She said they’ve been on “an extended vacation.”\n\nMontana\n\nKlaispell: Glacier National Park has reopened three trails days after they were closed because of grizzly bear activity. The Flathead Beacon reported that officials have reopened the Highline, Loop and Swiftcurrent Pass trails in the Granite Park area. Officials said the Granite Park Campground area remains closed. Park staff received several reports from visitors of encounters with a bear or bears Sunday. The park said the behavior was consistent with bears being disturbed and frustrated by humans. Officials at the park said visitors should remain aware and watch for signs indicating bear activity and take precautions, including carrying bear spray.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials at Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium said Tuesday that a 21-year-old rhino, Marina, was euthanized Monday after surgeons discovered an inoperable colonic obstruction. She was being treated for symptoms similar to colic when staffers noticed that she appeared lethargic. The 4,000-pound rhino arrived at the zoo in 1999. Her death leaves the zoo with another female and a male. White rhinos are listed as near-threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. In the wild, most white rhinos live in South Africa.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A team of researchers from the Desert Research Institute detected microplastics at several locations around Lake Tahoe earlier this year. Microplastics, a term for tiny pieces of plastic that come from everything from water bottles to synthetic fleece sweaters, are ubiquitous around the world, so it’s not surprising to find them in Lake Tahoe. Still, researchers are digging deeper into the issue to learn more about potential ramifications for Nevada. The study of microplastics is relatively new but their ubiquity is alarming to scientists. They have been found in fish in the oceans and raining down from the sky in the Pyrenees. The work at Lake Tahoe is part of an effort the DRI Foundation funded to learn more about microplastics in Nevada. In addition to lakes and streams in the Tahoe Basin, the Las Vegas wash in southern Nevada, which drains into Lake Mead, is being studied.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSunapee: A woman has celebrated her 111th birthday in New Hampshire with a bunch of cupcakes and a tribute from singers. Hazel Nilson was born Aug. 21, 1908, in Chicago. A lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, she liked to say she was born the last time the team won the World Series before their big comeback in 2016. Nilson, a former physical education teacher, has been a resident of Sunapee Cove since October 2014. Before that, she lived in Stone Lake, Wisconsin. Wearing a cake-shaped hat, Nilson sampled a peach cupcake at her party Wednesday. The Sunapee Singers sang “Take Me out to the Ball Game” in her honor. When asked if she has any secret to her longevity, she said smile, enjoy life and don’t fret.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPemberton Township: Officials believe off-road vehicle riders in New Jersey’s Pinelands ripped up 400 trees days after they were planted by teenagers. Jason Howell of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance told NJ.com he returned to the site to install barriers at the Bucks Cove Run Preserve in Pemberton Township and found the site “completely torn up” and a trash fire still smoldering. Off-road vehicle tracks were on the ground. The state Environmental Protection Department said it is aware of the vandalism and park police at nearby Brendan T. Byrne State Forest are increasing enforcement. Off-road vehicles are prohibited on Pinelands land managed by nonprofits and the state. However, licensed and registered vehicles can be driven on roadways.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New restrictions on wildlife foot traps and wire snares are being proposed by New Mexico Game and Fish officials amid conflicts arising from trapping traditions, evolving attitudes about animal suffering and outdoor enthusiasts with dogs. The agency that oversees trapping rules and regulations on Thursday suggested a prohibition on traps and snares for public lands on the outskirts of Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Cruces and Taos. It also suggested a half-mile no-trapping buffer at certain hiking trailheads, as well as training requirements for trappers. The proposal initiates a monthslong rulemaking process with opportunities for public comment. Rule changes are decided by the New Mexico State Game Commission, appointed by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. Trapping regulations hold implications for wildlife and recreation across an estimated 30 percent of New Mexico.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A top-rated New York City pizza restaurant has reopened two days after it was shuttered by state officials over unpaid taxes. The New York Post reported that Brooklyn’s Di Fara Pizza reopened Thursday after its owners worked out a payment plan to settle a $167,000 tax bill. Di Fara opened in 1965 and has long been a favorite with New Yorkers and out-of-town visitors. Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Thursday that he was glad “the best slice in town” would be around “for years to come.” The Democratic mayor had tweeted Wednesday that he wanted to help resolve Di Fara’s tax situation. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on TV station NY1 that the resolution of the restaurant’s tax dispute is “the perfect outcome from everyone’s point of view.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A judicial panel ruled Thursday that a mentally ill man who wore a Superman-like cape in police interviews and compared himself to Dracula did not kill a North Carolina college student in a dorm 40 years ago. Three judges declared James Blackmon, 66, innocent in the death of Helena Payton, who was stabbed in the neck in a dormitory bathroom of what is now St. Augustine’s University in Raleigh in September 1979. The ruling, which is final, came as part of the unique process under which the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission rules on innocence claims from convicted people and sends the cases it finds credible to a three-judge panel. Prison officials said, following the exoneration, that they were working Thursday afternoon to release Blackmon, who was serving a life sentence for second-degree murder.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s Health Department disregarded its own policy in updating the volume of pipeline spill at a natural gas processing plant. In July 2015, Oneok Partners reported a 10-gallon spill of natural gas condensate from a pipeline at a plant near Watford City. The estimated size of the spill was never updated, even as Oneok updated the state on cleanup. In October, Oneok told the state it had recovered 240,000 gallons of the liquid gas. State Environmental Quality Chief Dave Glatt said Thursday that a spill report should have been made public to reflect the severity of the spill. It’s also unclear whether promised quarterly inspections of the site have been done in the past two years. Glatt said he is investigating whether the inspections occurred.\n\nOhio\n\nLordstown: An Ohio electricity company said it is canceling plans to build a gas-fired power plant because of the state’s recent nuclear bailout. The Vindicator reported that the plant would have been Clean Energy Future’s third in Lordstown in northeastern Ohio. The company had spent more than $1 million in development and permitting costs. The company’s president, Bill Siderewicz, said the gas-fired plant would have produced $29 billion of economic benefit over its 50-year lifespan, as well as full-time jobs, local supplies and services. Siderewicz said plans were canceled because of the recent passage of a bill that gives $150 million a year to nuclear power plants near Cleveland and Toledo. State Rep. Gil Blair called Siderewicz’s announcement “certainly not good news.” Lordstown is in Blair’s district.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTahlequah: The Cherokee Nation’s newly elected chief formally announced his plan to send a delegate to the U.S. House, but acknowledged the first such attempt by a tribal nation will take time, as well as cooperation from Congress. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. on Thursday called on Congress to recognize the tribe’s right to a delegate outlined in two treaties with the U.S. government and the tribe’s constitution. Hoskin sent a letter last week to the tribe’s governing council announcing his plan to nominate Kimberly Teehee, a former adviser to President Barack Obama. Republican U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin, a Cherokee Nation citizen, said in a statement the Cherokee’s plan was “unprecedented,” but said he supports tribal sovereignty and that treaties must be honored.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Cremated remains found in a mortuary box on a Portland street belong to a World War II veteran who lived in a house that hs been demolished and who worked at a concrete and steel company that no longer exists. The Oregonian/OregonLive said Thursday it tracked down the details of Floyd Leslie Hill’s life and found some estranged family members in the Midwest. Those family members said they don’t want his ashes. Hill died in 2000 at age 80. For now, Hill’s remains have been returned to the mortuary where they originated. Chris Hawes, a volunteer with the Missing in America Project, said that when no one claims the remains of veterans, his organization can coordinate interment at a national cemetery.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTinicum Township: A small community near Philadelphia that managed to save the oldest surviving quarantine station in the Western Hemisphere from the wrecking ball is now transforming the 18th-century structure into township offices. For Tinicum Township, renovating the Lazaretto Quarantine Station was part of a broader plan to draw visitors to the community. For historians, saving the Lazaretto offers a chance to tell stories of immigration and public health in America’s early days. Built in 1799, the quarantine station protected the Port of Philadelphia against the introduction of diseases that could lead to epidemics for nearly a century. Township officials stopped a developer from tearing it down to build a parking lot. Now, they’ve restored it and will move offices into the stately building in September.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWesterly: The Rhode Island fire marshal is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible for blowing up two portable toilets last weekend. The first explosion happened at about 12:30 a.m. Saturday at a residential construction site in the coastal town of Westerly. The second incident occurred in a private parking lot in Charlestown. Police said a fisherman heard an explosion at about 11 p.m. Saturday, but the damage was not reported until Sunday morning. There were no reports of injuries in either explosion. The state bomb squad, which is overseen by Office of the State Fire Marshal, is investigating. The office said there’s no indication of any terrorist links to the explosions.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWalhalla: WSPA-TV reported the Oconee County Sheriff’s Office announced a new deputy to their staff on Wednesday: K-9 Thor. Thor, who will be a tracking and explosives canine for the sheriff’s office, is a yellow lab and was accompanied by his handler, Deputy Justin Stokes, at a swearing-in ceremony Wednesday. According to a sheriff’s office news release, Stokes and Thor have completed their required training and are ready to serve the county. Officials said Thor received his badge at the ceremony and then retired K-9 handlers received plaques commemorating their dogs’ service to Oconee County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The first round of homes in the flood-prone Rose-Lotta neighborhood near the Big Sioux River and Tomar Park could be demolished or relocated as early as this fall. Spring flooding put dozens of homes in the area southeast of Interstate 229 and Minnesota Avenue underwater – again. And because flooding there has grown increasingly frequent during large rain events and spring thaws, Mayor Paul TenHaken and the City Council set aside $1 million in leftover money from the prior year's budget to create a voluntary buy-out program in hopes of creating more green space. The idea is fewer homes, and more permeable surface area near Tomar Park could alleviate yearly flooding and improve drainage for other nearby properties. Those eight homes ranged in price from $72,000 to $186,000, with the average sale price to the city of $119,500.\n\nTennessee\n\nCleveland: State officials have broken ground on a $47 million state veterans nursing home. Gov. Bill Lee was among the ceremony’s attendees Wednesday. The single-story, 108-bed intermediate and skilled care nursing facility will span 110,000 square feet. It will include six 18-bedroom residential houses connected by interior shared support spaces. In 2003, the Bradley County Commission and Cleveland City Council passed resolutions to support a nursing facility for long-term veteran care. A $3 million anonymous donation was pledged in 2006, and the city and county have contributed $2 million each since. The state has added $10 million. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is contributing a $30.5 million grant. The families of Steve Williams, Thomas Williams, and Robert Wright donated 28 acres in Cleveland in 2010.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: The city has a new main fire station as recovery continues since Hurricane Ike swamped parts of the city in 2008. The Galveston County Daily News reported the $9.6 million Fire Station No. 1 was one of the last large projects funded by Ike disaster relief money. Construction continues on a public works building and a wastewater treatment plant. Visitors on Wednesday toured the nearly 28,000-square-foot fire station. The base is 11 feet above ground level. Fire Chief Mike Wisko said the station was reinforced to withstand a Category 5 hurricane. Forecasters said such storms include winds of at least 157 mph. All six Galveston fire stations were damaged by Ike, which had top winds of 110 mph and a 15-foot storm surge.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Legislators are drafting a proposal to scrap a planned state-run medical marijuana dispensary system after facing pressure from county attorneys who said the system put public employees at risk of being prosecuted under federal drug laws. Republican Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers said medical cannabis would instead be distributed through up to 12 private dispensaries. Gov. Gary Herbert has hinted about calling a special session where those changes could be approved, though no date has been announced. The law now calls for seven private dispensaries with a state-run “central fill pharmacy” distributing the remainder of medical marijuana orders through Utah’s 13 local health departments. But some county attorneys argued using health departments as pickup points would make the employees de facto drug dealers. Some cannabis advocates applauded the proposed change for increasing patient access. Others worry 12 dispensaries still won’t meet demand.\n\nVermont\n\nSwanton: Biologists are trying to figure out why American eels are washing up dead on the shores of northern Lake Champlain. Vermont Public Radio reported at least 15 dead eels have appeared from Swanton south to Milton in the past few weeks. State Fish and Wildlife Department fisheries biologist Bernie Pientka said it’s not clear what’s causing the die-off. He said an invasive nematode, or roundworm, has harmed eel populations in the U.S. Southeast, so that might be a cause. Pientka said other fish species in the lake do not seem to be affected. Lake Champlain once supported a commercial eel fishery. The population declined in the 1980s and 1990s, but rebounded after eel ladders were upgraded on the Richelieu River, which flows north from Champlain to the St. Lawrence River.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: All students in Newport News Public Schools will receive free breakfast and lunch under a federal program. News outlets reported the district received approval from the state’s Education Department to use a federal program that reimburses meals at schools with a certain proportion of low-income students. District child nutrition official Cathy Alexander announced the news Tuesday. The Virginian-Pilot reported it’s the largest public system in the state to give all meals to students for free.Federal funding eligibility depends on the percentage of students who participate in public benefit programs that make them eligible for free meals. If at least 40% of students fall into that category, the schools are eligible for funding. The newspaper said about 47% of students in the district met the criteria.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: What authorities described as a homeless camp on the water in Seattle has sunk. KOMO-TV reported the floating camp was made up of three boats rafted together and tied up illegally to a fishing net piling belonging to the Duwamish Tribe. Two of the boats sank last week in the Duwamish Waterway and a third boat remained afloat. The Port of Seattle is investigating after it was asked to by the City of Tukwila last month. Mike DeSota, environmental compliance manager for the Marine Division for the Port, said there was a “homeless concentration” of people going back and forth from the vessels. Officials said the Coast Guard pumped out fuel and removed hazardous chemicals on board. On Wednesday, a salvage crew removed both boats.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMineral Wells: Japanese truck maker Hino Motors Manufacturing has marked the opening of its new West Virginia assembly plant. Hino Motors held a ceremony Wednesday in Mineral Wells at a former retail distribution center. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said on Twitter before the ceremony that one of his first trade trips as governor in 2005 was to Japan to recruit Hino Motors to North America. Manchin said “it’s been a wonderful, wonderful success story.” Company President Takashi Ono has said the $100 million investment could create up to 250 new jobs. For 12 years, Hino Motors had assembled medium-duty trucks at a smaller facility 20 miles away in the Wood County community of Williamstown. Hino Motors is owned by the Toyota Group and its American headquarters are in Novi, Michigan.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Department of Natural Resources board is considering an emergency rule to shorten Wisconsin’s ruffed grouse season to protect the population. Drumming activity declined 34% statewide from 2017 to 2018. Hunters took only 173,347 grouse last year, the lowest total in the 35 years the DNR has been surveying small-game hunters about their success. The department said the decline’s cause is unknown. The season runs from mid-October through Dec. 8 in southeastern Wisconsin and from mid-September through Jan. 31 in the rest of the state. The rule’s description doesn’t lay out new season end dates. DNR spokeswoman Sarah Hoye said the rule would affect only the out-state season, ending it Jan. 5 instead of Jan. 31. The board is scheduled to vote on the rule description Tuesday. Approval would authorize the DNR to develop the rule language.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A video shows employees at a rental car agency all they need to know about how a car got damaged in Yellowstone National Park. The footage shows one of the dozens of bison stampeding through the park as it rams the rental and cracks the windshield. No injuries were reported. The Casper Star-Tribune reported that a family member caught the scene on video on Aug. 13 after the animals brought traffic to a standstill. Bison weigh up to 2,000 pounds and run up to 30 mph. A video shot earlier this summer showed a man petting a bison’s head in Yellowstone. No one was injured, but park officials warned visitors to keep their distance. In July, a bison threw a 9-year-old girl into the air in Yellowstone. She wasn’t seriously injured.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/23"}]}

In an amended complaint filed in February, Trump bumped his claim for damages to $20 billion.\n\nCBS aired two versions of the Harris interview in which she appears to give different answers to the same question about the Israel-Hamas war, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Texas.\n\nCBS previously said the lawsuit was \"completely without merit\" and had asked a judge to dismiss the case.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. Edward A Paltzik, a lawyer representing Trump in the civil suit, could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Paramount Chair Shari Redstone was similarly unavailable for comment.\n\nThe case entered mediation in April.\n\nTrump alleged CBS’s editing of the interview violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, which makes it illegal to use false, misleading, or deceptive acts in commerce. Media advocacy groups said Trump’s novel use of such laws against news outlets could be a way of circumventing legal protections for the press, which can only be held liable for defamation against public figures if they say something they knew or should have known was false.\n\nThe settlement comes as Paramount prepares for an $8.4-billion merger with Skydance Media, which will require approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. On the campaign trail last year, Trump threatened to revoke CBS's broadcasting license if elected.\n\nHe has repeatedly lashed out against the news media, often casting unfavorable coverage as \"fake news.\"\n\nThe Paramount settlement follows a decision by Walt Disney-owned ABC News to settle a defamation case brought by Trump. As part of that settlement, which was made public on December 14, the network donated $15 million to Trump's presidential library and publicly apologized for comments by anchor George Stephanopoulos, who inaccurately said Trump had been found liable for rape.\n\nIt also follows a second settlement, by Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms, which on January 29 said it had agreed to pay about $25 million to settle a lawsuit by Trump over the company's suspension of his accounts after the January 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhy Trump sued CBS: What to know about complaint dating back to Kamala Harris interview\n\nTrump has vowed to pursue more claims against the media.\n\nOn December 17, he filed a lawsuit against the Des Moines Register newspaper and its former top pollster over its poll published on November 2 that showed Harris leading Trump by three percentage points in Iowa. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an order barring the Des Moines Register from engaging in \"ongoing deceptive and misleading acts and practices\" related to polling.\n\nA Des Moines Register representative said the organization stands by its reporting and that the lawsuit was without merit.\n\nOn June 30, Trump dropped the federal lawsuit and refiled it in an Iowa state court.\n\n(Reporting by Helen Coster and Jack Queen in New York, Kanjyik Ghosh and Surbhi Misra in Bengaluru; Editing by Noeleen Walder, Rod Nickel and Kate Mayberry)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/15/trump-to-sue-bbc-for-putting-words-in-my-mouth-in-jan-6-video/87781629007/", "title": "Trump sues BBC for $10B over edited Jan. 6 video: 'Putting words in ...", "text": "Dec. 15, 2025 Updated Dec. 16, 2025, 4:13 p.m. ET\n\nThe president filed a federal lawsuit on Dec. 15 against the BBC, alleging the worldwide news organization \"put terrible words\" in his mouth and made it seem in a video that he called for violence in the Jan. 6, 2021 riots that ended with thousands storming the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I’m suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth,\" President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. \"They actually put terrible words in my mouth having to do with January 6 that I didn't say.\"\n\nThe $10 billion lawsuit for defamation comes in response to a documentary segment the British news broadcaster published last year before the presidential election. It featured edited video of a speech Trump gave to supporters on Jan. 6 before rioters took the Capitol building; BBC officials later admitted the video was edited in a way that didn’t accurately represent what Trump said.\n\n\"The beautiful words I said, the beautiful words, talking about patriotism and all of the good things I said\" were cut, Trump said of the video.\n\nTrump accused the BBC of defaming him by splicing together parts of a January 6, 2021 speech, including one section where he told supporters to march on the Capitol and another where he said \"fight like hell.\" It omitted a section in which he called for peaceful protest.\n\nThe president also suggested Monday the British company used AI to \"have me saying things I never said.\"\n\nBBC leadership has apologized to Trump, admitted an error of judgment and acknowledged that the edit gave the mistaken impression that he had made a direct call for violent action.

I'll discuss the underlying facts in a minute, but this news begs several questions.\n\nFirst, between filing defamation claims, demolishing the East Wing and sending out Truth Social posts, when does Trump, you know, work?\n\nSecond, I thought Trump wins so often he gets tired of winning. But his winning percentage on these silly cases rivals the 2025 Bengals.\n\nA federal court dismissed his recent case against The New York Times. The Wall Street Journal has filed a motion to dismiss Trump's suit regarding The Journal's reporting on the note Trump sent to his good friend Jeffrey Epstein. It's hard to imagine the court not granting the motion since everything the Journal said was true. And Trump's \"consumer fraud\" case against the Des Moines Register for reporting on a poll that ultimately proved inaccurate is likely to be tossed once some preliminary procedural issues get resolved.\n\nThat brings us to the BBC lawsuit. It's likely the court will summarily dismiss that one, too. In the suit, Trump claims the BBC defamed him in a documentary when it spliced together two parts of Trump's speech to his followers on January 26, 2021. The two sections condensed about 50 minutes of the speech, in which he urged his followers to march to the Capitol and \"fight like hell\" to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nBut the portion the BBC broadcast did not include this perfunctory statement from Trump: \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\" According to the lawsuit, this editing decision gave the impression that Trump was urging people to participate in the riot that later broke out at the Capitol.\n\nAnd while part of me sincerely hopes for a quick dismissal, another part of me hopes the case moves to the discovery phase. In any civil suit, both sides can obtain information about the other side's case. Here, the BBC could demand production of documents such as speech drafts, internal e-mails and text messages.\n\nThose might shine some light on Trump's motivation on January 6 – both when he fired up the mob and when he sat on his hands while they desecrated the Capitol. Trump and his henchmen would also need to sit for depositions. Lawsuits have a way of revealing uncomfortable truths.\n\nAnd the discovery might very well support a solid defense that the BBC documentary was substantially true. The \"substantial truth\" defense protects a publisher, even if there are inaccuracies, so long as the \"gist\" of the publication is accurate. Here, Trump argues that the documentary \"misled\" viewers by suggesting that Trump was urging his followers to storm the Capitol.\n\nHere, in asserting the substantial truth defense, the BBC might point out that Trump took no steps to stop the riot for at least two hours while the violence raged. He has called January 6 a \"day of love.\" He pardoned every single member of the mob. He has called them patriots. And this doesn't even scratch the surface of the January 6 Committee's findings.\n\nThe BBC might also contend that Trump is a \"libel-proof plaintiff.\" A libel-proof plaintiff is one who has tarnished his reputation so badly that the alleged defamation wouldn't make it any worse. With his indefensible actions during and following the January 6 riot, coupled with his vile Truth Social post following Rob Reiner's murder, Trump may very well have made himself libel-proof.\n\nBut he'll no doubt continue to file libel suits. It's kind of his thing.\n\nJack Greiner is a Cincinnati attorney.

What to know after Trump's order to cut funding\n\nWhy is Trump suing CBS News?\n\nTrump first filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the network in October over allegations that it deceptively edited a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Harris, his Democratic Party opponent in the presidential election.\n\nTrump raised the claim for damages to $20 billion in February, according to Reuters.\n\nCBS has repeatedly denied the accusations, and legal experts have told the New York Times the lawsuit is “baseless.”\n\nThe lawsuit entered mediation last month, signaling that CBS's parent company Paramount Global could choose to settle, raising concerns over how that may embolden the administration’s increasingly aggressive stance toward major media organizations, the New York Times reported.\n\nWendy McMahon departure follows Bill Owens' departure\n\nMcMahon’s exit follows the departure of longtime \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens in April.\n\nOwens, who announced he would leave the venerated show at the end of the season, cited concerns about editorial independence, according to a memo seen by Reuters.\n\nOwens said it had “become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it,” according to a note to staffers, CBS reported.\n\nDid CBS News edit Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview?\n\nYes. It is standard practice among news outlets to edit to fit time or space constraints, experts previously told USA TODAY.\n\nDuring a teaser clip for the interview on Oct. 6 on “Face the Nation” when Bill Whitaker asks Harris about the U.S.-Israeli relationship, viewers see a different video response from the vice president than on the subsequent “60 Minutes” broadcast on Oct. 7.\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Wyden, Warren and Sanders have pledged to investigate the settlement for potential illegalities if Democrats regain congressional control.\n\nThe Columbia Broadcasting System, known as CBS, has long been one of America's most admired media brands, from Edward R. Murrow's radio reports during World War II while bombs fell around him in England to the investigative invention of the televised news magazine \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nNow, with American media under constant attack from a presidency eager to tip toward tyranny, there's good reason a recent Broadway revival of a show named after Murrow's famous sign-off line – \"Good night, and good luck\" – was greeted with such acclaim.\n\nThe people in charge at Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, have no inspirational words to offer Americans these days. If they had a sign-off line, it would be more like \"Give in, and pay up.\"\n\nThat's just what Paramount did on July 2, Wednesday, agreeing to pay $16 million to settle a meritless lawsuit from President Donald Trump, who had first demanded $10 billion and then upped that to $20 billion while siccing federal regulators on CBS.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nTrump's CBS lawsuit was an affront to the First Amendment\n\nTrump's beef: CBS News twice aired an interview during the 2024 presidential campaign with Kamala Harris, then the vice president and Democratic nominee, that had been edited for two shows, \"60 Minutes\" and \"Face the Nation.\" His real problem was the constant state of victimhood his seething narcissism forces him to seek.\n\nThe lawsuit was derided as a blatant assault on the First Amendment protections for free speech in America. Don't take my word for it on that. Consider what CBS News reported Wednesday while announcing the settlement.\n\n\"First Amendment scholars and constitutional experts largely view the lawsuit as a frivolous misapplication of the law,\" the network reported, while noting that Trump's lawyers had specifically filed the case in a federal court district in Texas with one judge, who was appointed by Trump in 2019.\n\nTrump would have lost this case, either at trial or on appeal. But Paramount has something to lose, too.\n\nThe company is seeking the Federal Communications Commission's approval for an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media. Trump, who appointed Brendan Carr to head the FCC after winning a second term, has used social media posts to demand punishment for CBS News for the terrible crime of … journalism that didn't say exactly what he wanted to hear.\n\nSo this settlement is not about the journalism or ethics at CBS News. It's a payoff from Paramount Chair Shari Redstone so she and a band of very wealthy executives at the top of their corporation can get even richer.\n\nParamount made some feeble attempts, in announcing the settlement, to dodge the shame of that cash-driven capitulation, noting that Trump will not receive an apology and that the $16 million will go to his future presidential library, not to him directly.\n\nPathetic stuff. And certainly not the end of this scandal for Paramount, for two reasons.\n\nTrump will always be a bully, but Congress could turn over\n\nFirst, Trump is now and always has been a bully willing to use bogus lawsuits to harass his perceived enemies. And second, control of Congress could well tip to the Democratic Party in the 2026 midterm elections, which means Paramount's merger could be the subject of well-deserved legislative oversight.\n\nOn the bullying, Paramount was so driven by the merger that it missed the lesson from Trump's assault on the journalists at ABC News. That network's parent company, Walt Disney Co., tried to mollify Trump with a $15 million settlement in December for a tantrum-based lawsuit he filed in March 2024.\n\nCarr, over at the FCC, launched a federal investigation of Disney and ABC several months after the settlement to see if their efforts at employing a diverse workforce broke the law.\n\nGiving in to a bully guarantees more bullying in the future.\n\nOver in Congress, U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, took to social media to accuse Paramount of bribing Trump, vowing to press for federal charges if his party takes control of his chamber after the 2026 elections. Wyden and two Senate colleagues, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, in May wrote to Redstone to announce their intentions to investigate \"potentially illegal conduct\" as talk of a settlement circulated.\n\nRedstone and anyone at Paramount who backed this settlement should be ashamed, though I expect they're more focused on profits from the merger than the lasting damage they did to their reputations and the legacy of a once-proud institution of journalism.\n\nThey should pay for that cowardice. Trump, the voracious bully, will want more. Democrats, if they win back Congress, should use their powers of oversight to expose every angle of this embarrassing fiasco.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan.

Wisconsin schools will lose $8 million.\n\nThe grant, awarded by the Biden-Harris administration, aimed to address the growing mental health needs of students and staff shortages.\n\nDPI Superintendent Jill Underly criticized the decision, highlighting the positive impact the funding would make.\n\nWhen the Biden-Harris Administration awarded the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction $10 million over a five-year period to improve youth mental health services in December, it was the largest-ever expansion of K-12 mental health programs in the state to date.\n\nAnd it wasn't just Wisconsin. The investment was poised to help train and hire an additional 4,000 mental health professionals to schools nationally at a time when increasing mental health concerns among students compounded ongoing shortages of school-based mental health professionals.\n\nBut May 2, it was learned that less than a year into the grant cycle, the federal Department of Education abruptly terminated the grant earlier in the week. Wisconsin DPI received an email titled \"Notice of Non-Continuation of Grant Award\" informing the state agency that the Trump administration had determined \"not to continue your federal award … in its entirety, effective at the end of your current grant budget period.\"\n\nNationally, the Trump administration discontinued $1 billion in grants that supported school-based mental health programs.\n\nThe grants were funded through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a landmark gun safety law passed in the wake of a massacre three years ago in Uvalde, Texas, that left 19 elementary school students and two teachers dead.\n\nSpecifically, the Trump administration took issue with programs that educated mental health professionals about systemic racism and trained therapists to focus on race-related stress and trauma, among other things, said Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the Education Department, according to USA Today.\n\nDPI has made clear it has no plans to back down from inclusive therapy models. The state agency has doubled-down on its commitment to prioritizing diversity.\n\nWisconsin was among the 19 states that sued the U.S. Department of Education over its efforts to eliminate K-12 school funding for states that refuse to end diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\n\nSo far, $2.2 million of the Wisconsin grant had gone toward expanding online certification pathways, developing “grow your own” university programs for future school-based mental health providers, and offering statewide training and professional development to improve retention rates of mental health professionals.\n\nThe remaining roughly $8 million will not be awarded.\n\nThe 2024 grant was built off the success of a 2020 pilot grant from the federal government, which had put an additional 348 new mental health professionals into local education agencies across Wisconsin since the 2021-2022 school year. Wisconsin was one of a handful of states involved in the pilot program.\n\nIn hiring more mental health professionals, the state also shrunk its troublingly high ratio of students to school-based mental health professionals by 14% at school districts selected for the pilot program. The pilot program was considered so successful that Wisconsin became one of 22 states to be awarded another five-year grant, which started in January.\n\nNevertheless, the Trump administration says the grant \"no longer effectuates the best interest of the federal government.”\n\nDPI Superintendent Jill Underly called the decision to eliminate the grant indefensible at a time when communities have been pleading for help serving student mental health needs.\n\n“These funds ― which Wisconsin used to make meaningful change for our schools ― were helping districts and our higher education partners develop new mental health professionals, providing a career opportunity for our current high schoolers,\" Underly said. \"This action takes resources away from Wisconsin and disrupts the success efforts we’ve made to ensure qualified individuals are serving our kids.\"\n\nAt this point, there's no indication that staff hired through the 2020 pilot grant, which ends September 30, will be let go, but the canceled 2024 grant will invariably mean the loss of momentum in the state's ability to reach underserved communities.\n\nNow, DPI hopes that its historic proposal to invest more than $300 million in school mental health programs over the 2025-27 biennium makes its way through the Republican-controlled Legislature. The provision would invest in the now-stymied school-based mental health services program, expand aid for mental health care costs, invest in alcohol and drug abuse programs, add more mental health training across school staff, and extend peer-to-peer suicide prevention programs to middle schools.\n\nSuccess, however, is considered unlikely based on previous years. DPI had requested $278 million over the 2023-25 biennium, but received about $74 million in mental health services across K-12 Wisconsin schools. The 2021-23 biennial budget allocated less than half that amount ― $44 million ― into youth mental health services.\n\nShould the Legislature continue its trend of budgeting far less of DPI's proposed requests, the responsibility will fall to school districts to find the funding. Community members may see more school referendums on ballots in future years, for example.\n\n“Kids don’t get a chance to do-over their school experience while the federal government recalibrates its political agenda,” Underly said. “Federal funds are a critical part of our infrastructure, and these disruptions need to stop.”\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nNatalie Eilbert covers mental health issues for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

For model year 2026, for example, the fleetwide average was expected to be 35.8 mpg; under Trump's new rules, it would be 30.4 mph.\n\nBy 2031, the gap would increase substantially, from 50.4 mpg on average under the Biden rules to 34.5 mpg under Trump's.\n\nTrump not only said Biden's rules amounted to \"an insane electric vehicle mandate,\" suggesting they only could be met by forcing Americans to buy EVs and companies to produce them, but added cryptically that his Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could get rid of tailpipe emission standards it has previously mandated under the Clean Air Act. Such a move, if it were to happen, would be an enormous change in how greenhouse gas emissions from autos − considered one of the largest sources of climate change − are regulated.\n\nWith Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy flanked in the Oval Office by various dignitaries, including the leaders from the Detroit Three automakers, Trump asked Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley to step forward and comment on it.\n\n“Today is a victory of common sense and affordability,” Farley said. “Eighty percent of the vehicles we sell here, we make in our country, and we never left, unlike many of our competitors. This CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standard, that is aligned with customer demand, is the right move. We believe that people should be able to make a choice as you said Mr. President.”\n\nFarley went on to say, “We will invest more in affordable vehicles. This allows us to invest in affordable vehicles made in the US, which we will take the lead on and it will allow us to make vehicles more affordable.”\n\nStellantis, which makes Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat brands, was represented at the White House by its CEO Antonio Filosa, who also praised the proposal. \"It’s a great day for us at Stellantis because it’s the day when we see CAFE standards reconciled with real customer demands.\"\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra did not attend due to a previous commitment but John Urbanic, plant manager at GM's Orion Assembly plant, was on hand. He told Trump, \"We support your leadership for this issue that is so important to the auto industry.\" General Motors spokeswoman Liz Winter noted that as part of a $4 billion investment GM is making in U.S. manufacturing, GM is transitioning Orion from building EVs to instead build gasoline-powered pickups and SUVs.\n\nIn a statement, Winter said GM supports the move because GM has long advocated for one national standard.\n\n\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA’s proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" Winter wrote. \"As we review the proposal, we remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market.”\n\nIndustry supports the change, environmentalists balk\n\nIn a statement to the Detroit Free Press, the wider auto industry also applauded the move to ease the CAFE standards.\n\n“We’ve been clear and consistent: The current CAFE rules finalized under the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace for (electric vehicles),\" John Bozzella, CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation — a group that represents most automakers — said in a statement. \"What’s good for consumers and the auto industry? A stable regulatory environment and balanced, reasonable, achievable standards that continue to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy.\"\n\nBozzella added that the new policies will preserve consumer choice and keep the U.S. auto industry globally competitive.\n\nLikewise, the National Auto Dealers Association said in a statement that it has advocated for regulations that protect consumer choice and vehicle affordability for decades. It said car dealers support CAFE standards that are feasible and in line with customer demand for affordable, fuel-efficient cars.\n\n\"The comprehensive reset of CAFE standards proposed today represents a milestone in that effort, and we commend the Trump administration for its leadership on the issue,\" the NADA said in a statement. \"If finalized, these regulations would craft standards that can be met with a range of technologies. This would enable manufacturers to produce vehicles suited to a wide spectrum of consumers with varying budgets and fuel preferences.\"\n\nBut as noted, environmentalists were outraged. The League of Conservation Voters said a rollback will hurt the environment and consumers' pocketbooks.\n\n“The Trump administration is continuing their attacks on clean energy and families’ budgets by rolling back standards that save each family hundreds of dollars each year at the pump and make our environment healthier for our communities and future generations,\" said Darrien Davis, government affairs advocate on climate change and clean energy for the group.\n\n\"Slashing fuel economy standards will increase costs for drivers and threaten the progress made in reducing dangerous air pollution and preventing adverse health outcomes for children, older adults and communities who live near busy roads,\" he said.\n\nA reversal of Biden's policy\n\nThe proposal, if it is finalized in the months to come as expected, abandons standards put in place under the Biden administration about 18 months ago. The Biden administration had said those standards would save some 70 billion gallons of gasoline through 2050, save Americans more than $23 billion in fuel costs, and prevent more than 710 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, if they remained in place.\n\nThe announcement by Trump, meanwhile, continues his aggressive effort to unwind tougher mile-per-gallon standards for the U.S. fleet of cars and trucks that stretch back to 2011 and former President Barack Obama's first term.\n\nThose standards − which Trump moved to freeze in place during his first term as president and which Biden tried to pump up significantly in an effort to encourage the production and sale of zero-emission electric vehicles, or EVs − have become a political football, rising or retreating with each successive presidential administration.\n\nIn turn, those changes have scrambled automakers' multibillion-dollar plans to try to meet them with new models and set off lawsuits by environmentalists, consumers and the states.\n\nThe latest round, which began after Trump took office in January of this year after campaigning vigorously on a promise to drop Biden's \"EV mandate,\" is expected to be no different.\n\nIn June 2024 during Biden's administration, NHTSA finalized its most recent rule under the law passed by Congress 50 years ago that requires it to set average fuel economy, or mile-per-gallon standards, at the \"maximum feasible level.\" That rule called for a fleetwide U.S. average across all new light-duty cars and trucks sold to be 47.3 mpg for model year 2027, rising to 50.4 mpg in model year 2031.\n\nSignificantly, that rule by the Biden administration was developed concurrently with one previously finalized by the EPA in March 2024 under the Clean Air Act that called for two-thirds of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2032 to emit no greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, effectively requiring a steep increase in the number of EVs produced and sold.\n\nTrump's campaign promise\n\nOn the campaign trail especially in Michigan and other Midwestern swing states, Trump used the threat of that \"EV mandate\" to great effect, telling voters − and UAW members − that it would end in American auto companies losing business and jobs to Chinese producers better able to make and sell EVs and forcing consumers to buy vehicles they did not want at a higher upfront cost.\n\nOnce in office, Trump immediately followed through on his promise to roll back the so-called mandate, signing an executive order reversing an earlier one signed by Biden promoting EV adoption. In March of this year, new EPA director Lee Zeldin said the earlier Clean Air Act rule would be reconsidered, and Trump in June signed a congressional resolution reversing a waiver to California and other states to enact tougher standards on vehicle emissions, which is provided for in the Clean Air Act and is being challenged in court.\n\nIn passing a wide-ranging measure of tax and spending reductions, Trump and the Republican Congress also followed through on getting rid of a tax credit that encouraged the sale of American-assembled EVs by Sept. 30 of this year; it also dropped the penalties for automakers violating fuel standards under the law to zero, effectively making − for now − Trump's own proposed standards without any teeth, enforcement-wise.\n\nDuffy, Trump's transportation secretary, also said NHTSA would reconsider the fuel economy standards immediately after Trump took office in January and, in June, his department issued an interpretive rule \"of the factors the agency is prohibited by law from considering when setting maximum feasible fuel economy standards\" for vehicles of all kinds, saying that included any reliance on \"non-gas-powered\" cars and trucks, meaning EVs. It was the inclusion of EVs, however, which allowed for higher mpg standards to be set across the fleetwide average, since they use significantly less, if any, gasoline.\n\nAs proposed by NHTSA, the new rules would also make other changes to the ways in which fuel economy standards are set and enforced, including by getting rid of rules that allow automakers to bank and trade compliance credits. Duffy, speaking at the White House, said the old rules were based on a \"lie.\"\n\n\"These CAFE standards used (factors) which were contrary to the law,\" Duffy said, developing a standard \"which the car companies will take you was completely unattainable.\"\n\n\"All the nonsense is being taken out of the cars,\" added Trump.\n\nStaff reporters Liam Rappleye and Jackie Charniga contributed.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

Gretchen Whitmer. Ford spokesman Mark Truby acknowledged the company's cuts also almost certainly mean the state will reduce the roughly $1.8 billion promised in taxpayer subsidies for the megadevelopment.\n\n\"We've been studying this project for the past couple of months. I think we're all aware EV adoption is growing, and we expect that to continue, actually. But it's not growing at the pace that I think ourselves and the industry had expected,\" Truby said.\n\n\"We want to be really disciplined about how we allocate capital and think about matching production and future capacity based on demand.\"\n\nTruby said Ford originally anticipated the facility would produce 35 gigawatt hours worth of batteries annually, enough to equip about 400,000 vehicles. Now, the company expects the plant will be at 20 gigawatt hours, representing a roughly 42% reduction in output — approximately enough batteries for 230,000 vehicles.\n\nWhile Truby would not say exactly how much it planned to cut from the $3.5 billion investment, he did say it correlated with the cut in output. At 42%, that would mean cutting almost $1.5 billion, shifting the total investment to $2 billion.\n\nThe company also intends to use less space at the site, which currently comprises hundreds of acres just west of Marshall, a small town that's about 35 miles east of Kalamazoo.\n\nRepresentatives for Whitmer and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the state entity that oversees incentives for this deal and other megasites, focused on the fact Ford still plans to invest at the site and not on the cuts.\n\nAsked later Tuesday about possible changes to the Ford incentive package, Whitmer said some should be expected.\n\n\"As Ford has had to make some changes, we’ve had (a) very clear, open line of communication and the state’s role will change as well, right? When one aspect gets re-sized so does the other. I won’t get ahead of MEDC, they’re doing their work, but that wouldn’t be a surprising outcome,\" Whitmer said, when asked about the Ford incentives after an event in Livonia.\n\nMEDC spokesman Otie McKinley said incentives for the project \"will certainly be revised in accordance to the new investment parameters.\"\n\nAt this point, McKinley anticipated Ford and the MEDC will come together to get a proposal on a reduced subsidy package that could be presented to the Michigan Strategic Fund board, an entity that authorizes incentives. It's still unclear whether any changes will ultimately require legislative action.\n\nMichigan House Republican Leader Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, suggested lawmakers could push to nix proponents of the subsidies altogether.\n\n\"If the original proposal misrepresented Ford’s plans, the hundreds of millions of dollars tied to job creation should be revoked under the contract. The governor must right-size state funding and ensure taxpayers aren’t left on the hook for her failure,\" Hall said in statement Tuesday.\n\nMcKinley confirmed while Ford and the state had the framework for a deal, they never executed a final agreement for the project. Such agreements take months, if not more than a year, to finalize.\n\nIn late September and amid the UAW strike, Ford caught some policymakers and industry observers off guard when it announced \"pausing work and limiting spending on construction\" at the Marshall-area plant. Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said at the time the company's work would not recommence \"until we’re confident about our ability to competitively operate the plant.\"\n\nThat did not stop large contractor Walbridge from continuing site preparation; it received a contract worth up to $178 million to ensure the infrastructure is ready for Ford.\n\nJim Durian, head of the Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance, a local entity working with MEDC on the site, said in a statement during Ford's pause that site work continued on roads, wastewater systems and other utilities.\n\n\"We are pleased to see Ford resume work to build the BlueOval facility that will create 1,700 local jobs,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Truby explained what led Ford to formally resume its own work at the site.\n\n\"We're making some strategic decisions, and this would be just another one of those where we're moving forward. But we're trying to kind of right-size the investment and the footprint,\" Truby said, referencing a previously announced delay in investing $12 billion toward EV production.\n\n\"There were a number of factors. Obviously, it helps to have some certainty around, you know, we're no longer in a strike situation and we understand what our labor costs are going to be, by and large.\"\n\nThe project is a key piece in a larger policy championed by Whitmer and state economic development officials. They argue using hundreds of millions in public tax dollars to subsidize such megadeals will ultimately result in revitalizing communities and jump-starting industries key to Michigan's future.\n\nWhile some local residents champion the site, others are aggressively campaigning against it. Many local residents oppose what they consider a lack of transparency around the project, while others have concerns about possible environmental impacts.\n\nSome attack Ford's partnership with CATL, a Chinese company and the world's largest battery manufacturer, at the site. They suggest, without evidence, that there is a nefarious connection between CATL and the Chinese government.\n\nTruby confirmed Ford still intends to work with CATL at the site, noting the 1,700 promised jobs will all be positions with Ford.\n\nReporter Clara Hendrickson contributed to this report.\n\nContact Dave Boucher: dboucher@freepress.com and on X, previously called Twitter, @Dave_Boucher1.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2023/10/09/detroit-automakers-biden-petroleum-equivalency-factor-face-civil-penalties/71082599007/", "title": "Detroit automakers: Biden rule change could cost them billions", "text": "Updated Oct. 9, 2023, 4:39 p.m. ET\n\nAn auto industry trade group wants the Energy Department to back off a regulatory change it says runs counter to the Biden administration's goal of transitioning to electric vehicles and having them built in the U.S., noting it could cost the Detroit Three automakers billions more in fines compared with other manufacturers.\n\nThe American Automotive Policy Council, which is based in Washington and represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, sent a letter to Energy Department officials last week, saying the proposed change — to drastically scale back the effect of what is known as the petroleum equivalency factor, or PEF — will have significant consequences to the U.S. automakers' bottom lines at a time when they are investing in new electric vehicles.\n\n\"The D3 (Detroit Three) have announced tens of billions of dollars of combined investments to transition their assembly operation and develop new battery operations in the United States. These investment announcements were made as early as 2019 with a specific understanding (of the current rules remaining in place),\" wrote the policy council's head, former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt.\n\nIn his letter, Blunt noted that the Detroit Three automakers could face more than $10 billion in fines under the change between 2027 and 2032, compared with about $3 billion for all other automakers combined, when looked at in tandem with stronger mile-per-gallon standards — otherwise known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE standards — under consideration by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\n\n\"(The department's) deliberative action on the PEF will require the (automakers) to pay needless CAFE civil penalties, hurting American competitiveness,\" Blunt wrote in the Sept. 29 letter.\n\nEnvironmental groups, which pushed to have the standards toughened, are clamoring against the Biden administration backing off, saying automakers have plenty of tools to keep penalties down — especially with the bulk of those potential fines not likely to come until later this decade and into the next.\n\nThe question regarding the Energy Department's proposed change and the impact it and the standards proposed by the Biden administration — which it says could result in two-thirds of all new cars being sold being electric vehicles, compared with just 6% in 2022 — could have on U.S. automakers comes at a fraught time.\n\nThe UAW is on strike against the Detroit Three automakers, in part because of worries about jobs that could be lost during the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and many Republican politicians, including former President Donald Trump, are criticizing the plans to transition the industry, saying consumers don't want the EVs and they are too expensive. There have also been complaints about American automakers joining forces with China-connected companies to use their battery technology or tap supply chains.\n\nReuters first reported on the AAPC's letter this week, noting the change in the PEF could cost GM $6.5 billion, Stellantis $3 billion and Ford about $1 billion. But those charges were first specifically referenced by NHTSA in July in materials supporting its proposal to hike fuel efficiency in cars and trucks significantly, beginning with model year 2027. Along with the EPA's proposed rules for auto emissions, the regulatory changes are widely seen as promoting, if not virtually requiring, automakers to transition to selling many more electric vehicles than at present.\n\nIn its proposal this summer, NHTSA noted that there could be significant compliance costs for some automakers, saying, \"While some of this change may be due to increasing standards, the updated PEF value also has notable effects on manufacturers’ computed compliance levels.\"\n\nU.S. automakers, while investing billions in new battery and EV plants, have argued that the Biden administration's goals may be too ambitious and, they say, that is also true in the proposed PEF change. In the letter, Blunt argued that change actually works in favor of other automakers that have been slow to embrace plug-in EVs instead of protecting American companies.\n\nBlunt's letter also comes at a time when the Energy Department is considering whether it should delay implementation of the new PEF — which is set to go into effect in 2027 — because of automaker concerns that doesn't give them enough time to react with new product lines to avoid larger fines.\n\nLast spring, the Energy Department said it would significantly reduce the PEF in response to a petition filed by two environmental groups, the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Sierra Club.\n\nThe PEF is a value, required to be determined by law, that attempts to measure the energy use by EVs, converted to what that same energy amount would be in terms of petroleum. Then, that factor is used, when looking across an automaker's fleet of vehicles, to determine whether they are meeting required fleet-wide mile-per-gallon standards. Automakers are fined for not hitting the target, though the total penalties paid by all automakers combined over the last half-century has been about $1.5 billion.\n\nThe NRDC and Sierra Club successfully argued, however, that the current PEF gives automakers' EVs too much credit, meaning \"that a relatively small number of EVs (could) mathematically guarantee compliance without meaningful improvements in the real-world average fuel economy of automakers' overall fleets.\"\n\nLast spring, just as the EPA was rolling out new stricter car and truck emission standards, the Energy Department agreed with the environmental groups, saying, \"This runs counter to the need of the nation to conserve energy, particularly petroleum.\"\n\nBut this, Blunt said, also runs counter to the American automakers' strategy, endorsed by the Biden administration and funded in part by billions in subsidies and investments to make and sell more EVs. He said that strategy counts on a more generous PEF to balance out the number of internal combustion engine trucks those automakers still sell — which are far more than those of foreign automakers but which also consume far more petroleum.\n\nNHTSA is already planning to hike truck mile-per-gallon standards by about 4% a year, about twice as fast as car standards beginning in 2027. The PEF change, automakers say, will create \"a hole,\" where the Detroit Three's fleet-wide mile-per-gallon average for trucks will only be about 45 mpg by 2032 — well under the federal mpg target — compared with 61 mpg, well over the target, with the current PEF.\n\nCars, on the other hand, wouldn't be as impacted by the PEF changes, with the Detroit Three's fleet-wide average being about 65 mpg in 2032 compared with a target of 66 mpg. But those are a much smaller segment of U.S. automakers' sales.\n\n\"The truck fleet contains more than just pickup trucks,\" Blunt wrote. \"It also includes family vehicles such as SUVs, crossovers, and minivans. These family vehicles are 68% of the U.S. market. Moreover ... 83% of the vehicles produced by the (Detroit automakers) are included in the 'truck fleet.' \" NHTSA has already estimated that the Detroit automakers' per-vehicle cost of complying with the new standards, in terms of technological costs and fines, is expected to be $2,151, compared with $546 for other automakers.\n\nAutomakers want the Energy Department to delay any change to the PEF for now, arguing that it will only serve to drain investment in EV technology and reward other automakers like Toyota who have embraced hybrids, which have high mile-per-gallon capabilities but still use petroleum.\n\nPete Huffman, a lawyer with the NRDC, said the automakers are being disingenuous with their argument. He said NHTSA's figures for compliance costs are based largely on what regulators calculate will be the EV products of each brand in model year 2027 and extrapolated out to 2032. But American automakers, he added, have already said they plan to introduce many more EV models than those calculated by NHTSA, meaning they shouldn't face those fines.\n\n\"They're going to have a lot more EVs,\" he said. \"In those more realistic scenarios, nobody pays any significant fines.\"\n\nHe also said environmental groups oppose any effort to delay the new PEF from going into effect, given that the current one has been in place since 2000, when current EV technology was in its infancy.\n\n\"It's basically a windfall they've been getting for a very long time,\" he said.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

But sweeping reductions to projects ballyhooed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and many others create new questions for the future of the state's auto industry and the business subsidies program designed to spur growth.\n\n\"We want people to trust us, we need people to trust us. We try to bring all the information we can forward to the (Michigan Strategic Fund) board,\" Christin Armstrong, a senior vice president with the Michigan Economic Development Corp., said in an interview on Monday.\n\n\"We come with good intentions … what we are presenting to the board is the best project we can put together based on on the info and circumstances and conditions in that moment.\"\n\nThe state and Ford agreed Tuesday to substantially cut a proposed $825 million in tax credits for an immense new EV battery factory planned for outside Marshall, reducing that to just shy of $225 million. They're also slashing $69 million from a public grant for the project.\n\nBoth mirror moves Ford announced last year to shrink its own investment and jobs at the site. However, Ford said Tuesday the facility is \"more than 20% complete\" and the company is still on pace to begin production in 2026.\n\nThe jobs at the Ford Marshall site also are expected to pay higher wages than initially proposed with an increase to $25 from $20 an hour for the starting wage and an increase from $21.70 to $25.50 for the average wage.\n\nOn a separate Ford project, the state and company are nixing the entire $100.8 million grant, intended to help create more than 3,000 jobs and spur up to $2 billion in investment in Michigan at several Ford sites.\n\n“We are nimbly adjusting our manufacturing operations to match evolving customer demand and the Michigan Strategic Fund board is revising its incentive offers accordingly,\" Tony Reinhart, Ford's director of state and local government affairs, said in a statement.\n\nOfficials with the Michigan Economic Development Corp., the quasi-public agency that oversees corporate subsidies for the state, told the Free Press on Monday the moves reflect the changing nature of the EV market.\n\nJosh Hundt, senior project marketing adviser with MEDC, stressed that these situations highlight why the state has protections for public subsidies. Ford never received any of the $100 million promised for one project, and the largest chunk of public money at the Marshall site came via a tax rebate that could only be realized once the plant is operational.\n\n\"These projects are still growth opportunities for Ford,\" he told the Free Press.\n\nIt's unclear how much public money those opportunities will ultimately require.\n\nThe Mackinac deal that never happened\n\nIn June 2022, Whitmer joined Ford executives and Michigan state lawmakers to announce more than 3,000 jobs and a $1.1 billion investment at five existing Ford factories. At the time, the governor and Ford leaders presented the project as a done deal.\n\n\"Ford is investing, they are making strategic decisions about the future of mobility, they're leading the way. We've got to compete with the rest of the world to earn their investment here in Michigan. And we won,\" Whitmer said at the Mackinac Policy Conference on Mackinac Island. \"This is a big win for Michigan. Ford is going to continue to make these investments and when they invest in Michigan, it's good for every one of us.\"\n\nWhitmer previously took credit for these announced jobs, labeling them as new auto jobs created since she took office. But as Tuesday's adjustments show, companies can reduce the number of jobs promised at any moment.\n\nAs part of the original proposal, Ford agreed to invest specific dollar amounts and create a certain number of jobs at each site. Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn was promised the most jobs, more than 1,500, and $450 million invested.\n\nHowever, earlier this year Ford announced it would shift most of the 2,100 employees at the plant. The plan required moving 700 employees from the location that builds the highly touted Ford F-150 Lightning to the Michigan Assembly Plant. Another 700 would either go to other sites or take a retirement buyout.\n\nFord was supposed to invest all of the money by June 30, 2024, and create the jobs by June 2025, according to the MEDC project memo created at the time. The deal never really got off the ground though, state and Ford officials now say.\n\nBefore Tuesday, the Free Press asked Ford and MEDC repeatedly whether the company met its investment deadline. Late last week, an MEDC spokesman acknowledged Ford had not received any public funding through the project, but did not say how much money Ford invested or jobs the company created.\n\nIn a memo to the Michigan Strategic Fund board, the state indicates Ford invested all the money and created all the jobs it promised. However, the company did not create the promised number of jobs at each specific site, the memo states.\n\nIt's unclear why Ford would forgo the entire $100 million if it created the number of jobs and invested the amount of money it argued necessitated the public subsidy in the first place.\n\nFord spokeswoman Jessica Enoch noted the company will still receive separate tax incentives.\n\n\"The revised offer is proportionate to our revised investment and footprint,\" Enoch said.\n\nShe also noted recent company sales numbers showing Ford's EV sales are up 72% for the year.\n\nResizing in Marshall\n\nFord previously acknowledged in late November it would scale back its commitment in Marshall, a site called the BlueOval Battery Michigan site. At the time, the company said it would invest $1 billion less in Marshall, with a corresponding cut in 800 promised jobs and the plant's production capacity by roughly 40%.\n\nState economic development officials said they would trim public funding accordingly, but did not reveal the extent of those cuts until a meeting Tuesday of the Michigan Strategic Fund.\n\nUnder the new terms, Ford could receive a $141 million grant if it invests $2.5 billion and creates 1,700 \"qualified jobs.\" The company, however, could still receive additional funding for more jobs: up to $166 million for 2,100 jobs and a $3 billion investment by the company.\n\nIn either case, it’s a significant cut to the initially promised $210 million grant for 2,500 jobs and a $3.5 billion investment.\n\nThe project remains controversial in the local community. While the local economic development agency is a steadfast supporter — and continues to serve as a pass-through for public funding — some residents oppose the new factory. Their reasons vary, from desires to keep the area pastoral to political conspiracies, but this opposition continues to prompt legal fights in the community.\n\nThose fights have not stalled work at the site. Crews continue to develop the basic structure necessary for the large facility, while working on a separate but related component designed for other related businesses.\n\n“BlueOval Battery Park Michigan will play an important role in our plan to help make electric vehicles more accessible and affordable by producing low-cost LFP batteries in the U.S. and not relying on imports,” said Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of electric vehicle programs and energy supply chain, in a statement.\n\nFord deals highlight shifting politics of economic development\n\nThe EV projects scaled back by Ford were initially unveiled at events featuring Michigan political leaders headlined by Whitmer, who has celebrated the jobs promised by the automaker as part of a broader manufacturing renaissance in the state.\n\nBut the projects have also underscored the evolving politics of economic development in Michigan and the shifting coalition for Whitmer's broader strategy.\n\nWhen Ford announced several EV investments in southeast Michigan in 2022, legislative leaders from both political parties joined Whitmer to celebrate. Democratic and Republican lawmakers had just come together to quickly shepherd a new massive corporate subsidy program after Ford chose Kentucky and Tennessee over Michigan to locate new EV-related plants. When Ford subsequently announced the new EV jobs coming to Michigan, lawmakers from both parties swiftly approved the subsidy for Ford.\n\nBut Ford's BlueOval project encountered resistance in Lansing.\n\nRepublicans largely opposed public funding for the project with Minority Leader Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, describing it as a bad deal for Michigan given the public costs associated with it. He has also routinely said the jobs Michigan has subsidized aren't good-paying jobs, in contrast to Whitmer.\n\nOn the Democratic side, state Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City — a vocal opponent of corporate subsidies — emerged as the lone Democratic vote against the deal, opposing a spending bill allocating nearly $630 million to support the project. But behind closed doors, other Democrats also expressed discomfort with the spending.\n\nShortly after taking power in Lansing following an era of GOP control, Democrats vowed to make changes to Michigan's economic development policies.\n\nThe latest plan from Democrats would extend funding for Michigan's largest corporate subsidy program — set to expire next year — for another decade while adding new transit, housing and community investments to the mix.\n\nThe bills were put on the voting agenda before lawmakers left for their summer break. They never took it up amid opposition from some Democratic and GOP lawmakers that thwarted its chances. Lawmakers could still amend the legislation or broker deals to garner enough support for the package to send it to Whitmer’s desk later this year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/ford/2022/03/14/ford-electric-vehicle-production-europe/7032348001/", "title": "Ford EV battle plan for Europe includes new vehicles, partnerships", "text": "Updated March 14, 2022, 6:53 p.m. ET\n\nFord Motor Co. plans to dramatically expand its electric vehicle investment in Europe even while global markets are rocked by Russia's attacks in Ukraine, a leading supplier of neon that's needed to make semiconductor chips.\n\nThe chip shortage has paralyzed auto manufacturing globally and Ford specifically.\n\nEven so, the Dearborn automaker is powering forward with plans to challenge competitors including Tesla in the all-electric vehicle market.\n\nFord revealed Monday morning during a live webcast from Germany new elements of its strategy to become a key player in all-electric vehicle production: new vehicles, new production sites, new partnerships and new timelines.\n\n\"Ford Blue will build out our iconic portfolio of vehicles with internal combustion engines and deliver global scale excellence in engineering, manufacturing and supply chain.

The infrastructure in Norway, along with public policies designed to protect air quality, fully supports all-electric vehicles. Drivers there have been at more than 50% electric for more than six years. Buyers there immediately embraced the Mustang Mach-E.\n\nPuma stays, EcoSport goes\n\nStarting in 2023, Ford will begin building a five-seat medium-size all-electric crossover at the Ford Cologne Electrification Centre with a 311-mile range on a single charge — with a second electric vehicle coming in 2024.\n\nFord and VW, while still competitors, established a limited partnership in 2019 to save money and achieve electric vehicle scale.\n\nRowley also promised an all-electric Ford Puma crossover to be built in Craiova, Romania, starting in 2024.\n\n\"More than 130,000 Pumas were sold in Europe last year, making it the bestselling passenger vehicle across the region,\" he said. \"We have decided that production of EcoSport will come to an end later this year.\"\n\nThese latest announcements come on the heels of Ford announcing a plan to restructure the 118-year-old company into three units.\n\n\"Here in Europe we're forging a fast and accelerated path to an all-electric future,\" Rowley said, with an all-electric portfolio of passenger vehicles by 2030 within Ford Model e and only zero-emission commercial vehicles within Ford Pro by 2035 in Europe.\n\nFord is counting partnerships and joint ventures to leverage its strength in a highly competitive landscape. Last year, Ford announced a multibillion-dollar investment in plants to produce parts for electric vehicles in Tennessee and Kentucky.\n\nFrom Kentucky to Romania\n\nThese new announcements in Europe build on that effort, Rowley said.\n\n\"We are reimagining the Ford brand in Europe by going from two electric vehicles today to nine all-electric vehicles by 2024. More adventurous, more versatile, more connected than ever, these vehicles are built to meet the mobility needs of a modern Europe that is leading the fight against climate change,\" Rowley said. \"It directly aligns with Ford's commitment to build a future where freedom of movement goes hand in hand with looking after our planet and each other.\"\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard at313-618-1034orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

Ford's plan, however, reflects months of strategy planning to match output with demand, Ford spokesman Marty Gunsberg said in a statement. He declined to provide additional comment or explanation.\n\nA memo recently sent from Ford to a supplier outlined a plan to go from a weekly run rate of about 3,200 trucks to about 1,600 trucks, starting in January, according to Automotive News, which obtained the memo and first reported the cuts.\n\nYet Ford executives have foreshadowed change in recent months.\n\n\"We feel very good right now. But the future is somewhat unpredictable and volatile. We'll have to see how the market plays out. We're seeing competition increase,\" Marin Gjaja, chief customer officer for Ford Model e, told reporters on Aug. 1. \"We're going to have to adjust with the market. ... We look at the U.S. and EVs are growing 40% or more on volume year on year for the automotive industry. That's incredible growth.\"\n\nHis remarks followed a six-week shutdown to expand production capabilities at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn as the company was seeing a reported dip in demand for EVs industrywide.\n\nFord builds the bestselling truck in America with the F-Series vehicles and has acknowledged that electric vehicle production will take a number of years to be profitable. Gas-powered vehicles offset billions in EV costs and generate profits for the automaker.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has reported growing demand for hybrid trucks among consumers hesitant to switch to all-battery vehicles. In July, when Ford teased its 2024 F-150 pickup, CEO Jim Farley said the company planned to continue its commitment to gas-powered pickups and focus on hybrids.\n\nAt the time, Farley dialed back the Ford forecast to produce 600,000 electric vehicles annually by 2024, not 2023.\n\nFord sees consumers buying hybrids instead\n\nFord spotlighted hybrids, which increase fuel efficiency for truck owners while allowing them to go to the gas pump in times of need rather than find a charging station to plug in. As automakers figure out how many EVs to build, and what prices will work, Ford says it will work to tiptoe consumers away from internal combustion engines into electrification.\n\n\"We believe demand for our internal combustion and our hybrid portfolio will be ... potentially longer and richer than most expected,\" Farley said in July. \"We made sure Ford is profitable as we move through this ICE-to-EV transition.\"\n\nF-150 not alone\n\nThe landscape for Ford and other automakers has changed dramatically.\n\nFord revealed the Lightning in May 2021. By August 2021, Ford announced plans to double production to meet customer demand. In early 2022, the company shut down its reservation system to manage the overwhelming response. In the summer of 2023, Ford revealed plans to shift hundreds of workers from its Dearborn Truck Plant building gas-powered F-150s over to the Lightning plant.\n\nFord isn't the only Detroit automaker making adjustments to reflect the changing landscape. General Motors has launched its all-electric Chevrolet Silverado in small numbers this year. GM revealed its plans for the Silverado in 2021. In October, GM revealed it would delay significantly expanded production of its all-electric Silverado and GMC Sierra to late 2025.\n\nCybertruck takes all the oxygen out of the room\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is dominating headlines and social media with its new Cybertruck.\n\nYet many analysts don't see significant overlap with traditional pickup buyers.\n\n\"While the recent news about the Cybertruck may seem to have influenced Ford’s plans for the Lightning, the two announcements are coincidental,\" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, told the Detroit Free Press. \"Few Cybertruck buyers are cross-shopping the Lightning since they’re targeting different crowds. Ford is responding to slowing growth in the EV market while the Cybertruck has only to fill the demand for Tesla buyers looking for something unique.\"\n\nTesla posted on X that the company was \"making sci-fi a reality\" in announcing its upcoming deliveries.\n\nJohn McElroy, host of \"Autoline After Hours\" webcast and podcast, said the Cybertruck can't be compared to the more traditional F-150 Lightning.\n\n\"Ford has got to react to the realities in the marketplace. It probably overshot what it thought it was going to be able to sell when the EV euphoria was going on last year,\" he said. \"I don't see Cybertruck so much as a threat to Lightning as a threat to the automotive industry. (The Cybertruck) is such a revolutionary truck in so many ways — design, engineering, manufacturing. It represents a new way of doing vehicles in the automotive business.\"\n\nUsing stainless steel panels eliminates use of a stamping shop and a paint shop for assembly, McElroy noted, \"which, by the way, can easily be a $300 million to $500 million investment.\"\n\nMassively reducing capital investment allows the break-even point to further come down while competitors struggle with more traditional production approaches.\n\n\"The list goes on and on,\" McElroy said. \"It helps remind Ford just how far behind it is. Ford is actively working to catch up.\"\n\nCatching up before 2028 is unlikely based on all that's required to design and build vehicles, he said.\n\nFord executives have said they're currently identifying ways to cut production costs of the Lightning and Mustang Mach-E to be more competitive. Doug Field, formerly of Apple and Tesla, is now at Ford.\n\nAutomakers are asking the Biden administration to ease up on new regulatory changes that could cost Detroit automakers billions as they work to transition to electric vehicles.\n\n\"EVs are not catching on — not as hot as they thought they would be just a year ago,\" McElroy said.\n\nFord F-150 Hybrid can recharge all-electric vehicles in an emergency\n\nTexas man uses new 2021 Ford F-150 to heat home, power appliances during blackout\n\nTesla investor wants Ford to succeed\n\nTesla investor Sawyer Merritt posted to his 587,700 followers on X, formerly known as Twitter, \"A part of me is sad about this news cuz (in my opinion) the more EVs on the road the better. Yes this will probably help Tesla to some degree, but Ford selling as many F-150 Lightings instead of ICE F-150s is important to the transition to a sustainable energy future.\"\n\nFord Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said last month that Ford is \"not not moving forward\" on electric plans but just matching capacity with demand. The company is changing tactics in how to execute its strategy, he said.\n\nBeing out front on hybrid production, specifically with the F-150, is generating significant revenues that will help Ford generate profits to pay for the ongoing transition to electric vehicles, Lawler said.\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-618-1034 or phoward@freepress.com.

But for Main Street, it might mean more job cuts and higher new car prices.\n\nIndustry analysts expect President-elect Donald Trump to make several policy changes that would likely chip away at EV adoption, thereby forcing GM to reevaluate its business model, which right now is to offer an all-electric lineup by 2035. Last Wednesday, GM CFO Paul Jacobson told investors the automaker plans to stay the course regardless of any changes to federal regulations. He said GM's business model is insulated to protect against market swings.\n\nExperts concur that GM must stay the course on EVs because it is so financially committed to the program, but they also say GM will be forced to adjust its vehicle production mix, make additional job cuts or do both to remain financially sound.\n\nOn Nov. 15, the Free Press reported that GM let go of 1,000 employees — mostly salaried but some hourly workers — across its global operations, and it will no longer use its Yuma Desert Proving Ground in Arizona. This was the second round of job cuts within a matter of months. In August, GM eliminated nearly 1,500 from its software division globally.\n\nNow GM and other automakers face the likelihood of Trump removing the $7,500 federal tax credit offered on the purchase or lease of an EV. That tax credit has been instrumental in helping GM — and its crosstown rivals — sell EVs. With it gone, demand for EVs, already lagging earlier projections, is expected to drop, experts said, forcing automakers to adjust.\n\n\"In the eyes of Wall Street, this is bullish because Wall Street wants them to focus on their cash cow: Internal combustion engine vehicles, with some hybrids, and then sprinkle in some EVs,\" Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said of GM. \"But for the business, there’s going to be tough times ahead in terms of more job cuts or reallocation of resources because they’ve bet so heavily on EVs that, with no tax credit, the demand curve for EVs is going to change.\"\n\nGM's proactive cost cutting\n\nIves said a drop in EV demand will even impact future negotiations between GM and the UAW \"because they thought EVs would be the gold at the end of the rainbow and now it could be silver and bronze.\"\n\nGM has been investing $35 billion in EVs from 2020 through 2025 and it is just starting to roll out a broader lineup of the vehicles on its new Ultium propulsion system. Besides the luxury Cadillac EVs, GM also now offers the more affordable Chevrolet Equinox EV and will offer a new Chevrolet Bolt EV in 2025. The front-wheel drive Equinox EV 2LT models arrived in dealerships earlier this year and started at $41,900 — $34,400 after subtracting the tax credit, which can be credited to the dealer at the time of purchase or claimed as an individual credit when the buyer files taxes.\n\nAfter some rough launches in recent years of the Cadillac Lyriq and the Chevrolet Blazer EV, GM is finally gaining sales momentum on its EVs. Its share of the EV market is approaching 10%, and it became the No. 2 seller of EVs in the U.S. in the third quarter, behind Tesla. CEO Elon Musk, a Trump adviser, has said Tesla is likely to be helped in the long run by elimination of the credit.\n\nBut with the high cost of raw materials and lithium-ion batteries, which power EVs, the vehicles are not profitable for automakers other than Tesla. GM has been promising Wall Street it will get its EVs to a variable profitable position — meaning the revenue GM earns from selling the vehicle exceeds the direct cost of producing it — by year-end. Jacobson said last week the company remains on track to achieve that.\n\nLast year, GM said it would add plug-in hybrid technology to certain models in North America and deliver them to market in 2027. GM President Mark Reuss reiterated that timing last month during Investor Day, saying that gasoline vehicles will continue to be popular and regulations will likely continue to toughen, so the hybrid technology coming at that time will help GM hit higher federal emissions standards.\n\nIves said GM's actions to date, including the 1,000 job cuts earlier this month, sits well with Wall Street.\n\n\"GM is listening to what investors want. They want them to proactively cut costs and be ahead of everything, and it’s also why the stock is up 50% in less than half a year,\" Ives said. \"The job cuts are a shot across the bow to the broader strategy that (CEO) Mary (Barra) and (CFO) Paul (Jacobson) are driving. The typical perception of GM is, wait to reactively cut costs. It’s a new era.\"\n\nTo prove Wall Street's glee, Ives said, in theory GM's stock price should be down right now based on the incoming Trump agenda, but it keeps rising. On Aug. 5, GM's stock closed at a low of $39.95. On Friday, it closed at $58.53.\n\nThe real question: What is GM's wherewithal to endure?\n\nDavid Whiston, autos analyst with Morningstar, agrees with Ives that more job cuts at GM are coming.\n\n\"There’s so much pressure to minimize cost, so anytime they can find a way to get by with fewer salaried people I think they will do it,\" Whiston said. \"Hard to know from the outside though as to when you start cutting into bone, so to speak.\"\n\nHe said GM must keep working to bring down the costs of lithium-ion batteries because affordability is the key.\n\n\"Best thing GM can do is work on making EVs so affordable to make and for consumers to buy, that it can sell lots of them regardless of the rules,\" Whiston said.\n\nKevin Mixer, senior director analyst for automotive manufacturing at Gartner, agreed that keeping both gasoline and electric vehicles affordable will be critical for GM to compete. But GM will have to continue its path to cutting $2 billion in costs by next year. Mixer said there are other ways to get there beyond job cuts.\n\n\"Long term, you don’t change your plan,\" Mixer said of GM continuing to an all-electric future. \"Short term, you have to adjust as to what comes out of the portfolio, or what gets slowed or what gets stopped. It’s a portfolio adjustment. I’m curious to see what is the wherewithal to endure some tough quarters ahead, because that’s really the question at hand.\"\n\nIndeed, GM faces many challenges. It must restructure its business in China, where it's lost about $347 million in equity income through the first three quarters this year; it must meet tough federal emissions standards here; and faces a possibility that Trump will raise tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. All three Detroit automakers build various vehicles in Mexico that are sold here.\n\n\"So the first quarter will be very telling because it’ll echo what we see in Q4 and set the stage for 2025,\" Mixer said.\n\nGM and Ford talk about their plans amid uncertainty\n\nJacobson told investors last week at Barclays Global Automotive and Mobility Tech Conference in New York that GM will not change its business strategy on EVs, noting that whatever Trump decides to do with the tax credit or other regulations is still speculation.\n\n\"We’ve been pretty consistent that we’re not looking to next quarter, next year, et cetera. We’re thinking about this in a much longer time horizon,\" Jacobson said. \"I think many of the things we’re doing today will continue irrespective of what happens with the regulations.\"\n\nHe said the automaker has learned to stop having a \"knee-jerk reaction\" to market shifts and instead takes a conservative and consistent approach to ups and downs. He also said GM will continue to work with a Trump administration on regulations.\n\nAsked to comment for this article about GM's approach to its business as the Trump administration enters the White House, GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said, \"We all want the same things: a strong domestic auto sector, providing good jobs for hard-working Americans, and keeping the U.S. competitive globally.\"\n\nLast week, Ford Motor's CFO John Lawler told investors the company is reviewing its strategy amid the uncertainty as a new administration heads to Washington, D.C., according to a research note from Bank of America's John Murphy.\n\n\"Ford doesn't currently plan to change its product strategy as there is still uncertainty on how things will play out from a policy standpoint, but it is prepared to pivot given its flexibility across powertrains,\" Murphy wrote. \"On that note, Ford is continuing to invest in EVs, though it has announced a 35% cut in EV (capital expenditure).\"\n\nMurphy said EV prices are likely to decline next year as competition rises due to new EV nameplates entering the market. But, if the $7,500 EV credit is removed, EV prices for the consumer will go up, which could drive EV sales down. He noted that Ford's \"Skunkworks\" EVs are expected to be profitable and cost-competitive with Chinese EVs potentially produced in Mexico.\n\nSkunkworks refers to a team of \"top-secret, high-powered\" engineers Ford created a couple years ago to develop profitable and affordable EVs to compete with Tesla and the Chinese, according to CNN. Tesla is planning a compact crossover that’s targeted to cost $25,000, Reuters reported. Trump has promised steep tariffs on any Chinese-built EVs to keep them out of the U.S. market.\n\nThe cost of compliance\n\nTrump is expected to drastically scale back the new corporate average fuel economy target of 55 mpg for model year 2026 vehicles. The target is tough for all automakers to hit. Missing it could result in sky-high fines, analysts said.\n\nIves expects Trump to do this in first half of 2025 and said \"with the regulatory defanged, that’s bullish for the Detroit Three.\"\n\nWhiston agreed, saying the emissions fines are complicated, but they can potentially be massive depending on how many vehicles are out of compliance. He said the Clean Air Act allows an Environmental Protection Agency fine of up to $48,762 per vehicle, but in 2023 GM paid a fine of just $25 per vehicle for older vehicles that were not in compliance.\n\nWhile GM should benefit from Trump's changes to emissions rules given the full-size SUV and pickup mix, Whiston warned that if Trump imposes high tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico that are sold in the states, \"that could ruin everything irrespective of the environmental rules.\"\n\nThe Trump-Musk bromance\n\nFinally, there is the issue of Musk, who Trump has named to co-head a supposedly planned Department of Government Efficiency. Musk, who runs the largest EV maker in the world, is going to have overreach, even if indirectly, to other federal agencies including the EPA, Ives said. It's unclear if that might help GM or not.\n\nOne thing is certain, Ives said, Trump's ties to Musk should raise eyebrows in Detroit.\n\n\"Musk was iced out and on the outside looking in while GM and the unions were 'in' with the Biden administration. Now, Musk is at the top of the pecking order,\" Ives said. \"The Bromance between Trump and Musk is not a good thing for the 313 area code.\"\n\nMixer is ambivalent on Musk, noting that Tesla has some unique manufacturing processes, along with artificial intelligence systems in place that Detroit automakers might tap.\n\n“The question is, would that be available to the automakers to leverage?” Mixer said.\n\nContact Jamie L.

But the green car ambitions face a stubborn fact — the country isn’t ready yet.\n\nBefore a big electric fleet can run on the roads, rare earth minerals must be found and mined and electric power plants and battery producers vastly scaled up. Analysts say the nation presently lacks the raw minerals, the electric power capacity or the battery production to put millions of electric autos on the road.\n\n“All things considered, the nation’s current and planned production capacity will leave the U.S. dramatically short,” said Alla Kolesnikova, head of data and analytics for Toronto-based technology researcher Adamas Intelligence, referring to battery plant production volume.\n\nBattery costs have fallen since President Joe Biden, as vice president, worked on the Obama White House’s $2.4 billion green car initiative. Launched in 2009, the program failed to set off a green car boom in part because battery systems were too costly — accounting for about half the price of a proposed $28,000 electric sedan. Since then, battery costs have fallen — analysts say the price is around $10,000. That's encouraged green car advocates.\n\nFor more than a decade, advocates have insisted affordable electric autos can spare the planet from wrenching climate change tied partly to the exhaust of gasoline, diesel and jet engines that contribute 29% of the greenhouse gases vented annually into U.S. skies. Across the country, company and government planners have responded. In recent months:\n\nIn Memphis, FedEx Chairman Frederick Smith said the carrier's 200,000 vehicles will be carbon neutral by 2040.\n\nIn Detroit, General Motors decided to convert its Spring Hill assembly lines near Nashville to make only electric autos.\n\nIn New York, analysts predict 10% of the 17 million new autos sold annually nationwide will be electric vehicles by 2025, and over 30% by 2035, the year GM executives say all its new autos will be electric.\n\nIn Nashville, state planners set out to devise a statewide recharging network for electric cars and trucks.\n\nIn Middle and East Tennessee, four battery plants already are open or planned, making the state one of the nation’s three major hubs for supplying batteries for electric vehicles.\n\nNationwide, an array of electric car entrepreneurs are ramping up including, in Memphis, California-based Mullen Technologies, which says it has secured a sport-utility model designed in China.\n\nTennessee plans EV future\n\nAmerican inventors pined for electric cars from the very start of the auto industry. Finally, the technology has progressed. Never before has America been focused like now on EVs, short for electric vehicles.\n\nBut even in Tennessee, where Nissan Smyrna makes the electric Leaf car, and GM Spring Hill and Volkswagen Chattanooga separately will assemble electric models, the green car infrastructure still trails the ambitions.\n\n“Our goal in Tennessee is to grow the fleet to 200,000 electric vehicles in 10 years,” said infrastructure planner Sabyasachee Mishra, associate professor of civil engineering at the University of Memphis.\n\nMishra is calculating where to put EV recharging stations statewide and how many to install as electric autos displace Tennessee's nearly 7 million gasoline and diesel cars and trucks. His study is part of a state government-commissioned research project.\n\nHe began the project before Biden announced his green car initiative. Even with the $200 billion-plus in federal spending proposed for EVs, the electric vehicle goal for Tennessee isn’t being revised higher, at least not yet. Mishra said too many infrastructure hurdles must first be solved.\n\n“Even though the vision is there the full picture is still being planned out,’’ Mishra said.\n\nMishra and U of M engineering graduate student Huan Hoang Ngo are studying driving patterns in Chicago and Washington as well as long-distance travel. Mishra notes Tennessee's goal stops far short of making EV recharging stations common like gas stations.\n\nIn the near future, driving an electric car from, say, Memphis to Atlanta, will require motorists plan ahead and schedule online a stop to recharge their vehicle midway at a specific time, similar to scheduling air travel ahead of the trip, although the scheduling for EVs could be done only hours ahead of the drive.\n\nThat means if a driver hopes to recharge at Birmingham around noon, and the station’s chargers already are entirely booked at that time, the driver might have to wait or find another recharging network such as private and public systems planned by some automakers and cities.\n\nBUSINESS NEWS: FedEx Express to get 500 electric vehicles from new GM company BrightDrop\n\nRamp up EV supply base\n\nFor now, that’s all a theory and it is part of a larger question concerning ramping up EV production capacity. A larger issue: Powering the EVs. Battery plants must quadruple output to match the green car ambitions, said Kolesnikova, the research analyst in Toronto.\n\n“And if that fact alone is not daunting enough,” she said, “one only needs to consider how much lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, alumina and graphite will be required each year and they will surely begin to appreciate the magnitude of the unprecedented challenge and opportunity facing the U.S. EV industry.’’\n\nThe other concern: Electricity. Today’s battery-only car running on the interstate for an hour and a half uses as much electricity as the typical American home burns in one day including the power consumed by appliances and the air conditioner.\n\nThat’s a fair amount of energy — 100 kilowatt hours used every 100 miles, engineers say. Presently, U.S. power companies can supply homes, business and a big EV fleet. But there isn’t enough electricity in the early evening if millions of drivers come home from work, turn on the house lights, turn up the air conditioner and immediately plug their car into a wall socket for recharging. When that happens, brownouts could disrupt many cities.\n\n“Even as we plan the infrastructure for electric vehicles we need to make sure there is enough electrical energy available,” Mishra said. “The current amount of electricity available will not meet the demand.”\n\nElon Musk, founder of U.S. electric car maker Tesla, recently made headlines in Germany, saying global “electricity demand will likely double over the next two decades as a result of the update of electric vehicles.\" The London-based World Nuclear Association estimated an EV surge would require 25 new nuclear plants worldwide by 2035.\n\nIn mulling an EV future, University of Texas researchers in 2018 estimated some states would need to add considerable power generating capacity, some states not so much. The researchers used a dramatic scenario — figuring the electrical demand if all gasoline cars and trucks were at once changed to EVs. Tennessee would require 26% more power, California 47%, while around the Southeast: Alabama would need 25% more power, Arkansas 25%, Georgia 29%, Kentucky 24%, Missouri 32%, Mississippi 28%, according to the 2018 report.\n\n“While EVs might increase the amount of electricity the U.S. consumes, the investment required to accommodate them may be smaller than it appears,” the report says, noting EVs recharged from workplace parking lots during the day would not stress the electrical system in most states.\n\n“What’s more, based on our calculations, the money Americans would save in fuel costs alone could offset these investments,” the report says. “For example, had most of California’s vehicles been electric by 2017, we estimate that its drivers would have saved around US$25 billion that year in fuel costs….”\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIt’s a heady dream, one that has preoccupied green car advocates for over a decade and now been amplified by Biden.\n\nCongress still must approve the American Jobs Plan, but some Republican leaders say the spending package is too large and needs to be cut back. Whether the EV spending proposal survives intact remains to be seen.\n\nIf it does, key pieces of the EV initiative would spur demand for electric cars by providing use tax credits for consumers who buy an EV. Other pieces would ramp up money for expanding a recharging network and resolve other hurdles.

Questions about quality, although the company points to improvements on that front in recent years, and limited exposure to the brand by U.S. consumers have also likely played a role in keeping volumes lower than some European competitors.\n\nInterestingly, Alfa’s star was dimming only a year after it was announced as one of four global brands for FCA in 2018, with scaled back plans and uncertainty in the face of the coming merger with Peugeot maker PSA Group that created Stellantis.\n\nAfter it left for two decades starting in the mid-1990s, Alfa Romeo's relaunch in the U.S. market has been an ongoing project.\n\nStephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit, said Alfa Romeo’s progress felt as if it were on hold as FCA was working through the merger process. With a commitment from Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares that all current brands will be supported for a decade, Alfa Romeo does have some breathing room, she said.\n\n“There is opportunity for more growth or a more refined and more developed product lineup under Stellantis. A lot of it has to do with the fact that Stellantis has more scale ... and with Carlos Tavares’ attitude that that scale is available to the brands ... that should open up some opportunity for Alfa Romeo,” she said.\n\nWhether that makes a difference will depend on how well the brand’s plans are executed, Brinley said.\n\nOpportunities ahead\n\nWith so much focus on future electrification, success will also depend on how quickly customers embrace electric vehicles, a key focus for Alfa Romeo in the years to come, but Brinley noted that there will be lots of choices on that front.\n\nTonale, which is expected to offer a less-expensive entry to Alfa Romeo customers than either the Giulia or Stelvio, means more people should be able to afford an Alfa Romeo, Brinley said. Free Press auto critic Mark Phelan expects it to start in the mid-$30,000s.\n\nTo truly compete against premium European brands, however, Alfa Romeo will need to stand out. Tech features in today’s Alfas have shown improvements over years past, but they aren’t as robust as some others, Brinley said.\n\nAlfa Romeo might also want to reconsider its marketing approach.\n\n“They need to be more visible and more consistently visible so customers know they’re there,” she said.\n\nNew leadership\n\nOne of Alfa Romeo's sister brands in Stellantis, Peugeot, once had U.S. ambitions, too.\n\nLarry Dominique had been tasked with helping to bring Peugeot back to North America, but with the merger last year, that plan was dropped, and Dominique was asked to lead Alfa Romeo in North America, its No. 2 market behind Europe.\n\n“I was superexcited because very rarely do you get to work with such a distinguished historical brand. When I really started to understand the brand, a brand that’s been consistent for 111 years, we’ve had some ups and downs over the 111 years, but from the standpoint of the beauty, performance, DNA, the consistency of who we are as a brand, it’s never wavered and for me it was a great opportunity,” Dominique told the Free Press.\n\nDominique said he sought out the whole story behind how the brand got to where it is and gained some insight, although without the benefit of talking to the decision-makers of the past, which would include people like the late Sergio Marchionne, former FCA CEO.\n\n“What I noticed right away, we had a brand that when we started introducing Giulia and Stelvio and you can just look at the data ... there was some volume push, our transaction prices were quite low, our lease price points were quite low. They pushed the volume, but ... it was never a profitable brand from that standpoint,” Dominique said.\n\nNow, the longtime industry veteran who’s previously worked at Chrysler, General Motors and Nissan, among other stops, is looking to push Alfa Romeo more in markets beyond those where it’s currently strongest, such as California, New York and New Jersey, into Texas and urban areas around Phoenix, Atlanta and Chicago. The brand will also push the envelope for Stellantis’ electric ambitions as it’s slated to be the company's first brand in North America to have a full battery electric lineup.\n\nDominique said that by 2027-28, all new Alfas sold in the United States would be battery electric vehicles.\n\nDominique said the brand's customers skew male, and the intent is to push that in a more gender neutral direction.\n\nWhile Alfa tends to attract high-end Honda and Toyota customers, Dominique said he wants more BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Lexus customers.\n\n“People who love life, that’s who we’re shooting for,” he said. “If you were at a restaurant and there were 30 tables and 29 of those tables had people in ... black and grey suits and dresses, and there’s one table with a bright blue suit and a red dress. That’s the Alfa customer. They want to stand out.\"\n\nKarl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, said the brand has revived its image with its offerings in the last five years.\n\n“From styling to performance, the Italian flare that defined this brand for most of its history is back. The U.S. consumer has responded with solid sales numbers, but there's been stagnation in total volume for the past four years,\" he said, highlighting a difference between Alfa Romeo and its mass market sister, Fiat, another Stellantis brand from Italy which has seen its relevance ebb dramatically in the United States. \"The new Tonale is the right vehicle at the right time, and it should help Alfa Romeo grow sales and market share in the near term.\"\n\nBrauer noted that the brand’s resale value has struggled, which is a reflection of a lack of knowledge about, or demand for, Alfa Romeo vehicles in the used market.\n\nElectrification provides both challenges and opportunities for the brand, he said.\n\n“The challenge for a brand built on passion and personality will be maintaining those defining elements in an increasingly electrified world. As engine and exhaust sounds fade away, and steering and braking feedback is controlled by electronics, all cars' personalities will be largely defined by style. Considering Alfa Romeo's history in that area, this shift to EVs could be great news for the brand, but it will require engineering and advanced technology that is on par with larger, more experienced brands in the EV space,” Brauer said.\n\nContact Eric D.

The Dearborn-based automaker said it will invest $2 billion to retool the Louisville plant starting later this year.\n\nThe plant, which currently builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair SUVs, employs 2,800 hourly and 200 salaried workers. This midsized electric truck ensures the jobs of 2,200 hourly workers, so about 600 fewer jobs than exist today, said Ford spokesman Mark Truby. He said some of those 600 will take a buyout offer if they are ready to retire, others can transfer to nearby plants such as Kentucky Truck Plant, but there are no plans for layoffs.\n\nTruby indicated that there may be more EVs built at Louisville in the future to grow jobs there.\n\nFord's investment in Louisville Assembly is in addition to Ford's previously announced $3 billion commitment for BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Michigan, where Ford will make the prismatic LFP batteries, starting next year, for the midsize electric pickup.\n\nTogether, the nearly $5 billion investments mean Ford expects to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.\n\nFord executives and Kentucky officials also introduced on Monday, Aug. 11, the new Ford Universal EV Production System, which they said will simplify production and ease operations for workers.\n\nFord leaders also announced the creation of the Ford Universal Electric Vehicle Platform, which will enable the development of \"a family of affordable electric vehicles produced at scale.\" The vehicles will be software-defined with over-the-air updates to keep improving the vehicles over time.\n\n“We took a radical approach to solve a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that are breakthrough in every way that matters ― design, technology, performance, space and cost of ownership ― and do it with American workers,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. “Nobody wants to see another good college try by a Detroit automaker to make an affordable vehicle that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty.\"\n\nFarley has teased this announcement since Ford's second-quarter earnings when he said Ford would have a \"Model-T moment\" on Aug. 11. He's referring to the classic vehicle that helped turn Ford into a mass market automaker and perfect the assembly line process. At that time, Farley said it was critical that Ford unveil an EV strategy that would position it to make money selling the electric cars and effectively compete against the Chinese, who are known for making high-quality, desirable and affordable EVs.\n\n\"So, this has to be a good business,\" Farley said of Ford's investments in the new process and platform. \"From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. We empowered a tiny skunkworks team three time zones away from Detroit. We reinvented the line. And we are on a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S. We will not rely on imports.”\n\nFord's Skunkworks division is made up of a team of whiz kids in California who are tasked with developing a new EV.\n\nLFP, or lithium iron phosphate, batteries are increasingly being used in EVs, particularly in China because they are known to be safe, have a long lifespan and are cheaper to make.\n\nFord Universal EV platform\n\nFarley said the new Universal EV Platform will be efficient. For example, it reduces parts by 20% compared with platforms that support a \"typical vehicle\" with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time.\n\nFarley said the result will be a midsize pickup EV, sized close to the current Ford Maverick, with a lower cost of ownership over five years than a 3-year-old used Tesla Model Y.\n\n\"Take for instance the wiring harness in the new midsize truck; it will be more than 4,000 feet (1.3 kilometers) shorter and 10 kilograms lighter than the one used in our first-gen electric SUV,\" Farley said in a statement. \"Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic batteries also enable space and weight savings, while delivering cost reduction and durability for customers. The platform’s cobalt-free and nickel-free LFP battery pack is a structural sub-assembly that also serves as the vehicle’s floor.\"\n\nFord executives said this vehicle, which has been three years in the works, will be profitable within 12 months of launch.\n\nThe announcements come after Ford informed suppliers and employees in June that a full-size electric pickup, which is to be the successor to the F-150 Lightning, will be delayed to 2028. Ford plans to make that vehicle at its BlueOval City Assembly Plant in Tennessee. Additionally, Ford is delaying production of its E-transit van, to be built at its Ohio Assembly Plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, from 2026 to 2028.\n\nFord spokesman Dan Barbossa said Ford will continue to make the F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup, which is made in Ford's Rouge Assembly complex in Dearborn. Ford assembles the Mach-E in Mexico and has no plans to move production to the United States to lessen the impact of President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles, Kumar Galhotra, COO, told reporters on a media call on Aug. 11.\n\nAs for the new midsize EV pickup, Ford did not provide any specifications, including reveal date, starting price (other than it will be about $30,000), EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge time.\n\nBut it said the assembly of the midsize EV pickup is expected to be faster than the Louisville Assembly's current vehicles because of Ford's integration between the Universal EV Production System and the Universal Platform.\n\nPerformance and inspiration from Model T\n\nThe midsize EV pickup will have a low center of gravity that improves handling, offers a quiet cabin and ample interior space, according to the company. Farley said the truck is forecast to have more passenger room than the Toyota RAV4, before including the frunk and the truck bed.\n\nThe midsize truck will have a targeted zero-to-60 time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost, which is 4.5 seconds, with more downforce.\n\n“We took inspiration from the Model T ― the universal car that changed the world,” said Doug Field, Ford chief EV, digital and design officer. \"We applied first‑principles engineering, pushing to the limits of physics to make it fun to drive and compete on affordability. Our new zonal electric architecture unlocks capabilities the industry has never seen. This isn’t a stripped‑down, old‑school vehicle.”\n\nFord Universal EV Production System\n\nFord is also transforming the traditional assembly line into an “assembly tree.\" That means instead of one long conveyor, there will be three sub-assemblies that run down their own lines simultaneously and then join together.\n\nFord said a large single-piece aluminum unicasting replaces dozens of smaller parts, enabling the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately. The front and rear are then combined with the third subassembly, the structural battery, which is independently assembled with seats, consoles and carpeting, to form the vehicle.\n\nFarley said the parts will travel down the assembly tree to operators in a kit, which will included fasteners, scanners and power tools to do the job all in the correct orientation for use to avoid mistakes.\n\nFord said this Universal EV Production System will also dramatically improve ergonomics for employees by reducing twisting, reaching and bending.“We put our employees at the center and re-created the factory from scratch,” Bryce Currie, Ford vice president of Americas Manufacturing, said in a statement. “We expect ergonomic breakthroughs and complexity reduction ― through elimination of parts, connectors and wire ― will flow through to significant quality and cost wins.”\n\nFarley said the $2 billion investment in Louisville Assembly Plant for upgrades to assemble the midsize electric truck will secure 2,200 hourly jobs. Farley said the project is supported by an incentive offer from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.\n\nOlivia Evans contributed to this article.\n\nJamie L.

The obvious fear was that sharing any stage with the war hero would unhinge the president. McCain died last August from brain cancer.\n\nThis is pretty wild stuff.\n\nHigher-ups in the Navy reversed earlier efforts to cover the ship's name with a tarp. Trump denies he knew about the request, as does acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan.\n\nBelieve them, or don't. What cannot be denied is that someone in the White House sent email to the 7th Fleet urging that McCain's name be kept out of Trump's line of vision. Please confirm that the request \"will be satisfied,\" the White House Military official wrote in a follow-up message to the Navy.\n\nAlso, sailors wearing the USS John McCain's insignia were not allowed to board the amphibious assault ship Wasp, where Trump was giving his Memorial Day address. Sailors from other ships were invited aboard.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nWhat we have here is a trigger warning at the presidential level. A trigger warning cautions that a work to be presented contains writing, images and/or concepts that some people might find distressing. Popular on some college campuses, trigger warnings have been subject to much-deserved ridicule.\n\nRecall the fuss made during the last presidential campaign over the appearance of the words \"Trump 2016\" chalked on steps at Emory University. Students demonstrated with at least one insisting that the scribbling made him fear for his life. Others regarded this display of sensitivity as ludicrous.\n\nStudents demanding trigger warnings are often called \"snowflakes.\" Snowflakes are people so easily offended they feel a need for \"safe spaces\" away from realities of a harsh world. Snowflakedom is a mark of immaturity.\n\n\"Basically, we now have a capital city that is trying to child-proof the presidency, right?\" historian Jon Meacham said. \"You want to take everything away, all the sharp objects.\" Airbrush things out that might upset the \"dear leader.\"\n\nSo what about John McCain triggers Trump? Many have noted that the senator from Arizona is a true American hero who, having spent over five gruesome years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, sacrificed greatly for his county — and Trump is not.\n\nAfter running out of student deferments, Trump evaded conscription by claiming incapacitation due to bone spurs on his foot. It turned out he probably didn't even have bone spurs. (His doctor reportedly lied about them as a favor to Trump's father.)\n\nIt must have been hard for a fragile personality like Trump to watch the national outpouring of grief for McCain, who also embodied what now looks like a golden age of nonpartisan patriotism. The similar tributes paid to the late George H.W. Bush no doubt added tinder to Trump's pile of insecurities.\n\nTrump has tried to cover his neurotic bashing of a deceased politician by insisting his true beef was tied to McCain's vote that stopped the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Actually, Trump should have thanked McCain. His prospects for reelection would be far dimmer had millions of Trump voters started losing their health coverage.\n\nWhat makes this incident different from campus trigger warnings is that after advised of the \"dangers,\" students can still choose to receive the material. Trump's guardians wouldn't even take that chance and worked to keep the trigger hidden altogether. Unless, of course, they were doing it all at Trump's behest. The presidency doesn't get weirder than this, or so we hope.\n\nFollow Froma Harrop on Twitter @FromaHarrop.

Each will contain up to dozens of silk-wrapped steel structures, most of which were crafted in Zigong, China.\n\nJeremy Goodman, the zoo's executive director, told The Providence Journal it was an idea he took from Cleveland Metroparks Zoo when he met its director, who had hosted a lantern festival.\n\n\"He was telling me that they put one on and how phenomenal it’s been received and how it was a great revenue generator to help support their zoo and help support their mission.\"\n\nWhen Goodman saw the event for himself, he said he was \"blown away,\" thinking, \"This is something that we have to do at our zoo.\"\n\nAside from the lanterns, attendees can expect Asian cuisine and performers from a variety of Asian countries.

Almost treeless, the land drops away to a broad valley below ... the Great Swamp. Since humans first arrived here, this 20-mile flat-bottomed wetland has shaped their histories and settlements.\n\nFor thousands of years after the Ice Age, a gradual warming trend continued. Sea levels rose. Deciduous forests of oak, maple, beech, hickory, and chestnut replaced the tundra and tiaga plants. The Great Swamp began to evolve into what it is today, a diverse wetland composed of rivers, marshes, shrub swamps, fens and forested floodplain. It abounded with fish, turtles, amphibians, mammals and waterfowl, and the early people that lived along its edges found it an abundant source of food. They hunted and gathered in the highlands and traveled to the shores of both Long Island Sound and the Hudson River to gather shellfish and fish during spring runs. Only stone tools and pottery shards remain to mark the locations of their campsites and villages.\n\nDaniel Nimham, the last sachem of the Wappinger People of the Hudson River Valley and a hero in the American Revolution, maintained that land grabbers during the time of the French-Indian War had taken tribal ancestral lands in eastern New York from his people. No doubt, the abundant wild food made the area attractive.\n\nDutch merchants in New Amsterdam in the 1600s were interested in trading with the native people not for food but for valuable beaver pelts, as the pelts were all the rage in Europe. The Great Swamp’s beaver population was trapped out by the late 1600s.\n\nThe European settlers\n\nAttracted by the rich farmland, European settlers began to filter in to the uplands around the Great Swamp in the early 1700s. The Great Swamp determined the early settlement patterns. Settlers came over the hills from Connecticut on “Indian trails,” avoiding the Great Swamp for fear of “Swamp fever.” The Great Patent Road, now Route 22, was the major north-south highway running along the eastern edge of the Great Swamp.\n\nThe Great Swamp, stretching for 20 miles north and south, and almost 2 miles across at its widest point, meant only a few readily passable east-west routes. During the Revolutionary War, Gen. George Washington headquartered near Fredericksburg, now Patterson, which had a bridge over the East Branch Croton River and was the primary crossing point. From Fredericksburg, one could travel eastward to Danbury and the coast, south to Bedford and Peekskill, west to Fishkill and the Hudson or north into Massachusetts.\n\nBy the 1800s the farmers had cut down the forests, crisscrossed the land with stone walls, and developed upland pastures for sheep and cattle with lowland fields producing grain to feed them. Vast numbers of cattle and sheep were fattened on the rich pastureland before being driven down Route 22 to the markets in New York City. Small hamlets grew up around crossroads and the mills and tanneries on the tributaries feeding the swamp.\n\nThough they also hunted and fished in the swamp, some of the farmers thought they might do better without it. William S. Pelletreau, in his “History of Putnam County” (1886) mentions plans of ambitious farmers who hoped to drain the swamp to gain rich farmland.\n\nNineteenth-century farmers never found the funds to drain it for farmland, but some turned to profits from the Great Swamp’s other natural resources: marble, clay and ice.\n\nJill Eisenstein is a freelance writer, environmental educator, and board member of Friends of the Great Swamp.

Wouldn’t that be a cool job?\n\nDan Madigan, the senior keeper of the Deserts Biome at the Indianapolis Zoo, cares for 140 individual reptiles, amphibians, birds, and small mammals daily. His duties include feeding the animals, cleaning enclosures, and administering medications and treatments. Madigan also manages volunteers for the department and keeps animal record data.\n\nPrior to joining the Indianapolis Zoo, Madigan was a herpetologist at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Md.\n\nMadigan dreamed of working with animals as a child. As a 10-year-old, he wrote a letter to a marine mammal trainer at Sea World asking how to become an Orca trainer. To his surprise, he received a return letter from a trainer.\n\nMadigan says that simple letter helped open the door for him to a satisfying career in zoology.\n\nHe enjoys sharing his experiences, challenges and learning opportunities with zoo patrons.\n\n“I never know if the individual I am speaking with, young or old, will someday look back and recognize that talking to me opened their eyes to the wonder that is a zoological career — the same that the Sea World letter did for me nearly 19 years ago,” he said,\n\nQuestion: Why did you pursue this career?\n\nAnswer: Since childhood, I’ve always had a fascination with the wild world that surrounds us and I feel like that early excitement for nature is what helped guide me to where I am today. I remember as a child when most of my family would be watching sports, I’d be off in another room watching Discovery Channel or something of the sort.\n\nQ: What are your job duties?\n\nA: The primary duties of my job are to complete with care the daily husbandry of over 140 individual reptiles, amphibians, birds, and small mammals. Animal husbandry loosely described means all necessary needs are met for each and every individual. In most cases, this includes things like cleaning enclosures, feeding out the appropriate diet, administering veterinarian prescribed medications/treatments, and providing daily enrichment which keeps them engaged both mentally and physically. On top of the husbandry duties, I also help oversee our department’s volunteers, keep up on the animals records data, sit on the safety committee as a department representative, and take part as an active member of the Indianapolis American Association of Zoo Keepers chapter.\n\nQ: What’s so cool about this job?\n\nA: Of course, getting to work with such exotic and stunning animals like meerkats, komodo dragons, and various venomous snakes is amazing, but I still feel there is something else there that makes this job cool. I find that coming to work every day and being faced with new animal care challenges, learning opportunities, and the chance to share my knowledge with the public is what is truly cool.\n\nQ: How did you get the job?\n\nA: I located a posting for this job on the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Jobs section. Recognizing that I was qualified, I began the application process, which took only a short time as I had already prepared a resume. After a phone interview, I was asked to attend for a face-to-face interview which included having me demonstrate appropriate husbandry techniques. After several weeks, I received the phone call that the zoo intended to hire me for the position. Anyone wishing to get into a zoological career often follows the same path I did when searching for a job, but a bit of advice to better your chances is to have a well-constructed résumé and never underestimate the power of an internship, even if it’s unpaid, as they are worth their weight in gold in terms of experience.\n\nQ: What makes you good at this job?\n\nA: I enjoy working for the Indianapolis Zoo, which makes it easy for me to do my job to the best of my abilities. Having a positive outlook for what you do always makes for a good employee because to them it doesn’t feel like work.\n\nQ: Any downside?\n\nA: In my opinion there are no downsides to the actual daily duties. The only downside that any keeper can attest to is that we care so deeply for the animals under our care that when, as life would have it, illness and death occur, sometimes without warning, it deeply affects us emotionally. When we’ve cared for an individual on a daily basis for often many years, to lose them is just as hard to a zookeeper as losing a family member. As zookeepers, we take great pride in what we do, seen and unseen, and losing an animal that we’re so close to is really hard. But with that said also having gotten to know and work with that individual brings us great happiness and fond memories which we will never forget.\n\nQ: What is a story you’ll be telling your grandkids?\n\nA: When giving tours, I have had the pleasure of meeting many great people over the years, from television’s Nigel Marvin, to the 2013 Indianapolis 500 winner Tony Kanaan, and even the Indianapolis Colts starting quarterback Andrew Luck. Just getting to meet them is often a story in itself, and they are all great people and amazing role models.\n\nTo recommend someone for this feature, contact Jill Phillips at (317) 444-6246 or email her at jill.phillips@indystar..com.

But the national spending package enacted in March “makes clear that FDA can regulate tobacco products containing nicotine from any source,” the agency said in April, just before the law took effect.\n\nCompanies had until May 14 to submit a premarket application to keep their products on the market. Those that did not win the FDA’s authorization of e-cigarettes that used synthetic nicotine would need to be pulled by July 13.\n\nOn Wednesday, the FDA announced what it called “its first two warning letters” to manufacturers for unlawfully marketing non-tobacco nicotine e-liquid products without the required authorizations.\n\nThe letters went to AZ Swagg Sauce LLC and Electric Smoke Vapor House, which have a combined 10,000 products, according to the FDA. Neither company submitted a premarket application by the deadline, the agency said.\n\nUnder the law, anyone who makes or sells “non-tobacco nicotine” must comply with FDA regulations, which also include not selling to people under 21, not giving away samples and not making claims that their products are less harmful than cigarettes without FDA authorization.\n\nThe FDA said Wednesday that it also sent 107 warning letters to retailers in the past two weeks for illegally selling synthetic nicotine products to underage buyers.\n\n“FDA has been fully committed to actively implementing this critical new law regulating non-tobacco nicotine products since its passage, and the warning letters announced today are just the beginning of our compliance and enforcement actions,” said Brian King, director of the Center for Tobacco Products. “In the coming weeks, we will continue to investigate companies that may be marketing, selling, or distributing non-tobacco nicotine products illegally and will pursue action, as appropriate.”\n\nAfter Wednesday, any new synthetic nicotine product without premarket authorization from the FDA cannot be legally marketed. The FDA says it is processing 1 million applications for synthetic nicotine products submitted by more than 200 makers.\n\nAnti-tobacco advocates say the FDA’s action is not enough.\n\n“It’s not even a step forward. It’s them lifting their foot,” said Erika Sward, national assistant vice president of advocacy for the American Lung Association. “Taking action against the retailers does not cut the beast off at the head. They need to cut the beast off at the head and deal with the manufacturers and order the products off the market.\n\n“All products are supposed to be ordered off the market [Thursday], and there’s no excuse for any of them to remain,” Sward said.\n\nThe FDA didn’t address the most popular player on the market, Puff Bar, a disposable brand that comes in a variety of flavors including mango, strawberry banana and peach ice. The product was the most popular among students in 2021, with more than a quarter of kids in high school who currently vaped saying Puff Bar was their usual brand.\n\n“This deadline was significant because it involves the product most popular and the brand most popular among kids, and that’s Puff Bar,” Sward said. “If FDA is going to really act to protect kids, Puff Bar needs to be the place it starts. We were fully expecting and hoping to see Puff Bar off the market, and I think that was pretty clear that was what Congress wanted.”\n\nPuff Bar did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, sent a letter to the FDA to urge it to meet its deadline, and Durbin criticized the agency from the Senate floor on Wednesday.\n\n“The FDA is supposed to protect all Americans, and particularly our children. I’m calling on FDA to finally come to its senses. Err on the side of public safety, on the side of kids, not tobacco companies. This free fall in the legal department at the FDA is unimaginable. It’s not safe for America. And it’s not safe for our future,” he said.\n\nAnti-tobacco groups have voiced their frustration with the FDA for its inaction on this and other issues.\n\n“In March, Congress gave clear deadlines to FDA when it passed a law requiring FDA to regulate tobacco products made with synthetic nicotine,” said American Lung Association President and CEO Harold Wimmer. “The FDA has the tools it needs and now must act to immediately remove these products from the market as Congress required.”\n\nIn May, the FDA announced that it would not finish reviewing all the premarket applications from e-cigarette companies until June 2023, nearly two years past its court-ordered deadline to make a decision about those products.\n\nMore than 2 million middle and high school students used e-cigarettes in 2021, according to the National Youth Tobacco Survey.\n\n“The continued delay by the FDA puts more kids at risk of becoming addicted to these products. We urge FDA to swiftly remove all synthetic nicotine products from the market and put strict enforcement measures in place,” Wimmer said.\n\nLast week, the FDA announced a stay of its order to remove all of Juul Labs’ vaping products from store shelves, after a US appeals court entered a temporary administrative stay June 24. The agency cited “scientific issues” and said they warranted additional review.

About 95% of those ages 13 to 17 report having, or having access to, a smartphone. Close to half of those polled report using the internet on a “near-constant basis.”\n\nThe new report is based on summary data from 2010 through 2020 as well as interviews with officials, written responses from the agency and information available on its public website.\n\nIn a memo to the Inspector General’s Office in response to the report, Beethika Khan, the FDA associate commissioner for economics and analysis, wrote that her agency’s online tobacco surveillance program is “flexible” and has played “a major role in supporting FDA’s highest tobacco enforcement priorities.”\n\nOf the 16,511 online tobacco websites that the FDA flagged for review between 2010 and 2020, the agency sent warning letters to 899 of them, yet the Inspector General’s report says that the agency took not a single enforcement action against those retailers. The FDA has the legal authority to fine retailers, among other punishments like criminal prosecution and seizing tobacco products.\n\nThe warning letters it sent most often cited retailers for advertising and labeling violations, the report says.\n\n“It is unclear to what extent FDA conducted additional oversight of these online tobacco retailers at later dates and found subsequent violations that could result in FDA taking enforcement actions,” the report says.\n\nIn some cases, the FDA didn’t send warning letters when they may have been appropriate, the report says. For example, the FDA surveillance program took note of 400 online domestic retailers selling Ends products. There were 30 high-volume retailers that sold flavored cartridges, which are illegal, yet the FDA sent letters to only 19.\n\nThe report also notes that the FDA has failed to complete the rule-making process for online tobacco sales despite a deadline of 2011, more than a decade ago.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as ATF, requires tobacco product retailers to register with the agency, but the FDA has failed to work with ATF to get access to that information, according to the report. The FDA does share information on investigations, however.\n\nWhile it can be difficult to police online retailers due to the sheer volume and the internet’s “wild West” nature, as one FDA official described it in the report, it says the FDA could do better by collaborating more closely with ATF on the oversight of these online retailers.\n\nThe report recommends that the FDA finish making rules about online sales, as it was supposed to do years ago, and collect data about its oversight of online retailers.\n\nWhen the Inspector General asked, the FDA was not able to determine how many investigations of online retailers it’s done, saying that its investigations are just one tool that it uses to control kids’ access to tobacco.\n\nThe Inspector General’s report says the FDA should increase transparency of its investigations so parents and other interested parties can better understand what it’s doing to keep kids safe online.\n\nIn response to the report, the FDA agreed that there may be additional opportunities to collaborate with ATF and promised to explore them.\n\nThe FDA also agreed about the need for transparency and promised that by March, it will create a dedicated website to offer more information about its efforts.\n\nThe agency did not make any promises to develop rules about online tobacco sales but said that other laws and requirements may achieve the same ends.\n\nThe FDA also did not make any promises about data collection but said it would explore ways to “maximize transparency without jeopardizing investigations.”\n\nErika Sward, assistant vice president of national advocacy for the American Lung Association, said it is important to keep in mind that this report was done under a former director of the FDA’s tobacco program and that she has started to see positive changes in terms of enforcement under the program’s new leadership. Dr. Brian King was appointed director of the Center for Tobacco Products in July.\n\nAlso in July, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf announced that he had commissioned a review of the agency’s tobacco program, as well as its work regulating food. The independent review of the tobacco program is due to Califf by December 19.\n\nWhat stood out to Sward in the report was the FDA’s lack of follow-up beyond warning letters to online retailers.\n\n“The IG report underscores the significant and serious challenges that the Center for Tobacco Products has had with enforcement,” Sward said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe tobacco industry is unlike any other in the FDA’s purview, Sward said. Although drug companies and other regulated industries may adhere to any sort of letter from the agency, it will probably take more aggressive action to move the tobacco industry.\n\n“It’s not enough to send a letter. They have to be willing to follow up,” Sward said. “Unless FDA is willing to put some teeth behind it – and that could involve ATF or other parts of [the US Department of Justice] – we really need the law enforcement component to come in and pursue these manufacturers or retailers when they continue their illegal behaviors and actions.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2025/12/03/shredded-cheese-recall-walmart-target-aldi/87584984007/", "title": "Shredded cheeses sold at Walmart, Target, Aldi recalled.

illegal marijuana, authorities say", "text": "Updated Jan. 3, 2018, 6:38 p.m. ET\n\nIowans who want to buy cannabis oil to treat a range of ailments don’t have to wait a year for state officials to set up a tightly regulated distribution system – because versions of the products already are for sale on store shelves.\n\nState and federal officials say the oils, known as cannabidiol or CBD, are marijuana products that shouldn’t be sold in unregulated stores. “It’s illegal,” said Andrew Funk, executive director of the Iowa Board of Pharmacy. Police in two towns have recently seized products from store shelves.\n\nDespite such warnings, several Iowa businesses continue to openly sell CBD products, including oils, caplets and creams. Store owners and their out-of-state suppliers say the oil is extracted from hemp plants that were bred to have extremely low levels of THC, the chemical that recreational marijuana users seek. They say hemp is related to marijuana, but is not the same. “It’s not about getting high. It’s not about getting stoned. It’s about having a better quality of life,” said Kim Loeffler, owner of the Corner Store Apothecary in Cedar Rapids.\n\nCBD products are also readily available for order on the internet. Such unregulated sales have been ramping up as Iowa administrators work to implement a new state law allowing sales of medical marijuana products that are made and distributed under strict rules. That system, which is to go into effect in 2019, will have one state-licensed production facility and up to five authorized dispensaries. Sales will only be allowed to patients who obtain state permits after their doctors certify they have conditions such as epilepsy, cancer, multiple sclerosis, AIDS or Parkinson’s or Lou Gehrig’s diseases.\n\nPolice in Muscatine and Carroll have recently seized CBD products being sold by businesses.\n\nMuscatine police sent samples to the state crime lab for analysis, Muscatine County Attorney Alan Ostergren wrote in a statement posted online Tuesday. \"This analysis confirms that the CBD products seized in the investigation are marijuana under Iowa law. It is illegal to possess or distribute them,\" he wrote. Although Ostergren decided not to file charges, he warned that future violations might be prosecuted. He urged residents to destroy any CBD products they have.\n\nCarroll police also recently seized CBD products from two businesses, which they aren't publicly identifying. Police Chief Brad Burke said his department conferred with the Iowa attorney general’s office before making the seizures. “It’s a confusing law,” he said. “It’s going to be an interesting year to see how this all plays out.”\n\nLoeffler said she’s confident her Cedar Rapids business is on solid legal ground. Her tidy shop in the Czech Village neighborhood is far from clandestine. The CBD products are prominently displayed, and Loeffler said her customers have included several law-enforcement officers. Last month, she proudly testified about her business during a meeting in Ankeny of a state board that is helping set up Iowa’s new regulated medical marijuana system. Her husband also testified to the board, recounting how CBD products helped ease his severe epilepsy symptoms.\n\nLoeffler said in an interview that she doesn’t advise customers about how to respond to their health issues. However, her store’s website says the CBD she sells “is used to treat numerous disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, MLS, epilepsy, chronic fatigue, (and) digestive issues.”\n\nLoeffler’s testimony last month about her CBD sales drew no response from the state board members, most of whom are physicians. Nor did her description draw comment from staff members of the Iowa Department of Public Health and an assistant attorney general who were present at the board meeting.\n\nWhen the Register later asked the attorney general’s office about the legality of the business that Loeffler described, spokesman Geoff Greenwood said the lack of response from state officials at the meeting should not be interpreted as approval of unregulated CBD sales. Greenwood said board members and state staff were simply listening to public comment at the meeting, and they were not in a position to respond at the time.\n\nGreenwood added that the state’s legal definition of marijuana does not depend on the levels of THC present in materials extracted from cannabis plants. Anyone making or distributing marijuana products outside of the state’s new regulations would do so at their own legal risk, he said.\n\nGreenwood noted that the Iowa Board of Pharmacy advised pharmacists last May to refrain from selling CBD products, such as oils or creams, even if the products are described as low-THC. The board said in its advisory that it considers CBD products “Schedule I” materials, which “cannot be purchased, sold or transferred in or into the state of Iowa.”\n\nLast week, the Governor's Office of Drug Control Policy sent police departments and county attorneys a copy of a memo on the issue from the Iowa Department of Public Health. \"It is the position of the department that CBD products other than those manufactured under the department’s regulatory program are not legal in the state of Iowa,\" the memo says.\n\nThe state’s new medical-marijuana program will allow sales of products that have up to 3 percent THC. That’s at least 10 times the level reportedly contained in many of the CBD oils being sold informally.\n\nBut Funk, the pharmacy board administrator, doesn’t buy the argument that low-THC cannabis oils are legal to sell without a state permit. “It makes no difference,” he said of the THC levels in the oils being sold over the counter. The “hemp” plants being processed into oil are a variety of marijuana, he said.\n\nFederal officials, including leaders of the Drug Enforcement Administration, also contend CBD oil is a marijuana product that is not legal to sell or ship. The Food and Drug Administration has sent several warning letters to distributors in recent years, saying their websites include inappropriate, unproven claims the products can treat medical problems, including cancer. One of the most recent letters went to Green Roads Health, a Florida company that distributes CBD products that are sold at River Rat Vapes in Cedar Rapids.\n\nThe FDA letter contended Green Roads’ website included this claim: “The following are some of the many ailments CBD oil can potentially be therapeutic for: asthma, Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, autism, bipolar disorder, various types of cancer…” The FDA said the site also claimed “adding CBD oil as part of your daily Alzheimer’s routine has a good chance at delaying progression of the disease,” and it claimed CBD is “very useful for treating bipolar disorder.”\n\nGreen Roads responded that the FDA had mixed it up with a different company with a similar name. A Green Roads spokesman emphasized his company's confidence in the legality of its hemp-based products. \"Green Roads products contain zero THC, and they do not fall under the purview of the medical marijuana laws thereby making them legal in all 50 states,\" the spokesman said.\n\nDan Abbott, owner of River Rat Vapes, said he was unaware of the federal warning letter to Green Roads. But he said he is confident the CBD oil he sells is legal, and he sees no reason authorities would try to block distribution of such a benign product just because it's related to marijuana. \"That would be like saying aspirin is equivalent to hydrocodone,\" he said.\n\nIn 2016, the FDA said it had bought products labeled as CBD from several distributors and had the products tested at a lab. The tests found that some of the products contained little or no cannabidiol, and some of them contained significant amounts of THC.\n\nFunk shares federal regulators’ concerns about a lack of oversight into what’s contained in packages labeled as CBD. “You’re taking a risk,” he said. Companies that make prescription medications must regularly prove what’s in them. Companies that make supplements are much more loosely regulated.\n\nAn executive for a large national supplier of over-the-counter CBD products said his company’s offerings are legal because they’re made from hemp that is grown overseas and is legally imported. “They’re a botanical extract coming from a legal agricultural hemp plant,” said Josh Hendrix, director of business development for CV Sciences, which is based in California. CV Sciences products are sold in more than 1,500 health food stores nationally, including Campbell’s Nutrition in Des Moines and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market in West Des Moines.\n\nSimilar controversies are flaring up nationally. In Indiana, state authorities seized CBD oil from several stores last year, then paused amid controversy about the products’ legality. But Gov. Eric Holcomb said in late November that after 60 days, state police would resume seizing cannabidiol products that contained any of the THC chemical.\n\nA national trade group, the Hemp Industries Association, filed a federal lawsuit last year to try block the Drug Enforcement Administration from enforcing a new rule against CBD products. The lawsuit contends the federal agency's rule violated a 2004 federal appeals court decision allowing sales of hemp products with small amounts of THC.\n\nThe CBD controversy comes amid a continuing disconnect between federal law, which still classifies marijuana products as strictly illegal, and many states' laws, which allow sales for medical or even recreational purposes. Under President Barack Obama, federal authorities generally did not interfere with residents who followed state marijuana regulations. However, supporters of medical marijuana have expressed concern that the Trump administration would shift direction.\n\nLoeffler said she knows the subject is a legal gray area. She said she and other CBD supporters plan to ask Iowa legislators to make clear that products like the ones she sells are legal. \"We want to be in line with the law,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/04/states-push-legal-clarity-federal-consensus-cbd-cannabidiol-oil/3368846002/", "title": "CBD oil: States push for legal clarity, FDA consensus on cannabidiol", "text": "PAUL ELIAS\n\nAssociated Press\n\nApril 4, 2019, 5:04 p.m. ET\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — CBD oil-infused gummy bears, lattes and other food, drinks and dietary supplements are selling quickly even though the U.S. government says they're illegal and local authorities have forced some retailers to pull products. The confusion has the nation's two largest states and others moving to legalize the cannabis compound that many see as beneficial to their health.\n\nLawmakers in Texas and California are often in opposition, but they're both pushing bipartisan legislation to sidestep federal law and allow sales of the compound found in hemp and marijuana. Republicans and Democrats in Congress also are urging the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to change its stance.\n\nThe FDA announced Tuesday that it will hold a public hearing in May to gather more information.\n\nResolving the confusion can't come quick enough for Jonathan Eppers, who makes Vybes, a popular CBD oil-infused beverage. California health inspectors raided his Los Angeles warehouse in January and impounded $100,000 worth of the drink.\n\nEppers said about 50 California retailers have since dropped his product and he's moved production to Texas. He estimates lost sales, legal costs and relocation expenses have cost him at least $500,000.\n\n\"What is going on is unbelievable and asinine,\" Eppers said. \"They put us in this state of limbo that's costing us.\"\n\nEppers and CBD fans are mystified by the legal insecurity. After all, they say, retailers in California and nine other states that have broadly legalized marijuana sell edibles and other products that get people high, though pot is illegal under federal law. U.S. officials generally have taken a hands-off approach in states where pot is legal.\n\nThe FDA has oversight of CBD because it is the active ingredient in an approved prescription drug to treat two rare seizure disorders. The agency says CBD can't be added to food or sold as a dietary supplement because officials haven't determined if it's safe or effective for other conditions.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told Congress last week that enforcement is being limited to sellers who make false health claims. He says the agency recently sent warning letters to three companies touting CBD as a treatment for cancer, Alzheimer's disease, fibromyalgia and drug addiction.\n\n\"But there are products on the market right now that, given our enforcement priorities and our limited resources, we haven't taken action against,\" he said.\n\nSellers and users say CBD helps with pain, anxiety and inflammation, though limited scientific research supports those claims. It's turning up in products ranging from lotions, cosmetics and soap to diet pills, juices, cocktails, candy and drinks.\n\nShort for cannabidiol, CBD is a non-psychoactive molecule found in hemp and marijuana. Both are cannabis plants, but only marijuana has enough of the compound THC to get users high. CBD oil is extracted when the plant is processed. While hemp derivatives are essentially THC-free, CBD oil from marijuana may have very little or enough to produce a high.\n\nState and local officials are taking nearly all the enforcement actions against CBD. Health officials in California, which has the nation's largest marijuana marketplace, warned retailers last summer that anything edible containing CBD is illegal until lawmakers or regulators say otherwise.\n\nThe warning was largely ignored until early 2019, when state and local health officials began forcing some small businesses to pull products after receiving complaints.\n\nSan Francisco health officials recently barred two small operators from selling CBD-infused food and drink, while authorities in rural Grass Valley, 140 miles (308 kilometers) away, did the same to a small, cooperatively owned grocery store.\n\n\"It caught us way off guard,\" said Gus Dabais, owner of Sidewalk Wellness, one of the stores targeted.\n\nThe San Francisco Health Department sent warning letters to 1,900 businesses last year, spokeswoman Veronica Vien said. She said inspectors are not looking for CBD but responding to complaints.\n\nShe said that's how they ended up \"red tagging\" products at Dabais' business and Steap Tea Bar, a popular Chinatown stop that sold CBD-infused bubble tea.\n\nSimilar scenarios are playing out in Ohio, where authorities in January ordered a Cincinnati grocery store to remove CBD from two outlets. The following month, New York City health inspectors removed CBD products from a number of restaurants. Police in March raided two Fort Worth, Texas, retailers and seized CBD products after the local district attorney declared the compound illegal.\n\nIn Texas, one of a handful of states that outlaws all forms of marijuana, lawmakers are pushing a measure that would legalize hemp oil-infused edibles. It sailed through its first committee in the House this week.\n\nIn California, a similar CBD measure has moved on to the full Assembly.\n\n\"A number of people have been using it for years, and you can find it on retail shelves all over the place, but now people are surprised to find it's against the law,\" said Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, a Napa-area Democrat who introduced the measure. \"What this bill will do is clear up the confusion.\"\n\nShe said the legislation would stop state and local enforcement of the FDA's ban and hopes it becomes law by August.\n\n\"This would lift a legal cloud from a legitimate California business,\" said Jim Gross of the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, an industry association.\n\nA growing number of federal lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, are urging the FDA to approve CBD. They backed a measure taking hemp off the U.S. government's list of banned substances.\n\n\"Hemp is a versatile crop with many uses and applications,\" McConnell and Wyden wrote to the FDA in February. \"We are hopeful that by working with you on the implementation of our legislation, we can help ensure that hemp can be a new cash crop for farmers across the country.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2024/12/03/cucumber-recall-for-salmonella-wisconsin-and-34-other-states-affected/76732815007/", "title": "Cucumber recall for salmonella: Wisconsin and 34 other states ...", "text": "Dec. 3, 2024, 11:12 a.m. ET\n\nAt least 68 people nationwide, including in Wisconsin, have gotten sick in a salmonella outbreak linked to cucumbers, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nSunFed, an Arizona-based food company, first issued a recall of its cucumbers last week after reports of the illnesses began to emerge.

Ohio shops that sell to them face almost ...", "text": "Sept. 28, 2023 Updated Sept. 29, 2023, 3:14 p.m. ET\n\nNearly 300 southwest Ohio and northern Kentucky retailers sold tobacco products to minors since January 2019.\n\nThe majority of stores cited for underage sales are located within 1 mile of a middle or high school.\n\nFines for businesses increase with more infractions, but Ohio officials don't keep track of whether those fines are paid.\n\nWhen a 16-year-old girl went into the VIP Wireless & Smoke Shop on Beechmont Avenue in January, she walked out a short time later with a vape pen, an electronic device that heats liquid containing flavoring and nicotine.\n\nA Hamilton County Sheriff’s deputy observed the exchange and when he confronted the teen, she said she traded in a non-working vape pen for a working one, and it wasn’t her first time buying tobacco products there, according to a police report and court records.\n\nThe clerk who gave her the vape was cited for selling to minors, though the misdemeanor charge against him was eventually dismissed. VIP Distribution Discount Inc., which operates the Beechmont Avenue store, did not respond to messages from The Enquirer.\n\nWhat police say happened at the Anderson Township smoke shop is far from an unusual story.\n\nTeens and young adults working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration bought tobacco products in 328 instances at 300 different stores in southwest Ohio and Northern Kentucky since January 2019, according to an Enquirer analysis of federal-level inspection data.\n\nOf those violations, 67 involved electronic smoking devices such as vapes or e-cigarettes, the most popular tobacco products among school-aged children.\n\nThe Enquirer also found that the majority, or 59%, of stores cited by the feds during the last four years are located within 1 mile of a middle or high school.\n\nThose numbers do not capture the full extent of illegal sales of tobacco products to minors by legitimate retailers, nor do they include online retailers, but they do reveal how widespread the problem is.\n\nSales to underage buyers happened at stores across Hamilton, Butler, Warren and Clermont counties in Ohio, and Boone, Campbell and Kenton counties in Kentucky.\n\nTo put it in perspective, the number of cited stores is more than triple the number of Skyline Chili restaurants in Greater Cincinnati.\n\nTeens and children who smoke most commonly get hold of tobacco products from someone in their social circle, but it’s not rare for them to buy such items from clerks at gas stations, vape shops and even mainstream store chains like Kroger or United Dairy Farmers.\n\nAs many as 43% of 15 to 20-year-old e-cigarette users buy their devices from retail stores, research shows, with a 2019 study revealing school-aged vape users prefer smoke shops and convenience stores over other retailers.\n\n[ The Enquirer is making this special report on the youth vaping crisis free as a public service. Support local journalism with a subscription. ]\n\nConsumers in Ohio and Kentucky must be 21 to buy tobacco products, including vapes and e-cigarettes, under state law. The federal legal smoking age was raised to 21 in 2019.\n\nState agencies also inspect stores for compliance. In Ohio, where selling tobacco products to minors results in a criminal citation, officials don't track whether fines have been paid, instead leaving that job to local courts.\n\nHow are state laws for over-the-counter tobacco sales enforced?\n\nLocal police departments have the authority to issue citations for illegal tobacco sales, but much of the enforcement of tobacco laws is left to state agencies, which respond to complaints and hire teens and young adults to make undercover buys.\n\nThe Ohio Investigative Unit − contracted by the state’s departments of health and mental health and addiction services − carries out these sting operations year-round, as does the Kentucky Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which conducts around 6,000 buy attempts each year, many on behalf of the FDA.\n\nPassing these compliance checks should be a breeze, said Commander Eric Wolf, a spokesperson for the Ohio Investigative Unit.\n\nWolf said the agency typically employs 16 to 20-year-olds, many of whom are interested in a career in law enforcement.\n\nThey aren't allowed to appear older than they are, meaning they have to wear everyday clothes and cannot have facial hair or makeup, Wolf said. They’re also required to show an ID and give their true age when asked.\n\nSimilar rules apply to underage buyers in Kentucky, who are even encouraged to wear clothes bearing their high school insignia.\n\n“The biggest point of these compliance checks is to make sure that the retailers are checking IDs for these youthful appearing individuals,” Wolf said. “We’re not trying to do anything to trick or entrap these retailers.”\n\nBut the problem is bigger than clerks simply neglecting to check IDs, Wolf said, noting incidents at stores where clerks have the ability to scan IDs and deliberately override the register’s warning that the buyer is underage.\n\nWolf said there’s also been a recent emphasis on having underage buyers specifically ask for vapes and e-cigarettes, versus traditional tobacco products, given their rise in popularity among teens and young adults.\n\nAs of early August, OIU had attempted 59 e-cigarette purchases this year with 12 sold, according to the agency's data. Those attempts were among the more than 1,400 stings carried out by that point this year at stores across the state.\n\nTo get a more realistic picture of illegal sales to minors, however, underage buyers at both the state and federal levels should look older and be able to lie to store clerks, said Dr. Rob Crane, president of the Preventing Tobacco Addiction Foundation.\n\nWhy? Because that’s what someone trying to buy a vape illegally would do, Crane said.\n\nHe said the reason for raising the legal smoking age to 21 was to cut off access to the young adults who supply school-aged kids with vapes and other forms of tobacco.\n\n“That’s the person we’re trying to stop is that person who is buying a lot of vapes, who has a beard, or piercings, or tattoos, and they’re being sold to,” he added.\n\n‘Little incentive’ for retailers to follow federal law\n\nRetailers cited by the FDA for selling tobacco products to minors are usually slapped with fines and, in some cases, suspensions of their ability to sell tobacco.\n\nA first offense is punishable by a warning letter, with increasing civil fines levied for repeat offenses. The highest possible fine totals nearly $13,000 and is issued if a store has six violations within a four-year period.\n\nRetailers with five or more violations within three years are hit with a no-tobacco-sale order prohibiting all tobacco product sales, usually for up to 30 days. But such penalties are rare.\n\nOnly 61 no-tobacco-sale orders have been issued nationwide since January 2019, FDA data show. One of those was to the Monroe IGA Express, which was cited for six violations in less than two years.\n\nInspections by the FDA in fiscal year 2022 covered less than a quarter of tobacco retailers nationwide. Critics say those inspections are usually clustered in cities and stores that do get inspected typically don’t get a follow-up inspection for at least a year.\n\n“As a result, those retailers that are not in compliance appear to have little incentive to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors or to ensure they are keeping illegal products that are attractive to youth off the shelves,” Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, wrote in a July letter to the agency’s commissioner.\n\nWhat are vapes? What's in them? Everything you need to know about e-cigarettes\n\nAre fines just the ‘cost of doing business’?\n\nPunishments for illegal tobacco sales differ slightly at the state level.\n\nSelling tobacco products to minors in Ohio is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $250 fine for a first offense. A repeat offense carries a 60-day jail term and a $500 fine.\n\nWhile it's possible under state law for retailers to receive fines up to $2,000 or $3,000, depending on how many times they've been caught selling to minors, officials say it's usually the person behind the cash register who's held responsible.\n\nKentucky issues civil fines reaching as high as $1,000 for clerks and $2,500 for retailers.\n\nThere are no penalties in either state for underage possession or use of tobacco products.\n\nAs of Sept. 1, the Kentucky Public Protection Cabinet recorded a total of $61,300 in unpaid fines related to the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors.\n\nSpokespeople for the Ohio Department of Health and the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services said their agencies don’t collect data on whether fines have been paid, nor do they follow up on the outcome of cases stemming from the state's sting operations.\n\n\"Citations issued by (the Ohio Department of Public Safety) are handled through local courts, so there is no way for us to know the outcomes or keep track of fines paid,\" Eric Wandersleben, with the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, said in an email.\n\nWolf said OIU does check on whether clerks slapped with criminal citations are ultimately convicted, but the agency leaves it to the courts to keep track of unpaid fines.\n\nEven if those fines are being paid, it might not matter much in the end.\n\nMonetary penalties are an inadequate form of deterrence given that the average convenience store does hundreds of thousands of dollars in tobacco sales each year, said Crane, a physician and retired professor of family medicine at the Ohio State University.\n\n“It’s the cost of doing business,” he said. “The only thing that works is if you have on the second or third offense, a suspension. You suspend them for a week or two weeks, all of a sudden, they'll stop selling to kids.”\n\nOhio Rep. Sara Carruthers, a Hamilton Republican, introduced legislation in August aimed at increasing fine amounts for repeat illegal sales and possibly shutting down stores caught selling vapes and other tobacco products to minors, similar to how the state’s alcohol sales law is enforced.\n\nExpanded state authority is even favored by some working in the vaping industry, including Jeff Kathman, owner of Cincy Vapors.\n\n\"There has to be something, we have to be able to close this big loophole because I don't see it getting any better,\" said Kathman, who is proud of the fact his stores have not been cited.\n\nWhile illegal sales are a problem happening at large franchises and small businesses, Kathman squares no small amount of blame on the recent rise of \"hybrid\" smoke shops, which carry every kind of tobacco and vaping product imaginable. Some of these stores prefer to pay whatever fines are levied against them for illegal sales because those pale in comparison to the money coming in, he said.\n\n\"Their business thrives off catching the sales to the minors and being able to operate off of that,\" Kathman said, noting that often these stores are able to sell at cheaper prices, too.\n\nNew Cincy Vapors employees are made to card everyone at first, though the standard practice is to card anyone who appears under 27 years old, and there's a zero-tolerance policy for selling to minors, meaning any employee caught doing so will lose their job, said Kathman, who sits on the board of the Ohio Vapor Trade Association.\n\nWhile Cincy Vapors does sell flavored vape products, which are also appealing to adults trying to quit traditional tobacco, the business doesn't carry products that are otherwise appealing to kids. Kathman said he knows of some places dealing in vapes decorated with popular cartoon characters.\n\nEnforcement complicated by online sales\n\nBrick-and-mortar stores are just one part of the problem, however, because internet tobacco sales have also become a common way for middle and high schoolers to obtain vapes, with as many as 13% of school-aged smokers reporting they buy tobacco products online.\n\nThere are limits on the shipping of tobacco products and the FDA does conduct surveillance of online marketing, but there's currently no enforcement strategy comparable to its inspection of in-person stores.\n\nIf the FDA investigates an online store and finds evidence of illegal sales to minors, that retailer will likewise be issued a warning letter followed by escalating civil fines or a no-tobacco-sale order. However, a December 2022 report by the Office of Inspector General found the FDA issued 899 warning letters to online retailers between 2010 and 2020 but issued no fines or other enforcement actions.\n\nSince enforcing tobacco sales laws online is more expensive and complicated than in brick-and-mortar stores, a complete ban on tobacco sales online, either federally or at the state level, likely would be the most effective approach in preventing sales to minors, according to a report by the Mitchell Hamline School of Law.\n\n\"Issue No. 2, of course, is that we have to stop online sales,\" Crane said. \"There's no reason that you should be able to sell a deadly product online.\"\n\nFrom the editor: Why The Enquirer spent 6 months investigating teen vaping\n\nAre there better ways of enforcement?\n\nEnforcement of tobacco laws would be easier if retailers were required to obtain a tobacco retail license, said Page Dobbs, an associate professor of public health at the University of Arkansas. Licensing, she said, allows authorities to better track tobacco sellers and revoke their ability to sell tobacco after repeat violations.\n\nOhio and Kentucky do not have tobacco retail license laws, but major cities including Cincinnati, Columbus and Louisville have in recent years adopted their own. Locally, the cities of Norwood, Hamilton and Middletown also have tobacco retail license laws.\n\nCrane said the Preventing Tobacco Addiction Foundation has applied for a $900,000 federal grant to implement tobacco retail licensing across Ohio.\n\nCincinnati’s tobacco retail licensing ordinance went into effect in late 2019 and requires business owners selling tobacco products to obtain a license for every property and vending machine they operate.\n\nLast year, the Cincinnati Health Department made 144 underage buy attempts, with 16 instances in which someone under 21 was able to purchase tobacco. In 2021, the city conducted 289 buy attempts, with tobacco sold to an underage buyer in 128 cases.\n\nSting operations are conducted at every licensed tobacco retailer in the city at least once every two years, Jose Marques, a department spokesperson, said in an email. Penalties for selling to minors under the city’s ordinance include fines, which are used to fund enforcement and license revocation.\n\nAnother strategy is to create a limit for the number of licenses issued per capita so that when a tobacco retail license is revoked, the retailer doesn’t get it back, Dobbs said.\n\n“It puts an extra level of pressure on retailers to own their responsibility and compliance, and to take it seriously when the law is passed,” she added.\n\nWhile experts say local health departments are in a better position to enforce tobacco sales laws because they can tailor policies to the needs of their communities, enforcement of Cincinnati’s tobacco retail licensing has already faced pitfalls.\n\nNo underage buys were attempted in 2020, the first year they were due to happen, because of COVID-19-related restrictions, Marques said. Last year, staffing constraints and reduced availability of underage buyers stymied the city’s enforcement efforts, leading to a lower overall number of buy attempts.\n\nWhen told of Cincinnati's difficulties in enforcing its licensing law, Crane said: “We are going to be focusing on watching the watchers because there’s always going to be challenges. But if you don’t keep an eye on them, then bad things will happen.”\n\nRead all the stories in this special report here.\n\nThis project was underwritten, in part, by Interact for Health.

Steven McCraw said.\n\nThe gunman was killed more than an hour after he started shooting inside Robb Elementary School. Members of a specialized Border Patrol unit had entered the classroom, with one holding a shield followed by at least two others who engaged the shooter, according to a US Customs and Border Protection official.\n\nThe gunman is believed to have waited for the agents to enter the room, then kicked open the closet door and began shooting, the source said.\n\nThe agents had used a key to get into the classroom, opening the door while standing off to the side since the gunman had been shooting through the door, the source said.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the detail on the gunman emerging from the classroom closet.\n\nThe timeline of events that were part of the law enforcement response became more clear and more disturbing to the victims’ families Friday as McCraw explained the school district police chief was the incident commander who made the decision not to breach the classroom door.\n\nYet as officers stood in the hallway, children inside Robb Elementary School classrooms 111 and 112 in Uvalde repeatedly called 911 and pleaded for help, he said. They were in the middle of the deadliest school shooting since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.\n\n“From the benefit of hindsight where I’m sitting now, of course it was not the right decision,” McCraw said of the supervisor’s call not to confront the shooter. “It was the wrong decision. Period. There’s no excuse for that.”\n\nLATEST UPDATES ON THE UVALDE SCHOOL SHOOTING\n\nThe official who was the school district police chief, Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, officials said Friday.\n\nArredondo has nearly three decades of law enforcement experience, according to the school district, and was recently elected to a seat on Uvalde’s city council. He previously served as a captain at a school district police department in Laredo, Texas, and in multiple roles at the Uvalde Police Department.\n\nArredondo has not spoken about the shooting publicly since two very brief press statements on the day of the tragedy. CNN attempted to reach him at his home on Friday, but there was no response.\n\nIn all, 80 minutes passed between when officers were first called to the school at 11:30 a.m. to when a tactical team entered locked classrooms and killed the gunman at 12:50 p.m., McCraw said. The tactical team was able to enter using keys from a janitor, he added.\n\nWithin that period, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos killed 19 children and two teachers – marking at least the 30th shooting at a K-12 school in 2022. And while, as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said, the massacre could have been worse, the law enforcement response suggests it could have been better.\n\nThe delayed response runs contrary to commonly taught active shooter protocol, established after the Columbine school shooting of 1999, to stop the shooter as quickly as possible and even bypass helping the injured. The revelations also help explain why officials have offered contradictory information over the past three days as to what law enforcement did in response.\n\n“The levels of failure are just incredible, beyond belief,” said Anthony Barksdale, the former acting Baltimore police commissioner.\n\nAlfred Garza, the father of 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza, who was killed in the attack, said he believes someone should be held accountable for the delayed response.\n\n“They should have reacted quicker, faster,” he said. “Had they done that? You know, maybe we would have a different result.”\n\nGovernor livid over misinformation\n\nGov. Abbott told reporters Friday he was misled by authorities the day after the shooting, and he is livid.\n\nAbbott said he took careful notes from his briefing on Wednesday, calling what he told the public “a recitation of what people in that room told me.” He added, “As everybody has learned, the information that I was given turned out, in part, to be inaccurate, and I’m absolutely livid about that.”\n\nThe governor was in Uvalde for a news conference about the state response for the families of those affected by the shooting, but reporters pressed Abbott on the law enforcement response and the information given to the public about the shooting.\n\n“My expectation is the law enforcement leaders that are leading the investigations … they get to the bottom of every fact with absolute certainty,” he said.\n\nAbbott said the people who deserve accurate answers the most are the families whose “lives have been destroyed.”\n\n“It is inexcusable that they may have suffered from any inaccurate information whatsoever,” he said.\n\nSchool back door had been propped open\n\nThe area around the Robb Elementary School signs has become a memorial dedicated to the victims of the May 24 mass shooting.

That 911 call came at 11:30 a.m.\n\nThe gunman then moved toward the school parking lot and began shooting into classroom windows, McCraw said. A school resource officer, who was not on campus at the time, heard the 911 call and rushed to the school but drove past the suspect, who was hunkered down behind a vehicle, McCraw said.\n\nThe suspect then entered the school via the propped door at 11:33 a.m. and went to the adjoining classrooms 111 and 112, where he continued shooting, McCraw said.\n\nTwo minutes later, seven officers arrived to the school and approached the locked classrooms where the gunman had barricaded himself. Two of the officers were shot by the suspect from behind the door and suffered graze wounds, McCraw said.\n\nThe gunman fired 16 more rounds inside the locked classrooms between 11:37 and 11:44 a.m., and more officers continued to arrive to the hallway, McCraw said.\n\nAt about the same time, the Robb Elementary School posted on its Facebook that the school was on lockdown due to gunshots in the area. Outside the school, distraught parents soon began to arrive, desperate to know whether their kids were still alive, leading to confrontations with police trying to set up a perimeter.\n\nInside the school, there were as many as 19 law enforcement officers in the hallway at 12:03 p.m., yet they remained outside and waited for further tactical team and equipment, McGraw said.\n\nThat very minute, at 12:03 p.m., police received a 911 call from a girl who identified herself and whispered she’s in Room 112, McCraw said. She stayed on the phone for 1 minute, 23 seconds. At 12:10 p.m. she called back and said there were multiple people dead. She called again three minutes later.\n\nMembers of the Border Patrol tactical team, known as BORTAC, arrived with shields at 12:15 p.m. There they waited.\n\nThe girl called again at 12:16 p.m. and said there were eight to nine students alive, McGraw said. Another student called 911 from Room 111 three minutes later but hung up at the urging of another student. On a 911 call at 12:21 p.m., three shots can be heard, he said.\n\nThe gunman had fired over 100 rounds in the first minutes of the shooting, but the gunfire after that was sporadic and aimed at the door, McCraw said.\n\n“The belief was that there may not be anybody living anymore and that the subject has now tried to keep law enforcement at bay or entice them to come in to (die by) suicide,” he said.\n\nA female student called 911 at 12:36 p.m. that lasted for 21 seconds, but then called back and was told to stay on the line and remain quiet. At 12:43 p.m. and 12:47 p.m. she asked 911 to please send police now.\n\nFinally, at 12:50 p.m., the tactical team entered the room and shot and killed the suspect.\n\nSurviving children describe what happened inside\n\n10-year-old survivor says 'almost all' of his friends died in the shooting 02:42 • Source: CNN 10-year-old survivor says 'almost all' of his friends died in the shooting 02:42\n\nChildren who survived the shooting described what happened inside the school during the mayhem.\n\nTo survive the nightmare, Miah Cerrillo, 11, smeared her friend’s blood all over herself and played dead, she told CNN.\n\nMiah and her classmates were watching the movie “Lilo and Stitch” when teachers Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia got word of a shooter in the building. One teacher went to lock the door, but the shooter was right there – and shot out the door’s window, Miah said.\n\nAs her teacher backed into the classroom, the gunman followed. He then looked a teacher in the eye, said “Goodnight,” and shot her, the girl recalled.\n\nAnd then he opened fire, shooting the other teacher and many of Miah’s friends. Bullets flew by her, Miah said, and fragments hit her shoulders and head. The gunman next went through a door into an adjoining classroom. Miah heard screams and more gunshots. When the firing stopped, the shooter started playing music that was “sad, like you want people to die,” the girl said.\n\nScared he would come back to kill her and her few surviving friends, Miah put her hands into the blood of a slain friend lying next to her and smeared herself with it, she said. The girl and a friend managed to grab a dead teacher’s phone and call 911 for help, she said. She told a dispatcher, “Please send help because we’re in trouble.”\n\nThe pair then lay down and played dead.\n\nAnother student in a different classroom, 10-year-old Jayden Perez, said when he and his classmates heard gunfire, his teacher locked the door and told them to “hide and be quiet.”\n\nJayden said he was hiding near the storage area for backpacks during the shooting. Others in his class were under a table. The entire time, he wondered what was going to happen to them.\n\n“It was very terrifying because I never thought that was going to happen,” he told CNN. “(I’m) still sad about some of my friends that died.”\n\nHe does not want to go back to school again.\n\n“No, because after what happened. I don’t want to. I don’t want anything to do with another shooting or me in the school,” he said. “And I know it might happen again, probably.”\n\nParents outside school begged for action\n\nParents seen frustrated with police at shooting scene in new video 06:08 • Source: CNN Parents seen frustrated with police at shooting scene in new video 06:08\n\nOutside the school, chaos and confusion reigned as distraught parents showed up and implored law enforcement to force their way in and kill the gunman. One father even asked officers to give him their gear, he said.\n\n“I told one of the officers myself, if they didn’t want to go in there, let me borrow his gun and a vest, and I’ll go in there myself to handle it. And they told me no,” Victor Luna told CNN. His son survived.\n\nInstead, officers held parents behind yellow police tape, refusing to let them enter as crying and screaming echoed around them, several videos show.\n\nMembers of the US Marshals Service can be seen in one video holding back parents who pleaded to enter the school. US Marshals said in a statement they were called to the school at 11:30 a.m. and arrived about 40 minutes later from Del Rio, about 70 miles away.\n\nThe first deputy US Marshals to arrive entered the school to assist the Border Patrol tactical team already engaging with the shooter. The deputies also rendered aid to victims. Other deputies were asked to secure the perimeter around the school, but never arrested or placed anyone in handcuffs, the agency said.\n\n“Our deputy marshals maintained order and peace in the midst of the grief-stricken community that was gathering around the school,” the agency said.\n\nUvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez issued a statement Thursday defending his officers’ response to the shooting amid the growing criticism.\n\n“It is important for our community to know that our officers responded within minutes” alongside school resource officers, he said.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez Eric Levenson Virginia Langmaid Shimon Prokupecz Nora Neus", "Priscilla Alvarez", "Eric Levenson", "Virginia Langmaid", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Nora Neus"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/us/brooklyn-subway-shooting", "title": "A quiet morning commute quickly became a 'war zone' leaving more ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nPassengers on a Manhattan-bound train had to dodge bullets while being blinded by smoke during the Tuesday morning commute, setting off a manhunt for a gunman whose motives are still unknown.\n\nCommuters were riding the subway as it neared the 36th Street subway station in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park just before 8:30 a.m. when the gunman opened two smoke grenades, brandished a 9 mm handgun and fired at least 33 times striking 10 people – seven men and three women – according to NYPD Chief of Detectives James W. Essig.\n\nLive updates: Multiple people shot in Brooklyn\n\nThose 10 people were moved to area hospitals. An additional 13 people were injured via smoke inhalation, falling down or panic attacks, Essig said. Hospital representatives told CNN Tuesday’s shooting left at least 29 people injured, who were treated at three nearby hospitals for injuries, none of which are life-threatening.\n\n“We saw a quiet Tuesday morning turn an N train into a war zone as a smoke bomb was detonated, and multiple shots rang out,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said, adding the quick response from MTA, passengers and first responders saved lives.\n\nAuthorities found a U-Haul truck in Brooklyn that is suspected of being connected with the subway shooting. WABC\n\nFive of the victims injured were students commuting to school, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters outside Maimonides Medical Center. She said she met with a 12-year-old, a 13-year-old, a 16-year-old and two 18-year-olds at the hospital, which is the only pediatric trauma hospital in the area.\n\nA credit card and keys to a U-Haul van that had been rented in Philadelphia were found at the scene, police said. Both items helped investigators find a U-Haul van in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe bomb squad cleared the van and then it will be transported to a forensic location where the FBI NYPD and others can go through the vehicle in a controlled indoor environment.\n\nThe NYPD identified a man named Frank James, 62, as a “person of interest” in the shooting. James is believed to be the renter of the U-Haul vehicle found in Brooklyn and has addresses in both Wisconsin and Philadelphia, NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said Tuesday.\n\n“Mr. James is just a person of interest we know right now who rented that U-Haul van in Philadelphia,” Essig said. “The key to that U-Haul van was found in the subway in our shooter’s possessions. We don’t know right now if Mr. James has any connection to the subway. That’s still under investigation.”\n\nThe van was rented on Monday from a U-Haul store in Philadelphia, according to company records obtained by CNN. The rental agreement obtained by CNN shows the U-Haul reservation was made Wednesday, and was scheduled to be picked up Monday at 2:01 p.m. The van was supposed to be rented for two days, according to the reservation.\n\nThe records show James rented the van using a Wisconsin license with a Milwaukee address.\n\nNYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said there are possibly some social media postings connected to James in which he mentions homelessness, New York and Mayor Eric Adams. The mayor’s security detail was heightened out of an abundance of caution, Sewell said.\n\nNew York City agencies are offering a joint $50,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest of the suspect involved in Tuesday’s shooting, according to a statement from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).\n\nLater at the scene, investigators found a Glock 9 mm handgun, three extended magazines, two detonated smoke grenades, two non-detonated smoke grenades, a hatchet and a U-Haul key, Essig said. The key led to authorities finding the van in Brooklyn.\n\nTwo officials said they believe the gun jammed during the shooting. Sewell said there were no known active explosive devices on the train. The attack is not being investigated as an act of terrorism, but authorities have not ruled anything out, she said.\n\nThe photo gallery below contains graphic images.

Transit crime, broadly, is up 68% compared to last year, numbers closer to where they were at pre-pandemic levels, according to an NYPD summary of statistics current through Sunday.\n\nThe city tweeted later Tuesday because of the MTA disruptions, the NYC Ferry is waiving fares on the South Brooklyn route for the rest of the day and will “provide additional service during the evening commute.”\n\nWitness says he sat next to shooting suspect\n\nHourari Benkada, 27, told CNN he was sitting next to the subway shooting suspect on the “N” train Tuesday morning and was shot in the back of his knee while trying to flee.\n\n“I feel shocked, I feel shaky, I don’t know if I can ever ride a train,” Benkada, a lifelong New Yorker, told CNN after coming out of surgery.\n\nBenkada, a Housekeeping Manager at the New Yorker Hotel, said he got on the last car of the N train and sat next to a man with a duffel bag who was wearing an MTA vest.

Tunkel, who went to the hospital for smoke inhalation, said several gunshot victims were laying on the floor of the subway platform after the train arrived at the station.\n\n“One of the guys who was shot, his leg was bleeding pretty bad, so I took off my jacket and tied it around his leg,” she said.\n\nTunkel was in the subway car where the shooting took place and described the scene as chaotic. While she couldn’t see anything because of the smoke, she said she heard people crying out for help and others who said they were bleeding.\n\n“You couldn’t see anything, but you could feel it,” she said. People were rushing to the front of the car, and some fell to the ground, she noted. “You could feel the bodies.”\n\nYav Montano told CNN he was on the express train heading to work when smoke filled the subway car and he heard what sounded like fireworks. The train was between stations at the time, so panicked passengers tried to move to another train car to get further away from the smoke, he said.\n\n“The whole car was engulfed in smoke,” he said. “I couldn’t even use my mask anymore because it was black with smoke. It was ridiculous.”\n\nAbout 40 to 50 people were on the train at the time, he said. He was not sure how many were injured but said he saw a lot of blood on the floor of the train.

Then, he saw a pool of blood, and victims nearby. At first, French said he thought they had been stabbed, but soon realized they’d been shot.\n\nAfter snapping a few photos, French said he put his camera bag down and went to help the four victims he remembered were laying on the ground.

There are almost 10,000 cameras in the MTA system including almost 600 cameras on the Brooklyn section of where the attack took place, MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\n“We’re going to work with the NYPD to capture all that video to find out where this criminal may have come in or out of the system,” Lieber said. “And we’re also just reviewing with everybody who is involved, all of the information.”\n\nThe NYPD activated the city’s “Unified Victim Identification System” (UVIS) Tuesday in response to the subway shooting, the department tweeted. The UVIS is a “disaster management system that manages and coordinates all of the activities related to missing persons reporting and victim identification” and enables “centralized communications and data collection processes,” according to an official city guide on the system.\n\nThe system was previously used in response to various emergencies in New York City, including the East Harlem building explosion and Hurricane Sandy. It was also activated in April 2020, so New Yorkers could file a report about a friend or loved one who may have gone missing due to Covid-19.\n\nBrooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood is located in the southwest part of the borough and has a significant number of residents who are Asian and Hispanic. Each group makes about a third of its more than 135,000 residents, according to US Census data. The southern part of the neighborhood has emerged as Brooklyn’s Chinatown due to its growing population of immigrants from the Fujian province in China.\n\nShootings on the rise in New York\n\nThe shooting comes as violence in New York City and across the US has increased since the Covid-19 pandemic, reversing a decades long decline.\n\nIn New York, more than 360 people have been shot this year in 322 shooting incidents, increases of about 8% and 9% from last year, respectively, according to data reported by NYPD through Sunday. Over the last two years, shootings in New York are up 72.2 percent, and shooting victims up 70.4 percent.\n\nTuesday’s subway attack is the second mass shooting, defined as at least four people shot, in Brooklyn this year and the fourth in New York State, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The first Brooklyn mass shooting of the year was on January 13 at a Brooklyn event hall. There have been more than 100 mass shootings in the US so far this year.\n\nLieber, the MTA chair and CEO, said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Adams made commitments very early on in the new year to keeping the city’s subway system safe.\n\n“They have put more officers both on the platforms and on the train where people feel vulnerable,” Lieber explained, “And there are, you know, there’s an enormous effort to reach out to some of the people who for whatever reason have been sheltering in the subway system.”\n\nIn February New York City unveiled a comprehensive plan, dubbed The Subway Safety Plan, aimed at combating crime and addressing homelessness in the subway system to expand response teams of health, police and community officials across the city.\n\nMayor Adams emphasized the entire nation is witnessing a high level of violence, not only New York City.\n\n“We’re facing is a problem that is hitting our entire nation right now and that is why this is a national response,” Adams told CNN’s Dana Bash. “We need a national response to this issue.”\n\nIncluding Tuesday’s shooting, there have been 131 mass shootings in America this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit tracking gun death and injury. Those shootings left 141 people dead and 547 people wounded.\n\nAs a result of the attack, the Brooklyn Nets told fans to expect an “increased security presence” at Tuesday night’s postseason play-in tournament game against the Cleveland Cavaliers at Barclays Center, the team tweeted Tuesday.\n\n“Your safety and security is our top priority, and we are working closely with our law enforcement partners,” the tweet read. “Fans should plan to arrive early and expect an increased security presence at Barclays Center.”\n\nMass transit systems in the US increased patrols and asked the public to report anything unusual in the wake of the attack. In California, both the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) have either increased police presence at stations or are on “heightened alert” as a result of the incident in New York.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misspelled FDNY First Deputy Commissioner Laura Kavanagh's last name.", "authors": ["Brynn Gingras Pervaiz Shallwani Mark Morales Kristina Sgueglia Eric Levenson Amir Vera Shimon Prokupecz", "Brynn Gingras", "Pervaiz Shallwani", "Mark Morales", "Kristina Sgueglia", "Eric Levenson", "Amir Vera", "Shimon Prokupecz"], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/politics/us-russia-joe-biden-vladimir-putin-ukraine-politics-diplomacy", "title": "Why a Putin summit would be a huge risk for Biden | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nBy agreeing in principle to a summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, President Joe Biden is reaching for a signature foreign policy win, but accepting massive political and strategic risks that could easily backfire.\n\nBiden’s last-ditch, still-tentative and highly conditioned agreement to meet the Russian President came after a weekend of frenzied diplomacy and alarming new US claims that Russia was about to invade Ukraine.\n\nThere are real doubts that the meeting, brokered by French President Emmanuel Macron, will ever take place. The White House said Sunday it will go ahead only “if an invasion hasn’t happened.”\n\nAny summit is contingent on the outcome of talks between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Europe this week. That meeting also depends on the condition that Moscow’s troops don’t further encroach into Ukraine.\n\n“Blinken and Lavrov will discuss further if the invasion hasn’t started by then – in which case it’s all off,” an official told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Arlette Saenz.\n\nNo timetable or venue for any presidential summit has been set. White House press secretary Jen Psaki also stressed that if Russia chose to invade Ukraine anyway, the US would impose “swift and severe consequences. … And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.”\n\nOnly hours before news of a possible summit emerged after a late-night call between Macron and Putin – following a previous conversation between the French President and Biden – the US warned it had intelligence suggesting that the Russian strongman had already given his field commanders orders to invade Ukraine. And on Monday morning, Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan painted a dire picture of the situation around Ukraine, saying an “extremely violent” attack could happen in the “coming hours or days.”\n\n“It will cost the lives of Ukrainians and Russians, civilians and military personnel alike. But we also have intelligence to suggest that there will be an even greater form of brutality because this will not simply be some conventional war between two armies: It will be a war waged by Russia on the Ukrainian people, to repress them, to crush them, to harm them,” Sullivan said on NBC’s “Today” show.\n\nThe extreme distrust shared by all parties to the conflict – Russia, Ukraine and Western allies – means this diplomatic breakthrough will hang by a thread. Recent US and Russian exchanges have been characterized by contempt, suspicion and sarcasm. So there’s hardly a guarantee of success if Lavrov and Blinken meet. Any outcome of a summit that preserves Ukraine as a functioning, democratic state would likely be seen as a defeat by Putin.\n\nAnd the situation around Ukraine’s borders, where more than 150,000 Russian troops are at high alert, is so tense that local clashes could spark a wider conflagration and shut down diplomacy. The US and its allies will also be alive to the possibility that Putin is willing to talk not because he’s blinking in the standoff, but is instead seeking a way to divide America from its friends before an invasion.\n\nBut if Putin does hold off from what was seen in Washington as an almost certain fresh incursion into Ukraine, it will count as a temporary success for the White House’s aggressive war of information meant to remove the element of surprise from his vast troop buildup and to thwart any faked rationale for an invasion.\n\nAny time a war is averted, especially one in which the US predicted thousands of civilian casualties, it prevents tragedy, misery and the possibility of destabilizing refugee flows. Therefore it is incumbent on everyone to try. Russia was non-committal on the idea of a summit with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that there were so far “no concrete plans.”\n\nEven France, which helped broker the idea of a meeting between Putin and Biden, cautioned much work needed to be done before they could get together. “We are making our last efforts, the most intense, to avoid the worst,” a source at the French presidential palace told reporters on Monday.\n\nBiden’s political gamble\n\nEven if the apparent agreement for a summit holds Biden will be taking a significant gamble.\n\nHawkish Republicans are sure to accuse him of appeasing the Russian strongman and of rewarding his aggression in holding Ukraine hostage. If a meeting with Putin fails and an invasion follows regardless, Biden will open himself up to charges of weakness.\n\nAny summit that is not comprehensively choreographed for success beforehand is a political high-wire act. And Biden can ill-afford blows to his prestige, with his approval rankings sliding and after his claims to statesmanship were dented by the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.\n\nStill, presidents are elected to make the toughest decisions. If Biden refused to meet and war erupted in Ukraine, he would be accused of not testing diplomacy to its limit. And he has some potential cover: If Putin backtracks and a summit doesn’t happen, he will let Biden off a political hook.\n\nBlinken effectively explained the President’s openness to diplomacy despite his belief that an invasion was imminent during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“We believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,” Blinken told CNN’s Dana Bash.\n\nThe skeptical tone of the White House’s statement explaining Biden’s “in principle” openness to a meeting, however, was not just rooted in suspicion of Russian motives. It also appeared to be an attempt to insulate the President from political attacks at home.\n\nBut there are reasons to take the risk. Despite the fact that the US will not send troops to defend Ukraine because it is not a NATO member, Biden has a genuine domestic rationale for avoiding war in Ukraine. Any Russian invasion could cause a spike in already rising gasoline prices and inflation rates that could further harm Democrats’ chances in the midterm elections.\n\nIs Biden playing into Putin’s game?\n\nAs well as shouldering a big political risk, Biden will brave treacherous geopolitical ground if he meets Putin.\n\nOne theory of the Russian leader’s build-up around Ukraine is that he wants to restore the Kremlin’s Cold War prestige as an equal power of the US. In essence, Biden is granting Putin that platform, even though many in Washington regard Russia as a greatly diminished force, despite its formidable nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe same accusation – that a US President was granting the concession of equal prestige – surrounded ex-President Donald Trump’s inconclusive summits with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. There is little chance of the affection on display at those love-ins being repeated in frosty Biden/Putin talks.\n\nBut Putin would also clearly like to debate and decide the great affairs of nations with the US – as was the case during Cold War summits between the US and the Soviet Union. The fact that this potential encounter was arranged by the French will ease some fears in Europe that US allies are being marginalized – a factor that did rear its head early in the Ukraine crisis.\n\nThe Élysée Palace said that other “stakeholders” will be included. That could include Ukraine and other NATO allies, including ex-Warsaw Pact members in Eastern Europe. But the French presidency did not offer further details. The prominent role of Macron, who is seeking to become the dominant European statesman after the retirement of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and faces a reelection campaign in a matter of weeks, will not go unnoticed inside or outside of France.\n\nA total disconnect\n\nThe most fundamental threat to the success of any Putin-Biden talks is the incompatible nature of the two sides’ positions.\n\nThe Russians are demanding an assurance that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO and want the alliance to pull weapons and troops out of member states that were once behind the Iron Curtain, like Poland, Hungary and Romania. That condition is non-negotiable for the West, which says it is up to individual nations to decide their destinies.\n\nThe US rejects Russian warnings that it feels threatened by NATO’s eastern expansion after the Cold War, styling the alliance as purely defensive. This position might make sense in Western capitals, but it does not take into account bruised Russian pride – the root of Putin’s two-decade effort to reshape the accepted outcome of the Cold War after the Soviet Union’s collapse.\n\nIn repeatedly trying to destabilize Ukraine, the Russian leader has also made clear his determination never to allow the former Soviet republic to make an ideological move west towards NATO and the EU. So any face-saving effort could undercut his historic mission and be hard for him to accept.\n\nBut if Putin has decided that the costs of an invasion of Ukraine – punishing Western sanctions and a possible bloody insurgency in the country are too much to bear – Biden may be able to construct a diplomatic off-ramp for the Russian leader. There are many issues, including arms control, stemming conflict in cyberspace and thwarting the spread of nuclear weapons, that could make each side safer.\n\nBut these issues are hostage to the same fundamental disconnect between Russia and the US that has boiled during the Ukraine conflict – and show why any summit between Biden and Putin will be seen as tentative until it occurs and why success is unlikely.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/us/uvalde-texas-elementary-school-shooting-what-we-know", "title": "Uvalde Texas school shooting: What we know about the Texas ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWe may never know why a shooter gunned down 19 children and two teachers in a massacre Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, two days before summer break.\n\nBut as the nation mourns 21 lives lost, disturbing details have emerged about the shooter’s behavior in the weeks leading up to the shooting as well as unsettling questions about police officers’ delayed response to America’s deadliest school shooting since 2012.\n\nPerhaps the most pressing questions are how and why the shooter managed to remain inside the school for more than an hour before law enforcement shot him dead.\n\nArmed with a rifle, the 18-year-old barricaded himself inside adjoining classrooms, where he shot and killed children and their teachers who tried to protect their them.\n\nOne 11-year-old student survivor, Miah Cerrillo, told CNN on Friday that she smeared her classmate’s blood on her face and played dead to avoid being targeted by the shooter.\n\nOutside the bloody crime scene, up to 19 officers were in the hallway but did not storm the classrooms because the commanding officer mistakenly believed the “active shooter” portion of the attack had ended, Col. Steven McCraw, who heads the Texas Department of Public Safety, said Friday during a news conference. Most of the shots were heard in the initial minutes of the siege, with later outbursts seemingly directed at the door.\n\n“Of course it was not the right decision,” McCraw said. “It was the wrong decision, period. There’s no excuse for that.”\n\nA school resource officer was not on campus when the violence started, and he then drove past the suspect to meet with a teacher he mistook for the shooter, officials said Friday, contradicting earlier information that the shooter was met by officers upon entering the school.\n\nAlso revealed Friday: A teacher had propped open the door the shooter used to enter the school, where he fired more than 100 bullets.\n\nGET THE LATEST UPDATES ON THE SHOOTING\n\nHere’s what we know and what we don’t know:\n\nGunman shot his grandmother, texted his plans and crashed his car\n\nSalvador Ramos, an 18-year-old from Uvalde, was the gunman, authorities have said. Officials said the gunman purchased his rifles, one of which was used in the attack, with a debit card.\n\nMinutes before the horrific attack, Ramos allegedly sent a series of text messages to a teenage girl in Europe whom he had met online, describing how he had just shot his grandmother and would “shoot up a(n) elementary school.”\n\nThe area around the Robb Elementary School signs has become a memorial dedicated to the victims of the May 24 mass shooting.

He told her it was a surprise and to “just wait for it,” she said.\n\nOn Tuesday, at 11:01 a.m. CT, Ramos called and told her he loved her, she said.\n\nWhen the horrific school attack unfolded\n\nAlthough authorities have released conflicting information on law enforcement’s response to the shooting, here’s what we know about the timeline of Tuesday’s shooting (all times Central) – as of Friday night.\n\n• 11:21 a.m.: The shooter allegedly engaged in a text message exchange with the girl in Germany, telling her he shot his grandmother. The 66-year-old was in serious condition Wednesday at a San Antonio hospital, officials said.\n\n• 11:27: Video shows a teacher propping open a school door to the outside, McCraw said Friday. The door is “typically locked,” said Ross McGlothlin, a former principal for the school. “It’s an exterior door that you don’t need to go to unless you’re leaving to go home on a school bus,” McGlothlin said.\n\n• 11:28 a.m.:The shooter crashed his grandmother’s pickup in a ditch near the school, DPS Regional Director Victor Escalon said during a news conference Thursday. Ramos got out of the truck, carrying a rifle and bag, Escalon added. The cause of the crash was not clear, officials have said.\n\nThe shooter saw two people at a funeral home across the street and fired at them before continuing to walk toward the school, Escalon said. He climbed a fence into a parking lot and began shooting at the school.\n\nAt that point, no officers were at the school, Escalon said, walking back earlier information released by his agency that the gunman first encountered an armed school resource officer.\n\nA school resource officer “was not on campus,” McCraw said. The officer heard a 911 call, went to school and saw a teacher he mistook for the shooter, McCraw said. “In doing so, he drove right by the suspect who was hunkered down behind the vehicle where he began shooting at the school.”\n\n• 11:30 a.m.: US Marshals receive a call for help from an Uvalde police officer, the US Marshals Service said in a statement Friday. On Wednesday, US Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said his team received a call around this time.\n\n• 11:31 a.m.: The teacher who kept the door open called 911 to report the crash and a man with a gun, McCraw said.\n\n• 11:33 a.m.: The shooter walked into the west side of the school through the door propped open by the teacher, McCraw said. The shooter fired more than 100 rounds into classroom 111 or 112, which are adjoined, McCraw said.\n\n• 11:37 a.m.: More shots are heard from inside the classrooms. Officers gather in the hallway, McCraw said.\n\n“Officers are there, the initial officers, they received gunfire, they don’t make entry initially because of the gunfire they’re receiving. But we have officers that are calling for additional resources,” Escalon said, describing requests for equipment and personnel, including negotiators.\n\n• 12:03 p.m.: A student makes a 911 call from room 112 lasting 1 minute, 23 seconds. She calls back at 12:10 to report multiple deaths. She calls back at 12:13 and at 12:16 to say “eight or nine students” were alive, McCraw said.\n\n• 12:15 p.m.: Members of the Border Patrol Tactical Unit begin to arrive, according to McCraw. Some agents came from the field, and some who were off duty also sped in to respond, according to a source familiar with the situation.\n\n• 12:36 p.m.: Shots are heard on another 911 call.\n\n• 12:50 p.m.: The tactical team opens the door with a key from the janitor and shots can be heard on a 911 call, according to McCraw.\n\nA truck authorities believe belonged to the Robb Elementary School shooter sits crashed in a ditch. Marco Bello/Reuters\n\nShooter was in the school for an hour\n\nAuthorities faced backlash over the conflicting nature of information that has been released about the timeline of the shooting spree, particularly over the length of time the gunman was in the school before he was fatally shot.\n\nPedro “Pete” Arredondo, the Uvalde School District police chief, was acting as commander during law enforcement’s response to the mass shooting, McCraw said.\n\nWhen special agents with the US Border Patrol finally arrived at the school to offer backup, the chief made the call for the officers not to breach the classrooms the shooter had locked from the inside, McCraw said.\n\nThe officers waited for about 40 minutes before entering the classrooms. Some children called 911 and pleaded for help as the officers stood outside, McCraw said. The officers took no action while waiting for room keys and tactical equipment, a state official said at a news conference.\n\nIn all, 80 minutes had passed between when officers were first called to the school at 11:30 a.m. to when a tactical team entered locked classrooms and killed the gunman at 12:50 p.m., McCraw said.\n\nCNN attempted to reach Arredondo at his home on Friday, but there was no response.\n\nThe district had created a safety plan with its own police force, social media monitoring, and a threat-reporting system to “provide a safe and secure environment” for students, its website states. It’s not clear to what degree the plan was developed with active shooters in mind.\n\nWhat we know so far about the shooter …\n\nThree days before the shooting, a photo of two AR-15-style rifles appeared on an Instagram account tied to Ramos.\n\nRamos recently sent a former classmate a photo showing an AR-platform rifle, a backpack with rounds of ammunition, and several ammo magazines, said the peer, who didn’t want to be identified.\n\n“I was like, ‘Bro, why do you have this?’ and he was like, ‘Don’t worry about it,’” the friend told CNN. “He proceeded to text me, ‘I look very different now. You wouldn’t recognize me.’”\n\nRamos had stopped attending school regularly, the friend said. He worked at a local Wendy’s, the restaurant’s manager told CNN.\n\nRamos “kept to himself mostly” and “didn’t really socialize with the other employees,” evening manager Adrian Mendes said. “He just worked, got paid, and came in to get his check.”\n\nThe teen in Germany who said she and Ramos had communicated for weeks said Ramos told her he spent a lot of time alone at home.\n\n“Every time I talked to him,” she said. “He never had plans with his friends.”\n\nUsing the social media app Yubo, Ramos threatened girls he would rape them, showed off a rifle he bought and threatened to shoot up schools in livestreams.\n\nAmanda Robbins, 19, said Ramos verbally threatened to break down her door and rape and murder her after she rebuffed his sexual advances during a livestream.\n\nDuring another livestream, an 18-year-old Yubo user Hannah from Ontario, Canada, said she reported Ramos to Yubo in early April after he threatened to shoot up her school, rape, kill her and her mother.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a Yubo spokesperson said, “We are deeply saddened by this unspeakable loss and are fully cooperating with law enforcement on their investigation,” adding that an account has been banned and under investigation.\n\n… and the victims whose lives were stolen\n\nBy Wednesday morning, after hours filled with agony, several of the victims’ families confirmed they had received devastating news.\n\nJust hours before he was killed, 10-year-old Xavier Lopez was celebrated at Robb Elementary’s honor roll ceremony, his mother Felicha Martinez told The Washington Post.\n\n“He really couldn’t wait to go to middle school,” she said.\n\nAngel Garza spent seven hours searching for his 10-year-old daughter before learning Amerie Jo Garza was among the children killed, he said.\n\n“Please don’t take a second for granted,” Garza posted on Facebook. “Hug your family. Tell them you love them.”\n\nTen-year-old Eliahana “Elijah” Cruz Torres was also a victim, her aunt Leandra Vera told CNN. “Our baby gained her wings,” she said.\n\nTess Marie Mata, also 10, was killed in the shooting, too, her sister Faith Mata, 21, confirmed to the Washington Post. Tess was a fourth-grader who loved TikTok dances, Ariana Grande and the Houston Astros, Mata told the Post. She had been saving money for a family trip to Disney World.\n\n“My precious angel you are loved so deeply. In my eyes you are not a victim but a survivor.

The latter classification denotes \"a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence\" and includes drugs like ketamine and testosterone. A Schedule I classification is used when there is a \"high potential for abuse\" and the drug serves no medical purpose.\n\nThe order doesn't change marijuana's legal status federally but could clear the way for more research and medical use.\n\nIn Indiana, where marijuana is still illegal, it could provide extra pressure for the state to join its neighbors in legalizing some form of the substance.

This move could mark the most significant federal shift in cannabis policy in half a century.\n\n\"We're looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks,\" Trump said at an Aug. 11 news conference.\n\nThe federal government lists marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as a Schedule I drug — the category reserved for substances deemed highly dangerous, addictive and without medical value. Reclassifying it to Schedule III, as recommended by federal health officials in 2023, would put marijuana in the same legal tier as Tylenol with codeine and anabolic steroids, allowing it to be prescribed by licensed medical providers and dispensed by pharmacies.\n\nIt would not, however, legalize recreational use under federal law.\n\nWhat a federal shift could mean for Oklahoma\n\nOklahoma legalized medical marijuana in 2018 and more than 2,000 dispensaries now operate statewide. But under current law, adults can only purchase cannabis with a medical patient license.\n\nThat could change if voters approve State Question 837, which would legalize recreational sales for adults 21 and older. The measure cleared a major procedural hurdle in July and organizers have already started gathering signatures. Organizers have until Nov. 4 to collect at least 172,993 valid signatures to get on the ballot in 2026.\n\nIf Trump reclassifies marijuana to Schedule III, Oklahoma's medical marijuana market — already among the largest per capita in the nation — could see smoother banking operations, lower compliance risks for dispensaries and broader medical research opportunities. But the move would do nothing to authorize recreational sales in the state; that decision would still rest entirely with Oklahoma voters.\n\nThe push for SQ 837\n\nOklahomans for Responsible Cannabis Action (ORCA), the group behind SQ 837, is betting that public sentiment has shifted since voters rejected a similar measure, State Question 820, in 2023 by a 61% margin.\n\nThis time, ORCA is pursuing a constitutional amendment, making it harder for lawmakers to alter or repeal the law without another statewide vote. The proposal would tax recreational sales at 10% while preserving the medical system and exempting licensed patients from the new tax.\n\nThe campaign faces new hurdles, including a 2025 state law limiting how many petition signatures can come from a single county. That means ORCA can't rely solely on the city center like Tulsa or Oklahoma City for signatures and will have to fan out into rural areas — such as Harmon County, where just 117 residents will be allowed to sign.\n\n\"Maybe we'll go and hang out at the co-op for a day or go to the county courthouse,\" ORCA Director Jed Green said. \"Voters of Harmon County — get ready, we'll come out and visit.\"\n\nOpen primary supporters have challenged Senate Bill 1027 in the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which has not yet issued a ruling.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nTrump's comments come after years of fits and starts on federal marijuana policy.

During the 2024 campaign, Trump supported a ballot measure, which ultimately failed, that would have legalized the drug in the state of Florida.\n\n\"I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,\" Trump said in his statement about the Florida ballot initiative.\n\nMany Americans support marijuana legalization\n\nMarijuana is legal for medical or recreational use in 45 states and 64% of Americans supported legalization in a Gallup survey from October, up from 36% two decades ago. Support for legalization has dipped recently among Republicans, though, Gallup found.\n\nMarijuana would not become legal at the federal level if the drug were reclassified, but it would make it easier for the industry to operate and for research to be conducted on the drug.\n\nPrevious presidents consider reclassifying marijuana\n\nFormer President Joe Biden ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to review marijuana's classification in 2022, and the next year HHS called for listing marijuana as Schedule III, which the DEA describes as \"drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\" The Biden administration in 2024 proposed a rule to reschedule marijuana, but it has been on hold since March.\n\nIs marijuana legal in Kentucky?\n\nMedical marijuana became legal at the start of 2025 and was signed into law by Beshear in March of 2023.

Instead, the government should deschedule cannabis, removing it from the Controlled Substances Act and effectively legalizing it.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, and other legislators have repeatedly introduced legislation to essentially legalize weed. But they haven't gone anywhere.\n\nNote: This article was originally published in May 2024, when the Drug Enforcement Administration formally recommended rescheduling cannabis. It has been updated to an executive order from the Trump Administration expediting that process.\n\nWASHINGTON — Cannabis policy in the United States is going through big changes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected imminently to sign an executive order expediting the rescheduling of marijuana as a Schedule III drug, first reported by the Washington Post. It's the end of a nearly 18-month process that began under the Biden Administration and one of the most defining moments in drug policy this century.\n\n\"The facts compel the federal government to recognize that marijuana can be legitimate, in terms of medical applications when carefully administered. In some cases, this may be used as a substitute for addictive and potentially lethal opioid painkillers,\" Trump said in the Oval Office before signing the executive order. \"This can do it in a much lesser way. This can make people feel much better that are living through tremendous pain and problems.\n\n\"Forty states and multiple U.S. territories have already recognized the use of medical marijuana. This reclassification will make it far easier to conduct marijuana-related medical research, allowing us to study potential benefits and potential dangers in future treatments. It's going to have a tremendously positive impact, I believe,\" Trump said.\n\nBut just because cannabis will likely be rescheduled, it doesn't mean weed is legal in the United States. And it doesn't mean that medical marijuana is now legal on the federal level.\n\n“This Executive Order represents a meaningful and long-overdue acknowledgment by the federal government that cannabis does not belong in the same category as the most dangerous substances known to man,” American Cannabis Collective cofounder Don Murphy said in a statement. “By moving cannabis to Schedule III, President Trump has taken a decisive step toward aligning federal policy with science, patient experience, and the realities already recognized by a majority of states.”\n\nMeanwhile, 88% of Americans live in states that have some kind of medical marijuana law — and 53% live in states where weed is already legal for adult use, according to data from the Marijuana Policy Project and Census population estimates.\n\nIf it seems like a lot to comprehend, you're not alone.\n\nTrying to navigate the legal weed landscape has long been a tricky proposition. But with rescheduling on the docket and descheduling up for debate, here's what you need to know.\n\nSo, Trump is going to reschedule marijuana. What does that mean for me?\n\nIn short? Not much - especially in New Jersey.\n\nMarijuana will remain illegal at the federal level under rescheduling but, with 24 states now legalizing cannabis for adult use, the places where this is really an issue are becoming more rare.\n\nFor example, you still can't light a joint in a national park. And those with a marijuana conviction could still be disqualified from federal housing, food benefits and face deportation, according to the Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for U.S. drug policy reform.\n\nAnd it's still a felony to transport drugs across state lines, even if you're traveling between two states with legal weed laws, like New Jersey and New York.\n\nThen why bother rescheduling marijuana at all?\n\nIt's a pretty huge first step, even if it's mostly symbolic.\n\nRescheduling marijuana as a Schedule III drug is a monumental moment in U.S. drug policy history. Cannabis has been listed as a Schedule I drug - with no medicinal value and a high potential for addiction - for over 50 years, and that status served as the basis for decades of the War on Drugs.\n\nTrump's stance on legal weed seemed to soften during the 2024 presidential campaign. He pledged to rescheduling on the campaign trail, and encouraged Florida voters to support a referendum that would have legalized weed in the state. That referendum failed, with 56% of voters rejecting it.\n\nThe rescheduling process began under former President Joe Biden, himself considered by critics as an architect of that decades-long campaign; as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden authored or sponsored laws that instituted mandatory minimum prison sentences for drug crimes, including possession.\n\nBiden called for rescheduling in 2022 and repeatedly said that no one should be jailed just for marijuana possession or use.\n\nThat doesn't mean rescheduling isn't without benefits. Cannabis businesses will no longer fall under Section 280E of IRS tax code, which prohibits businesses involved in the \"trafficking\" of Schedule I and Schedule II substances from deducting \"ordinary and necessary\" business expenses from their taxes. That could result in lower prices for consumers and, at the least, make it easier for cannabis entrepreneurs to open and stay in business.\n\nSchedule III also, technically, allows for the medical prescription of cannabis - like other Schedule III drugs, such as ketamine, testosterone, anabolic steroids or Tylenol with codeine.\n\nThe only problem? The Food and Drug Administration hasn't actually approved cannabis for medical use - at least, not yet.\n\nWhat's the difference between rescheduling and descheduling?\n\nSchedule I drugs, like ecestasy, heroin and LSD, are determined to have no medicinal value with a high potential for addiction. Marijuana is getting rescheduled as a Schedule III drug, which means it has medicinal value witih a low to moderate potential for addiction.\n\nMarijuana legalization advocates are calling for the Biden Administration to instead completely remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act - to \"deschedule\" it entirely.\n\nIn broad terms, this would essentially decriminalize the drug on the federal level. The decision on whether to actually legalize weed would still be left up to states, but the federal government would tax and regulate it, as it does with alcohol and tobacco.\n\n\"We hope this move to Schedule III truly does open up medical research, that it inspires states to guarantee access to safe, regulated cannabinoids for patients who desperately need them, and that the regulated industry might finally be treated more fairly under the federal tax code,\" Marijuana Policy Project executive director Adam J. Smith said in a statement. \"But a move to Schedule III does nothing to end hundreds of thousands of possession arrests each year, nor does it do anything to fix the untenable, ongoing disconnect between federal prohibition and the regulated state markets under which more than half of American adults live.\n\n\"We are pleased that the President is taking this important step, but it is only a step. It is long past time to deschedule cannabis entirely and end nearly a century of failed prohibition,\" Smith said.\n\nWhy doesn't everyone want to legalize marijuana?\n\nLike any other drug, cannabis use can cause short-term and long-term effects.\n\nWhile the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA, reports that there has never been a cannabis overdose, that doesn't mean the drug is without risk.\n\nA February 2024 study published in the Heart Association journal reported that people who used cannabis daily had a 25% higher risk of heart attack and a 42% higher chance of stroke compared to those who didn't use the drug at all.\n\nAnd according to NIDA, people who begin using cannabis at a young age can face permanent IQ loss, and long-term use has been associated with temporary paranoia, hallucinations and can exacerbate symptoms of disorders such as schizophrenia.\n\nSmoking marijuana has a similar health impact to tobacco smoke, according to the institute, including respiratory issues such as a daily cough, phlegm and a higher risk of lung infections. But it's unclear if the drug leads to a greater risk of lung cancer.\n\n\"A drug isn’t medicine because it’s popular,\" said former White House Office of National Drug Control Policy advisor Dr. Kevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, the leading anti-legalization group. \"The Administration's effort to push through this action in an election year could be perceived as a thinly veiled attempt to reverse polling trends with the principal targets of the pot industry, namely young people.\"\n\nIn recommending the Department of Health and Human Services reschedule cannabis, scientists said cannabis users could develop moderate to low physical dependence and some psychological dependence but that withdrawal symptoms are \"relatively mild\" compared to alcohol.\n\nSo will the federal government ever legalize weed?\n\nIn recent years, bipartisan groups of senators have introduced legislation that would have largely legalized marijuana.\n\nMost prominently, Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, and Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, introduced the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act in 2024. As written, the bill would:\n\nDeschedule cannabis, eliminating the federal prohibition in legal weed states and placing federal jurisdiction under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.\n\nExpunge nonviolent marijuana offenses and allow those in prison to petition for resentencing.\n\nEstablish grant programs and expedited review processes for cannabis businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. (In state legal weed laws, these usually mean people with marijuana arrests or those from or opening up shop in communities with large Black and Hispanic populations with a high rate of marijuana arrests.).\n\nRemove \"unnecessary\" pre-employment and random drug testing for cannabis.\n\nRequire the FDA to establish labeling production and labeling standards.\n\nHere's the problem: Turning a bill into a law is subject to a lot of mitigating factors that, often, have nothing to do with the bill itself. And turning a bill into a law relatively unscathed - for example, protecting much of the details in the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act - is nearly impossible.\n\n\"To walk around in an institution where colleagues of mine have admitted openly about their marijuana use and, meanwhile, young people in this country - African Americans and Latinos - can't get jobs for doing the same things that presidents and senators and congresspeople have done is the height of hypocrisy,\" Booker said when the bill was introduced.\n\nThere's reason to be hopeful, though.\n\nSupport in the Senate has grown since Booker and Wyden first introduced a version of the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act in 2022. Last year, it had 22 sponsors in the Senate.\n\nBut they're all Democrats, despite voters in both parties largely supporting marijuana legalization. Legalizing marijuana on the federal level is going to require a number of Republicans to buy in, along with near-unanimous support by Democrats.\n\n\"What happened yesterday (the DEA recommending rescheduling marijuana) is really a kick in the pants,\" Wyden said at the time. \"Descheduling is a Republican's dream. This is a monument to state's rights.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Jeanine Santucci, Michael Collins, Eduardo Cuevas, and Joel Shannon contributed to this report.\n\nMike Davis is an investigative reporter with the Asbury Park Press, where he's covered local news, politics, transportation and the cannabis industry.
