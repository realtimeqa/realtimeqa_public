Here's what you said | Opinion", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump returns to the White House this Inauguration Day with the whole world watching – and talking – about it. Us included.\n\nBut we wanted to hear from you. As part of our new reader-driven feature, Forum, we asked you: What do you hope Trump will accomplish in his first 100 days, or what are you worried will happen? How do you feel about a second Trump presidency? Which issues are most important to you?\n\nHere's what you said.\n\nWhat do I see in Trump's first 100 days? Hope.\n\nLet me count the ways I’m optimistic about Donald Trump’s second term, both as a Trump voter and as a proud American citizen.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFirstly, a second Trump term could offer a renewed focus on economic growth ‒ true economic growth. Trump was committed to creating jobs, cutting taxes, and reducing burdensome regulations, and before COVID-19, the economy was witnessing unprecedented growth with low unemployment rates across demographics, including the lowest unemployment rate for Black Americans than at any point in history.\n\nA second term could reignite an economic engine that many argue is currently insufficient in helping Americans, especially those in the working class ‒ regardless of how the Democrats try to spin it with stagnant wages and an increase in the cost of living and basic goods.\n\nI hope that Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress can reduce government waste wherever possible to reduce our $36 trillion national debt and pay off our $2 trillion federal budget deficit without imposing tariffs on other countries (though there’s a part of me that doesn’t think he’s serious and is only saying that for leverage).\n\nTrump’s foreign policy is looking strong, too. The Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations, stand as a testament to his administration’s ability to forge peace in historically strained regions ‒ just like his diplomatic quests with North Korea, China and any other belligerents ‒ without resorting to needless violence, military conflict or sacrificing our troops.\n\nTrump has pledged to shut down our border to prevent further illegal immigration, something that has been desperately missing in our country. If you’ve watched the news for any length of time, you’ve heard about innocent people murdered by illegal immigrants, some of them deported only to return with no repercussions. Immigration is our gateway to the future, but we must also remember that the needs of our naturalized citizens come first. We’re a country, not a charity, and we’re especially a country with a set of laws to abide by.\n\nTrump’s leadership style might actually catalyze much-needed political reform. His second term might be the beginning of a political realignment in America – specifically, the Republicans washing their hands of the neocons for good and ushering in a new economic era, one that's more populist for the working and middle class and not created to line the pockets of a select few to purchase a yacht – as well as a reduction of spending where necessary. Let's just face it: It needs to be done.\n\nWhile Trump elicits strong sentiments on both sides of the aisle, the potential benefits of a second term deserve reflection. I trust his advisers will keep him in line to focus on the task at hand and not try to do too much, unlike his first term. Let us remain hopeful and engaged that America can achieve a better tomorrow for all built on health, wealth, safety, security, unity, peace, prosperity, American pride and, most important, happiness.\n\n— David Griffith, Cooper City, Florida\n\nI'm ecstatic for Trump's first 100 days. He loves our country.\n\nI was raised in a military family with a mom, dad and a brother. We traveled all over the United States and even overseas. I saw all types of people and was taught to respect my elders. We went to church and obeyed the laws. We were taught to work hard for the things we wanted, it was expected of us to give our best in every activity. We were also taught to love our neighbors as ourselves. We attended church and went to public schools. So I have a healthy respect for our military, first responders, medical professionals, teachers, police officers, etc.\n\nI believe that while Trump had a different upbringing, he believes in these things, too. I would like to see Trump begin to do in his first 100 days these things below:\n\nI want to see our military given the respect and provision they deserve. I want other nations to want to have a military like ours and have a healthy respect for us and not mess with us or our allies. I want to see police officers and firefighters given pay raises and provided for when tragedy occurs for them and their families. Support and fund public education so that parents don't have to resort to homeschooling to protect their children from violence or to ensure they get a good education. Teachers need pay raises as well. I want women's sports to be for women. If a biological male wants to play sports, let them play against others like them. I want the border secured. I have no problem for those individuals or families that want a better life in America but they need to go about it the correct way. Not by \"plowing\" over the border in great crowds or sneaking in under cover of darkness. I want those who prey on these individuals ‒ who promise to carry them over the border but instead abuse, victimize and kill them ‒ to be punished to the fullest extent. I want all Americans to pay their fair share of taxes. To close loopholes for the rich or criminal elements. I want our government officials to find a way to get along, compromise and work for solutions for all Americans, not just their special interests. I believe abortion rights need to be a state issue. I want the price of groceries, gas, housing and health care to be reduced. Big pharmaceutical companies and insurance agencies seem to be pushing the cost of medical care and medicine out of reach for a lot of Americans. Most young people these days can't afford to buy a home. I would like housing to be more accessible for those who want to purchase. I would like to see criminals convicted of horrible crimes made to face their punishment and not languish in prison or on death row for 20 years at our expense. I think more should be executed.\n\n— Leslie Melton, Saucier, Mississippi\n\nI'm rooting for Trump to be our best president ever. I'm also fearful.\n\nI’m fearful. I’m fearful that the rights I cherish, the rights we all cherish, the rights my own family fought for, will slowly die, erode and decay into a web of lies. I am fearful. I am fearful that the American dream available to my own ancestors, the American dream my own family fought for, will no longer be available to others – to the dreamers and doers and faithfully patriotic.\n\nI am a history teacher; my favorite holiday is Independence Day; my favorite subject is the American Revolution. I am fearful our deep love of country will be replaced with a deep well of spite and anger. I am fearful.\n\nFrom the right: Trump's to-do list: Fix the economy and border. All he must remember is KISS. | Opinion\n\nFrom the left: Happy Inauguration Day! Once Trump is president, America will become great again! | Opinion\n\nBut I am also hopeful. I am so hopeful he will be the best president we ever had. This is my hope for every president because I cannot find it in me to hope for any less for the country I love. The hope I hold burns bright, a light he cannot extinguish, a light they cannot extinguish. Because hope is the one thing no one can ever take away from us.\n\nMy fear is that it will be just as bad and chaotic as the last. But I will hope. I hope that in four years, I will say, “Wow, was I wrong about him? Wow, was I wrong about them? I was more wrong about this than anything I was ever wrong about in my entire life.”\n\nI will always hold out on hope. I will hope for my daughter. I will hope for me. And I will hope for you. And because I hope, I will vote. I will vote in every single election unless and until they take it away from me.\n\nI did not vote for him, but I refuse to fail as a country.\n\n— Amy Patalune, State College, Pennsylvania\n\nTrump wants to end war in 100 days. I believe in him.\n\nMilitant attacks, economic crises and global political maneuvering. These are the problems our 47th president must face, and he must solve these problems with a clear vision of perfection, otherwise, he’ll have scathing reviews from the American people and the American media. This is his master plan to fix these issues and create a legacy that will mark the end of what many have decided was a shimmering Republican revival.\n\nOne of Trump’s most difficult challenges to overcome has to be the global tension arising from countless wars. Trump has declared his unequivocal support to end the Israel-Hamas war altogether. However, the Republican Party has taken a hard-line stance to support Israel in all their endeavors. Trump's prior success with the Abraham Accords could lend him some credibility in negotiations.\n\nIf this new cease-fire deal succeeds, President Trump could easily use this in collaboration with Israel as a bargaining agreement with other factions of Islamist terrorism such as Hezbollah to end their conflicts with Western allies as well. If not, complete obliteration of this terrorist organization is in order.\n\nTrump’s diplomatic skills seem to be as great as they were in his first term, and not much has changed around the global political scene. The usual faces pop up here and there, but the new ones seem to be eager to forge ahead in complete agreement with the new American interests. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made it very clear in her congratulatory remarks to President Trump that she’s willing to purchase American energy, and that could be the foundation for a very attractive friendship with Europe and surrounding areas.\n\nNew NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has also made it clear that he’s willing to cooperate with President Trump on his policy measures. He could present resistance to Trump’s recent actions toward acquiring Greenland, but Trump’s tough bargaining tactics could easily bypass any concerns that Rutte may have.\n\nDiplomatically, it seems Trump is still intact and still very popular among the American-adjacent global elite.\n\nTrump’s first term, which many political analysts and regular Americans agree supercharged the Republican revival, was tainted by tremendously damaging exterior forces, including a split Congress, sickeningly partisan legal battles and, at the end of his term, COVID-19. Now, his favorability ratings have ballooned higher and higher after each failure of the Biden administration, and after his beaming performance in the election, the path to political glory looks bright for Donald Trump and the Republicans.\n\n— Noah Witherspoon, Broward County, Florida\n\nTrump 1.0 was a disaster. He remains despicable.\n\nIt’s hard to believe such a despicable character was elected president. Donald Trump is not a uniter. He is a divider. He is not a peacemaker. He is a hate enabler. History shows Trump will continue to lie, deny and be disingenuous. Those are not the qualities Americans need from their president.\n\nI believe he will restrict individual freedom. That he will favor big money above working-class Americans by extending tax cuts and continuing the lie that “trickle-down economics” works. Plans to deport immigrants will harm the economy and get people killed. The less affluent will be harmed by continued efforts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. Look how often Trump tried to eliminate it, demagoguing by saying it is socialism and echoing conservatives' cries about “death panels.” None of that has happened.\n\nTrump 1.0 was a disaster. I was hopeful the “outsider” would be schooled by his Cabinet. I was wrong. The years showed Trump as disrespectful of everyone, including military leaders and veterans. Republicans’ chaos created revolving-door House leaders like Paul Ryan, Eric Cantor, John Boehner, Mike McCarthy and now Mike Johnson, who won’t survive the far-right Freedom Caucus. A less qualified group of Cabinet picks are up for vetting, and the nepotism of the first term is continuing. Throw in folks like Chip Roy, Tommy Tuberville, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Elon Musk and expect to see a government shutdown over the budget. Stock market volatility will follow.\n\nPromised tariffs will hurt working-class Americans. Threatening our allies with tariffs, retaking the Panama Canal, buying Greenland and inviting Canada to become a state all add chaos and foster the idea internationally that America is an imperialist country.\n\nHow can Trump unite a polarized country when he and the Republicans refuse to negotiate with Democrats? That’s the wrong way to govern. Democrats can be similarly accused, but folks, it’s time both parties grow up and put the country’s collective interests first. And Republicans, there was no election mandate.\n\nMass deportation is a threat being politically backtracked to focus on a few captured criminals fitting a false narrative about border crossings. Trump is selling fear with exaggerated nonsensical claims. Immigrants deserve to come through a processing center and have their cases reviewed in a timely manner. That means one year. Too many take five or longer. We can resolve this with more immigration judges and border personnel.\n\nAbortion has related concerns about individual freedoms. Women have the right to an equal rights amendment and to self-agency over their own bodies. The extremes presented by Republicans are falsehoods and morally hypocritical. It’s not just Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+ and other marginalized communities that will be harmed. Any group not male-centric and predominately white will be diminished and demonized by Republicans. Only when everyone has equal freedoms and rights can a country move forward in a world advancing technologically at a warp speed.\n\nPeace, not war, compromise, not tyranny, are essential to a truly free, people-first society. That should be obvious to all.\n\n— Bryan Buck, Oak View, California\n\nI hope Trump does a good job. But he's already creating chaos.\n\nI hope Donald Trump does a good job, but after his comments the last few days about Greenland and Canada and the Panama Canal I feel there is going to be chaos, as there was in his first term. The main reason I feel this way is that he sees something on TV or someone plants a thought in his head and he thinks it is a good idea ‒ and then that becomes his priority for the moment. I also feel that he is not telling the American people what he will do but is deflecting from the real issues. That is because he is facing the reality that accomplishing things is not as easy as promising things.\n\nI am not expecting a lot from his first 100 days. He is not a leader who provides guidance, expectations or a vision. He is a leader who just sits back and lets everyone else figure out what to do. But when it doesn't meet his expectations, he throws in a monkey wrench, which starts the process all over. We saw that with the continuing resolution to fund the government where at the last minute he wanted to add the debt increase into the continuing resolution, though he ultimately didn’t get what he wanted. We are seeing it now as he declines to tell Congress whether he wants one bill or two.\n\nI think the most important issues are the economy, foreign policy and health care. But Trump won’t really deal with them. He’ll let them become a crisis before he decides to try to fix the problem. Tariffs will just create a burden on the country and will hurt the economy. I have experience with watching a business owner lose money because of having to pay a tariff on goods he imported.\n\nTrump has had eight years to develop a replacement for Obamacare, but he has done nothing except to say he has a concept. With foreign policy, he may have some success, but it will be a lot harder than what he thinks. Just by saying something is going to happen is not going to make it happen. I feel he is is more concerned with renaming the Gulf of Mexico or Mount McKinley or getting revenge for a perceived wrong than he is in solving real problems.\n\n— James Wold, Covington, Louisiana\n\nOur government is corrupt, and we deserve it\n\nI will never understand how Americans reelected Donald Trump. I say we deserve what comes our way. Don’t complain or whine when Social Security is cut and Medicare is reduced. I believe our government is now the most corrupt institution in the world. Our Supreme Court is a joke and should be done away with.\n\nWhat does a rich man want? More money and to keep what he has.\n\nOur Supreme Court is a joke and should be done away with. I worked at a cleaners and week after week I observed the following: Rich people would complain about their clothing and get it done for free. Ordinary people from the streets would pick up their clothing, pay for it and go about their business. The rich men around Trump will show us how stupid we are. The elderly and poor will be the ones suffering from increased taxes but who cares? Not those rich white men in leadership.\n\nAnd if you can send money to help pay for Trump’s legal bills, go for it.\n\n— Fay Smith, Lake Lure, North Carolina\n\nI am a Republican, and I am worried\n\nI feel it is important to know that I have been a registered Republican for 56 years and supported the basic principles of the party. That changed when Donald Trump began running for the highest office in our government and I read and listened to his wild rhetoric. He demonstrated disdain for truth, showed no respect for others and lacked any regard for the law.\n\nI am more concerned about Trump’s upcoming new term of office than at the beginning of his first presidency. He showed us in his first term that he had no understanding of our constitutional laws, and worse, did not believe he was bound to respect them. There was virtually no evidence that uniting our country was a primary goal of the president. Instead of serving all citizens, he served himself and his major sycophants.\n\nHe left us steeply divided as a nation, created more national debt than any other administration and, for the most part, ignored the thousands of Americans dying each day because of COVID-19. AND someone else was always the cause of our problems. ALWAYS.\n\nDuring his reelection campaign, Trump’s rhetoric became more vitriolic and threatening. The lies and claims became more outrageous and the division deeper. The United States is a nation of laws, but to Trump, they are an impediment to his need for glory. Meanwhile, he has given multiple examples of wanting to continue in office after his upcoming term ends. Regrettably, I believe that his second term, even if it ends, will leave America far worse.\n\nFrom the onset of his new term in office I expect America and the world will witness more fear, more chaos and more division. He is sly, but not wise. He is focused on himself and not others. He desires to rule and not govern and has disdain for laws. He will be surrounded by people who will do his bidding without regard for what is best for our country.\n\nWe are a republic, which is defined as “a state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch.” Within three months, I believe there will be signs that Trump will not support this time-honored form of government.\n\nAs a result, the issues most important to me during Trump’s first 100 days are federal governance, the economy, foreign policy and potential Jan. 6 pardons.\n\nI do not believe that Trump will address these issues in a manner that is in the best interests of the U.S. or the world. Also concerning is the apparent lack of qualifications of many proposed Cabinet members and the Republican Party’s control of Congress. Because of that, these issues will not be managed on the basis of “we” but on the whims of “me.”\n\nLastly, I fear that if Trump pardons the rioters who disregarded our laws and trampled the Constitution’s governance four years ago, it will demonstrate just how dark and terrible his judgment is. It will also foretell “a red sky in the morning” omen for all of us.\n\n— Larry Holland, Lenoir, North Carolina\n\nCan't believe how stupid we are\n\nI am in a state of disbelief over a second Trump presidency. I can't believe how stupid we are as a country. Americans are too easily manipulated by right-wing propaganda and have zero critical thinking skills. It's been obvious for a while that Republicans have no interest in actually governing and doing what is right for the majority of Americans. On top of that, they have ruined our moral fiber and the credibility of the GOP at the same time.\n\nIt's a shame that we allowed this to happen. We have become apathetic and don't pay enough attention to which policies actually have real-world effects and how those policies affect us in everyday life. Instead, we have devolved into listening to whoever has the loudest microphone and think that repetition of claims is equivalent to the validity of the claim.\n\nIn the first 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency I expect chaos. None of the issues he campaigned on will be addressed except possibly tariffs, which will only hurt the average consumer. Beyond this, it's hard to tell what will happen – ambition and incompetence is always an interesting mix. But if history is any indicator, Trump is good for less than 10% of what he promises on campaign trails.\n\nThe most important issues we are facing are the economy, health care, abortion and oil and gas drilling. Trump, the “stable genius” he is, will make the absolute worst decision possible in each instance. The only way he will be able to make a decision on any of the issues is by understanding who is to benefit and who is to lose. Once he understands which decisions will help his rich loyalists and greedy sycophants, he will make sure to put them first. When he says \"America First\" – what he really means is \"me rica\" first.\n\n— Blake Caudill, Indianapolis, Indiana", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/23/debate-transcript-trump-biden-final-presidential-debate-nashville/3740152001/", "title": "Debate transcript: Trump, Biden final presidential debate in Nashville", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nHere is the full transcript of the final presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, moderated by Kristen Welker in Nashville on Oct. 22, 2020. Headers have been added for ease of reading.\n\n[0:00] Welker: A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start.\n\nAnd we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\nTrump and Biden on COVID-19\n\n[1:03] Trump: So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.\n\n[3:05] Welker: OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[3:12] Biden: 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.\n\n[5:00] Welker: President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?\n\n[5:12] Trump: It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.\n\n[5:21] Welker: Can you tell us what companies?\n\nTrump: Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.\n\n[5:34] Welker: Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?\n\n[5:52] Trump: No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.\n\n[6:12] Welker: Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?\n\n[6:25] Biden: Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.\n\n[6:53] Welker: President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.\n\n[6:55] Trump: I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.\n\n[8:09] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response?\n\n[8:10] Biden: My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry. This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.\n\n[9:02] Welker: President Trump, your reaction?\n\n[9:03] Trump: I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.\n\n[10:09] Welker: And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.\n\n[10:19] Biden: Can I respond to that?\n\n[10:20] Welker: 30 seconds please, and then I have a question.\n\n[10:22] Biden: Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.\n\n[10:55] Welker: Let me talk about —\n\n[10:56] Trump: Excuse me.\n\n[10:57] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[10:58] Trump: I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves\n\n[11:15] Welker: Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.\n\n[11:16] Biden: The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say? He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather. Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people\n\n[11:42] Welker: President Trump.\n\n[11:43] Trump: Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You’re xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —\n\n[12:12] Biden: I didn't say either of those things.\n\n[12:13] Trump: You certainly did.\n\n[12:16] Biden: I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.\n\n[12:23] Welker: All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.\n\n[12:26] Trump: He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That’s obvious.\n\n[12:30] Welker: Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?\n\n[12:33] Biden: No.\n\n[12:33] Welker: OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?\n\n[12:51] Biden: What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.\n\n[13:21] Welker: You haven't ruled out more shutdowns\n\n[13:24] Biden: Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now\n\n[14:03] Welker: Let's talk about schools. President Trump —\n\n[14:05] Trump: Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.\n\n[14:07] Welker: Please, and then I have a follow up.\n\n[14:08] Trump: Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it’s their immune system.\n\n[14:46] Welker: Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?\n\n[15:04] Trump: I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.\n\n[15:49] Welker: Vice President Biden, your —\n\n[15:51] Biden: Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on.\n\n[16:37] Welker: President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.\n\n[16:39] Trump: I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.\n\n[17:34] Welker: Vice President.\n\n[17:34] Biden: Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans. They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.\n\nTrump: New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.\n\n[18:00] Welker: President Trump, what about —\n\n[18:02] Trump: When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.\n\n[18:42] Welker: Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?\n\n[18:58] Trump: I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.\n\n[19:43] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\n[19:45] Biden: My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving. It's a dangerous problem.’\n\n[20:30] Trump: Well this is —\n\n[20:31] Welker: I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.\n\n[20:33] Trump: I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don’t tell me about wall street.\n\n[21:15] Welker: All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.\n\n[21:17] Biden: Average contribution, $43.\n\nOn national security\n\n[21:18] Welker: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[21:48] Biden: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.\n\n[23:45] Welker: President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[23:56] Trump: Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.\n\n[26:01] Welker: Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.\n\n[26:06] Biden: I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?\n\n[27:04]Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\n[27:06] Trump: First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.\n\n[27:42] Welker: Did your accountant tell you —\n\n[27:44] Trump: Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.\n\n[28:22] Welker: All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?\n\n[28:35] Trump: I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.\n\n[29:04] Welker: I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.\n\n[29:12] Biden: At some point I want to respond.\n\n[29:13] Welker: Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.\n\n[29:15] Biden: Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks.\n\n[29:42] Welker: Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.\n\n[29:46] Trump: I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.\n\n[30:41] Welker: All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?\n\n[30:56] Biden: Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.\n\n[31:58] Welker: Let me ask my question to you.\n\n[32:00] Trump: Could I just — one thing.\n\n[32:01] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[32:02] Trump: His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest.\n\n[32:27] Welker: I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.\n\n[32:31] Biden: No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.\n\n[32:35] Welker: OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?\n\n[32:52] Trump: I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.\n\n[32:26] Welker: OK.\n\n[32:27] Trump: Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —\n\n[33:54] Welker: We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?\n\nBiden: What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.’ I said, ‘we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we’ re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.\n\n[35:33] Welker: All right, let's talk about North Korea.\n\n[35:35] Trump: Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.\n\n[35:37] Welker: OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...\n\n[35:39] Trump: His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —\n\n[35:41] Biden: Not true.\n\n[35:42] Trump: — after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.\n\n[35:56] Biden: That is not true.\n\n[35:56] Welker: President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?\n\n[36:03] Trump: First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.\n\n[36:07] Welker: Through sanctions?\n\n[36:08] Trump: I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.\n\n[36:12] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:14] Trump: It’s what?\n\n[36:15] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:16] Trump: No, the taxpayers. It's called China.\n\n[36:20] Biden: Not true.\n\n[36:20] Trump: China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry\n\n[36:42] Welker: OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?\n\n[36:49] Biden: This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month. Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.\n\n[37:26] Welker: I wanted to say, I want to tell —\n\n[37:28] Trump: That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.\n\n[37:29] Welker: 10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.\n\n[37:31] Trump: Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.\n\n[37:40] Welker: All right, let’s talk —\n\n[37:40] Trump: I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected.\n\n[37:44] Welker: Let’s talk about —\n\n[37:44] Trump: Let’s get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.\n\n[37:48] Welker: We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.\n\n[38:12] Trump: When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.’ And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship.\n\n[39:05] Welker: Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?\n\n[39:15] Biden: Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up. And help if not, it's going to continue.’ What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.\n\n[40:05] Welker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?\n\n[40:12] Biden: On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.\n\n[40:21] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families.\n\n[40:24] Trump: Kristen, they tried to meet with him.\n\n[40:24] Welker: Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump.\n\nTrump: They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.\n\n[40:32] Welker: OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond.\n\n[40:33] Trump: They tried, he wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.\n\n[40:43] Welker: President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through.\n\n[40:43] Biden: We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.\n\n[41:10] Trump: And it didn’t happen.\n\n[41:12] Welker: Let’s move on and talk about American families.\n\n[41:14] Trump: Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.\n\n[41:18] Welker: We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.\n\n[41:22] Trump: Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.\n\nOn the economy\n\n[41:47] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nTrump: First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ -- to my people, great people -- ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better.\n\n45:12 Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nBiden: What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None, zero, you can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no -- he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do?\n\n47:20 Welker: I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?\n\nBiden: What he’s saying, it's ridiculous. It’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.\n\nWelker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- ‘We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year --\n\n49:24 Welker: We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.\n\nTrump: No, no, but that's a question --\n\nWelker: We're gonna get to it --\n\nTrump: It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.\n\nWelker: Vice President, your response.\n\nBiden: My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.\n\nTrump: Kristen, when he says --\n\nWelker: Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill\n\n50:08 Trump: When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --\n\nWelker: Let's see if --\n\n50:31 Trump: -- it was impossible --\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\n50:34 Biden: He thinks he's running against someone else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So I don't know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.\n\nTrump: He tried to get rid of --\n\nWelker: Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I’m going to have to go on to another question --\n\nTrump: -- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --\n\n51:28 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next question.\n\n51:31 Trump: They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.\n\nWelker: OK, let's move on to the next question.\n\nBiden: May I respond?\n\nWelker: Very quickly.\n\n51:40 Biden: The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?\n\n52:11 Trump: 401k’s are through the roof. 401k --\n\nWelker: All right, let’s move on.\n\n52:14 Trump: -- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --\n\nWelker: We're gonna move on --\n\nTrump: And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.\n\nWelker: -- to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here.\n\nTrump: Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.\n\nWelker: But you're the president.\n\nTrump: I do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.\n\nWelker: All right, Mr. Vice President --\n\nBiden: You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?\n\nWelker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President\n\nTrump: If we made a deal, we’d have --\n\n53:32 Welker: Let me ask Vice President Biden the question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?\n\nBiden: Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like -- it's not new. It's been out there. The HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on. What's the matter with these --\n\nTrump: The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.\n\nWelker: I want --\n\nBiden: All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.\n\nWelker: I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.\n\nBiden: I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You’ve got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money.\n\nWelker: We are going to move on --\n\n56:35 Trump: For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business --\n\nWelker: You said --\n\nTrump: How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen\n\n57:03 Welker: Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --\n\nTrump: Say again?\n\nWelker: You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case?\n\n57:10 Trump: What I’d really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 --\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden\n\nBiden: Two jobs, one job below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. That is simply not true.\n\nOn immigration\n\nWelker: We're going to talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?\n\nTrump: Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.\n\nWelker: But how will you reunite these kids with their families?\n\n58:48 Trump: Let me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.\n\nWelker: Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?\n\n59:08 Trump: Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you.\n\nBiden: These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big real tough, really strong. And guess what? They cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.\n\nWelker: Let me ask you a follow up --\n\nTrump: Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages?\n\nBiden: So let's talk about --\n\nTrump: Who built the cages, Joe?\n\n59:58 Biden: Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal.\n\nWelker: Let me just --\n\nTrump: Let me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean --\n\nWelker: But some of them haven’t been reunited --\n\nTrump: But just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages?\n\nWelker: Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?\n\nBiden: Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, and I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it's illegal. You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here. Many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.\n\n1:01:51 Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.\n\nWelker: Vice President, what’s your response?\n\nBiden: The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for the hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before. That’s never happened before in our country. You come to the United States and you make your case. That’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.\n\n1:02:55 Welker: President Trump, there is --\n\nTrump: It’s so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back.\n\nBiden: Not true.\n\nTrump: We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\nTrump: You don’t know the law, Joe.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\nBiden: I know the law. What he's telling you is simply not true.\n\nTrump: They don’t come back.\n\nBiden: Check it out.\n\nWelker: All right, let's move on --\n\nTrump: But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it\n\n1:03:59 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next section --\n\n1:04:04 Biden: You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.\n\nTrump: Go ahead.\n\nOn race in America\n\nWelker: All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called “the talk.” It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nBiden: I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.\n\n1:06:32 Welker: President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nTrump: Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’. I said, ‘You don't have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’. And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities.\n\n[1:08:28] Welker: OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?\n\n[1:08:33] Biden: My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences. We committed over 1,000 people’s sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.\n\n[1:10:04] Trump: But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--\n\n[1:10:10] Biden: I am not--\n\n[1:10:10] Trump: You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.\n\n[1:10:19] Biden: We did--\n\n[1:10:20] Trump: You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.\n\n[1:10:34] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you.\n\n[1:10:38] Biden: Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely.\n\n[1:11:00] Welker: Let me ask them some follow--\n\n[1:11:01] Trump: Excuse me--\n\n[1:11:04] Welker: Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.\n\n[1:11:05] Trump: If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--\n\n[1:11:19] Biden: Nobody says--\n\n[1:11:20] Welker: President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue--\n\n[1:11:21] Trump: It’s the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell.\n\n[1:11:25] Welker: President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race. President Trump---\n\n[1:11:29] Biden: Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.\n\n[1:11:30] Welker: Please, very quickly.\n\n[1:11:32] Biden: Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.\n\n[1:11:51] Trump: You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be--\n\n[1:11:58] Biden: That’s exactly what-- That’s exactly what--\n\n[1:12:00] Trump: Is this where you’re going? This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?\n\n[1:12:03] Welker: Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--\n\n[1:12:05] Trump: You have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia.\n\n[1:12:09] Welker: Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?\n\n[1:12:32] Trump: Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘Pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘Pigs, Pigs’, talking about our police, ‘Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’. I said, ‘That's a horrible thing’. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:03] Welker: What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?\n\n[1:12:06] Trump: I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I’m the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:35] Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.\n\n[1:13:39] Biden: Abraham Lincoln. Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here. He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.\n\n[1:14:12] Welker: President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.\n\n[1:14:16] Trump: He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--\n\n[1:14:19] Biden: You said you were Abraham Lincoln.\n\n[1:14:21] Trump: No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn’t say ‘I'm Abraham Lincoln’. I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community’. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--\n\n[1:14:42] Biden: Oh, God.\n\n[1:14:42] Trump: Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what’s happening out there.\n\n[1:14:50] Welker: All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?\n\n[1:15:20] Biden: One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. But they were not in the crime bill.\n\n[1:16:12] Trump: But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? ‘That's what I'm gonna do when I become president’. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.\n\n[1:16:34] Biden: We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--\n\n[1:16:39] Trump: You got nothing done\n\n[1:16:40] Biden: 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.\n\n[1:1:08] Trump: I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, ‘I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.\n\n[1:17:29] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.\n\n[1:17:34] Biden: We had a Republican Congress. That’s the answer.\n\n[1:17:37] Welker: OK.\n\n[1:17:39] Trump: Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it.\n\n[1:17:43] Welker: All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-\n\n[1:17:44] Trump: Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.\n\nOn climate change\n\n[1:17:48] Welker: Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[1:18:15] Trump: So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.\n\n[1:19:50] Welker: Vice President, Biden--\n\n[1:19:51] Trump: And we haven't destroyed our industries.\n\n[1:19:52] Welker: Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.\n\n[1:19:55] Biden: Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China's doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening. And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.\n\n[1:21:47] Trump: President Trump, your response --\n\n[1:21:48] Trump: They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It’s $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things--\n\n[1:22:47] Welker: All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. So let's hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions.\n\n[1:23:11] Biden: I don't know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. And they know they're good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing.\n\n[1:24:00] Welker: President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.\n\n[1:24:00] Trump: Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--\n\n[1:24:36] Biden: Find me a scientist that says that.\n\n[1:24:38] Trump: Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--\n\n[1:24:47] Biden: False.\n\n[1:24:47] Trump: So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking?\n\n[1:25:01] Welker: All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--\n\n[1:25:04] Biden: I have never said I oppose fracking.\n\n[1:25:06] Trump: You said it on tape.\n\n[1:25:08] Biden: I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.\n\n[1:25:10] Trump: I’ll put it on.\n\n[1:25:11] Biden: Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.\n\n[1:25:15] Welker: Would you rule out banning fracking?\n\n[1:25:17] Biden: I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.\n\n[1:25:44] Welker: I have one more question--\n\n[1:25:48] Trump: Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. ‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.\n\n[1:26:00] Biden: Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land--\n\n[1:26:05] Welker: Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?\n\n[1:26:26] Trump: The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.\n\n[1:27:22] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.\n\n[1:27:26] Biden: My response is that those people live on what they call ‘Fence Lines’. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe.

Yes.\n\n[1:28:19] Trump: Oh, transition.\n\n[1:28:21] Biden: It is a big statement because I would stop--\n\n[1:28:22] Welker: Why would you do that?\n\n[1:28:24] Biden: Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —\n\n[1:28:27] Trump: That’s a big statement.\n\n[1:28:31] Biden: Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:52] Trump: We actually do give it to solar and wind--\n\n[1:28:54] Welker: All right, we have one final question--\n\n[1:28:56] Trump: That’s the biggest statement.

Ohio?\n\n[1:29:07] Welker: Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden?\n\n[1:29:12] Biden: He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production. By 2050, totally.\n\n[1:29:25] Welker: All right. One final question--\n\n[1:29:26] Trump: Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?\n\n[1:29:27] Welker: No, we're finished with this.

Jeff Flake is endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris because of his conservative values — not in spite of them — he said Saturday in an interview announcing his support for the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nFlake, R-Ariz., is crossing party lines to endorse a Democrat for the second presidential election in a row. He backed President Joe Biden over former Republican President Donald Trump in 2020 and voted third-party rather than cast a ballot for Trump in 2016.\n\n“I'm a conservative. I believe in the rule of law,” Flake said during an interview at The Nile Coffee Shop in Mesa on Saturday afternoon. “First and foremost, I want to support a presidential candidate that respects the rule of law, somebody who, if they lose an election, wouldn't try to use the presidential powers to overturn that election.”\n\nFlake made his endorsement just 37 days before Election Day, and it comes at a time when the vice president could use a boost in Arizona. Polls show Harris and Trump locked in a close battle for the White House, with Trump slightly ahead and leading on the issues that voters say they care about most.\n\nThe endorsement is part of a larger Harris effort to reach Arizona Republicans and independents who, like Flake, may not agree with her on every policy but are turned off by Trump’s bombastic brand of politics and election denialism.\n\n“If you are a conservative, then you believe in the rule of law and you believe in limited government, economic freedom, individual responsibility, free trade. And I think that if you look at the two candidates, Kamala Harris represents more of those views than Donald Trump,” Flake said. “I don't agree with everything that the Harris campaign has put out. That's not necessary. I've never agreed with the entire platform of any Republican I voted for.”\n\nFlake served with both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, during his time in Washington, and said he learned the character of both candidates while he was there. Flake and Harris were on the Senate Judiciary Committee together, and Flake got to know Walz even earlier, when they served in the House.\n\nFlake spoke to Walz a few days ago and had a “good discussion,” he noted.\n\nFlake just returned to the United States three weeks ago from his ambassadorship in Turkey. He endorsed Harris about as soon as he could, he said, now that his official duties are over and he’s back on U.S. soil. Biden nominated Flake to serve as U.S. ambassador to Turkey in 2021 and he assumed the post in 2022.\n\nDuring the interview, Flake addressed the news that New York City Mayor Eric Adams was accused of accepting bribes from Turkish nationals, including a member of the Turkish government. Flake said most of the alleged activity happened before he became ambassador, and that he was surprised by what he read in the indictment. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is handling the case.\n\n“Pretty brazen,” Flake said. “It’s really too bad. But having served in Turkey, this never came up. I never had any knowledge of it.”\n\nFlake was, however, working with the Southern District of New York on another issue: Returning stolen cultural artifacts to Turkey that had been in museums or private collections in the U.S.\n\nThe Republican diplomat has had a front-row seat to the escalating issues in the Middle East, and he named foreign policy as a top reason he’s backing Harris over Trump. Flake also pointed to tariffs and immigration as major sticking points.\n\n“Her support for our allies abroad, that's important to me. Recognition that tariffs actually would increase inflation and increase costs on U.S. consumers, that's important. And her recognition that immigration reform is one, important and two, it needs to be bipartisan,” Flake said.\n\nA day earlier, Harris delivered a border security speech in Arizona where she promised to go even further than Biden to curb illegal immigration. Harris visited the U.S.-Mexico border wall and participated in briefings with U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officials during her time in the state Friday.\n\nHarris said the nation’s immigration policies should be both “orderly” and “humane” during the remarks, and promised to crack down on people who cross the border illegally and pursue criminal charges against repeat offenders.\n\n“I wasn't surprised that she came out with a tougher policy than Joe Biden's had,” Flake said. “And I welcome it. I think it's the right thing to do.”\n\nHarris also said she was more serious about tackling immigration than Trump, who has pledged to carry out mass deportations and finish the U.S.-Mexico border wall if he returns to the White House. Trump often criticizes Harris for the record-high migrant encounters at the southern border during Biden’s term.\n\nFlake has been a vocal Trump critic for the better half of a decade, slamming the former president’s political style, his penchant for tariffs and his views on immigration. He paid the price, facing sharp criticism from the former president and a Trump-aligned primary challenger in 2017.\n\n“I've never supported Donald Trump. I didn’t in 2016. I didn’t in 2020. And there's been no conduct over the past four years that would cause me to support him this time,” Flake said. “Kamala Harris, I served with her in the Senate. I know of her character.”\n\nFlake opted not to run for reelection in 2018, saying, “There may not be a place for a Republican like me” in the new GOP. Four years later, the Arizona Republican Party censured him for endorsing Biden.\n\nStill, Flake said he’s optimistic that Americans can find a way back to more traditional political debates on policy. He said Trump has been “really bad for conservatism and bad for Republicans” and that “there’s just no future in vitriol or grievance.”\n\n“At some point, Republicans get tired of losing,” Flake said, pointing to Democratic victories across the country and in Arizona over the last several years.\n\nSince Flake left office, Democrats have taken both Senate seats, the Governor’s Office, the Secretary of State’s Office and the Attorney General’s Office in the state. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego has the lead in this year’s Senate contest against Trump acolyte Kari Lake, a former local news anchor.\n\n“This is a red state, and if you run as a traditional Republican, you can win in Arizona,” Flake said. “The problem is if you run as a MAGA Republican who denies that President Trump lost, you know, the last election, take his just, kind of smash-mouth politics, then you can't win in Arizona — and that speaks well for the voters in Arizona.\"\n\nHarris has signaled that she plans to nominate a Republican to serve in her Cabinet if she is elected president, but Flake brushed off speculation that he would join a potential Harris administration.\n\n“That’s not anything I’m seeking,” Flake said.\n\nFlake also weighed in on a recent claim by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate from Ohio, that the late Republican Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would not vote for Harris if he were alive today. McCain’s son, Jim McCain, had just thrown his support behind Harris and registered as a Democrat.\n\n“I never would pretend that I could tell how somebody's going to vote. And I would suggest that anybody who does is over their skis in trying to make that supposition,” Flake said.\n\nFor his part, Trump did not reach out to Flake to ask for an endorsement this election cycle. The pair haven’t spoken since Flake was in the Senate and Trump was in the White House. Flake isn’t worried about the former president’s reaction to his Harris endorsement.\n\n“He may, I guess, I don’t know, call me ‘Flaky Flake’ or whatever he called me before,” Flake said. “I won’t mind.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2025/01/16/arizona-residents-at-us-mexico-border-await-trump-actions-immigration/77602881007/", "title": "Arizona-Mexico border: Immigration, security, Trump top of mind", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to make immigration and border security top priorities during his upcoming second term.\n\nHe has promised historic mass deportations and signaled sweeping changes to policies that in recent years have defined the nation’s southern border with Mexico.\n\nArizona Republic reporters traveled along that border to far-flung communities in southern Arizona, speaking with residents, businesses, ranchers and law enforcement officials to understand the current state of the border and what people hope will come from the next four years under a new administration.\n\nFrom west to east, what the reporters found was a complex tapestry of views, concerns and hopes from the diverse communities that call the borderlands home.\n\nFor some, stricter policies represent safety and economic security. For others, they threaten livelihoods, family ties and the cultural identity of the region.\n\nThese varied perspectives, captured in the following portraits, paint a picture of a borderland at a crossroads, where federal policies will affect the daily lives of those living on the front lines of the immigration debates playing out in Washington, D.C.\n\nRepublic's immigration data page:How many undocumented immigrants are in the US? How many deported? See the data\n\nA San Luis farmworker who voted for Trump explains why\n\nSAN LUIS – The emerald-colored fields spread across the landscape, as the winter months are the epicenter of U.S. production of salad greens in Yuma County. Hundreds of broccoli plants shoot out of the ground in tight rows that seem to go on without end.\n\nHowever, many of these fields, such as Lee Farms in San Luis, do end up butting up against the six-inch-wide, rust-colored steel posts that make up the crowning achievement of Trump’s first administration: the border wall.\n\nIn 2022, Luis Jesus Ames, a farmworker who oversees the irrigation of the fields at Lee Farms, witnessed something that moved him to action.\n\n“One day, while I was tending to the fields here, I saw hands coming out across the fence. I stopped, and then someone called over to me, asking me for food,” he recalled. “I asked them what was going on, and one of them told me that they had fled their country because of crime and corruption in the government.”\n\nAmes, an immigrant himself from just the other side of the wall where San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, lies, said he saw the desperation in people’s faces. They were starving.\n\nHe decided to go to the Walmart, which was only four miles away. He loaded his Ford F-150 pickup truck with food, water, and blankets to keep warm during the cold desert night.\n\nWhen he returned, he distributed the items, passing rations to the hundreds of people through the fence. But it was not enough.\n\nSo, he took a second trip. Then, a third. Then, a fourth.\n\nAmes never stopped buying goods to aid the migrants waiting to be processed by the U.S. Border Patrol.\n\n“I would come every day ready with food to give out. I did that for two years,” Ames said. “I did everything humanly possible to help out of the kindness of my heart.”\n\nHe met people from all over the world, including Cubans, Venezuelans, Colombians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, and Salvadorans.\n\n“Little kids crying, pregnant women — I saw it all,” Ames said.\n\nWhat he saw pushed him to vote for Trump in the 2024 election.\n\n“I witnessed a lot of disorder with all the people that came across. Believe me, although I did everything out of kindness – I know I saw something that was not right – that’s my criterion,” Ames said.\n\nAmes is one of the many voters who helped deliver Yuma County to Trump this past November. According to an analysis of voter data by The Republic, Trump overwhelmingly swept the county, winning in precincts where most registered voters identified as Hispanic.\n\nNotably, the precinct where Ames works in San Luis went for Harris.\n\nWhile voters have listed numerous reasons for casting their ballot in favor of a second Trump administration, for Ames, the one reason was apparent: the border was not secure.\n\n“When Trump was in office, he made this wall,” he said, a few feet from a plaque at the top of a section of the border wall that had been put up during the inauguration of the fence back in 2017.\n\n“Before this wall, people would come across the fields and trample over the crops. They didn’t care. When the wall went up the problem was under control,” he said.\n\nTohono O’odham tribal leader bridges 2 nations\n\nSELLS – The Tohono O’odham Nation shares a border with Mexico for a stretch of more than 60 miles.\n\nYou won’t find the 30-foot bollard fences that make up the wall to the east of the reservation on which the sovereign nation lies.\n\nOr the scars of dynamite blasts on the mountains to the east near Sasabe.\n\nThe land here, filled with saguaro cactus, creosote bushes and teeming with wildlife and cattle, seems relatively untouched. Aside from the occasional house or ranch, the only marker of humans in the area is the vehicle barrier fence installed after 9/11.\n\nVerlon M. Jose, the chair of the Tohono O’odham Nation, drives along a service road that runs parallel to the border. Jose drives comfortably even with the road's dips and craters, keeping up a full conversation with his passengers.\n\nBaboquivari Peak is regarded as the center of the universe by the Tohono O’odham people: the home of I'ito, the Tohono O’odham’s creator. The peak is within the Baboquivari Wilderness area, fewer than 40 miles from the international boundary line. The Bureau of Land Management and the Tohono O’odham Nation recently signed an agreement to co-stewardship the Baboquivari National Wilderness.\n\n“We've been corralled in these 2.8 million acres,” Jose said. “Our reservation is 2.8 million acres small. Our aboriginal lands are from Hermosillo, Sonora, to Phoenix, Arizona. Anthropological evidence will tell you that.”\n\nIn October 2019, the National Park Service notified the Tohono O’odham Nation it had recovered human bone fragments near Quitobaquito Springs, near where the border wall was under construction.\n\nThen-Tohono O’odham Nation Chair Ned Norris Jr. provided testimony to the House Natural Resources Committee that the federal government had desecrated “a burial site that the Nation had sought to protect” and caused irreparable damage to a significant oasis in the Sonoran Desert.\n\n“When the elders went out to Quitobaquito and they first saw the wall there, they cried,” Jose said.\n\nDespite meetings the nation had with federal immigration officials about the burial sites in the area planned for the border wall, construction continued, according to the testimony.\n\nTo build the wall, the Department of Homeland Security waived three cultural resources laws, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, after then-President Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 aimed at improving border security and immigration enforcement.\n\nJose recalled the words of an elder who described how devastated he was with the construction.\n\n“I don’t know how I would live if I was to wake up and look and see this wall there. I don’t think I’d want to live another day,” he said.\n\nApproximately an hour and a half west of the San Miguel gate, which is a crossing used by tribal members on both sides of the international boundary, he arrives at a spot where the fence ends and vertical jagged rock stretches upward to touch the sky.\n\n“I come up here by myself when I need rest and relaxation. This is my happy place,” Jose said.\n\nHe ascends the hill, stepping forward using his cane, holding onto the vehicle barrier that serves as the border wall.\n\n“I can dance at least once or twice. The moment you stop dancing, life is over,” he said.\n\nHe reaches the end of the wall.\n\n“This is why we do what we do.”\n\nHe surveys the Sonoran Desert underneath the brim of his white straw cowboy hat, looking north toward State Route 86, which cuts across the reservation.\n\n“I want to invite the president of the United States and anyone else that wants to build a wall to come,” Jose said. “If they want to have a meeting about the wall, I say we have a meeting right here, in this place.”\n\nHe looked down at his feet and realized he was on the Mexico side of the vehicle barrier that ran along the side of the rocky mountain he had just hiked.\n\n“Technically, I guess I am in Mexico right now,” he looked up and said. “No matter which side – I am on O’odham Jewed, the land of the people.”\n\nGet our American Border newsletter:A weekly look at immigration news in states along the US-Mexico border\n\nSheriff, Nogales residents full of questions about what's next\n\nNOGALES – On a breezy, sunny January morning, Santa Cruz County Sheriff David Hathaway walked near a portion of the border wall in the Nogales area. It was quiet, with yellow grasses swaying in the breeze. Towering cottonwood trees lined the Santa Cruz River on both sides of the border.\n\nThe landscape looked identical on each side of the international line. The only evidence Mexico was a few steps away was the four iterations of border fencing.\n\nThe first marker was the original border monument, a tall, vertical obelisk from the 1800s. Next stood a four-strand and barbed wire fence for livestock that was added decades ago. In front of the barbed wire was a more recent border barrier, or Normandy barrier, to stop vehicles from crossing. Next to the vehicle barrier towered steel bollard walls, shorter than Trump’s 30-foot wall but topped with spirals of barbed wire.\n\nThe silence surrounding the sheriff was occasionally interrupted by a squawk of crows or the engines of several passing Border Patrol cars.\n\n“Despite all the hype about the border, very peaceful town down here. And being on the border, to me, from my perspective, just being a local law enforcement officer doesn't create any unique challenges,” he said.\n\nHathaway, a Democrat who was reelected by a landslide in November, oversees an agency in the state’s smallest county. His department has 40 deputies to cover 1,200 square miles. He emphasized that Santa Cruz County deals with issues similar to any other county, such as domestic violence, identity theft and burglaries and fraud.\n\nIn downtown Nogales, where the steel bollards are even taller, merchants criticize the wall and the razor wire that lines the tops of the steel poles.\n\nTo them, the barbed wire makes downtown Nogales look like a war zone, making people think Nogales is dangerous, “which is not true,” and discourages people from coming to Nogales to shop, Hathaway said.\n\nLiving and growing up so close to the border, Hathaway has become a de facto expert on border issues. However, his stance on immigration differs from many other sheriffs in southern Arizona.\n\n“There's this perception among certain sheriffs that you need to be hostile towards Mexico. You need to have this crisis attitude. You need to adopt that language, that they're all criminals and they're all gang members,” Hathaway said. “The reality is, they're coming here to work, and they add value to the U.S. economy, and they make all of our standards of living go up.”\n\nHe criticized Secure the Border Act, or Proposition 314 that Arizona voters passed in November. The bill, still tied up in court, would allow state and local law enforcement officers to arrest border-crossers in the country illegally.\n\nHaving his deputies act as Border Patrol agents under Proposition 314 would take them off their prime mission of responding to violent crimes and property crime, Hathaway said. His deputies weren’t trained on immigration issues, and no funding was available for that kind of training, he said.\n\nNeither were there funds to detain border-crossers on state charges, he said. While the county was reimbursed a daily per-diem rate for detaining people brought in on federal immigration charges, that doesn’t exist for state charges.\n\nThe federal government has people to work on federal responsibilities such as immigration, Hathaway said.\n\n“It’s something that doesn't behoove us to get involved in this,” he said.\n\nFor a sheriff like Hathaway, that bill is problematic in other ways. In a county where more than half of the residents are Hispanic, deputies would have to check everyone’s documents, which would create a “Gestapo” type of environment, Hathaway said.\n\n“We want to help everyone in the community, no matter what your background is,” he said.\n\nIn Nogales, people's perspectives differ on how the next four years will look under Trump.\n\nLydia Lopez, 54, is a shopkeeper at a perfume store on the main street leading to the port of entry and the crossing into Nogales, Sonora.\n\nShe has lived in Nogales for eight years and originally hails from Sonora.\n\nLiving close to the border, she sees undocumented immigrants, but they haven’t affected her daily life, she said.\n\n“They respect you; you know, everyone respects each other's lifestyle. Everyone has their own possibilities,” Lopez said.\n\nHowever, immigration has impacted her daily life in another way: the long lines at the port of entry. It can take a long time to cross the border.\n\nShe has contrasting opinions on Trump’s upcoming presidency.\n\nOn one hand, during Trump’s first presidency, many of the extreme actions he said he would take didn’t come to pass, Lopez said. But on the other hand, she said Trump was a businessman and trying to do something for his country.\n\n“He knows about money and economy,” she said. “And what distinguishes the U.S. is its economy, being a first-world country. Here people live well because we all want to come and work and make good money to improve our way of life.”\n\nTrump has vowed to impose a 25% surcharge on all goods shipped to the U.S. from Mexico, among other tariffs.\n\nLopez said she wasn't concerned about the potential tariffs. People would adapt, she said.\n\nCarlos Atondo, 40, who lives in Mexico, has a different opinion. He was buying perfume from Lopez during his monthly trip to Nogales and spoke about how the tariffs could impact American citizens because prices would increase.\n\n\"We won't stop buying goods here,\" he said about buying in Nogales, Arizona. \"We won't be buying what Mexico is selling here; we will be purchasing other products.\"\n\nBargaining chip or devastating blow?Arizona border economy debates the 25% tariff\n\nAndres, a migrant from El Salvador, waits in Nogales, Sonora\n\nNOGALES, SONORA – Andres, 36, had been living in Atlanta for a year and working under the table, getting paid to wash cars and clean yards among other miscellaneous jobs.\n\nOne day, he got a call from the mother of his child, who was living in Mexico in Monterrey, Nuevo León. His son had been hospitalized and was in serious condition.\n\n“I had two options: I stayed and waited for my son’s condition to get worse, or I came back,” Andres said. He returned to Mexico, although he had an upcoming appointment with an immigration official in Atlanta.\n\nAndres had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border through Eagles Pass, Texas, where he had turned himself in to immigration authorities.\n\nThey made copies of his fingerprints.\n\n“‘Go figure it out however you can,’ was what the immigration official told me,” Andres said.\n\nHe was released into the U.S. with nothing in his possession. All of his documentation, along with his cellphone, had been soaked when he crossed the Rio Grande.\n\nHe was able to use another person’s phone to call family members, who were able to send him $200. With it he purchased a new phone for $150.\n\n“I got in contact with my dad, who had been living in Atlanta for 22 years,” Andres said. He clarified this wasn't his biological dad, whom Andres had never met. “He’s my dad because I decided he was.”\n\nAndres was raised in El Salvador by his grandmother. He had known his mom and now, as an adult, has a relationship with her, but she had moved to Milan.\n\n“It’s not because my family has money, but because the situation obligated her to migrate,” he said. Andres left El Salvador when it had the highest murder rate in the world. He arrived in Monterrey, where he met a woman, got married and two years later had a son.\n\nThe child was born with autism and a congenital birth defect, spina bifida occulta, which causes the spine not to form properly during pregnancy.\n\nIn February 2024, Andres had to make the hard choice of self-deporting from the United States to help support his family. The Republic is not publishing Andres’ last name at the request of the Kino Border Initiative in Nogales, which is providing him aid. Officials said using his full name could jeopardize his and his family’s personal security.\n\n“I’m trying to cross now to help support my kid and give him the best I can – not the luxuries but what is necessary,” he said.\n\nAndres has been waiting since November for a meeting with an asylum official in Nogales. He has used the CBP One app to try to find available appointments not only at the ports of entry near him but across the entire Southwest border.\n\nHe has not yet been able to find one.\n\nSince its launch in January 2023, the CBP One app has helped nearly 900,000 migrants schedule appointments at U.S. ports of entry for asylum screenings, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe Biden administration said the app was designed to \"reduce wait times and crowds at U.S. ports of entry and allow for safe, orderly, and humane processing.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, then-Republican nominee Donald Trump vowed to eliminate it if elected. In a post to the social media platform X in September, he claimed the app was being used to smuggle migrants into the U.S.\n\nDays before the start of a second Trump administration, migrants using the app remain in limbo.\n\n“Even if they don’t let me in, I will find the opportunity – but not because I want to come in and cause harm to the country. I want to feel safe. I want to find work,” Andres said.\n\nShelter director in Nogales, Sonora, anticipates surge of deportees\n\nNOGALES, SONORA – Atop a hill, along a twisty, winding road, is where the Albergue San Juan Bosco sits – one of the longest-running migrant shelters in the city.\n\nIn 1982, Juan Francisco Loureiro — “Don Paco” as he was known — and his wife, Hilda Loureiro, founded the shelter in response to the groups of migrants they would see on their walks down the main street in Nogales.\n\nBoth have now died, leaving a legacy their son Juan Francisco Loureiro Esquer Jr. continues as the shelter director.\n\nSan Juan Bosco is a unique fixture in Nogales – it is the only shelter open 24 hours a day and takes in people who have been deported.\n\n“If it’s before 8 p.m., the Instituto Nacional de Migración receives people and passes along information,” Loureiro Esquer said. “If it’s after, then no one is there to receive people who have been deported. Taxi drivers, police officers and ordinary citizens of Nogales – they all know of the existence of the shelter – and provide them information.”\n\nIn recent weeks, Loureiro Esquer has been preparing the shelter for people seeking help who have been swept up in deportations from the U.S.\n\nHe is concerned the combination of individuals and family arriving to wait for an appointment with a federal immigration official at the port of entry and people who have been recently deported will mean his shelter will fill up quickly and not be able to take everyone in.\n\nHe said he has talked with Nogales, Sonora, Mayor Juan Francisco Gim Nogales about the potential surge of deportees that could overwhelm the shelter's resources.\n\n“He’s someone who’s always worried about this migration phenomena – especially now with the threat of mass deportations that the president-elect has promised to carry out,” Loureiro Esquer said.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of supporters last month in downtown Phoenix, Trump doubled down on his campaign promise to carry out “the largest deportation program in American history.”\n\n“We will get them out fast, and we have no choice,” he said, adding his plans would start on Inauguration Day.\n\nBefore it became the San Juan del Bosco shelter, the property had been abandoned. A friend let the family borrow the building, which had no windows or doors. The shelter was built brick by brick, with the contributions of friends and donations, eventually transforming it into the multi-room structure that stands today.\n\nInside, the scent of freshly mopped floors fills the room behind a set of open gray sheet-metal doors. People are received here in the shelter's lobby, overlooked by the director’s office.\n\nA hallway connects the living quarters, which are filled with bunk beds. The shelter can take in approximately 100 to 150 people, the maximum number allowed in the building, according to Loureiro Esquer.\n\n“We have to get ready in the time we have left to brace ourselves,” he said. “We have to take concrete actions in favor of the migrants, otherwise this will turn into a major social problem across the entire borderlands, or at the very least the principal ports where these deportation actions will take place.”\n\nIn Cochise County, 'doing nothing is not an answer,' sheriff says\n\nSIERRA VISTA – Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels was patrolling the roads of Sierra Vista, firearms resting between the driver and passenger seats, before attending a ribbon-cutting ceremony at Cochise College’s new dormitories.\n\n“I'm a cop's cop. I'm not a normal sheriff, I can tell you right now,” Dannels said. Dannels, a Republican, ran unopposed in November and was reelected for his fourth term as sheriff.\n\nOn patrol, he was looking for smugglers, reckless drivers or anything unusual. Smugglers often drive at high speeds along Cochise County’s roads to evade law enforcement, he said.\n\n“They drive like crazy,” Dannels said, noting that the county sees high-speed car pursuits daily. Although rare, authorities have discovered stash houses in the county hiding migrants.\n\nThe uptick of high-speed cars zooming through Cochise County began three to four years ago. Dannels said that increase led him to ask former Gov. Doug Ducey’s office for help funding a center that would act as a law enforcement hub for Arizona. That vision came to fruition in October with the opening of the Cochise County Sheriff's Office Oletski Border Operations Center in Sierra Vista.\n\nThe center houses local, state and federal officials and has a surveillance room where deputies can view photographs from 1,300 cameras spread across the border, as far west as El Centro, California, and as far east as New Mexico.\n\n“We're holding the gate closed, we're putting pressure back on the gate from flipping wide open,” he said. “Doing nothing is not an answer to me.”\n\nFourth-generation rancher John Ladd has a ranch along the border. In recent years, he has seen migrants crossing his land, though he hasn’t seen them cross drugs in the past seven years, he said.\n\nWith more people crossing, Ladd said he takes more precautions when he goes out to check fences, water and cows, like calling his wife or ranch hands and telling them when he’ll be back. After rancher Robert Krentz was killed in 2010, Ladd got his first cellphone. Krentz’s killer was never found.\n\nLadd said he saw a meaningful impact in the number of people crossing his land when Trump implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols, known as Remain in Mexico, which required asylum seekers to stay in Mexican border cities to await the outcome of their proceedings.\n\n“In combination with that, our Sheriff Mark Dannels did a really good job” on border security, Ladd said.\n\nDannels has been outspoken about “inaction” from the White House, criticizing President Joe Biden for not sitting down with America's sheriffs to discuss border security. Conversely, the messaging from Trump is that he will prioritize the border, Dannels said.\n\nEven before Trump’s inauguration, he said Tom Homan, Trump’s pick to oversee the border, has begun engaging with America’s sheriffs.\n\nAs Trump looks to deputize local law enforcement to carry out his immigration goals, Dannels said that wasn’t necessary, if law enforcement is already doing its job. He said Cochise County law enforcement officials are already working hand-in-hand with state and federal agencies with the creation of the operations center.\n\nHe likened that help to any other agency looking for help to find a fugitive.\n\n“If the FBI comes into my office today, the DEA comes to my office today ... or any federal agencies … Would we question it? No,” Dannels said. “So why are we going to, quote, question HSI (Homeland Security Investigations) or a federal border patrol agent who comes in and said, we need your help. Here's the paperwork.”\n\nBar called the Gay 90's keeps spirits high in Naco\n\nNACO – Past the looming walls made of steel bollards and a small port of entry sits the Gay 90’s Bar, Naco’s last surviving business, just steps away from Mexico.\n\nNow run by a father-daughter duo, the bar was founded in 1931 and survived the rise and fall of copper mining, the closure of a popular golf course and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOver the years, businesses closed and people left town, but the bar stayed.\n\n“A lot of things have changed. A lot of people have moved out,” said 71-year-old Leonel Urcadez, who bought the bar from its previous owner in the 1980s. “Very few people stayed that I went to school with. There's only one person that lives here.”\n\nNaco's estimated population is just more than 800 people, a fraction of the number living in the much larger town of Naco, Mexico, just across the border. Students cross over from Mexico to go to school in Bisbee and Naco, while others cross over to work.\n\nThe bar, named after a period known as the Gay 90s, or the 1890s, isn’t the only bit of Arizona history on that speck of land. The adobe-style Naco Port of Entry is also historic. Built in 1937, the original port of entry still stands and is used for office space. It sits next to the newer, more updated port of entry designed with mosaics and copper detailing as an ode to the area’s copper mining history.\n\nNaco is also the home of Camp Naco, which housed the famed Buffalo Soldiers, Black troops from the 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments and later the 25th Infantry regiment. They were sent to guard the U.S. border during the Mexican Revolution.\n\nSonia Urcadez, 45, was born and raised in Naco and now runs the Gay 90's Bar with her father. She remembers a time before Naco had a towering steel border wall, when there was just a fence.\n\nAs a child, she would run through a hole in the fence to a paleteria in Mexico where she and other children would get their candy and popsicles.\n\nIn recent years, the steel border wall has dominated the landscape. The town used to have a gas station and auto shop, grocery stores, a restaurant and more. Now all that’s left is the Urcadez’s bar and a memory of more fruitful times.\n\nShe works hard running the bar both for her family and the entire Naco community.\n\n“We are the home of Naco,” she said, likening her bar to that of a convention center or gathering space.\n\nThrough the milestone celebrations held in the large event space she rents out behind the bar at just $100, she has seen children grow up and people celebrate their proudest moments.\n\nFor some kids, she hosts baby shower, baptism and first birthday events.\n\n“A girl that I graduated high school with had her quinceañera, and then her daughter had her quinceañera here,” Sonia said of the generations who have celebrated at her father’s establishment.\n\nWhereas Naco’s neighboring town Bisbee caters to tourists and has higher prices, the bar in Naco tries to keep prices down.\n\n“We want our locals to be able to come here and afford it,” Sonia said.\n\nLiving next to the steel bollard wall, Sonia said she has seen undocumented immigrants run through her front yard and has found camouflage clothing and carpet slippers.\n\nBut undocumented immigrants crossing into Naco haven’t impacted her life, she said. Conversely, the curfew at the port of entry has. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the port was open 24/7. During the pandemic, it began closing at 10 p.m. and reopening at 6 a.m.\n\nThose hours affected the number of customers going to the bar.\n\n“It’s a lot slower,” Leonel said about business since the curfew was put in place.\n\nThe bar continues to survive because of tourists and newcomers moving to the area. It has a rotating schedule of bands and a pool league with other bars in the neighboring communities.\n\nLiving next to a port of entry, the Urcadezes see border and immigration issues firsthand. Leonel said migrants who cross into Naco tend not to stay because there is no work and nothing to do.\n\nThey said they feel safe in their tiny border town and describe Naco as quiet and friendly, where people greet each other on the street.\n\n“What they need to do is stop building walls and just give people the work,” Sonia said.\n\nIn Douglas, faith group remembers those who died seeking better life\n\nDOUGLAS – It was rush hour on a chilly weekday evening. Cars waited in traffic as far as the eye could see to cross into Mexico at the Douglas port of entry.\n\nA small group of people began to place dozens of white crosses on the street leading up to the port.\n\nNext to the line of cars, four people called out the names of people who had died crossing the desert into the United States and briefly holding each cross high into the darkening sky.\n\nWritten on each cross was a name.\n\nThe weekly Healing Our Borders prayer vigil hosted by the ministry group Frontera de Cristo has continued for 24 years. Since 2000, the group has never missed a week. The vigil aims to remember those who had died crossing the desert into Cochise County. When the group first began the vigil, it had 20 crosses. Now the group rotates between 400 crosses.\n\n“There is always someone here,” said Mark Adams, the U.S. coordinator for Frontera de Cristo, a binational ministry based in Douglas and Agua Prieta that organizes the weekly event.\n\nThe group laid about 80 crosses on the road, leaning them against the curb for several blocks until reaching the port of entry. At the end of the vigil, the group finished with a prayer.\n\nAdams said the purpose of the vigil is to remember the people who have died crossing the desert and to raise the issue in a public space.\n\n“When we think about people dying in the desert, it's not about numbers. It's about human beings who have families and mean something,” he said.\n\nAdams migrated to Douglas from South Carolina. His wife is from southern Mexico. He found out eight years after they were married that his in-laws had their visa request rejected.\n\n“We formed our family here, and just to realize that my in-laws can’t come into the United States ...” he said.\n\nHe said the immigration situation has personally affected his family’s life, especially that of his oldest daughter, who has been stopped at the border and threatened to be sent back to Mexico by U.S. authorities, Adams said.\n\nHis oldest daughter has Indigenous features and darker skin and is the only one of her siblings who has experienced difficulties crossing the border, he said.\n\n“It's kind of strange to live in a place where you're worried about your 18-year-old daughter crossing the border by herself but not worried about your 8-year-old son crossing the border by himself,” Adams said.\n\nAdams believes that Trump’s rhetoric pits vulnerable communities against one another by stoking fear and scapegoating immigrants. But he doesn’t believe that Vice President Kamala Harris would have helped sort out immigration, either, if she had won the presidency.\n\n“If VP Harris would have won, she would have continued the 'prevention through deterrence' strategy that was begun during the Clinton administration and has continued under each successive administration ... Democrat and Republican,” Adams said.\n\nHe blamed the policy of making border crossing more difficult and dangerous for why people die in their efforts to seek new opportunities, refuge or family reunification.\n\n“We know that the policy has led to the death of thousands, the separation of families and the growth in the power of organized crime. ... The policy is morally repugnant, and it is anti-gospel,” Adams said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/22/dnc-fact-check-kamala-harris/74832489007/", "title": "DNC fact check: What Harris, other speakers got right and wrong", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris and the dozens of speakers that preceded her at Thursday's Democratic National Convention attacked former President Donald Trump on an array of fronts, including abortion, diplomacy and his litany of criminal charges.\n\nNot all of it was true.\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check team followed along to sort fact from fiction and add context where it was missing.\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nKamala Harris claim: Trump tariffs would cost households $4,000 per year\n\nTrump tariffs ‘\"would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year.\"\n\nThis overstates the impact economists project from Trump’s proposed 10% tariff on imported goods.\n\nWhile Trump has described it as a way to raise revenue, economists say it would mostly be passed along to consumers, effectively making it a tax.\n\nA study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found the tariff, along with a 60% tariff on Chinese goods also proposed by Trump, would lower the average post-tax incomes of American households by about $1,800.\n\nThat’s mostly in line with projections from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that says the tariff would cost households roughly $1,700 each year, and the conservative American Action Forum, which projects additional household costs between $1,700 and $2,350.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nCatch up on our convention fact-checks\n\nWe've fact-checked key speakers throughout the Republican and Democratic conventions.

But the court’s decision isn’t as clear cut as Harris’ remarks make it seem. It declares that “official” acts by presidents are protected, but steps taken as a candidate are not.\n\nThe ruling also leaves room for presidents to be prosecuted under a narrow set of circumstances, related to responsibilities “within the outer perimeter” of presidential duties, or to unofficial acts, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n“The parties before us do not dispute that a former President can be subject to criminal prosecution for unofficial acts committed while in office,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the 6-3 majority that divided along ideological lines. “They also agree that some of the conduct described in the indictment includes actions taken by Trump in his unofficial capacity.”\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the court gave Trump “all the immunity he asked for and more.” Trump is the first president – former or current – to be criminally charged.\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nRuben Gallego claim: VP Harris responsible for veteran benefits expansion, unemployment rate\n\n“Kamala Harris has delivered more benefits to more veterans than ever before and has achieved the lowest veterans unemployment rate in history.”\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs said it has granted benefits to 1.1 million veterans and their survivors so far in fiscal year 2024, an all-time record.\n\nThe VA said it’s been able to deliver more care and benefits than ever before largely because of the PACT Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August 2022. The White House has described the law as the “most significant expansion of VA Health Care in 30 years.”\n\nIt helps deliver more timely health care benefits and services to over five million veterans who may have been exposed to toxic substances – such as through burn pits – while serving the country, the White House said.\n\nBut the claim overreaches by giving direct credit to Harris for actions taken by an administration led by Biden. In public remarks in 2022, Harris credited Biden’s leadership for the passage of the PACT Act.\n\nThe issue is close to Biden, who has drawn a connection between burn pits and his late son Beau’s fatal brain cancer.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs website says the PACT Act is “is perhaps the largest health care and benefit expansion in VA history.” The Veterans of Foreign Wars, a nonprofit veterans service organization, considered the bill the most significant piece of veterans legislation in history.\n\nOn unemployment, the jobless rate among veterans fell to 2.1% in April 2023 – during the Biden-Harris administration – the lowest mark since 2000 when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking monthly unemployment for the group, the Military Times reported. For all of 2023, the rate was 2.8%, the lowest rate since at least 2000, the outlet reported.\n\nThe veterans unemployment rate was 3% in July, up from 2.9% the previous month, according to the Department of Labor.\n\nBut as with the veterans benefits, referring to this veterans unemployment rate as something Harris has “achieved” overstates her role in the process. USA TODAY found no record of Harris leading initiatives that would justify such a description.\n\n-Andre Byik\n\nKamala Harris claim: Trump plans to create a ‘national anti-abortion coordinator,’ force reporting on miscarriages and abortions\n\n“He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on women’s miscarriages and abortions.”\n\nThis claim does not appear to reference any plan or platform endorsed by Trump, but rather aspects of Project 2025, a political playbook created by the Heritage Foundation and dozens of other conservative groups.\n\nThe project calls for increasing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s surveillance of abortion information by forcing states that don’t currently provide this information to the CDC, such as California, Maryland and New Hampshire, to do so.\n\nPage 455 of the plan explains this would be done by allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to “use every available tool, including the cutting of funds, to ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what gestational age of the child for what reason, the mother’s state of residence, and by what method.” It also calls for information about miscarriages to be collected from the states.\n\nAs Harris alludes to, the plan also calls for appointing someone who is “unapologetically pro-life” as the “Senior Coordinator” of the “Office of Women, Children, and Families.”\n\nWhile Democrats have insisted Project 2025 is Trump’s plan if elected president, he has attempted to distance himself from it. In a July 5 Truth Social post, Trump wrote that he disagrees with parts of the plan and has “no idea who is behind it.” Notably, Trump embraced many of the Heritage Foundation’s policy proposals during his first administration, and some of his allies were involved in Project 2025, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nKamala Harris claim: Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare\n\n\"Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare.\"\n\nThis is a slightly softened version of a claim Harris’ campaign has made before, including a tweet from her campaign claiming Trump attempted to do this \"every single year.\" It oversimplifies a series of budget maneuvers.\n\nTrump didn’t attempt to cut general Social Security retirement benefits, but he attempted – and failed – to reduce spending for Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income, according to The Washington Post. About 8.5 million people receive such disability benefits, but that’s only a fraction of the number who receive retirement and survivor benefits.\n\nTrump did propose cuts to Medicare in his budgets for the fiscal years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, The Post noted. But an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that 85% of his proposed Medicare savings would come from healthcare providers and would lower costs for seniors.\n\nTrump’s last budget, released in February 2020, had about $500 billion in net Medicare spending reductions over 10 years, but most would come from reduced payments to hospitals and other healthcare providers, Forbes reported, citing the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nKamala Harris claim: Trump encouraged Russia to invade allies\n\n“Trump on the other hand threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies. Said Russia could, quote, ‘Do whatever the hell they want.’”\n\nThis claim popped up earlier in the evening by Sen. Mark Kelly, and by President Joe Biden at his State of the Union. Here’s what we reported when Kelly said it:\n\nThe quote Harris cited here is technically accurate but significantly oversimplified.\n\nTrump, speaking at a Feb. 10 campaign rally in Conway, South Carolina, suggested he might not come to the aid of NATO members attacked by Russia if they weren’t contributing enough money to the alliance, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n“One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, ‘Well sir, if we don’t pay and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?’\" Trump said. “I said, ‘You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent?’ He said, ‘Yes, let’s say that happened.’ No, I would not protect you.”\n\nThen, Trump added, “In fact I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.”\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at the time that Trump's comments could endanger lives and undermine the security of NATO members, including the U.S.\n\n-Chris Mueller and Andre Byik\n\nKamala Harris claim: She secured $20 billion for those hurt by foreclosure crisis\n\n“(I) delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure.”\n\nThis refers to the settlement Harris, as California’s attorney general, negotiated with several large mortgage companies in 2012 to provide relief for struggling homeowners in her state following the foreclosure crisis.\n\nThe nation’s five largest mortgage servicers – Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Ally Bank/GMAC Mortgage – were accused of using illicit tactics to wrongfully foreclose on homeowners, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2016. Harris pulled California out of nationwide mortgage settlement talks in September 2011 when it appeared her state’s share would be roughly $4 billion.\n\nIn announcing the deal in 2012, her office said it totaled $18 billion, of which more than $12 billion was to go toward reducing the principal on loans or offering short sales to roughly 250,000 homeowners who owed more than their homes were worth or were behind (or almost behind) on payments. There is a discrepancy in the specific dollar amount, however. While her office announced it as $18 billion, multiple media outlets through the years used the same $20 billion figure that Harris referenced during her address.\n\nUltimately, about $4.5 billion of that settlement went to lower debt on primary mortgages, the Wall Street Journal reported. The rest went to reduce debt on second mortgages and to short sales, in which banks agreed to allow homes to be sold for less than the mortgage value and wrote off the difference.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nMark Kelly claim: Trump said Russia could do ‘whatever the hell they want’\n\n“(Trump) invited Russia to do – and these are his words, not mine – whatever the hell they want.”\n\nAs President Joe Biden did in his State of the Union, Kelly here cites a quote that is technically accurate but significantly oversimplified.\n\nTrump, speaking at a Feb. 10 campaign rally in Conway, South Carolina, suggested he might not come to the aid of NATO members attacked by Russia if they weren’t contributing enough money to the alliance, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n“One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, ‘Well sir, if we don’t pay and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?’\" Trump said. “I said, ‘You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent?’ He said, ‘Yes, let’s say that happened.’ No, I would not protect you.”\n\nThen, Trump added, “In fact I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.”\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at the time that Trump's comments could endanger lives and undermine the security of NATO members, including the U.S.\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nAl Sharpton claim: Trump paid for newspaper ads urging death penalty for five teens\n\n“(Trump) spent a small fortune on full-page ads calling for the execution of five innocent young teenagers.”\n\nSharpton is referring to the Central Park Five, a group of Black and Latino teenagers wrongly convicted of assaulting a white female jogger in Central Park in 1989.\n\nLess than two weeks after the attack, Trump took out $85,000 worth of full-page ads in The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post and New York Newsday. The ads proclaimed in all caps, “Bring back the death penalty and bring back our police,\" going on to condemn a \"dangerously permissive atmosphere which allows criminals of every age to beat and rape a helpless woman and then laugh at her family's anguish.\"\n\nThe ads did not, however, explicitly advocate for the Central Park Five to be executed.\n\nIn 2002, the group was exonerated after a convicted murder Matias Reyes confessed to assaulting the jogger, which was confirmed by DNA evidence.\n\nTrump did not apologize for the ads when he was asked in 2019 whether he would apologize to the men.\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nMarcia Fudge claim: Trump was sued over housing for Black people\n\n“He started his career being sued for denying housing to Black families”\n\nThis lawsuit is real, though the quick mention leaves out how the case was resolved.\n\nThis claim from the former secretary of housing and urban development refers to a lawsuit filed more than half a century ago. Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made the same claim during a debate with Trump in 2016.\n\nTrump was in his late 20s in 1973 when the Justice Department sued him, his father Fred and their management company over allegations of racial discrimination at their housing developments in New York. According to testers for New York City’s human rights division, a Black woman who attempted to rent an apartment at a Brooklyn complex managed by Trump’s firm was told nothing was available, but a white woman was offered a choice of two apartments shortly after.\n\nThe case was settled in 1975 after Trump countersued the Justice Department for $100 million for making false statements. That allegation was dismissed.\n\nAs noted by NPR, Trump responded in the 2016 debate by emphasizing there was no admission of guilt in the case. Indeed, NPR reports, the Trumps took a settlement offer that included no admission of guilt but required the Trumps to place newspaper ads saying their properties welcomed Black applicants.\n\n\"Yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company — had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens,\" Trump said. \"And we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country — it was a federal lawsuit — were sued. We settled the suit with zero, with no admission of guilt.\"\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nHow we pick and research fact checks\n\nEver wonder how fact-checkers do their work?

Trump said he rewrote his closing remarks at the Republican National Convention in July to “bring the whole country, even the whole world, together,” he told the Washington Examiner.\n\nThe FBI identified the gunman as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, and said Secret Service agents killed him at the scene. But officials have been unable to determine his motive, one of the key unanswered questions sparking a significant amount of misinformation.\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked an array of false claims stemming from the assassination attempt.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDNC background: Democrats link Trump to Jan. 6 Capitol riot\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, and former President Donald Trump’s alleged role in the attack, has become a focal point at this week’s Democratic National Convention.\n\nAquilino Gonell, a former U.S. Capitol police officer, said in a convention speech that rioters beat him with a pole attached to an American flag, and he blamed Trump for summoning protesters to the Capitol.\n\nTrump is accused in a federal indictment of directing his supporters to march on the Capitol in an effort to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence to reject the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory.\n\nMore than 1,200 defendants have been charged in the attack on the Capitol. Trump’s case was overseen by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked numerous claims about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDNC background: Harris’ childhood, ethnicity spawn misinformation\n\nNot long after the Democrats picked Vice President Kamala Harris to replace President Joe Biden at the top of their ticket, several false or misleading claims about her resurfaced.\n\nMany of those originated four years earlier when Harris was picked as Biden’s running mate in 2020. Some question whether Harris – the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father – is eligible for the presidency. Others claim she was raised in Canada, is not African-American and as a prosecutor held Black inmates past their release dates.\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked several false claims that center on Harris’ background:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDNC background: Democrats, GOP spar over election security claims\n\nAs the 2024 election draws closer, Democrats and Republicans continue to spar over concerns about the security and integrity of the voting process.\n\nA bill passed in July by House Republicans and some Democrats would require proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections – even though data shows the problem of non-citizens voting is virtually nonexistent.\n\nThe measure advanced amid repeated, baseless claims from former President Donald Trump – the Republican presidential nominee – that the 2020 election was rigged against him. He referenced the claim in a video shown during his party’s convention in July. However, state-level recounts, reviews and audits of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud.\n\nTrump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee led by his daughter-in-law have said they will mobilize 100,000 people in battleground states to ensure “transparency and fairness” in a move that has drawn criticism from opponents saying it has the potential to lead to voter intimidation.\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked numerous false claims about the integrity of the elections:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDNC background: Project 2025 and that giant book\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has warned voters about what she describes as the dangers of Project 2025 in the weeks since she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nThe project is an effort by the Heritage Foundation and other conservative organizations that resulted in a 900-page playbook for the next Republican president. A full implementation of the guidance in the document would effectively overhaul the federal government.\n\nA slew of Trump’s allies are involved in the project, though Trump has maintained that he is not.\n\nHe’s described its proposals as “extreme” and “absolutely ridiculous,” though he has not specified what he disagrees with.\n\nNumerous Democratic leaders, including Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Pennsylvania, attacked Project 2025 and attempted to connect it to Trump in their convention speeches. Some speakers, such as comedian Kenan Thompson, used an oversized physical copy of the playbook in condemning it on stage.\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked several claims about Project 2025:\n\n-BrieAnna Frank\n\nDNC background: Harris wasn’t ‘border czar,’ but debate continues over immigration policy\n\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden announced Harris would lead the administration's diplomatic efforts with Mexico and the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to slow migration to the U.S. southern border. At the time, Harris said the administration “must address the root causes that cause people to make the trek, as the president described, to come here.”\n\nBut Harris was never put in charge of the southern border or made \"border czar,\" contrary to some posts on social media. Immigration has been a top issue for voters as encounters with migrants at the southern border have increased under Biden.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has promised the largest deportation effort in U.S. history if he is elected again. He also said he would reinstate strict immigration policies from his first term, limit asylum access at the U.S. southern border and eliminate automatic citizenship for people born in the U.S. to immigrant parents.\n\nIn February, Republican lawmakers blocked an immigration bill that would have revamped the country’s immigration and border policies. Biden blamed the bill's failure on opposition from Trump. Since then, Biden has issued executive orders to implement new restrictions on asylum access and speed up the process to get a green card for certain spouses and children of U.S. citizens.\n\n- Chris Mueller", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/22/presidential-debate-donald-trump-joe-biden-face-off-one-last-time/3725267001/", "title": "Trump, Biden spar over China, economy, covid in last election debate", "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. – President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden tussled over health care, the economy and the nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic in a final debate Thursday that was fiery but far less vitriolic than their first appearance together last month.\n\nNearing the end of an intense campaign that has once again divided the nation, the two men slammed each other’s records during the 90-minute slugfest, with both repeatedly demanding time to respond to each other’s accusations as they worked through emotional battles on immigration, foreign policy and racial tensions in America.\n\nTrump walked into the debate on the Belmont University campus in Tennessee with more to prove and more at stake. Down double digits in polls national and single digits in virtually every battleground state in the country, it was the president – buffeted by the coronavirus and its economic consequences – who was most in need of reset heading into the Nov. 3 election.\n\n“We’re learning to live with it,” Trump said of the virus early in the debate, arguing that coming vaccines and therapeutics would take care of the latest surge in COVID-19 cases cropping up in many states across the country. “We can’t lock ourselves in a basement like Joe does.”\n\nBiden, who started off his debate by calling attention to the number of Americans who have died from the virus -- some 220,000 -- fired back by quoting the president’s own words back to him.\n\n“He says we’re learning to live with it,” the former vice president said during one of the more poignant exchanges of the evening. “People are learning to die with it.\"\n\nAs expected, Trump went hard on accusations against Biden’s son, Hunter, and a recent report about the alleged contents of a computer hard drive purporting to document his Ukrainian and Chinese business ties. Federal authorities are investigating whether the material – supplied by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer – is part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nBiden noted Trump’s foreign real estate holdings, including a Chinese bank account recently unearthed by The New York Times. Trump asserted, without providing evidence, that the account was closed before he became president.\n\nA last-minute decision to mute microphones during some portions of the debate appeared to lower the temperature, giving both candidates two minutes to answer questions without interruption. In at least two instances, Trump appeared to have his microphone cut off as he ran over his allotted two minutes.\n\nTrump and Biden fought bitterly over immigration and a recent report that the administration has been unable to locate the parents of some 545 children who were among the families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2017 and 2018. That turned into a much broader debate over immigration.\n\n“Who built the cages, Joe?” Trump repeatedly asked, pushing an argument that it was the Obama administration that had separated families attempting to cross the border.\n\nIt was the Trump administration that implemented the \"zero tolerance\" policy in 2018 that separated migrant children and parents at the southern border. The administration later admitted that it began separating families under a pilot program in 2017.\n\nBiden accused Trump of “ripping” parents from their children.\n\nVeteran pollster Frank Luntz said that Trump did “much better” than in the first debate, but questioned whether the debate did enough to “change the electorate fundamentally.”\n\nThe mute button created a more civil environment – for the most part – but did not lead to any kind of breakthrough moment for either candidate, analysts said. It was probably a draw, they said, and that benefits the front-running Biden.\n\n\"Assuming this debate is perceived as close or a draw, it's a win for Biden since he came into the evening with the most to lose and avoided making a disqualifying gaffe,\" said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan.\n\nKall added: \"This was the last opportunity in the campaign before tens of millions of people to change the election narrative and this didn't occur.\"\n\nLara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at the George Washington University, said Trump \"again spoke only to his base,\" while Biden \"appealed to those who may still have been on the fence.\"\n\n— John Fritze, David Jackson and Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump to Americans who didn't vote for him: We have to get back to a pre-pandemic country\n\nWelker asked both candidates what they would say on their Inauguration Day to Americans who did not vote for them. Trump began by saying that he wants to rebuild the country to what it looked like before the coronavirus wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy and killed more than 220,000 Americans.\n\n\"We have to make the country totally successful as it was prior to the plague coming in,\" he said before pivoting to attacking Biden.\n\n\"We are on the road to success, but I'm cutting taxes, and he wants to raise everybody's taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything,\" Trump said of Biden. \"If he gets in you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen. Your 401K's will go to hell and it'd be a very very sad day for this country.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden: science over fiction, hope over fear\n\nBiden said if elected, he would give an optimistic inaugural speech to Americans who didn’t vote for him based on plans to grow the economy, deal with racism and develop clean energy.\n\n“I will say I’m an American president. I represent all of you, whether you voted for me or against me,” Biden said. “We’re going to choose science over fiction. We’re going to choose hope over fear. We’re going to choose to move forward because there are enormous opportunities.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden reiterates opposition to fracking ban\n\nBiden reiterated his opposition to a ban on fracking – something that Trump continues to accuse Biden of wanting to do.\n\n“I do rule out banning fracking,” Biden said, adding that the fossil fuel industry needs to be able to “transition” as the country takes action to improve the environment.\n\nBiden has said he wants to stop new permits for fracking\n\n“Excuse me. He’s against fracking. He has said it,” Trump said. Biden clarified that he’s against fracking on federally owned land.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nPersonal comparisons\n\nThe candidates got personal as Trump hammered away at one of his main arguments, that Biden had his chance during his many years in Washington and didn’t deliver.\n\n“I ran because of you,” Trump said. “I ran because of Barack Obama because I thought you did a poor job.”\n\nBiden facetiously said he hopes Trump does put the focus on him as that will help the voters.\n\n“Because what’s happening here, you know who I am. You know who he is. You know his character. You know my character,” Biden said. “You know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race.”\n\nTrump tried to turn the discussion back to his campaign’s unproven charge that Biden accepted influence payments from foreign entities.\n\n“Don’t give me this stuff about how you're this innocent baby,” Trump said. “Joe. They’re calling you a corrupt politician.”\n\nAs the debate turned to a discussion of the Black Lives Matter movement, Biden jabbed Trump for his boasts that no president since Abraham Lincoln has helped Black people more than he has.\n\n\"Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history,” Biden said of Trump. “He pours fuel on every single racist fire. Every single one”\n\n— Maureen Groppe and Ledyard King\n\nBiden and Trump spar over climate\n\nTrump defended his decision to pull out of the Paris Accord to set international carbon emission standards, saying it would “have destroyed our business” and cost the country “trillions of dollars.”\n\n“I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs,” Trump said, adding that the water and air have gotten cleaner during his administration\n\nBut Biden pushed back, saying the voluntary treaty would have addressed a looming crisis that scientists say is already damaging the country in terms of broader wildfires and fiercer hurricanes.\n\nThe former vice president called climate change an “existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it.”\n\nHis plan also calls for reaching “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, a deadline laid out in the Green New Deal.\n\nBiden has said he doesn’t support the Green New Deal that was introduced by liberal Democrats in Congress earlier this year. But he does support a plan that transitions the economy to a green environment that he said would provide “millions of good-paying jobs.”\n\nBut on his campaign web site, the former vice president calls the proposal a “crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nTrump: ‘Least racist person in this room’\n\nFacing questions about his past statements on white supremacy and other hate groups, Trump repeatedly claimed during the debate he was the “least racist person in this room.”\n\nTrump and Biden battled over race in one of the more emotional moments of the debate. Trump repeatedly pointed to the 1994 crime deal that Biden helped shepherd through Congress, legislation that Biden acknowledged was a “mistake.”\n\nTrump didn’t directly answer a question about his relationship with the Black Lives Matters movement but instead said his first impression of that movement was hearing anti-police chants following police-involved shootings of unarmed people of color.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nBiden says institutional racism exists in America\n\nBiden said he believes there is institutional racism in America and accused Trump of taking the country backwards in terms of equality.\n\n“A black parent, no matter how rich or poor they are, has to teach their child not to wear a hoody as they cross their street,” Biden said, reciting examples of how people of color confront racism in the U.S.\n\n“The fact of the matter is, there is institutional racism in America,” Biden said, adding that the U.S. has never fully “lived up to” the principle that “all men are created equal.”\n\n“We’ve constantly been moving the needle toward inclusion, not exclusion,” Biden said. “This is the first president who’s said, ‘We’ve got to put an end to that.’”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nTrump dodges question on family separations\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said in a court filing that they are unable to locate the parents of 545 children who were among the families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2017 and 2018.\n\nWhen asked how he plans to reunite those families, Trump said: \"We're trying very hard, but a lot of these kids come up without the parents. They come over through cartels and the coyotes,\" he said.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the more than 1,000 parents who were separated from their children were deported back to Central America, according to the filing.\n\nThe president then insisted that the Obama administration instituted the policy and his administration carried it out but the Trump administration implemented the \"zero tolerance\" policy in 2018 that separated migrant children and parents at the southern border. The administration later admitted that it actually began separating families under a pilot program in 2017.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden: 'We owe' dreamers a pathway to citizenship\n\nBiden said one of the first steps he would take as president is proposed legislation to give some 11 million undocumented immigrants brought over by their parents or guardians at a young age a pathway to citizenship.\n\nThose children, known as “dreamers” had a temporary reprieve under the Obama administration but now live in fear of deportation under Trump.\n\n“They’re going to be immediately certified again to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship” rather than “sent home to a country they’ve never seen before,” Biden said of his plan. “Many of them are model citizens. Over 20,000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them.”\n\nAsked why the Obama administration did not do more to protect them. Biden acknowledged that it “took to long to get it right.”\n\nBut Trump shot back that “he had eight years to say what he was going to do (and) he did nothing.”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nTrump, Biden at odds on stimulus to boost economy\n\nTrump said he hasn’t been able to reach an agreement on another stimulus to counter the recession from the pandemic because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., won’t reach an agreement before the election.\n\n“Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve anything because she’d love to have some victories on a date called Nov. 3,” Trump said. “We are ready, willing and able to do something.”\n\nBiden said House Democrats approved a spending plan during the summer. But Trump blasted it for benefitting poorly run states and cities governed by Democrats.\n\n“The bill that has passed in the House was a bailout of badly run, high crime, Democrat – all run by Democrats cities and states,” Trump said.\n\nBiden said if elected he would serve as president of Democratic and Republican regions.\n\n“I’m going to be an American president,” Biden said. “I don’t see red states and blue states. What I see is American, United States.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden backs $15 federal minimum wage; Trump doesn’t\n\nTrump and Biden disagreed whether the federal government should institute a $15 minimum wage.\n\nTrump said it would put many companies out of business and that it should be a state-by-state decision.\n\nBiden said that it’s “simply not true” that it would hurt businesses.\n\n“No one should work one job, two jobs below poverty,” Biden said, adding that many frontline health care workers during the pandemic are making below $15 an hour. “They deserve a minimum wage of $15 and anything below that puts them in poverty.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden: Trump ‘lecturing me’ on Medicare and Social Security?\n\nBiden scoffed at accusations from Trump that he would seek to “destroy” Social Security and Medicare.\n\n“When he's talking about a public option,” Trump said of Biden’s health care plan, “he's talking about destroying your Medicare and destroying your Social Security.”\n\nBiden fired back: “This is the guy who's tried to cut Medicare. The idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.\"\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden: ‘I beat all those other people’\n\nBiden tried to swat away Trump’s constant labeling of the former vice president as a “socialist” by pointing out that he conquered far-left candidates during the Democratic primary to nab the nomination.\n\n“I think he thinks he’s running against somebody else,” Biden said. “He’s running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them.”\n\nThe moment echoed a recent visit to Wisconsin when Biden, upon being asked by a reporter about voters’ concerns he was too socialist, responded: “I beat the socialist,” a reference to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nTrump knocks another opponent: Obama; Biden says Trump is 'confused'\n\nTrump has occasionally used this debate to criticize another political opponent: Barack Obama, hitting his administration over issues like health care, North Korea, immigration policy, and even its response to swine flu.\n\n\"They left me a mess,\" Trump said during a discussion of North Korea's nuclear threat.\n\nBiden, who served the Obama administration as vice president, said Trump took over a prosperous and peaceful country but has cozied up to dictators like North Korea's Kim Jong Un and undercut the nation's health care.\n\n\"He's a very confused guy,\" Biden said of Trump.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nMute button shuts down initial statement\n\nIn one of the first manifestations of the debate commission’s new policy on muting microphones, Trump appeared to have the final words of his opening response were cut off as he was answering a question on health care.\n\nBoth candidates were limited to two minutes in their initial response to a question. It appeared Trump went over that time as he was discussing his desire to end Obamacare.\n\nEarlier in the debate, Biden’s microphone didn't flip on until after the former vice president began speaking for a second.\n\nThe new policy, imposed after a widely panned first debate defined by interruptions on Sept. 29, has had impact on the broader feel of the debate: Though the Trump campaign argued the rule was unfair, both candidates have had more time to speak without interruption during their initial answers.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nTrump says he would 'come up with a brand new, beautiful health care plan' if ACA is overturned\n\nOne of the most pressing questions hanging over the Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett is a case backed by the Trump administration to strike down the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration's signature healthcare plan. The court will hear the case on Nov. 10, one week after Election Day.\n\nAsked what he would do to help the 20 million people who get their health insurance through Obamacare if the court overturns the ACA, Trump said he would \"come up with a brand new, beautiful health care\" plan. Trump, who campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare, has offered few details on what a Republican plan would look like.\n\nTrump instead boasted about the elimination of the individual mandate which required most Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. He promised to protect people with pre-existing conditions, which is already enshrined under Obamacare but did not offer details on how he would do it under a new GOP plan.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nThe heat’s turned up\n\nThe debate got more contentious as the night wore on with one of the most heated exchanges occurring about halfway through during a discussion on North Korea.\n\nThe candidates were battling over Trump’s relationship with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, whom he’s met with.\n\n“He’s legitimized North Korea,” Biden said. “He's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug.”\n\nTrump responded that it’s important to have good relationships with other leaders.\n\n“We’re not at war,” he said.\n\nBiden shot back that the nation had a good relationship with Hitler before he invaded Europe.\n\nDuring the next segment, on issues affecting families, when Biden made one of his frequent reference to his birthplace, Trump interrupted.\n\n“He doesn't come from Scranton,” Trump said. “He lived there for a short period of time.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: North Korea a threat\n\nBiden said Trump legitimized North Korean leader Kim Jong Un despite the totalitarian nuclear power that is developing more sophisticated missiles that would reach the United States.\n\n“He’s a thug,” Biden said. “We’re going to make sure we control them and make sure they cannot hurt us.”\n\nBiden said would only meet with Kim Jong Un if he agreed to reduce his nuclear stockpile.\n\n“The Korean peninsula should be a nuclear-free zone,” Biden said.\n\nBut Trump said he improved relations that were troubled. He said relations are good and the countries aren’t at war.\n\n“They left me a mess,” Trump said of the Obama administration that included Biden as vice president. “He didn’t like Obama.”\n\nBiden scoffed.\n\n“We had a good relationship with Hitler before he invaded the rest of Europe,” Biden said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden introduces ‘Bidencare’\n\nBiden said he plans to pass Obamacare with a public option – and call it “Bidencare” – when asked what he would do if the Supreme Court were to overturn the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe former vice president said his plan would reduce drug prices and premiums by allowing patients through the Medicare program to negotiate drug prices with insurance companies.\n\n“We’re going to make sure we’re in a situation where we’re actually going to protect preexisting conditions” he added, accusing the president of failing to come up with a plan on this front despite promising one. “He’s never come up with a plan.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden accuses Trump of cozying up to foreign ‘thugs,’ including China\n\nBiden said he would crackdown on China economically and move cut the trade deficit that has ballooned since Trump imposed tariffs on the foreign power.\n\n“They have to play by the rules,” Biden said, discussing ways that China has tried to set boundaries that are not internationally recognized or their efforts to steal intellectual property from the U.S.”\n\nThe former vice president went on to criticize Trump for cozying up to “thugs” running China, Russia and North Korea.\n\n“And he pokes his finger at all of our friends, all of our allies. We make up only 25% of the world’s economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to China ‘these are the rules. You play by them or you're gonna pay the price for not playing by them, economically’,” Biden said. “That's the way I will run it. And That's what we did in upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things (under Obama).”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nTrump acknowledges he has (or had) a bank account in China; Biden urges him to 'show us' his taxes\n\nTrump acknowledges he has (or had) a bank account in China; Biden urges him to 'show us' his taxes\n\nTrump acknowledged he has had a Chinese bank account and insisted he wants to release his tax returns – but also said he would continue to withhold them from the public.\n\nUnder pressure over the issue, the president said he has closed his Chinese account, but did not provide proof – which would be in the tax returns he is refusing to release because they remain under audit.\n\nAn audit does not obligate Trump to keep his tax returns private.\n\nBiden told Trump there's a simple solution: Just release the documents.\n\n\"Show us – just show us,\" Biden told Trump. \"Stop playing around.\"\n\n— David Jackson\n\nBiden says he’s ‘not taken a penny’ from foreign countries\n\nBiden said he’s “not taken a penny” from any foreign country after Trump raised allegations that the former vice president made money in a business scheme involving China with his son Hunter Biden.\n\n“I think you have to clear it up and talk to the American people,” Trump said, raising allegations elevated in a New York Post story last week that revealed purported emails from Hunter Biden and his former business associates.\n\n“I have not taken a penny from any foreign source at any point in my life,” Biden responded. He then raised recent reports that Trump has a secret bank account in China. “He’s talking about me taking money from China? I’ve not taken a penny from any country. Ever. ever. Ever.\"\n\nBiden pointed to Trump not releasing his tax returns after promising to do so for years, saying “What are you hiding?”\n\n“Nothing was unethical,” Biden said of Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the energy company Burisma. “My son has no made money from China. The only guy who has made money from China was this guy,” he said, directing his comments at Trump\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nAre smirks allowed?\n\nThe candidates were told not to interrupt each other but no one said they couldn’t physically react.\n\nAnd Biden had plenty of facial expressions when Trump was asked about his criticisms of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert.\n\n“This guy's a disaster,” Trump said of Fauci Monday. On Thursday, Trump said they didn’t have a problem.\n\n“I get along very well with Anthony,” Trump said, as Biden smiled.\n\nTrump then implied Fauci is a partisan.\n\n“I think he’s a Democrat but that’s OK,” Trump said of Fauci, as Biden shook his head.\n\nTrump got his turn when Biden was asked whether there was anything unethical with his son’s work for a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n“The guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy,” Biden said of Trump as the president shook his head with a smirk.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: Trump 'panicked' over coronavirus\n\nBiden once again went after Trump for telling author Bob Woodward in February that he purposely played down the threat of coronavirus.\n\nWoodward recently released an explosive new book on Trump titled \"Rage\", which included the president telling the journalist in a recorded interview weeks before the first death in the U.S. that despite knowing how \"deadly\" and serious the coronavirus pandemic would be, he wanted to \"play it down\" and would to continue to do so.\n\n“He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air and it was much worse than the flu,” Biden said. “He went on record … that he knew how dangerous it was but he didn’t want to tell us because he didn’t want us to panic. Americans don’t panic. He panicked.”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nBiden: Countries that interfere with election will pay\n\nBiden vowed to penalize any country that influences the U.S. election after intelligence officials said Russia, China and Iran are trying to interfere.\n\n“Any country that interferes with us will pay a price because it is our sovereignty,” Biden said.\n\nBiden said a former national security adviser accused Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, of being a Russian pawn by spreading misinformation. But Biden asked why Trump hasn’t challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“What happens? Nothing happens,” Biden said. “I don’t know why this president is unwilling to take on Putin.”\n\nTrump said he imposed sanctions on Russians.\n\n“There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump,” Trump said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nTrump shows up in Nashville combative, but more restrained\n\nIt was a question that had dominated the pre-debate coverage for days: Would a more subdued Trump show up to the debate stage in Nashville, or would the president hold firm to the pugilistic style he has embraced for much of the campaign.\n\nIn a way, in the early moments of the debate at least, he managed to do both.\n\nTrump avoided the interruptions that marred the first the debate, giving Biden more room to speak – a strategy his aides had pushed him to embrace. But he still pressed hard against Biden as the Democrat slammed the administration’s coronavirus response.\n\n“We’re about to go into a dark winter. And he has no clear plan,” Biden argued on COVID at one point.\n\n“He was months behind me. He was way behind us,” Trump countered.\n\n“We’re learning to live with it,” Trump said of the virus. “We can’t lock ourselves in a basement like Joe does.”\n\nThe back and forth was tense but less fiery and uncivil than the first debate on Sept. 29.\n\nAt one point Trump asked NBC’s Kristen Welker if he could respond to a Biden criticism. When Welker said he could, Trump responded: \"Thank you, I appreciate that.\"\n\nThe exchange represented a departure from the more intense and combative exchanges he has had with the moderators of the first debate and a recent town hall.\n\n— John Fritze and Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump blames COVID-19 response on 'Democratic states'; Biden says the president is playing politics\n\nTrump sought to shed blame for the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic problems by blaming Democratic state governors.\n\nStates, like New York and Michigan, led by Democrats Andrew Cuomo and Gretchen Whitmer, have failed to step up and are resisting re-opening their economies, Trump said.\n\nBiden said New York and other states have \"bent the curve\" on COVID cases and are coming back, and added that Trump should not be dividing the country into \"red states\" and \"blue states.\"\n\n\"We're all the United States,\" Biden said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden says he would ‘shut down the virus, not the country’\n\nBiden did not rule out future shutdowns of businesses to combat the coronavirus if elected president, saying reopening must slow down if the rate of infections grows faster than it can be combatted.\n\nBut the former vice president said: “I’m going to shut down the virus, not the county.”\n\nBiden blamed the “ineptitude” of Trump for putting the country in a situation where many businesses and schools are closed to fight the spread of COVID-19. Biden said he supported health precautions against COVID-19 that would still allow businesses to operate.\n\n“He shouldn’t have been on his golf course,” Biden said of the president’s coronavirus response. “He should have been negotiating with Speaker Pelosi.”\n\nTrump fired back: “All he does is talk about shutdowns,” he said, adding that Biden is just like Democratic governors who have enforced shutdowns in their states. “He’ll shut down the country if one person in our massive bureaucracy says close it down”\n\nBiden responded: “Absolutely, not true. We should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\n'He says we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it'\n\nTrump has repeatedly said we're \"rounding the turn on the pandemic,\" which has killed more than 220,000 people but the president had a new message about the coronavirus.\n\nBiden criticized Trump's optimistic message on the pandemic as several states are reaching new highs in average new daily cases and slammed the president for saying that the pandemic is going to be \"over soon.\"\n\n\"We're learning to live with it. We have no choice we can lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He says we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it,\" Biden responded.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nNo initial interruptions\n\nBoth Trump and Biden got through their first opening comments without interruptions.\n\nAfter all the overtalking of the first debate, the debate commission announced that only the microphone of the candidate speaking would be turned on while that candidate had two minutes to give an initial answer to each of the debate topics.\n\n“I’m going to ask you to please speak one at a time,” Kristen Welker, the debate moderator, requested at the start. “The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say.”\n\nWelker introduced the first topic, the coronavirus pandemic, and both Trump and Biden gave their initial responses uninterrupted.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: Trump still has no plan\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden slammed Trump for not doing more to prevent 220,000 Americans from dying of COVID-19 so far.\n\n“Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America,” Biden said.\n\nThe former vice president said he would urge everyone to wear a mask for months, which could avoid half the projected 200,000 more deaths expected by the end of the year. He also proposed to create programs for rapid testing and national standards for reopening schools and businesses.\n\n“We’re in a circumstance where the president still has no plan,” Biden said. “I will take care of this.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump takes first question on COVID\n\nTrump took the first question in the debate – on COVID-19, and how his administration is going to deal with the latest surge in cases taking place in many states.\n\nThe president focused on the mortality rate in the country, which has decreased, and said asserted that states would climb out of their recent increases.\n\n“We’re fighting it and we’re fighting it hard,” Trump said. “There’s some spikes and surges in other places, and they will soon be gone.”\n\nTrump talked about his personal experience with COVID-19.\n\n“It’s going away,” he said.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nFinal presidential debate is underway\n\nThe final debate between Trump and Biden is underway in Nashville, an event that has been described as the president’s last, best chance to reset a campaign that is running behind in most of the nation’s battleground states.\n\nFamily members for both candidates have occupied the front rows in the Curb Event Center at Belmont University. An orange program and a pack of anti-bacterial wipes was placed on each seat in the hall, where about 200 people will watch the candidates square off in person.\n\nThe debate comes with less than two weeks to go before the Nov. 3 election, and as more than 40 million Americans have already cast a ballot. The candidates will discuss the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, racial tensions, national security and leadership, among other topics.\n\nBuckle up: No matter what happens, the next 90 minutes will be among the most interesting and important of this rollercoaster of an election.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nMembers of Trump family spotted in masks\n\nMembers of the Trump family including First Lady Melania Trump and the president's children Eric, Donald, Ivanka and Tiffany were spotted wearing masks as required by the debates commission. The family was criticized for refusing to wear masks at presidential debate at the Cleveland Clinic on Sept. 29, just two days before the president tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nLara Trump, a Trump campaign official and the wife of Trump's son Eric, sparred with Fox News' Chris Wallace, who moderated the debate, about whether the family was asked to wear masks indoors.\n\n\"We walked in with a mask on. We sat down - all the seats were socially distanced,\" she told Wallace earlier this month. \"I want to be very clear, never one time did anyone from Cleveland Clinic come up and ask any member of our family to put a mask on.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump invites Tony Bobulinski, Hunter Biden's former business partner, as debate guest\n\nPresident Donald Trump is again taking a page from his 2016 playbook by inviting a guest to attack his opponent.\n\nThe Trump campaign has enlisted Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, who has accused the former vice president of accepting influence payments from foreign entities. Bobulinski claims that Hunter Biden spoke to the former vice president often about his business dealings and \"frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals.\"\n\nJoe Biden has insisted that his son Hunter's business interests have never influenced his policies.\n\nBobulinski's appearance comes after The New York Post reported on the alleged contents of a computer hard drive purporting to document the Ukrainian and Chinese business activities of Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. Federal authorities are investigating whether the material supplied to the Post by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, is part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nBiden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates responded to the allegations by pointing out the former vice president released his tax returns, which show \"there is no indication he ever got any money from anybody in these business deals.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever. He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him,\" Bates said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday campaign officials told reporters they expect Trump to attack Biden and his family. Biden Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield warned that such accusations would be \"amplifying Russian misinformation.\"\n\nBobulinski has agreed to cooperate with a Senate investigation into the Bidens and agreed to be interviewed by members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Finance committees on Friday.\n\nFor Trump, the move was a reprise of a similar stunt in 2016, when the president entered a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with three women who had accused President Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior. At the time, Trump was still reeling from the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood recording in which he was heard bragging about groping women.\n\nIn what was billed as a campaign call \"ahead of tonight's presidential debate,\" officials outlined allegations against Hunter Biden and his business activities in Ukraine and China. Aides refused to answer any question that did not pertain to Hunter Biden hours before the final match-up between Trump and Biden.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian and John Fritze\n\nNo plexiglass to separate Trump, Biden\n\nThe plexiglass that separated the vice-presidential candidates during their debate this month will not be present on the presidential debate stage in Nashville.\n\nThe barrier was added to the stage following Trump’s diagnosis with COVID-19 and an outbreak at the White House. It was on prominent display when Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris debated in Utah on Oct. 7.\n\nHealth officials in Nashville originally recommended the plexiglass but after consulting with Dr. Tony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and taking Trump's negative test result into account, the glass was removed around 4:30 p.m. CT, according to Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nTrump recovered from his bout with the virus and has held an active campaign scheduled. Both candidates have tested negative for the virus ahead of the debate.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Plexiglass barriers were seen between the podiums. But by Thursday afternoon, after the two candidates conducted their walkthroughs of the debate hall, they were gone.\n\n— John Fritze, Joey Garrison and The Tennessean\n\nTrump at downtown fundraiser; Biden awaiting debate at local home\n\nThe president and several members of the first family, including Ivanka and Tiffany Trump, were still at a downtown fundraiser late Thursday afternoon.\n\nKid Rock and Lee Greenwood were on hand at the JW Marriott hotel where the fundraiser is taking place.\n\nBiden is staying at a local home while he awaits the debate.\n\n— Natalie Neysa Alund and Adam Tamburin, The Tennessean\n\nWhat time does the debate start?\n\nThe debate will air from 9 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. ET, and will be moderated by NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker. Viewers can stream the match-up at USATODAY.com. The debate also will air on major networks and cable channels, including Fox News, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, PBS and C-SPAN.\n\nJoe Biden invites North Carolina restaurant couple as guests for debate\n\nA North Carolina couple struggling to keep their restaurant afloat during the coronavirus pandemic will join Democratic nominee Joe Biden in Nashville for Thursday night’s presidential debate.\n\nZweli and Leonardo Williams, owners of Zweli’s Kitchen, a Zimbabwean restaurant in Durham, N.C., will be in the debate crowd as the former vice president’s invited guests, according to the Biden campaign.\n\n“They have really had to adapt in order to keep their business afloat,” Biden campaign senior advisor Symone Sanders said during a press call. “They are two of the many small business owners who have felt an economic impact of this administration’s failed response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden camp rebuts Hunter attacks\n\nA Biden aide predicted Trump would attack the former vice president's son during Thursday night’s debate in Tennessee and said doing so would be \"amplifying Russian misinformation.\"\n\nTheir pre-debate warning from Biden comes after The New York Post reported on the alleged contents of a computer hard drive purporting to document the Ukrainian and Chinese business activities of Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. Federal authorities are investigating whether the material supplied to the Post by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, has part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nMore: A tabloid got a trove of data on Hunter Biden from Rudy Giuliani. Now, the FBI is probing a possible disinformation campaign.\n\n\"We expect that Trump will attack Biden and his family,” Biden Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield said Thursday. “And every time he does that, all he's doing is reinforcing what we've said all along: He is acknowledging that he has no case for a second term.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump tests negative for COVID\n\nSoon after Trump’s COVID diagnosis this month a question emerged that the White House never fully answered: Was the president tested for the virus before he stood on stage with Biden for their first debate?\n\nThis time around, White House officials are being more clear.\n\n“We tested him on the way here and he tested negative,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters traveling with the president to the debate in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThe White House announced Trump’s positive test result on the morning of Oct. 2. He took part in the debate with Biden days earlier, on Sept. 29. Trump has not directly answered whether he was tested on the day of the debate, a requirement from the Commission on Presidential Debates, and White House aides have been unwilling to answer questions about the timeline of his previous negative tests.\n\n“I don't know, I don't even remember,” Trump said during a televised town hall on NBC last week. “I test all the time.\"\n\n– John Fritze\n\nTrump has much on the line in final debate with Biden\n\nTrump faces a make-or-break moment in his campaign for a second term as he squares off Thursday against Biden in the final presidential debate of the 2020 election – and perhaps the final opportunity to reset the narrative of the race.\n\nAfter a widely panned and frequently vitriolic debate Sept. 29, the two candidates will square off with less than two weeks to go before the Nov. 3 election. What to watch: Will Trump moderate his tone after facing blowback for coming in \"too hot\" during his first exchange with Biden? How will the decision by the Commission on Presidential Debates to mute microphones during portions of the debate affect the back-and-forth?\n\nThe final debate comes as Biden enjoyed double-digit leads in national polls and single-digit leads in most battlegrounds, findings the Trump campaign argues does not adequately capture the enthusiasm among the president's supporters for a second term.\n\nMore:How to watch the last presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump\n\nThe debate will air from 9 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. ET, and will be moderated by NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker.

A viral moment during the event came when Harris threw shade at Donald Trump's rallies as protesters were being removed.\n\nThe night ended with a sold-out rally at the Resch Expo in Green Bay where the vice president focused her speech on the theme of \"A New Way Forward for Wisconsin.\"\n\nWith less than three weeks to go until Election Day, the campaign trail is especially focused on battleground states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Thursday marked Harris' sixth visit to Wisconsin as a presidential candidate.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel and Green Bay Press Gazette provided updates throughout the day. Review it below:\n\nWatch Kamala Harris rally in Green Bay\n\nKamala Harris ends speech at Resch Expo, heads to Michigan tomorrow\n\nHarris ended her speech around 7:20 p.m. after speaking for about half an hour.\n\nHarris is set to campaign tomorrow in Grand Rapids and Oakland County, Michigan. Trump will also hold a rally in Detroit Friday.\n\n-- Hope Karnopp\n\nKamala Harris encourages sending back absentee ballots, making plan to vote\n\nHarris reminded the crowd there are 19 days until Election Day and encouraged people to make a plan to vote.\n\nEarly, in-person absentee voting begins Tuesday, the same day former President Obama and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz will rally in Madison.\n\n\"If you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today. And remember, Wisconsin has same-day voter registration,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service recommends mailing back absentee ballots at least a week before Election Day, Nov. 5. Sending it back 10-14 days beforehand will ensure your clerk receives it in time.\n\nEarly voting in Wisconsin: How to find dates, locations and hours in your community.\n\nEarly voting can be held between Oct. 22 and Nov. 3 in Wisconsin. But dates, locations and hours are set by each city, town or village.\n\n-- Hope Karnopp\n\nAfter 'lock him up' chants, Kamala Harris says 'the courts will take care of that'\n\nAfter airing clips of Trump calling himself the \"father of IVF\" at a town hall for women voters earlier this week, the crowd started chants of \"lock him up!\"\n\n\"Okay, the courts will take care of that. Let's take care of November,\" Harris responded.\n\n\"The man calls himself the 'father of IVF.' I mean, what does that even mean?\" Harris continued. \"When you listen to Donald Trump talk, it becomes increasingly clear, I think, he has no idea what he's talking about when it comes to the health care of women in America.\"\n\n-- Hope Karnopp\n\nKamala Harris criticizes Trump's comment that Jan. 6 was 'day of love'\n\nHarris criticized Trump's comment at a Univision town hall event Wednesday night, where he called the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol a \"day of love.\"\n\n\"The American people are exhausted with his gaslighting,\" Harris said, repeating a line she said earlier in La Crosse. \"We are ready to turn the page.\"\n\nBeforehand, Harris mentioned her Fox News interview.\n\n\"I intend to be a president for all Americans, no matter their political party, where they live, or where they get their news,\" Harris said.\n\n-- Hope Karnopp\n\nCrowd at Resch Expo for Kamala Harris rally surpasses 4,000\n\nThe crowd in the Expo Center has reached more than 4,000 with overflow, the Harris-Walz campaign said. Some supporters waiting in line were turned away around 5:40 p.m.\n\n'Packer,' union member introduces Kamala Harris\n\nJim Ridderbush, Vice President of the United Food & Commercial Workers Local 1473, introduced Harris in Ashwaubenon. Ridderbush, wearing Green Bay Packers apparel, introduced himself as a \"packer\" at JBS meat processing plant.\n\n\"(Trump's) a scab,\" Ridderbush said, referencing a line United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain said at the Democratic National Convention. \"He doesn't like union people. When unions are strong, the middle class is strong.\"\n\nThe campaign has focused on union support in the last week of the campaign, with former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder visiting a Teamsters office last week to stump for Harris.\n\n-- Hope Karnopp\n\nKamala Harris about to take the stage\n\nThe press pool is settling into the risers. The Secret Service just put the seal of the Vice President on the podium: Harris is here.\n\n“Go, Pack, Go!” into “KA-MA-LA!”\n\nDemocratic 8th Congressional District Kristin Lyerly took a risk by going off script, but the Packers fans in the audience picked up quick.\n\nShe led the crowd in a round of the often-chanted “Go, Pack, Go!” heard at Packers games, then remixed it with another three-syllable word: “KA-MA-LA!” the crowd shouted back at her.\n\nResch Expo reaches capacity\n\nJust after 5:40 p.m., the remaining crowd began to walk away from the Resch Expo as officials said the venue reached capacity.\n\nJasmine Puls, a student at University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, said she and her friends had waited over an hour in line and were about to go through security when they were told they were at capacity.\n\n-- Vivian Barrett\n\nSmall group of protesters in Green Bay\n\nOn the other side of the line, two protesters stand with signs: \"no arms embargo, no vote,\" and \"no vote 4 genocide\"\n\nSandra Kohlmann, 43, is talking to supporters as they wait in line. \"How many kids have to die before you stop the genocide?\"\n\nA supporter yells back, \"you're voting for Trump, sorry.\"\n\n‘A New Way Forward for Wisconsin’ in Green Bay\n\nAs the three Jumbotron-size plaques inside the Resch Expo remind attendees, tonight’s about ‘A New Way Forward for Wisconsin..\n\nHarris has been criticized by many conservatives for not doing enough in the time she’s been vice president on the economy and immigration, and have tried to frame her candidacy as a repeat of the last administration.\n\nShe offered her most plain rebuke of that argument last night on FOX News: “My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency.”\n\n-- Jesse Lin\n\n'Vote for Trump!'\n\nA small pro-Trump protest has started outside the Resch Expo.

In contrast to Harris’ earlier visit to Milwaukee and La Crosse, there’s a conspicuous lack of protestors in Green Bay.\n\nThat’s not an indication, however, of how the rest of the night will play out: a lone pro-Palestinian heckler was in the crowd for Walz on Monday but was quickly dragged away and drowned out by chants of “We’re not going back!”\n\n'Educators for Kamala and Tim' at Green Bay rally\n\nScattered throughout the Green Bay line are supporters wearing \"Educators for Kamala and Tim\" shirts. People \"have to support\" Harris, said Karen Smith, 66.\n\nKatie Wavrunek, 42, works in early childhood education. Under Project 2025, crafted by the Heritage Foundation and more than 100 other conservative groups, funding for Head Start and the Department of Education as a whole would be severely diminished, setting children as a whole back. Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025.\n\n\"We're here to support education,\" Wavrunek said. \"We want a better world for the children we work so hard to support every day.\"\n\n-- Nadia Scharf\n\nKamala Harris supporter at Green Bay rally says election is about saving democracy\n\nStas DeWet, 61, arrived at the Resch Expo decorated with political buttons to show her support for Harris in what she called a fight to save democracy. Some of the top issues on her mind included preventing the implementation of Project 2025, expanding the supreme court and reproductive rights.\n\n“To my Republic friends, this is not against what you believe as a Republican,” DeWet said.\n\nDeWet said she is excited to be a part of the historic moment of President Joe Biden passing the torch to Harris. She described Biden’s decision as a part of protecting democracy.\n\n-- Vivian Barrett\n\nIt's getting crowded outside for the Kamala Harris rally in Green Bay\n\nThe line outside Resch Expo, where Harris is scheduled to speak in under two hours, stretches blocks.\n\nA group of Hmong Harris supporters is gathered near the start of the line. Tim Kong, 58, said they're out because they want to see something different.\n\n\"A better vision, a better future,\" Kong said.\n\n\"She cares,\" Moua Theo, 60, added.\n\nIn line, Deborah Logerquist said she's here to give her veteran's support for Harris. She's excited to see her in person, especially after Harris's recent Fox News appearance.\n\n\"She wasn't having it,\" Logerquist, 70, said. \"You go, girl!\"\n\nShe's hoping Harris will be able to rally support to overturn the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which eliminated the right to abortion at the federal level. She's also a fan of her economic policy — she feels it's \"about time\" for politicians to think about the middle class.\n\n-- Nadia Scharf\n\nGreen Bay mayor attending Kamala Harris event\n\nGreen Bay mayor Eric Genrich, who opened Walz’s visit to the city on Monday, just arrived at the Harris event and greeted his former chief of staff Amaad Rivera-Wagner.\n\nAmong the list of high-profile locals to attend or who are already in line: Democratic 8th Congressional candidate Dr. Kristin Lyerly, several City Council members, Oneida Nation council members, and the local Hmong community member president.\n\n-- Jesse Lin\n\nWatch Kamala Harris in La Crosse\n\nKamala Harris invokes Wisconsin's 'Forward' motto on abortion and other issues at La Crosse event\n\nInvoking her campaign’s popular refrain -- “we are not going back” -- Harris at her La Crosse rally said,” just like Wisconsin’s state motto tells us, ‘We will move forward.’”\n\n“We will move forward, because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom … like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body,” she said, referring to states like Wisconsin that have laws on the books banning abortion in almost every case.”\n\nWisconsin’s 19th century-law banned abortions except when the mother would die without one. A case challenging the law awaits a final decision from the state Supreme Court.\n\n“One does not have to abandon their faith or their deeply-held beliefs to agree, the government should not be telling her what to do,” Harris said, pledging to sign into law a bill codifying Roe v. Wade.\n\n-- Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo hours before start of Kamala Harris rally in Green Bay and it’s already a party inside Resch Expo\n\nTwo hours to Green Bay start and it’s already a party.\n\nPersonal space seems tight for attendees who fill five sets of high school football stadium-like bleachers and rows of folding chairs inside the Resch Expo. More attendees are still making their way through airport security style entrances.\n\nAt the middle of it all: a blue runway below speakers that have so far blasted The Weeknd, Dua Lipa, Sabrina Carpenter, and now Chappell Roan’s “HOT TO GO!” to which attendees are doing the corresponding dance choreo.\n\n-- Jesse Lin\n\nKamala Harris touts Wisconsin roots, boosts Tammy Baldwin in La Crosse\n\nIn her opening remarks at UW-La Crosse, Harris noted her Wisconsin roots.\n\nFrom the ages of 3 to 5, Harris lived on the west side of Madison, before leaving in 1970. Harris visited her childhood home when she campaigned in Madison in March. Her mom and dad were professors at the UW-Madison.\n\n“Every time I come (to Wisconsin) now, when I land, Gov. (Tony) Evers will greet me, and he'll say, ‘Welcome home,’” she said, then encouraging the state’s voters to “reelect someone who has spent her career fighting for the families of Wisconsin, your senator, Tammy Baldwin. We need her in Washington.”\n\n— Jessie Opoien\n\nLike on Packers game day, Green Bay street parking beginning to fill for Kamala Harris rally\n\nGreen Bay locals know to take advantage of the city’s relaxed rules on street parking when the Green Bay Packers play home games.\n\nLikewise, at 4 p.m., hours before Harris is set to speak at the Resch Expo, cars are beginning to line the streets north of the nearby Lambeau Field.\n\n— Jesse Lin\n\nProtesters at Kamala Harris rally in La Crosse removed from facility\n\nAbout 20 minutes into Harris' speech, a number of attendees were escorted out, while shouting \"Jesus is Lord\" at those around them.\n\nHarris stopped her speech.\n\n\"Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally,\" she said. \"No, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers and applause as the protesters were shown towards the door.\n\n-- Laura Schulte\n\nMark Cuban calls Trump the Grinch, says he wants to steal Christmas through tariffs\n\nMark Cuban took the stage ahead of Harris’ arrival, warning attendees that “Donald Trump wants you to have a lousy Christmas” through his vow to raise tariffs on imported goods.\n\n“I honestly think that he used to understand how tariffs work,” Cuban said, noting that, in the 1990s and early 2000s, Trump was “a little bit coherent” and “actually made a little bit of sense” when he discussed tariffs and trade policy.\n\nTrump’s policies now, Cuban said, are “just gibberish.”\n\n“People just don't realize how many of the products that we use on a daily basis are made in China. It's a lot,\" he said. \"At this time next year, you're going to be making decisions on the Christmas presents you want to buy for family and friends.\n\n“If Donald Trump is elected, he puts these 60% tariffs on Chinese products. ... It will be up so much you won't be able to afford the presents that you want for your family and friends.”\n\nThose costs would filter down, Cuban said, to small businesses, too.\n\n“We were talking about small businesses, the local retailers that you've been supporting for years, that are in your community, the local clothing shop, the local sporting goods store, the local knick-knack store that carries all the candles and all the goodies and funky gifts that you like to buy,” he said. “Their costs for everything they sell, or most of the things they sell, could go up by 60%.\"\n\nCuban said the election is “a battle for entrepreneurship.\"\n\n\"Behind every small business, there is an entrepreneur that busted their ass. Behind every small business, there is an entrepreneur who gave up almost everything to be able to start that business, who dreamed of a better future for their family,\" he said. \"The Trump that stole Christmas, the Grinch, will crush (their) dreams.\"\n\nCuban said Harris is the candidate who understands small businesses the best.\n\n“She knows that small businesses are an integral part of our community that we grow up with, and she wants to help those businesses grow, because she knows that maybe one of you here right now will be the one to start a business that turns into the next Google, turns into the next Nike,” he said. “And I want all of us to just ask yourself, 'Why can’t I be the one that changes the world?'\"\n\n— Laura Schulte and Jessie Opoien\n\nLa Crosse rally for Kamala Harris off to a loud start\n\nMitch Reynolds, the mayor of La Crosse, was one of the first speakers on the stage at the UW-La Crosse Recreational Eagle Center.\n\nHe touted Harris’s plan for down-payment assistance for new home buyers, and to create more manufacturing jobs.\n\n“Ya'll know what happened when Trump was in office, right? Those jobs went overseas,” he said. “You’ve heard this before, but Kamala Harris is working for the people. Donald Trump is working for himself.”\n\nHe also encouraged attendees to take up work to get Harris elected, and to get U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin re-elected.\n\n“She needs you to fight just as hard to elect down-ballot Democrats who will help support her agenda,” he said.\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers and applause as Reynolds left the stage. Harris is due to speak with attendees around 3:15 p.m.\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nKamala Harris leaves Milwaukee for La Crosse\n\nKamala Harris on killing of Yahya Sinwar: 'Hamas is decimated, and its leadership is eliminated'\n\nHarris made a brief statement to reporters about the killing of Hamas military leader Yahya Sinwar by Israel.\n\nSinwar is regarded as the architect of the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that prompted the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\nHarris on Thursday said Israel had a right to defend itself and that Hamas's threat to Israel \"must be eliminated.\"\n\n\"Today, there is clear progress toward that goal,\" Harris said. \"Hamas is decimated, and its leadership is eliminated. This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza. And it must end such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.\"\n\nShe added: \"And, it is time for the day after to begin without Hamas in power.\"\n\nHarris didn't take questions.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nMore:Kamala Harris issues statement on death of Hamas leader after closed press event at UW-Milwaukee\n\nWatch Kamala Harris in Milwaukee\n\nGrandparents bring grandson to first political rally for Kamala Harris rally in La Crosse\n\nIn La Crosse, where Harris will speak later this afternoon, Jeff and Julie Larson-Keller brought their grandson, Luca Sien, 9, to his first political rally.\n\nJeff said he was excited to see Harris, and that he's enjoyed watching her \"come alive\" since entering the presidential race.\n\n\"She does bring so much, I don't know, encouragement and hope to us,\" he said.\n\nThe Larson-Kellers and their grandson traveled to La Crosse from Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nJulie said she was \"really happy\" to have the chance to support Harris in person, and has been dedicated to getting her elected after watching Hillary Clinton lose in 2016.\n\n\"I really think health care for everybody, but especially for women's health care, is really important. It's a basic right and that's why we can't go back,\" she said. \"And our grandkids ... we don't want them to have to worry about those things.\"\n\nLuca said he was excited to see Harris in person and \"shake Kamala's hand.\"\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nKamala Harris to make comments on Middle East at UWM event\n\nThe meeting between Harris, entrepreneur Mark Cuban and UW-Milwaukee students will now be closed to the press.\n\nHarris is expected to make a statement about the Middle East to reporters instead.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nStudent protesting at UWM angry over Kamala Harris visit, police involvement\n\nDina El Kassas, a UWM sophomore majoring in global studies, was initially protesting with the group of students closest to the Lubar Entrepreneurship Center who are surrounded by police.\n\nShe said officers eventually allowed her to leave the group and move out of the police-tape boundary because she didn’t want to be arrested. Still, she thought the heavy police presence was just for show and that police wouldn't actually arrest the student protesters.\n\n“I think they’re just there to intimidate us,” El Kassas said.\n\nShe has been involved in pro-Palestinian student protesting efforts at UWM since last year, including the two-week encampment on campus. She objected to paying tuition to a school that would welcome Harris, who she sees as complicit in Israel’s devastating military operation in Gaza.\n\nShe was also frustrated that UWM had released a statement days ago, saying it was politically neutral.\n\n“It’s a lie. It’s a blatant lie,” El Kassas said.\n\n— Sophie Carson\n\nAttendees for Kamala Harris rally in La Crosse arrive early\n\nIn anticipation of seeing Harris speak in La Crosse after her appearance on the UWM campus, hundreds of rally attendees flooded into the UW-La Crosse Recreational Eagle Center Thursday afternoon.\n\nStudents took their seats on risers behind the podium where Harris will speak later this afternoon, while other attendees took seats or found a place to stand next to the stage.\n\nSome ran to find a spot as soon as the doors opened at noon, excitedly giving each other high-fives and taking selfies in front of the podium.\n\nThe event in La Crosse is expected to start around 3 p.m.\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters chant as Kamala Harris arrives to UWM\n\nAfter Harris’ motorcade arrived at UW-Milwaukee, protesters continued chanting outside the police tape, and the students surrounded by officers inside the police tape haven't yet been arrested.\n\nThe protesters are chanting such things as “Kamala.

We charge you with genocide.” And, “UWM is painted red; 40,000 dead.”\n\nThe motorcade was greeted by protesters accusing Harris of genocide and chanting, “From the river to the sea.” At least one protester called reporters “Nazis” as they entered the UW-Milwaukee buildings.\n\nPotentially hundreds of student onlookers are gathered outside the police tape near the UWM student union and Lubar Entrepreneurship Center, along with additional protesters.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of officers from several departments continue to arrive.

The UK's first-past-the-post electoral system meant this only translated into five MPs, but crucially it came second in 98 seats, 89 of which were won by Labour.\n\nWhat are Reform's policies?\n\nReform UK has a populist agenda aimed at attracting voters from both the left and right who are frustrated with the two main parties and feel strongly about issues such as immigration and the costs of net zero.\n\nIn a column published in The Telegraph to announce the party's relaunch in 2020, Farage and former party leader Richard Tice vowed to take on \"powerful vested interests\", including \"badly run, wasteful quangos\", the BBC, the House of Lords and the Home Office.\n\nReform's manifesto for last summer's UK general election was described by Farage as \"radical\" and \"outside the box\" and put a hardline stance on immigration unsurprisingly front and centre.\n\nReform's plan to \"stop the boats\" carrying migrants crossing the Channel completely is part of a four-point plan to curb illegal immigration. It would freeze all \"non-essential\" legal migration and take the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights so it can use offshore processing centres for illegal immigrants and prevent them from claiming asylum.\n\nShrinking the size of the state and reducing the tax burden is another key pledge Reform hopes will win over disillusioned voters. A planned £50 billion a year reduction in government spending would help fund its manifesto pledges to raise the income tax threshold from £12,571 to £20,000, exempting six million people from having to pay income tax. The party would also scrap VAT on energy bills, lift the VAT threshold on businesses to £150,000, cut fuel duty and corporation tax, and raise the inheritance tax threshold to £2 million.\n\nOn energy, the party proposes scrapping the UK's 2050 net zero targets and green levies to bring down energy bills, while fast-tracking North Sea oil and gas licences, and doing more to enable fracking.\n\nCulture war issues also featured prominently in Reform's offer to Red Wall voters. Farage placed \"issues and arguments around gender on the very first page\" of his party's election manifesto, said The Guardian, condemning the \"divisive 'woke' ideology\" he claimed had captured public institutions. The party has vowed to ban the teaching of \"transgender ideology\" in schools and scrap diversity, equality and inclusion rules.\n\nReform's manifesto promised a referendum on the current voting system and in what Politico said is \"another pledge that brings Farage's party in line with many of the left\", it also called for the unelected House of Lords to be replaced with a \"much smaller, more democratic second chamber\".\n\nWhat is Reform's strategy to win power?\n\nSince assuming the leadership of Reform in the summer, Farage has made no secret of his plan to usurp the Conservatives as the main opposition party to Labour with the \"real ambition\" to win power at the next general election in 2029.\n\nReform claims to be \"Britain's fastest growing political party\" and has released a \"live membership tracker\" that shows how it is close to overtaking the Conservative party's 131,680 card-carrying members.\n\nThe party is now just a few points behind Labour and the Conservatives nationally, according to Sky News polling, \"but with a general election still four years away, its challenge is holding on to that momentum\".\n\nIt is just the latest boost in what has been a \"pretty good year\" for Reform in general and Farage in particular, said The Spectator.\n\n\"At the beginning of 2024, he was out of politics and fresh out of the jungle, having returned from 'I'm A Celeb…' with no imminent plans of a comeback. Now, fast forward 12 months, he is an MP, party leader and beating Keir Starmer as a more popular choice of PM.\"\n\nReform has \"been buoyed in recent weeks by a series of high-profile Tory defections\" and \"hopes to win hundreds of council seats at local elections in May, and at least one mayoralty\", said the FT.\n\nWith longstanding ally Donald Trump soon to be back in the White House and Musk potentially backing them to the tune of tens of millions of pounds, Farage's 2029 electoral ambitions are starting to seem not so far-fetched.", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/15/trump-picks-face-senate-confirmation-hearings/77703322007/", "title": "Pam Bondi likely to be confirmed as Trump picks glide through ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Welcome to Confirmapalooza.\n\nSenate Committees questioned six of Donald Trump’s top appointees on Wednesday over issues of war, political revenge, spycraft, electric cars and more.\n\nPam Bondi, Trump's choice for Attorney General and the day's main event, battled through heated exchanges with two Democratic senators as she repeatedly refused to acknowledge that Joe Biden won the 2020 election, while stating she accepted that he was president.\n\nBondi was on the road to confirmation, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., one of her chief antagonists, said as that hearing ended. \"Today, Pam Bondi demonstrated exactly why she is an excellent choice to serve as the next Attorney General of the United States,\" the Trump transition team said in a statement.\n\nMore:Takeaways from Senate confirmation hearings: Democrats grill Trump Cabinet nominee\n\nOther Trump appointees gliding toward likely confirmation included Marco Rubio for secretary of state; John Ratcliffe, CIA director; Sean Duffy, transportation secretary; Chris Wright, energy secretary; and Russell Vought, to lead the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY for a day of pivotal hearings.\n\nConfirmapalooza closes: Trump's nominees in good shape\n\nWith the end of Russell Vought's hearing before the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, that's it for Wednesday's Senate marathon. Most of Trump's choices enjoyed at least a measure of bipartisan support and Pam Bondi, his prospective Attorney General, easily navigated through rough questioning from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nHearings will continue Thursday with questioning of witnesses in Bondi's confirmation, and hearings for Scott Bessent, Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary and former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum at Interior.\n\nMore:At Pam Bondi's attorney general confirmation hearing, focus moved to FBI nominee Kash Patel\n\nA man, a plan, a canal: Panama\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, Trump's prospective Secretary of State, indirectly addressed the president-elect's threats to reclaim the Panama Canal, possibly by force, over concerns about Chinese influence over the waterway.\n\nRubio said he hadn't yet looked into the legality of reclaiming the canal.\n\n“But I'm compelled to suspect that an argument could be made that the terms under which that canal were turned over have been violated, because while technically, sovereignty over the canal has not been turned over to a foreign power, in reality, a foreign power today possesses… through their companies − which we know are not independent − the ability to turn the canal into a choke point in a moment of conflict,\" Rubio said.\n\n\"And that is a direct threat to the interests and the national security of the United States.\"\n\nAt the same time, Panama has been a \"great partner\" to the U.S. in other areas, he told senators. \"And I hope we can resolve this issue of the canal.\"\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nMore:Trump loyalist John Ratcliffe sails through CIA director confirmation hearing\n\nBarely a peep about Project 2025 at Vought hearing\n\nRussell Vought, tapped to once again lead the Office of Management and Budget under Trump, helped contribute to the controversial and sweeping conservative policy blueprint known as Project 2025. The document was a Democratic rallying cry during the 2024 campaign and Trump was forced to disavow it.\n\nHowever, Vought faced little questioning on the document at his confirmation hearing Wednesday.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., noted in his opening statements that Vought is “one of the architects of Project 2025,” having written a 25-page chapter on executive power. The Michigan senator said he has “serious questions” about Vought’s candidacy for a myriad of other reasons.\n\nOtherwise, Democratic senators largely focused on issues such as Vought's views on Congress’ power of the purse and his appetite for disagreement with Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans were predominantly concerned with federal spending and asked Vought his plans to decrease it.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nMore:Trump's 'Front Row Joes,' superfans and the obsession, explained\n\nBondi hearing wraps; senators expect confirmation\n\nSenators finished their questioning of Pam Bondi on Wednesday after nearly five and half hours. Senate Judiciary Committee leader Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said they may still submit written questions to her until 5 p.m. EDT Thursday. Other witnesses are also set to be questioned Thursday about Bondi's nomination.\n\n\"I have every confidence that you're going to do a superb job,\" Grassley told Bondi.\n\nAll signs pointed to Bondi's confirmation as the hearing ended. Even Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), who got into heated exchanges with Bondi, said she is \"very, very, very, very likely to be confirmed.\"\n\n–Aysha Bagchi\n\nSchiff asks Bondi for help fighting crime after wildfires\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, who had been another harsh questioner of Pam Bondi, Trump’s choice to become attorney general, asked for her help prosecuting arsonists, looters, fraudsters and price gougers in the aftermath of the California wildfires.\n\n“I hope you will demonstrate a willingness to go after anyone who is engaged in price gouging,” said Schiff, D-Calif. “The price at the pump in California is through the roof. Are you willing to take on even powerful interests like the oil industry if you determine that they are gouging consumers?”\n\nBondi reminded Schiff she represented Florida as attorney general during the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. She said she could help fight crime throughout the state.\n\n“Crime is rampant in California and it’s only going to get worse based on these fires,” Bondi said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump’s pick for budget director faces questions on abortion\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asked Vought a series of questions related to “policies of life,” or the issue of abortion, including whether abortion providers should be excluded from federal grant money and if pregnancy resource centers, known for their opposition to abortions, should in turn be entitled to government funding.\n\n“The president has made his views on abortion really clear throughout the administration, the campaign,” Vought said. “I’m not going to get ahead of the president with regard to the budget process.”\n\nTrump has celebrated his role in appointing three conservative Supreme Court justices who were crucial in overturning Roe v. Wade. But he waffled during the 2024 election on some abortion issues, at one point seemingly suggesting he would vote in favor of a pro-abortion access ballot measure in Florida, before eventually clarifying his opposition.\n\n“Again, the president’s a pro-life president. He had a very pro-life record,” Vought said Wednesday. “I think the country has a good sense of where he is on the issues.”\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nMore:Trump says he would veto national abortion ban as issue threatens his campaign\n\nBondi says her hope is to 'restore integrity' to DOJ as polls show polarization\n\nAsked by Republican Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt about her overall vision for the Justice Department, Bondi said she plans to surround herself with \"great people\" and look at different parts of the department, but \"first and foremost,\" she wants to \"keep America safe and restore integrity to that department.\n\n\"I don't think I can stress enough that 72% of Americans have lost faith in the Department of Justice,\" Bondi said.\n\nBondi didn't explain the source of that statistic, but polls indicate American views on the department may be polarized based on which presidency it falls under.\n\nMore:Israel and Hamas reach deal on Gaza ceasefire, hostage release\n\nOnly 17% of U.S. adults are either \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident that the Justice Department will act in a fair and nonpartisan way in Trump's second term, according to a new poll from the Associated-Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Another 32% are somewhat confident.\n\nRepublicans views of DOJ grew more critical in recent times, according to a July Pew Research Center survey. It found 56% Republicans and Republican-leaning independents had an unfavorable view of the department, up from 50% the year before. By contrast, only about a third of Democrats and Democratic leaners had an unfavorable view.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nStrings attached for Trump wildfire aid?\n\nSen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., pressed Russell Vought, Trump's choice to run the White House Office of Management and Budget, on whether, if confirmed, he would ensure that federal grants do not hinge on a grantee’s political affiliation – or a state’s political makeup.\n\n“So, if the president says to you, ‘I don’t care what the law says, I don’t like California, and I’m not going to give them the disaster aid they need,’” Hassan asked, “you’re going to stand up to the president and say, ‘Sir that’s not appropriate’?”\n\nMore:'Conditions' should be placed on California wildfire aid: House Speaker Mike Johnson\n\nTrump has threatened to put conditions on disaster aid to California in the wake of deadly and devastating fires in the Los Angeles area. Some House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have signaled interest in the same.\n\n“Senator, I don’t engage in hypotheticals, but the president would never ask me to do something along those lines,” Vought told Hassan Wednesday.\n\n“Well, history speaks a little bit differently to that point,” Hassan replied.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nBipartisan support for Ratcliffe CIA bid\n\nJohn Ratcliffe won bipartisan support on the Senate Intelligence Committee as he widespread reforms the CIA and promised he would not hire or fire employees based on their political views.\n\nRatcliffe’s pledge, made repeatedly in response to questions from committee Democrats, may put him at odds with Trump and some of the president-elect's other national security picks who have vowed to test intelligence officials based on their support of Trump.\n\nBut Ratcliffe, citing his time as Director of National Intelligence in Trump's first administration, said he will not waver.\n\n\"If you look at my record as DNI, that never took place. That is never something anyone has alleged, and it is something that I would never do,\" Ratcliffe told the committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.\n\n−Josh Meyer\n\nMore:Trump loyalist John Ratcliffe sails through CIA director confirmation hearing\n\nBondi ‘terrified’ of potential ISIS attack\n\nPam Bondi, Trump’s choice for attorney general, told her Senate confirmation hearing she is “terrified” of a potential ISIS attack on the United States.\n\nA U.S. citizen who claimed membership in ISIS rammed a rental truck into a crowd in New Orleans on Jan. 1 and killed 14 people.\n\nFormer FBI Director Christopher Wray told CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday a threat like that inspired from afar is one of the most challenging types of terrorist the agency faces.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked whether Bondi worried about an attack on the homeland by ISIS or its affiliates.\n\n“Only from the public reporting that I’ve seen, I’m terrified,” said Bondi, who does not yet have a security clearance.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nBondi calls Schiff ‘reckless’\n\nAnother feisty exchange erupted between Sen. Adam Schiff and Pam Bondi, Trump’s choice to become attorney general, over whether she would investigate or destroy evidence from the investigation of the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Are you frightened because evidence was destroyed against President Trump that was false?” Bondi replied. “I can’t believe you’re asking such a question.”\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., who investigated the Jan. 6 attack while serving in the House, said a Supreme Court decision granting presidents immunity for official acts could allow Trump to order the investigate former special counsel Jack Smith. Schiff asked Bondi if she would investigate Smith, secured an indictment against Trump that was dismissed after he won the election.\n\nBondi said it would be irresponsible to answer but that politics would play no role in prosecutions.\n\nThe exchange grew more heated as Schiff accused her of being unable to tell Trump who won the 2020 election or not to pardon Jan. 6 defendants.\n\n“You were censured by Congress, senator, for comments like this, that are so reckless,” Bondi said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nDuffy dismisses concerns about Project 2025\n\nTowards the end of the Transportation Secretary confirmation hearing, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., raised concerns about Project 2025, an extensive 920-page plan put together by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, that aims to reshape the federal government. She asked Duffy whether he assures he won’t prioritize actions in Project 2025 that would undermine safety for consumer protections.\n\nBut Duffy waved off her concerns, saying that Project 2025 is not Trump’s agenda.\n\nMore:Southwest Airlines sued, Frontier fined over flight delays in DOT’s latest crackdown\n\n“I have never read Project 2025, so I'm not sure what's in it, but the president's going to decide policy, and he made me the secretary…the President stepped away from it. It's not part of - it hasn't been part of his agenda,\" he said.\n\nThough Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025, which critics have called “authoritarian,” many officials from his previous administration helped work up the plan.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBondi clashes with Padilla, says won’t be bullied\n\nA fiery clash erupted when Sen. Alex Padilla asked Pam Bondi, Trump’s choice for attorney general, repeatedly about elections and immigration, seeking yes or no answers, and cut off her longer attempts to answer.\n\nBondi had traveled to Philadelphia a day after the 2020 election to claim Trump had won Pennsylvania while votes were still being counted. President Joe Biden eventually won the state.\n\nPadilla, D-Calif., asked whether Bondi had any evidence of election fraud or wanted to retract her statement, yes or no. But Bondi couldn’t get a word in edgewise as he interrupted.\n\n“You pointed your finger at me said you were speaking,” Bondi said. “I’m not going to be bullied by you Sen. Padilla.”\n\nPadilla also asked about her familiarity with the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides citizenship to people born in the U.S.\n\n“Senator, I’m here to answer your questions, I’m not here to do your homework and study for you,” Bondi said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Russell Vought?\n\nRussell Vought served as Office of Management and Budget director in Trump’s first term. The president-elect tapped Vought, 48, to return to the position and once again oversee the president’s budget, federal regulations and the White House’s coordination with government agencies.\n\nBetween Trump administrations, Vought founded the Center for Renewing America, an advocacy group dedicated to furthering the GOP leader’s agenda.\n\nHe is also credited as author of a 25-page chapter on executive power for Project 2025 – which Trump repeatedly denied association with throughout his 2024 campaign. Democrats are expected to press him on the controversial policy blueprint in today’s hearing.\n\nVought appears this afternoon before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, led by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nBondi: 'No one will be prosecuted, investigated because they are a political opponent.'\n\nBondi said Wednesday that she hasn't had any discussions with President-elect Donald Trump about seeking to prosecute President Joe Biden or members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, including now-California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney.\n\nBondi was responding to questions from Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch, who asked for her assurance that the Justice Department won't try to pursue political adversaries over the next four years.\n\nIn August, Trump shared memes on his Truth Social media platform calling for the House committee to be indicted and depicting Biden and other political rivals in jumpsuits.\n\n\"Every case will be done on a case-by-case basis,\" Bondi said. \"No one should be prosecuted for political purposes. Absolutely not.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDuffy says he’d allow Musk’s Tesla vehicles to continue to be investigated\n\nTransportation Secretary nominee Sean Duffy said that he’d allow the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to continue its investigation into Tesla vehicles, regardless of outside political pressure, when asked by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.\n\nThe investigation came after reports of multiple crashes caused by a feature that allows drivers to control their cars remotely.\n\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has become an influential voice in the incoming Trump administration and a member of Trump’s inner circle.\n\n“Yes, I commit to this committee and to you that I will let (NHTSA) do their investigation. And I think I also mentioned to you that a lot of the players in these spaces, I haven't met any of them,” Duffy said. “So yes, it's going to be a lot of pressure here.”\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRubio: U.S. position on Ukraine war is not realistic, concessions must be made\n\nSecretary of State nominee Marco Rubio argued it should be the official position of the United States that the Ukraine-Russia war should be brought to an end. Rubio, currently a Florida GOP senator, also defended Trump’s push for accelerated negotiations.\n\nThe Biden administration's approach to the war on Ukraine aid is “not a realistic” position, Rubio said, nor is it realistic to believe that Ukraine will be able to forcibly remove troops from a nation the size of Russia from the territory it has taken.\n\n“Now what that master plan looks like is going to be hard work,” he said. “My hope is that it can begin with some cease fire.”\n\nRubio also told his Senate colleagues: “There will have to be concessions made by the Russian Federation, but also by the Ukrainians…It's also important that there be some balance on both sides.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nDemocratic senators target Trump FBI pick Kash Patel at Bondi hearing\n\nSpeaking at Pam Bondi's confirmation hearing, Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she has \"serious concerns\" about Trump's pick to head the FBI, Kash Patel. Patel's confirmation hearing hasn't yet been scheduled.\n\nKlobuchar voiced alarm about comments from Patel that the FBI's intelligence division is \"the biggest problem\" the bureau – which falls within the Justice Department – has had.\n\n\"I have not seen those comments from Mr. Patel,\" Bondi responded. \" I would review them, but we have to do everything we can to protect our country. Again, Mr. Patel would fall under me and the Department of Justice, and I will ensure that all laws are followed, and so will he.\"\n\nKlobuchar suggested that assurance wasn't enough.\n\n\"While I agree you would be the boss of Kash Patel, I'm not sure that you would be able to intervene with every decision or position that he had, or know what he's doing,\" Klobuchar said.\n\nLater, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut also questioned Patel's fitness, pointing to comments from Patel on a list of people belonging to the \"deep state\" that he thinks should be targeted.\n\nBondi said if both she and Patel are confirmed, he will follow the law.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRubio warns ICC could try to arrest Americans next\n\nThe International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes is a “test run” of its power to prosecute the head of state of nonmember nations that could be used against the United States in the future, Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio warned at his confirmation hearing.\n\nIf the ICC doesn’t drop this, he said, its credibility will be damaged. “And I think the United States should be very concerned, because I believe this is a test run for applying it to American service members and American leaders in the future.”\n\nNeither Israel nor the United States are party to the international treaty that established the ICC.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nDuffy adds possible Hawaii and Alaska trips to his to-do list\n\nTrump Transportation Secretary nominee Sean Duffy made clear with Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, that he would work in a bipartisan fashion as it relates to transportation policy. However, he also joked with the Democrat.\n\n“I think you mandated that I go to Hawaii to see you,” Duffy said, to which Schatz replied, “I'll issue my demand letter shortly.”\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, later invited Duffy on a trip to Alaska, saying he can bring his family and go salmon fishing. “Maybe you go after your trip to Hawaii, but will you come to my state and see these challenges, because they're real challenges,” he asked.\n\n“I would come to Alaska, and I promise you, I will not sing…I sang to him in the office,” Duffy said.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBoeing mid-air scare takes center stage in Transportation hearing\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican senators pressed Sean Duffy, Donald Trump's choice for Transportation Secretary, how he plans to improve Boeing after an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet lost a door panel mid-flight last year. The Federal Aviation Administration has maintained tougher oversight over Boeing since the incident.\n\nSen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, asked what steps Duffy would take to get Boeing back on track.\n\n“You have to push the FAA to make sure they're implementing their safety plan,” said Duffy.\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell, of Washington − home to Boeing − said the Federal Aviation Administration under prior administrations hasn’t pushed for a strong safety management culture. Duffy said if that's what it takes to get a \"better safety record at Boeing, I'm on board.\"\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBondi can’t talk about TikTok ban\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked Bondi if she would enforce the congressional ban on TikTok that goes into effect Sunday if the social media company isn’t divested from its Chinese parent, ByteDance.\n\nTrump has said he would “save” TikTok and the solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, represented TikTok while asking the Supreme Court to delay implementation of the law.\n\n“I can’t discuss pending litigation,” Bondi said. “But I will talk to all the career officials – prosecutors – who are handling the case, absolutely.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Lawmakers urge Biden to extend Jan. 19 deadline for TikTok ban: 'Not the answer'\n\nTrump energy pick pushes fossil fuels\n\nChris Wright, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the Energy Department, told senators in his confirmation hearing on Wednesday his first priority is expanding domestic energy production including liquefied natural gas and nuclear power.\n\nWright, 60, believes fossil fuels are the key to ending world poverty, which is a greater problem than climate change's \"distant\" threat, according to a report he wrote as CEO of oilfield services company Liberty Energy.\n\nThe hearing was briefly stopped several times by protesters, with at least one shouting about the deadly fires in Los Angeles and the role fossil fuels play in global warming.\n\nWright supports some fossil fuel alternatives, such as small nuclear power reactors, which are not yet commercially available, and geothermal power. But he has criticized solar and wind power as insufficient.\n\n−Reuters\n\nMore:Wildfire weary Los Angeles residents face 'last really windy day': Live updates\n\nRubio's opening remarks draw protests, laughs\n\nSen. Marco Rubio’s introductory remarks were interrupted three times by protesters, who were quickly escorted out of the hearing room. One shouted in Spanish at Rubio – who is Cuban-American – prompting him to joke that he gets bilingual protests.\n\n“That’s a first here for us, at least in recent times,” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, replied to laughter.\n\nRisch also said he had a goodbye gift for his colleague as the hearing got underway. It is expected to be Rubio’s last with the committee, of which he is also a member, before he joins the Trump administration.\n\n“I thank you, and I hope I can earn your support, whether it's because you believe I would do a good job, or because you want to get rid of me,” Rubio told senators as he concluded his remarks.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nBondi: ‘Politics will not play a part’ in Justice Department\n\nAnother former prosecutor, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said attorneys general of both parties prevented White House interference with criminal investigations and asked Bondi if she would continue that policy.\n\n“Yes, I believe that the Justice Department must be independent and must act independently,” Bondi said. “The No. 1 job is to enforce the law fairly and evenhandedly, and that’s what will be done if I am confirmed as the attorney general.”\n\n“Politics will not play a part,” Bondi added. “I’ve demonstrated that my entire career as a prosecutor, as attorney general and I will continue to do that.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\n'Great bipartisan love’: Sean Duffy’s hearing opens in a lighthearted manner\n\nSean Duffy, Trump’s transportation secretary pick, introduced his family, including his five-year-old daughter Valentina, to senators in his opening remarks.\n\nDuffy resigned from Congress in 2019 a few months before Valentina was born, announcing that he had learned she had health issues, including a heart condition, and that he wanted to support his family. She was born with Down syndrome.\n\n“She, no doubt, is our family's favorite,” he said. “She was hugging Senator Baldwin on the way in, showing great bipartisan love. Hopefully, she'll be behaved for the hearing today.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDurbin asks Bondi about pardons for Jan. 6 defendants\n\nCiting President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to pardon defendants from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Sen.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., the committee chair, kicked things off by saying the CIA has repeatedly failedin its core mission of “stealing secrets … handling spies … hacking computers.”\n\n“Suffice it to say, we’re too often in the dark,” Cotton said, citing the intelligence community’s failure to predict the fall of Syrian strongman Bashar Assad and other geopolitical events. “The CIA must get back to its roots.\"\n\nRatcliffe is considered well-qualified for the job and an easy confirmation for what is essentially the top operational intelligence position in the government. He served as Director of National Intelligence during Trump’s first term, which oversees all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies including the CIA.\n\nRatcliffe is also a former federal prosecutor and was a staunch Trump ally during his time representing Texas, where he was a member of the House Intelligence Committee. If approved, he will succeed outgoing CIA Director William Burns.\n\n−Josh Meyer\n\nBondi won't say Joe Biden won 2020 election\n\nBondi refused to say President Joe Biden won the 2020 election, although she acknowledged he \"was duly sworn in.\"\n\nThe refusal came after Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois pressed her on the topic.\n\n\"I accept, of course, that Joe Biden is President of the United States, but what I can tell you is what I saw firsthand when I went to Pennsylvania as an advocate for the campaign,\" Bondi said.\n\nIn 2020, Bondi helped fuel Trump's false claims that widespread fraud stole the election when she spoke at a press conference in Pennsylvania alongside Eric Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. There, as votes were still being counted, Bondi said she was concerned about poll watchers gaining access election sites and falsely claimed, \"We've won Pennsylvania and we want every vote to be counted in a fair way.\"\n\nResults showed Joe Biden won Pennsylvania. Numerous recounts and audits have since confirmed Biden's 2020 victory. Bondi didn't cite any specifics Wednesday as she refused to rebut Trump's false claims about the 2020 voting outcome.\n\n\"I was an advocate for the campaign, and I was on the ground in Pennsylvania, and I saw many things there. But do I accept the results? Of course, I do,\" Bondi said.\n\n\"Do I agree with what happened, and...\" Bondi continued, trailing off. \"I saw so much.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDurbin asks Bondi about potential lobbying conflicts\n\nThe top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, asked Bondi how she would deal with potential conflicts involving former clients from her lobbying at Ballard Partners.\n\nThe firm was paid $115,000 per month for a period by the government of Qatar. Bondi said many people worked under the contract and that she was proud of her work against human trafficking leading up to the World Cup.\n\nDurbin also asked about a potential conflict with the GEO Group, a private prison company he said stands to receive millions of dollars from detaining immigrants under President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for mass deportations.\n\n“If there are any conflicts with anyone I represented in private practice, I would consult with the career ethics officials within the department and make the appropriate decision,” Bondi said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nBondi pledges ‘one tier of justice for all’\n\nIn her opening statement, Bondi said she would fight every day to restore confidence and integrity at the Justice Department.\n\nGrassley, R-Iowa, had complained about the “weaponization” of the department leading to investigations of protesters at abortion clinics and at school board meetings. Republicans have also alleged a two-tier system of justice that treats defendants differently.\n\n“The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone,” Bondi said. “America will have one tier of justice for all.”\n\nBondi began by introducing a slew of relatives in the audience and reeled off the names of five female friends and mentioned former coworkers.\n\n“Ranking member Durbin, if you want to get dirt on me, these women have known me since I was a child,” Bondi said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\n'Rot infesting the Department of Justice': Grassley opens with litany of GOP grievances\n\nGrassley's opening remarks laid out a litany of Republican grievances against the Justice Department and the FBI, including investigations of Donald Trump that led to two federal indictments of the now president-elect.\n\nThe committee's chairman accused the department of leaking information from special counsel Robert Mueller's 2016-2019 investigation into Russian election interference as recently as last August to hurt Trump's 2024 election chances − while \"stiff-arming\" congressional requests for information that would embarrass the Biden administration.\n\nGrassley assailed what he said were prosecutions of people peacefully praying outside an abortion clinic and investigations into parents who expressed concern about school curriculum choices and COVID-19 mandates. He accused DOJ of putting \"undue pressure\" on social media platforms to censor users.\n\n\"These are only a few particularly egregious examples of rot infesting the Department of Justice,\" Grassley said. \"The impact to this political infection in our once storied law enforcement institutions is catastrophic\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDurbin: Would you tell President Trump 'No'?\n\nThe top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said he would question Pam Bondi about her independence from Trump after she joined him trying to overturn the 2020 election and repeatedly called investigations of him “witch hunts.”\n\n“This time around, President-elect Trump has vowed not just to use the Justice Department to advance his political interests, but also to seek ‘retribution’ against ‘the enemy within,’” Durbin said. “I need to know you would tell the president ‘No’ if you were asked to do something that is wrong, illegal or unconstitutional.”\n\nDurbin also planned to ask Bondi about her lobbying for major firms including Uber and Amazon, and the embassy of Qatar.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nAnd we're off\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, gavels in the first of a marathon of Wednesday confirmation hearings, with former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in the hotseat at the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDem senators are warm to Marco Rubio\n\nWhile Trump's second-term appointments include a number of controversial figures − think Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. − Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is at the other end of the trouble spectrum. His Senate colleagues like and trust him.\n\n“I think that will be the closest hearing that’s a lovefest of any of the confirmation hearings. I can't say that about the other ones,” Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said.\n\nA former presidential candidate and senator of 14 years who served as vice chair of the Senate's famously bipartisan intelligence committee, Rubio is one of Trump’s only Cabinet picks expected to win widespread Democratic support.\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, who chaired the Intelligence Committee when Rubio served as ranking member, praised Rubio in a statement as someone who would be a “strong voice for American interests around the globe.”\n\n“While we don't align on the issues of foreign policy, I know his values, I know his work ethic, there's so many things I respect about Sen. Rubio that make me very inclined to support him,” Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nMore:Marco Rubio, Trump's choice for secretary of state, has broad support\n\nWho is Pam Bondi?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department, ex-Florida Attorney General and corporate lobbyist Pam Bondi, is set to face formal questioning from senators as her confirmation hearing kicks off at 9 a.m.\n\nBondi, who was a defense lawyer for Trump in his first impeachment trial, is generally expected to be confirmed after Trump's controversial first pick – former Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz – dropped out. Gaetz faced accusations that he paid women for sex and had sex with a minor.

Neither the Green Bay Packers nor the Pittsburgh Steelers ever came close to crossing the spending mean, yet both are considered among the most stable organizations in football.\n\nThe New England Patriots, unquestionably the NFL’s best team over the last seven years – and the team the Lions have tried desperately to copy in their latest quest to find some form of football success – spent significantly more than the league average on free agents just once in that time frame and yet reached four Super Bowls and averaged 12.3 wins per season.\n\nMore:Lions free agency grades: Hard not to love these moves\n\nYou probably already knew the Patriots weren’t big free-agent spenders. They were the only team as of Wednesday morning that hadn’t agreed to a contract with a pending free agent.\n\nAnd if you read what I wrote before the free-agent negotiating period began Monday, you know perfectly well how I feel about free agency. I’m all for the players getting theirs, and all for the teams saving theirs, because free agency, more often than not, is one big pot of fool’s gold.\n\nSo it’s with that in mind that I offer up this fence-straddling but wholly true free-agent analysis:\n\nI like the free agents the Lions added, but I don’t like the money they spent to bring them in. I like how aggressive Bob Quinn was in going after the players he (or Matt Patricia) coveted, but I’m not sure they’ll make the Lions appreciably better in 2019. And I certainly understand the desire to go big this time of year for a regime that must show progress after an ugly 6-10 season, but I also recognize there are long-term ramifications if this spending spree – the Lions’ second in three years, according to Sharp’s analysis – doesn’t work.\n\nMore:Pundits grade Lions' top free-agent signings: ESPN writer not a fan\n\nNot a hot enough take for you? Let’s dive a little deeper in.\n\nIf I had to give the Lions a grade for the first 48 hours of free agency (knowing full well there are more moves ahead), I’d give them a B. They filled their biggest positions of need at defensive end, tight end, slot receiver and cornerback, and they did it with solid options all around.\n\nBut canvassing a brief sampling of people across the league, I’m not sure the Lions will get enough bang for their buck from these contracts.\n\nTrey Flowers was a really nice player the last three seasons for the New England Patriots, and I don’t think there was much question that he was the best defensive end on the market. But the Lions gave him a contract that pays him $18 million a season and makes him the fifth highest paid defensive player in the NFL. I got what amounted to a few eye-roll emojis from a few people I asked about the deal across the league.\n\nSome said he was a must-sign for the Lions in order to validate what Patricia is trying to do as head coach, and, yes, the Lions did face some competition for him. But at that price tag, Flowers is going to have to deliver a whole lot more than the seven sacks a season he’s gotten used to.\n\nJustin Coleman got a four-year, $36 million contract to play cornerback, and while it’s hard to assess the real value of the deal not knowing its structure, I know one NFC team had Coleman valued at about 75 percent of that pay in its free-agent analysis.\n\nLike Flowers, Coleman has a previous relationship with Patricia, and that no doubt played a part in the Lions’ pursuit. But like Flowers, he’ll have to outperform his past – and maybe be more than a nickel cornerback – in order to validate the money the Lions spent.\n\nI got mixed feedback on the Jesse James signing, with one evaluator I trust saying he could develop into a 70-catch tight end in Detroit and another saying the Lions totally overspent for James, too.\n\nWhat I do like about James, and Flowers and Coleman, is that they’re all young enough in their careers to bet on the come, and they all should have plenty of opportunity in Detroit.\n\nDanny Amendola, the 33-year-old slot receiver the Lions signed, doesn’t have youth on his side and he wasn’t particularly, but he, too, is a New England product and we all know how much that matters to Patricia.\n\nThe other free agent the Lions agreed to terms with late Wednesday night, offensive guard Oday Aboushi, might be the signing I like most. I don’t know if he’ll start at right guard or play as a backup, or, heck, even make the team. But he’s cheap and he knows the system, and at 28 years old, he, too, is still in his NFL prime.\n\nIf you trust in your scouts enough to find you talent, and in your coaches enough to develop the players once they’re in house, that’s the kind of signing that smart teams like the Patriots have thrived on for years.\n\nOverall, the Lions landed five players in the first 48 hours of free agency that all have a chance to contribute next year. They’ve got a bunch of draft picks and cap room to keep tweaking their roster, and the best news is, if they use those well enough, they won’t have to splurge on free agents again anytime soon.\n\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.

Ortiz\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPHOENIX – Seven weeks ago, the Los Angeles Angels spent $8 million on Cuban shortstop Roberto Baldoquin even though, according to baseball's rules governing international players under 23 and with less than five years of pro experience, he would essentially cost them twice as much and the team would be forbidden from signing any international prospect for more than $300,000 over the next two years.\n\nA week later, the Arizona Diamondbacks disregarded the same disincentives and landed Cuban pitcher Yoan Lopez for an $8.27 million bonus.\n\nOn Monday, the Boston Red Sox thumbed their noses at the penalties in handing highly sought Cuban infielder Yoan Moncada a $31.5 million bonus, meaning they'll end up paying $63 million to secure his services, independent of future salaries.\n\nThe bonus must be paid prior to the conclusion of the third calendar year following the date that the contract is entered (i.e., 2018). The tax money is due on July 30 and is used to fund international baseball development.\n\nIt appears the sanctions are not doing their job.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\n\"We thought we put a set of deterrents in the international signing pool that would be effective,'' Commissioner Rob Manfred said. \"So far, I will say they have not been quite as effective as we hoped for. But remember, the piece that has not yet kicked in is the inability to sign in the following years, so we'll have to see how that piece of the deterrent plays out before we make a full judgment.''\n\nIn the meantime, teams continue to find ways to lavish enormous amounts of money on unproven players – Moncada, Lopez and Baldoquin are all expected to require minor-league seasoning – despite the attempts to slow them down.\n\nAnd, of course, those who have the most spend the most.\n\nWith the New York Yankees in a relatively austere mode after a major shopping spree in the 2013-2014 offseason, the Red Sox have stepped up and set two records for payouts to Cuban free agents.\n\nIn August, they granted outfielder Rusney Castillo – who did not fall under the signing guidelines – a $72.5 million contract, the largest ever for a player from the communist island. Moncada's deal is the biggest for any player subject to the limitations, and it once again prompted calls for an international draft.\n\nTeams are flush with money and hungry for talent, so it's not strictly the large-markets clubs that are jumping into the talent pool head-first. The Diamondbacks surprised many baseball insiders when they landed Cuban outfielder/third baseman Yasmany Tomas for $68.5 million in December.\n\nBut few teams can afford to take such a gamble on players who have never competed against pros on a regular basis, other than the Cuban league, regarded as no higher than Class AA.\n\nThe small-market Milwaukee Brewers were impressed with Moncada's skills, which some of their evaluators believed would make him a future All-Star. They were the first team to make an offer for the powerfully built switch-hitter, and although it was under $20 million, they let it be known it could go higher. The Brewers soon found out they still couldn't match up with the big spenders.\n\n\"I don't think the financial penalties give everybody a fair chance,'' Milwaukee general manager Doug Melvin said. \"They don't deter clubs from getting involved. That 100 percent penalty (for every dollar above the assigned pool) doesn't seem to scare off a lot of teams.''\n\nMoncada is by all accounts a special talent, a speedy 19-year-old with power who was a dominant force at the junior level and batted .277 in parts of two seasons in the top Cuban league.\n\nLopez, who faced him in youth ball and in Cuba's Serie Nacional, told USA TODAY Sports in Spanish that Moncada is \"a complete player. In Cuba they talked about how he was going to be the next 'boom' player, a guy who was going to explode.''\n\nMelvin estimated Moncada might be a year and a half from the majors, and it's not hard to envision a scenario where he would take over as the Red Sox third baseman while newly acquired Pablo Sandoval shifts to DH to replace David Ortiz, who will be approaching 41 by the end of the 2016 season.\n\nCoincidentally, that will be the last season under the current collective bargaining agreement, and by then the clamor for an international draft to help level the playing field should be loud and clear.\n\n\"I suspect it will be a topic in 2016,'' Manfred said, \"and the significance of that topic probably increased by some of the activity we've had recently.''\n\nGALLERY: CUBANS WHO LIVE UP TO THE HYPE", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/14/making-weight/25741977/", "title": "Health is more than absence of illness", "text": "Daniel P. Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2018/03/25/detroit-tigers-al-avila-2018-opening-day/453652002/", "title": "Detroit Tigers: Meet the men trying to rebuild the franchise", "text": "LAKELAND, Fla. – It’s a cool morning, 50-something degrees as the sun shines on Tiger Town.\n\nIt’s the second day of Detroit Tigers minor league mini-camp, and one team wearing gray pants leads the other team, wearing white pants, 2-0, in the top of the third inning.\n\nMichael Fulmer is pitching, wearing a uniform with his name on the back. Fulmer, the team’s emerging ace, is getting his pitches in against younger players who are swinging and missing, wearing T-shirts with their names on the backs. They all belong to the Tigers' organization.\n\n“It’s a full house here,” one rival scout says, surveying the rather populated scene on the Tigers’ only day off this spring.\n\nYour guide to the 2018 Tigers:\n\nAll things Tigers: Latest Detroit Tigers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nNine reasons why Tigers might not be terrible in 2018\n\nTigers have No. 1 pick in 2018 MLB draft: 10 possibilities\n\nTigers top-20 prospects: Forecasting their major league debuts\n\nHere, a thousand miles away from the cold of Comerica Park, where the proverbial baseball winter is coming, Al Avila’s men can squint and see the franchise's future, when the prospects they've acquired through trades or drafts develop and maybe wind up playing in Detroit, wearing those uniforms.\n\n————————————————\n\nAl Avila\n\nWho: Executive vice president, general manager\n\nAge: 59.\n\nMajor League seasons: 27.\n\nKey jobs: Tigers: Assistant GM, 2002-15; Marlins: Vice president and assistant GM, 2001-02; Marlins: Scouting director, 1998-01; St. Thomas University: Athletic director and head baseball coach, 1989-92; Dodgers: Area scout, 1986.\n\nThree pitches:\n\n• Avila is the oldest son of legendary Dodgers executive Ralph Avila.\n\n• Has an expansive collection of Hawaiian shirts.\n\n• Nicknamed “lunch” early in his career for his penchant to schedule meetings around lunchtime.\n\n————————————————\n\nSome of Avila’s men stand around the field, an assortment of international scouts and interns, trainers and video guys, a loud groundskeeper named Amp and some interested players who just wrapped up their workouts on the surrounding fields. Franklin Perez, the Tigers' top prospect, is one of them. He says hello.\n\nIn the observation deck are Avila’s closest confidantes, David Chadd and Scott Bream. Behind the plate, Jay Sartori talks to Tom Moore. Not far away, Dave Littlefield is on the phone. Sam Menzin seems to be everywhere.They represent most of the team Avila has trusted with constructing the next contending Tigers team.\n\nAnd this week, when the Tigers open the 2018 season on Thursday at Comerica Park, the franchise will christen the official beginning of the franchise's next phase after years of chasing a World Series title.\n\nThe Tigers are not expected to contend this season. There will be losses, many of them, which will pile up as Avila wades through what almost certainly will be a painful rebuild. The team on the field will be unrecognizable from years past. Miguel Cabrera is the only remaining superstar. The up-and-coming players might not be around for much longer. And hope is far away, playing in the minor leagues.\n\nAvila's men are the ones working to bring talent to the organization, blending traditional scouting techniques with new-world analytics. This blend of old and new is at the heart of the Tigers' rebuild, and it will determine their future.\n\nA future on display this morning at Tiger Town.\n\nFor an hour, the Tigers see all aspects of their rebuild. Troy Montgomery, a center field prospect they acquired in a trade this offseason, singles off Fulmer, who could be shipped out for multiple prospects in a trade someday. Matt Manning relieves Fulmer. He has a great fastball. Alex Faedo pitches. Christin Stewart singles off him.\n\nAvila's men watch this, some wearing hoodies that say, “Winning Starts Now,” none really believing it. It could take three years. It could take five years. It could not happen at all. But they believe they’re going to start winning again. And for the challenge that will define his career, Avila believes in them and they believe in him, too.\n\nThis is who they are.\n\nMistakes in the rear-view mirror\n\nAl Avila believes this wholeheartedly.\n\n“You can take it to the bank,” he says.\n\nHe is talking about his front office and how — years before Aug. 3, 2015, when he took control of the Tigers — he had a piece of paper with their names written on it. He chose them not only for their abilities and experience, but for their leadership and personality. He called an impromptu meeting with them a week ago.\n\n“I told them, ‘I hand-picked all of you for these leadership roles and this is why I did it,’ ” he says. “’These are the qualities you have and that’s why you’re in your positions. I’m telling you the God’s honest truth.’ ”\n\nAvila, 59, is entering his third full season as Tigers general manager. He is the face of the team’s rebuilding efforts, the man who holds the blueprint. But behind that blueprint is what he believes is the best baseball knowledge in the business.\n\n“If you don’t have a team of people doing good jobs for you, you’re screwed,” he says. “If you don’t have a good person running your business — stock market, retail, all those people that run companies — if they didn’t have good people in all their departments doing their jobs, they would not be successful.”\n\nSome in the Tigers organization refer to them as the “Rat Pack.”\n\nThey carpool through Florida together, eat lunch together and oftentimes dinner. They have lifetimes of baseball experience but scoff at the notion they are old-school.\n\nAt Tiger Town, like on many other spring training days, they walk onto the field from an outfield entrance. Avila leads the way, Chadd to his left and Bream to his right.\n\nChadd, 52, is Avila’s most experienced scout in the front office and his assistant GM. A former All-American outfielder at Kansas State, Chadd passed on a minor-league opportunity with the Royals out of college to begin his coaching career. He joined the Marlins as an area scout in 1994, working with Avila for the first time, and rose through the amateur scouting ranks.\n\n————————————————\n\nDavid Chadd\n\nWho: Vice President, Assistant General Manager\n\nAge: 52\n\nMajor League seasons: 24\n\nKey jobs: Tigers: VP, amateur scouting, 2005-14; Red Sox: Director of amateur scouting, 2002-04; Marlins: Director of scouting, 2001; Wichita State: Assistant coach 1990-91.\n\nThree pitches:\n\n• Chadd, an All-American at Kansas State, passed on a minor-league contract offer from the Royals to begin his coaching career.\n\n• Recognized by Baseball America as the top scouting director of the 2000s.\n\n• Inducted into the Kansas Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\n————————————————\n\nSays Gary Hughes, the long-tenured Red Sox scout who hired Chadd in 1994: “There were good players at every game he took me to.”\n\nAfter a successful stint as amateur scouting director with the Red Sox, for whom he drafted and signed future All-Stars Jonathan Papelbon, Jon Lester and Dustin Pedroia, Chadd came to Detroit, began overseeing drafts in 2015 and later served in a hybrid role combining player development and scouting.\n\nNow, his focus is the Tigers' 40-man roster, minor league free agent signings and player development, all while assisting Avila in every aspect of baseball operations.\n\n“It’s changed dramatically for me,” he says. “I haven’t had to manage this much since I was coaching college baseball. So it’s changed dramatically for me. Al did that job for so long that he had it down, so as much as his change was being GM, my change to assistant GM was the same.”\n\nEarly in their tenure, the Tigers made mistakes. In Avila’s first offseason on the job, the Tigers went on a spending spree and signed starting pitcher Jordan Zimmermann, outfielder Justin Upton and pitchers Mike Pelfrey and Mark Lowe.\n\nIf you’ve been in the game for as long as Avila, those mistakes will be made.\n\nPelfrey ($16 million) and Lowe ($11 million) never came close to working out after signing two-year deals in 2015. Upton struggled through one of the worst slumps of his career after signing a six-year, $132 million deal in 2016. He broke out of it late in that season, and was dealt to the Angels at last season's trade deadline for prospects.\n\nZimmermann is the only player of those four still with the Tigers. He is 17-20 with a 5.60 ERA since signing a five-year, $110 million contract, with $74 million remaing on that deal.\n\nThere's optimism that with a strong season, he too could be traded, which would nearly complete the ongoing payroll deconstruction. Zimmermann is scheduled to start on Opening Day.\n\nAvila does not shy away from the mistakes. The Tigers were built to win, and winning is the reason longtime team owner Mike Ilitch hired him.\n\nSometimes, you pick the wrong players. And then you pay for it.\n\n“You have to understand why those mistakes were made and why those decisions were made,” Avila says. “You have to trust that the process was done correctly and that at the end of the day, we’re in it together, not pointing fingers because it happens, but picking each other up when it does.”\n\nThat process — and the thinking behind the critical moves that are to come — funnel through Chadd and Bream to Avila, who is running his team the same way he did when taking on a similar rebuilding process as the Marlins scouting director in the late 1990s.\n\n“There were some concerns, some problems,” one executive who worked for Avila said. “And he took a new approach and he said, ‘Hey, this is the way we’re going to do it. Here’s a bus. Get on the bus. If not, this bus is going to move on without you.' ”\n\nBack then, that bus was leading the Marlins to a second World Series title. But a week into the 2002 season, right after Avila arrived in Detroit, Bream thought a different bus was moving on without him.\n\n————————————————\n\nScott Bream\n\nWho: Vice president, Player Personnel\n\nAge: 47\n\nMajor League seasons: 20\n\nKey jobs: Tigers: Director of pro scouting, 2013-15; Padres: Special assistant to the general manager, 2011-12; Tigers: Major League scout, 2002-10; Tigers: Assistant general manager 2002; Tigers: Advance scout, 1999-2001.\n\nThree pitches:\n\n• Bream, a former shortstop in the Padres, Cubs and Tigers systems, was known for his foot speed and hard play, but not his hitting.\n\n• Enjoys golfing and skiing.\n\n• Skipped a pre-draft workout with the Rangers for his high school prom.\n\n————————————————\n\nA network wired for success\n\nThe Tigers were off to an 0-6 start in 2002, and new team president Dave Dombrowski had fired general manager Randy Smith, assuming his duties. Back then, Bream was proving himself as a young advance scout, appointed to the position years earlier after injury ended his playing career at Triple-A Toledo.\n\n“As soon as (Dombrowski) was hired, I saw it coming,” Bream said, sitting in his office. Outside the window, in the distance, are the Tiger Town backfields where he took his final professional swing, the one that tore up his shoulder.\n\n“The day Randy got fired,\" Bream said, \"I thought I was getting fired.”\n\nBut along with Dombrowski — and Avila — came Scott Reid, who was impressed with watching Bream during his scouting travels. Bream survived the day and worked nine seasons as a pro scout, most notably recommending Max Scherzer over Brandon Morrow as the team debated who to trade for during the 2009 offseason.\n\nBream, 49, is considered by Avila to be a “super scout.” He is the vice president of player personnel, directing the 16-man pro scouting department, and remains the one exception to Dombrowski’s long-standing rule that if somebody leaves the organization, they won’t be asked back. Bream is Avila’s ace when it comes to Major League scouting.\n\n“One of their common threads is they’re well-wired,” one American League executive said. “They have different trees and a lot of branches. If there’s a guy David Chadd knows, he can get information from a guy that Al might not know. If there’s a guy Scott Bream knows, he might be able to get information from a guy Dave Littlefield doesn’t. Information is so important.”\n\nConnections played a key role in the Tigers' biggest move to date — trading Justin Verlander to the Astros last season. As the minutes ticked closer to the postseason-eligible trade deadline at midnight Aug. 31, the front office's relationship with the Commissioner's Office played a big role in sealing the deal at 11:59 p.m. But perhaps no one played a bigger behind-the-scenes role than Bream, who is close friends with Astros manager A.J. Hinch.\n\nBream had been highly sought after and nearly left Detroit for the Dodgers in 2014 before a dinner with Avila and chief legal counsel John Westhoff changed his mind.\n\n“It just felt right,” he says. “He basically said, ‘Don’t go,’ but it wasn’t necessarily what he said, it was just kind of the comfort of being with Al and John and this felt like home, in some respects. I had been here a long time.\"\n\nLittlefield 'a leader of men'\n\nThe Tigers hired a young area scout named Dave Littlefield long before Avila or any members of his team arrived.\n\nLittlefield, a football player in college, was injured and looking for something to do when he stumbled into the baseball coaches’ office and asked to volunteer.\n\nHis first observation after his team was swept early in the season was, “I don’t know much about college baseball, but I know one thing: Their players are better than ours.” Thus began his baseball life. He coached at Massachusetts, in the Cape Cod League and at Clemson before jumping to the professional level as the Tigers’ East Coast amateur scout in 1988.\n\nKnown back then for eating his breakfast and reading the newspaper while driving down I-85 in the Carolinas, Littlefield represents the Tigers’ wealth of experience in the front office. He is the team’s vice president of player development, a job Avila says nobody in baseball wants because of the long, tedious hours. With him comes 30 years in the game, and most notably, a seven-year tenure as the Pirates' general manager from 2001-07.\n\n“He’s a blessing,” Avila says. “He’s a guy that should not just be scouting because he is a leader of men. He can lead, he can manage and so I always visualized him as a guy that, if I ever had a position, he would be one guy that I would want in charge of a department.”\n\n————————————————\n\nDave Littlefield\n\nWho: Vice president, Player Development\n\nAge: 57\n\nMajor League seasons: 30\n\nKey jobs: Cubs: Special assistant, 2008-14; Pirates: GM, 2001-07; Marlins: Assistant GM 1998-2001; Expos: Director of player development, 1994-97.\n\nThree pitches:\n\n• Littlefield is the oldest of three brothers in the game. Scott is a scout for the Rangers and Mark is a trainer for the Yankees.\n\n• He once watched the worst start of Clayton Kershaw’s senior year in high school and passed on him in the draft, selecting Andrew McCutchen instead.\n\n• Former Massachusetts football player.\n\n————————————————\n\nLittlefield’s job is to guide the development of the young talent in the Tigers’ system, from managing the staff who coaches them to promoting players and ensuring the farm system has organizational depth. While the rest of Avila’s entourage travels to spring training games across Florida, Littlefield stays on the backfields and spends most of the regular season working with minor-league affiliates.\n\nHe describes the Tigers’ new-age player development philosophy like this: “We may be old, but don’t take us as old-school. We do things that we think are the right thing to do. You learn over time and you make adjustments over time, so you pick up new things, which we all have to be open-minded to. But we think there’s certainly a fundamental part of baseball that we believe and we’ve learned from others that is a foundation of how players are always going to get better.”\n\nTigers' real MVP? Trackman\n\nIt is the top of the sixth inning in a game, and Matt Manning’s minor league contemporaries cannot hit his fastball.\n\nA Major League scout wonders how hard Manning is throwing, and a screen to his left shows Manning's last pitch was at 95.7 mph, had a spin rate of 2,234 revolutions per minute and was thrown at an extension of 7 feet, 3 inches past the rubber.\n\nIf it seems like too much information to process, that’s the point. It’s not the information, which every other team has access to, that illustrates the team’s analytical gains the past few years. It's the person sitting on a bench behind the backstop, cataloging each pitch with a few clicks.\n\nHis name is Adam Dailey, the newest member of the four-person analytics department, and when asked how he would explain all of this — the numbers and the clicks and what he does — he says it’s about spreading the most information as efficiently as possible.\n\nManning, one of the organization’s heralded pitching prospects, is striving to be equally as efficient. He couples his fastball with a good curveball, freezing the second batter he faces, prompting more questions from the scout. Manning is 20 years old, a former first-round pick who probably will start the season at Class A Lakeland.\n\n“Great pick,” the scout says. “Good-looking kid. They must be excited about him.”\n\nManning is pitching on field No. 3 at Tiger Town — Charlie Gehringer Field — the only one on the backfields with Trackman technology, a radar which has a numerical input for almost everything happening on the field. Behind the chainlink backstop, Sam Menzin talks with Manny Crespo, the team’s longtime Latin America player development director, about something on the screen. Crespo, 68, has been with the Tigers for 13 seasons. Menzin, 27, has been with them since 2012. He remembers what it was like back then.\n\nMenzin is considered the most versatile of the team’s front-office figures. He is well-versed on analytics, familiar with the Collective Bargaining Agreement from his days as an intern with Turner-Gary Sports agency , and he sits with the scouts at spring training games. Menzin assists Bream with pro scouting and is often the problem-solver when veteran scouts have problems adapting to the new analytics technology.\n\n————————————————\n\nSam Menzin\n\nWho: Director, Baseball Operations and Professional Scouting\n\nAge: 27\n\nMajor League seasons: 5\n\nKey jobs: Tigers: Baseball operations analyst and coordinator of baseball operations, 2013-15; Tigers: Baseball operations intern 2012.\n\nThree pitches\n\n• Known for wearing visors.\n\n• Known to sing Billy Joel as a youngster.\n\n• Added professional scouting to his role this upcoming season.\n\n————————————————\n\nAfter Manning strikes out the side, Alex Faedo, the team’s first-round pick from the 2017 draft, takes the mound. Faedo, a right-hander with a funky delivery from the University of Florida, was recommended by both the scouting and analytical departments.\n\n“Not much coming out,” the scout at the field says, echoing similar assessments throughout the spring. “I wouldn’t have known he was a first-rounder.”\n\nThe scout’s words represent the fickle nature of talent evaluation.\n\nFaedo is throwing to Joey Morgan, the team’s third-round pick last year. On a two-strike count, Morgan fouls a Faedo fastball directly off the Trackman screen, which is latched on the backstop high above home plate.\n\n“Oh, crap,” Dailey says.\n\nTrackman is OK.\n\nFaedo’s pitch, a 93 m.p.h. fastball, shows up on the screen. Dailey clicks away, cataloging it for near-immediate consumption.\n\n“It takes a beating,” he says.\n\nAnalytics: The new frontier\n\nStanding in the distance, Jay Sartori does not bat an eye. It is his 39th birthday, and he’s celebrating it the only way he knows how: By working.\n\nSartori is the man behind the Tigers’ analytical advances, the architect of an information database named “Caesar,” which went live on Jan. 5, 2017 and serves as a one-stop shop for all the information the organization now has.\n\nThere is likely no place Sartori would rather be on his birthday than spring training, which he missed dearly while working two years at Apple. Before his Silicon Valley sabbatical, Sartori built a nearly identical system, called “The Beast,\" over three years with the Blue Jays.\n\n————————————————\n\nJay Sartori\n\nWho: Senior director, Baseball Analytics & Operations\n\nAge: 39\n\nMajor League seasons: 10\n\nKey jobs: Apple: Manager, App Store Operations, 2014; Apple: Manager, App Store Entertainment & Sports, 2013; Blue Jays: Assistant GM, 2011-13; Nationals: Director of Baseball Operations, 2010; MLB Labor Relations: Manager, Salary and Contract Administration, 2006-09.\n\nThree pitches:\n\n• Was in attendance as a Patriots fan for this year’s Super Bowl loss.\n\n• Remains fiercely loyal to Apple products.\n\n• Pro wrestling fan who dreams of Michigan native Kevin Nash throwing out the first pitch of a Tigers game.\n\n————————————————\n\nSitting in his office, the man who Avila calls “the most important person I’ve hired in 20 years,” explains how far the Tigers have come in analytics since he arrived early in Avila’s first off-season.\n\n“The best way to say it is we did not have an analytics department,” Sartori says. “It just did not exist.”\n\nNow, the department consists of eight people, including manager Jim Logue, who came from the Yankees last offseason and who Sartori considers the smartest man in the room. In addition to Sartori and Logue, there are four full-time analysts, two database architects. There's also a software developer position open and several interns who run the day-to-day operations.\n\n“I think we’ve made infinite strides in that sense,” Sartori says. “We went from not having stuff to now we have this and we have output analysis.”\n\nThat analysis aims to improve decision making and player development, from the major to the minor leagues and from amateur to international players. The analysts take data from Trackman or Rapsodo (a mobile version or Trackman) or any other technologies, and try to break it down into a usable format for the Tigers’ front office. Earlier this spring, the University of Michigan’s Exercise and Sports Science Initiative visited Tiger Town and put sensors on Franklin Perez, the franchise's top prospect, during a bullpen session. Daz Cameron and Derek Hill were tracked while running the bases, as was Christin Stewart swinging the bat. Each of their movements were captured with high-speed cameras.\n\n“We’re trying to make everybody’s job easier with more access to information,” Sartori says. “To make sure everybody understands and we’re on the same page and talking the same language.”\n\n“We spent a lot of money on technology, but I have old-school guys,” Avila says. “They gotta buy in. If they don’t buy in, then where’s the loyalty, right? I have to show loyalty to the guys that are traditional guys, that I trust them to do what they do, with the capabilities of what they know. They also have to have loyalty to me on the new things I’m bringing to the table, and they have to buy in. Because if they don’t, it’s not going to work.”\n\nTigers No. 1 ... in the draft\n\nDown the hall from Sartori, past pictures of team legends like Hall of Famers Al Kaline and Alan Trammell, who will be inducted in July, Tom Moore is talking about what he does.\n\nMoore, 47, is the Tigers’ director of international operations. He is one of two men whose job has become even more important in the rebuilding process. The other, amateur scouting director Scott Pleis, is on the road but represented on Moore’s desk by a bobblehead doll with his picture taped to it.\n\n————————————————\n\nTom Moore\n\nWho: Director, International Operations\n\nAge: 44\n\nMajor League seasons: 23\n\nKey jobs: Tigers: Assistant director of professional and international scouting, 2006-14; Red Sox: Assistant director of professional and international scouting, 2002-05; Red Sox: Major League video coordinator, 1995.\n\nThree pitches:\n\n• Grew up in Massachusetts rooting for the Yankees.\n\n• Ran the Boston Marathon in 2004.\n\n• Met his wife Kerri while interning with the Red Sox. She was part of the PR department.\n\n————————————————\n\nMoore is involved in the team’s ever-expanding international efforts, which is how Avila made his name with the Marlins. His job is to find and sign the best international talent, best utilize the team’s international signing pool budget and manage professional scouts.\n\nPerusing color-coded rosters for their international teams, Moore jokes that he might have the easiest job of the bunch in convincing Avila to put more resources in the international budget. This season, the Tigers have focused on the Dominican Republic by adding a second summer league team and renovating their facilities. The Tigers are one of four teams who have kept an academy in Venezuela despite the country’s economic crisis.\n\n“It’s extremely important because we’re trying to develop within,” Moore says. “We’re trying to really pump up the system but at the same time, that’s been our job since day one, to try to get the tools to either develop the guys or trade for. The difference is, we’re dealing with many more resources now.”\n\nMoore’s right-hand man is Miguel Garcia, who, along with Avila, was instrumental in the Marlins' signing of Miguel Cabrera. Ask a rival executive for the reason why this Tigers front office should be trusted with the rebuild, and he says, “Look at their first baseman. This is what those guys do.”\n\nThe international side of amateur talent acquisition is more of a crapshoot than the game Pleis will play this summer. And though he doesn’t come out and admit it, there is pressure with having the No. 1 pick in the draft.\n\nPleis, 54, is talking from his hotel room in Tennessee. He has been on the road for the past 10 days as he travels the country scouting contestants for not only the top pick, but the rest of what will be an important draft for the Tigers' rebuild.\n\n“It’s critical to bring in some impact,” he says.\n\n————————————————\n\nScott Pleis\n\nWho: Director, Amateur Scouting.\n\nAge: 54.\n\nMajor League seasons: 24.\n\nKey jobs: Tigers: National crosschecker, 2007-09; Cubs: East Coast crosschecker, 2004-06; Yankees: Area scout, 1994-2004.\n\nThree pitches:\n\n• Was drafted in the fourth round in 1981 as a catcher before being moved to second base.\n\n• In 1983, fell .003 short of the New York-Penn League batting average title.\n\n• Dad, Bill, pitched in the majors with the Twins.\n\n————————————————\n\nAfter a minor-league playing career, Pleis dabbled in golf, trying to make the professional tour, before starting as an area scout. He didn’t think too much of his future in the game but was hired by Chadd in 2007.\n\nThe Tigers' draft strategy is a bit different this season. Talent has always been prized, but in the past — as the Tigers contended every year — players closer to making an immediate major-league impact were preferred. This year — and in the years to come — they might target players with higher upsides since they have no illusions of contending.\n\nThe team’s farm system still ranks in the lower-third of baseball, even after acquiring some solid prospects in last season's fire sale. Now, with the top pick (also known as the \"1-1\") — and most importantly, the largest signing-bonus pool to spend on players — Pleis and his scouts must produce some big-league players.\n\n“It’s almost like the perfect storm,” Pleis says. “From ownership giving us support with all of the extra tools we have in analytics to get the best players, it’s kind of like, if you were to pick the best time where this all came together, it’s a good time when you’re picking ‘1-1’ ”\n\n'This is a people business'\n\nIt’s a nice night, 70-something degrees as the sun sets on a golf course.\n\nAl Avila doesn’t golf much, he says. When he does, he’s just kind of out there swinging. He does smoke cigars, though, and tonight, he is smoking a Monte Cristo while he surveys the dinner menu at Grasslands Country Club.\n\nAvila takes a longer-than-expected time to choose his meal, but this is not surprising. Those who have worked closest with him say he is methodical in his decision-making, yet fearless in the decisions he makes. He chooses the “Shrimp Diablo.”\n\nMoments later, he receives a text message from his wife. One of his daughter’s former dance teammates died in the bridge collapse at Florida International University. He steps outside to call his wife and returns 10 minutes later. A favorite phrase of his is, “Life is temporary.” He repeats it later when talking about his team in the front office.\n\n“I trust them,” he says. “If I didn’t trust them with my life — and when I say my life, I mean my career, because this life is temporary — then they wouldn’t be here. I trust them. I’m really proud of my team and I know they will be successful for me.”\n\nThey were chosen because of their loyalty and leadership and trust, all old-school baseball ideals from a man who has spent his life in the game. They are longtime scouts and coaches and players who have also spent their life in the game. A couple of them are Hall of Famers.

Journal Sentinel reporters worked to cover it all through stories, galleries and video, long and shorter. Here's a look at the 20 stories Milwaukee Journal Sentinel readers spent the most time with in 2024, as measured by average engage time per story. The average time spent on the story ranged from nearly 12 minutes to about 5 minutes.\n\nReporter Mary Spicuzza dug through thousands of records, interviews and documents to piece together what happened to her second cousin August Palmisano. The first person narrative dives into Milwaukee's mob history to try to find out who killed Augie, who died in a 1978 car bombing. What Spicuzza found was a story about loyalty, jealousy and power — and what some people are willing to do for it.\n\nSpicuzza and multimedia producer Bill Schulz also produced an accompanying podcast.\n\nGreen Bay Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst talks with columnist Pete Dougherty every year after training camp and before the regular season starts. This year, Packers fans tuned into the column in anticipation of another exciting year, and hopes for another ring.\n\nBeat reporter Ryan Wood dove deep into the tapes to write this analysis of Jordan Love in his first season as starting quarterback for the Green Bay Packers. Wood looked at every pass Love made: all 581 of them. The story published on Jan. 11, 2024, on the eve of the Packers' surprising playoff run.\n\nMilwaukee residents were hurt and saddened to learn what happened to 19-year-old Sade Robinson. When police arrested Maxwell Anderson in connection with her death, reporters Ashley Luthern and Elliot Hughes investigated his background. What emerged is a portrait of a young man who appeared to repeatedly flout the rules, faced few serious consequences and was prone to violence and alcohol-fueled rage.\n\nReporter Curt Hogg gives Brewers fans a reason to believe in the future – that even though the club doesn't have the top-end talent in the MLB, it more than makes up for it in depth. You may not know the names on Hogg's list yet, but someday you may be buying their jerseys.\n\nWe'll call it a tie for No. 6 with partner stories featuring interviews from Brewers owner Mark Attanasio and new Brewers manager Pat Murphy. Heading into the 2024 season, the Brewers were going through a lot of change at the top, and fans wanted an inside scoop, provided by longtime beat reporter Todd Rosiak.\n\nSophie Carson tells the heartwarming story of a reunion between a mother and her son after 58 years apart. Barbara Kraft had Kevin Heyel when she was 20 years old and gave him up for adoption. Her siblings never even knew she was pregnant. “I was worried about you,” she told him when they met. “All the time.”\n\nReporter Cleo Krecji spent a year working in an assisted living facility and shares what she saw in a first person narrative based on her daily journals from the time. An accompanying investigation delves into how people in assisted living facilities are getting sicker, and how underprepared Wisconsin is to handle their care.\n\nReporter JR Radcliffe dissects the untimely end to the Brewers' season and the enduring questions: Why and when? Also who? Who will the team pick up in the offseason? And will we ever get that pennant?\n\nSimilar to the deep dive into Jordan Love's first starting season, reporter Todd Rosiak analyzed Brewers manager Pat Murphy's first 50 games. Rosiak looks at the numbers and the pitchers and poses questions to Murphy, giving readers some stats to chew on.\n\nThe entire newsroom worked together to craft this list of objects that define Milwaukee.\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nReaders do care about more than just the Brewers, a team that clearly dominates this list. Jim Owczarski's February feature about Bucks star Damian Lillard showed Milwaukee fans that Lillard is committed to the team at a time when many were worried.\n\nEnrollment at regional universities in the UW System has slumped everywhere except at UWGB. Higher education reporter Kelly Meyerhofer looked at some data to find out how the Green Bay campus is bucking the trend.\n\nTrending sports reporter JR Radcliffe ranks the Packers' top 15 NFL draft classes in anticipation of last year's draft. And which class is at No. 1? It's 1958 for those who can remember.\n\nDedicated Journal Sentinel readers will be familiar with columnist Dan Bice's \"winners and losers\" lists. Naturally, the Republican National Convention winners and losers was a must-read.\n\nSixty years ago, many Milwaukee neighborhoods, and nearly every community in the 10-county archdiocese, had a Catholic church. Those churches often had schools, convents, gymnasiums and rectories. Today, dozens of parishes are in clusters that share priests and administrative resources to deal with a decline that has become more pressing over the last decade, reporter Sophie Carson found in an analysis.\n\n\"The seeds of the inning that may have revived playoff baseball in Milwaukee were sown on a dirt field in Maracaibo, Venezuela, nearly a decade ago, when Reinaldo Hidalgo stood behind a rickety chain-link fence, stopwatch and notepad in hand ...\" We dare you to stop reading there.\n\nMegan Kling shared her and her husband's difficult decision to end a dangerous pregnancy with reporter Jessica VanEgeren, who handles the nuance of the story with care. VanEgeren tells how a family came to make their choice.\n\nThe Republican National Convention brought the entire Journal Sentinel newsroom together, and eight reporters and interns contributed to this story featuring more than 30 delegates from different states.\n\nThe top restaurants list returned in 2024 after a five-year hiatus. Dining critic Rachel Bernhard presents her list as \"the ones that make Milwaukee a destination in dining, whether you’ve lived here all your life or are discovering its magic for the first time.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/football/nfl/bills/2018/12/28/buffalo-bills-2018-review-josh-allen-quarterbacks-kelvin-benjamin/2423478002/", "title": "Buffalo Bills 2018 highs, lows: From playoffs to auditions for 2019", "text": "ORCHARD PARK – This was a year for the Buffalo Bills that was perfectly predictable, and to their credit, coach Sean McDermott and general manager Brandon Beane warned us all that it was coming.\n\nRather than bask in the glory of terminating the 17-year playoff drought in 2017, the two football department head honchos at One Bills Drive recognized that a repeat run to the playoffs was going to be next to impossible.\n\nThey told us to “trust the process” and asked for patience as the Bills muddled through a season that they knew would likely be derailed by an onerous dead salary cap problem of their own doing, a rookie quarterback earning his stripes, and a near-total lack of talent on the offensive side of the ball which would be difficult to overcome no matter how well their more established defense played.\n\nAs their 5-10 record heading into Sunday’s season finale against Miami indicates, it has indeed been a tough year for the Bills.\n\nThe 365-day epoch that was 2018 began in the early morning hours of Jan. 1 with so much joy as fans celebrated at the Buffalo airport when the Bills flew back from Miami having clinched their spot in the postseason.\n\nIt will end on New Years’ Eve with the players packing up their lockers and saying goodbye to each other, many knowing that they won’t be back with the Bills in 2019.\n\nIn between, it was a pretty interesting year. Here’s a look back:\n\nJanuary: Made the playoffs, but lots of loss in\n\n► Playoff loss: In their first postseason game since Jan. 8, 2000, the Bills lost 10-3 to Doug Marrone’s Jaguars as Tyrod Taylor, in his final game as the Bills’ quarterback, could muster only three points and the defense couldn’t figure out how to tackle Jacksonville QB Blake Bortles who ran for 88 yards while passing for only 87. “Heck of a year,” McDermott said. “Appreciate how hard the guys played, how hard they worked all season. This was a step. We learned a lot of valuable lessons today, ones that we’ll carry forward as we move forward as an organization.”\n\n► Incognito trouble: A couple hours after the game, Jacksonville defensive end Yannick Ngakoue tweeted that Buffalo’s Richie Incognito used racial slurs aimed at him during the game. This, of course, was a serious allegation, especially given Incognito’s checkered history. He and Ngakoue wound up being AFC teammates at the Pro Bowl, and while there was never an admission of guilt from Incognito, he apologized and said, “I hope it can be put to bed.”\n\n► Coordinator change: After watching his offense struggle most of the year, ranking 22nd in points, 29th in total yards and 31st in passing yards, McDermott cut the cord with Rick Dennison and two days later hired western New York native Brian Daboll, who was fresh off winning a college national championship with Alabama. Knowing the Bills would be drafting a QB in the first round, McDermott admitted, “Brian’s background, and knowing the passing game in particular, was important to me.”\n\n► Early retirement: Eric Wood, one of the heart and soul leaders of the team, received devastating news just days after the season ended when, in his exit medical exam, a degenerative neck problem was diagnosed which forced him to retire. Unfortunately, due to a contract issue, his retirement announcement in the fieldhouse was ruined, and he has yet to get his proper and well-deserved send-off.\n\nFebruary: 2018 season starts to take shape\n\n► Quitter signs: The Bills knew they were losing cornerback EJ Gaines in free agency, so they moved quickly to fill the void by signing veteran Vontae Davis before free agency began. You might say this transaction didn’t work out too well.\n\n► Trade rumors: It came as no surprise to anyone that Taylor’s future with the team was a hot topic, and the rumor mill began grinding in earnest with all signs pointing to the Bills either cutting Taylor before the start of free agency or trading him.\n\n► QB search: The Bills’ hierarchy headed to Indianapolis for the annual NFL Scouting Combine with the intent of intensifying its research on the top-rated QBs in the draft. Josh Allen, Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold and Josh Rosen were all in the mix, depending on how high the Bills could trade up in the first round. “They do have ammunition, and pretty good ammunition,” Bill Polian said of Buffalo’s two first-round picks.\n\nMarch: Free agents roll in, Tyrod leaves\n\n► Decision time: Long-time defensive tackle Kyle Williams was firmly on the fence when the season ended regarding retirement, but after deliberate consideration, he decided it wasn’t time to hang ‘em up and he and the Bills agreed on a one-year deal. “I haven’t exhausted my dream of playing this game and chasing being a champion,” Williams said.\n\n► Tyrod traded: The dominoes began falling the day before the start of free agency when Beane traded Taylor to the Browns and tackle Cordy Glenn to the Bengals. These moves enabled the Bills to move up to No. 12 in the first round, plus brought an extra third-round pick while clearing some salary cap space for the next two days of activity.\n\n► Spending spree: Beane was a busy man on the first two days of free agency as he signed QB A.J. McCarron, DT Star Lotulelei, DE Trent Murphy, S Rafael Bush, and LB Julian Stanford, and before the end of the month, the free agent haul also included RB Chris Ivory, C Russell Bodine, OT Marshall Newhouse, and CB Phillip Gaines. In hindsight, it wasn’t a very productive group of players.\n\n► A bad night: Wide receiver Zay Jones, who had a tough rookie season which ended with shoulder surgery soon after the playoff loss, was arrested in Los Angeles following a bizarre incident in an apartment complex where he was running around naked and out of control. He has never publicly discussed what happened, and charges were ultimately dropped, but he wound up missing all of the Bills’ offseason program.\n\nApril: Help for offense and defense arrives\n\n► Richie retires: The Bills asked Incognito to take a pay cut, and he reluctantly agreed to it, then changed his mind and promptly retired, creating another gaping hole on the offensive line following Wood’s retirement and Glenn’s trade.\n\n► The chosen one: Mayfield went No. 1 overall to the Browns, Darnold went No. 3 to the Jets, so Beane, realizing he couldn’t stay put at No. 12, worked a trade with Tampa Bay to move up to No. 7 and selected Allen, passing on Rosen who many felt would have been the right pick. Beane then traded up to No. 16 in the first round to choose LB Tremaine Edmunds. In one night, Beane believed he was setting two foundational pieces in place, the QB on offense and the QB on defense. We shall see if indeed he did.\n\nMay: Bye bye Brandon\n\n► Brandon fired: In a shocking development, Russ Brandon was fired by the Pegulas for allegations of personal misconduct and inappropriate relationships with female employees at Pegula Sports and Entertainment. It was a sad end to a tenure that began in 1997 and saw Brandon hold several hugely important roles with the Bills, and later PSE.\n\n► Allen’s arrival: The rookie came to Buffalo for the Bills’ rookie mini-camp and he wasted no time taking a leadership role as he had the other rookies following him around like he was the Pied Piper. The highlight for Allen, though, was meeting Bills’ legend Jim Kelly. “Still shaking from meeting him; he’s a special man,” Allen said.\n\nJune: Jim Kelly honored\n\n► Award time: At his annual charity golf tournament, Kelly jumped the gun before ESPN could announce and revealed that he would be receiving the Jimmy V Award at the annual ESPY awards in July. The honor, named for the late Jim Valvano, is presented to a member of the sporting world who has “overcome great obstacles through perseverance and determination.” Just a couple months earlier, Kelly had learned that his oral cancer had returned and he underwent yet another major surgery.\n\nJuly: Camp starts with McCoy saga\n\n► Disturbing allegations: Just before the start of training camp, LeSean McCoy’s former girlfriend was the victim of a home invasion and beating, and she claimed that while McCoy was not the perpetrator, she believed he was behind the incident. McCoy vehemently denied this, and the Bills and the NFL decided not to punish McCoy, though the case remains open.\n\n► Training camp: The Bills arrived at St. John Fisher College with Allen signed and ready to go, though he began practice as the third-stringer behind McCarron and Nathan Peterman. And so began the daily analysis of every move the QBs made.\n\nAugust: Peterman wins the QB battle\n\n► Taking a swing: Realizing how lacking the wide receiver corps was, Beane acquired Corey Coleman, a former first-round pick of the Browns who they had just cut days earlier after he openly complained about his standing on the team to Cleveland coach Hue Jackson on camera during the airing of HBO’s Hard Knocks. Coleman proved to be a waste and was cut at the end of training camp.\n\n► Preseason games: Peterman got the start in the opener against Carolina which was an early red flag on McCarron. McCarron started against the Browns and did not play well in his brief stint. Then came what everyone was waiting for, Allen’s start against the Bengals. It was a letdown as he went just 6 of 12 for 34 yards and absorbed five sacks. When Peterman threw for 200 yards in the second half, McDermott decided that he was the winner of the three-headed QB competition and that he would start opening day in Baltimore.\n\nSeptember: Peterman out, Allen in\n\n► McCarron traded: In a surprising move, when Jon Gruden of the Raiders offered Beane a 2019 fifth-round pick, the GM peddled McCarron to Oakland, thus admitting to a big free agent whiff. The trade left the Bills with a terribly worrisome QB situation with just Peterman and Allen on the roster heading into Week 1.\n\n► Allen Era begins: It took all of one half of the miserable 47-3 Week 1 loss to the Ravens for McDermott to realize Peterman wasn’t the answer at QB, so he turned to Allen to finish that game, and named him the starter for the Week 2 home opener against the Chargers. Of course, few remember that Allen threw for 245 yards because at halftime, Vontae Davis stunned the Bills and NFL Nation by abruptly retiring. Naturally, his quitting became a blight on the Bills and western New York and the jokes were relentless over the next few days.\n\n► Superman: The following week, Allen literally leaped into the national consciousness as he helped lead the Bills to a shocking 27-6 upset blowout in Minnesota. On one of his scrambles, Allen jumped right over Vikings LB Anthony Barr, and Twiiter and the world of memes exploded.\n\nOctober: So many QBs\n\n► QB roulette: Allen suffered an elbow injury in the loss at Houston, so Peterman came in and threw a game-deciding pick six in the final two minutes. The following week, McDermott started Derek Anderson even though he had been signed off his couch barely a week earlier. Predictably, Anderson was terrible and the Colts blew out Buffalo. A week later, Anderson started again in the Monday nighter against the Patriots, and he endured another rough performance before being knocked out by a concussion, and he never played another snap.\n\n► A rebirth: During the Bills’ October struggles, they cut rookie WR Robert Foster after he caught only two passes in the first six games and showed no signs of improving. He was brought back to the practice squad, and from that moment on he proceeded to change his narrative through hard work and now he’s the top receiver on the team.\n\n►No takers: Kelvin Benjamin was so bad in the first two months, Beane couldn’t get anyone to bite in trade talks prior to the Halloween deadline. In the meantime, he took a flyer on Terrelle Pryor who had been cut by the Jets in the hopes that he could bring some playmaking ability to the wide receiver corps. Like several of Beane’s free agent signings in 2018, it didn’t work and Pryor was cut a few weeks later.\n\nNovember: We found out who Matt Barkley is\n\n► QB controversy?: No, not quite. But Matt Barkley, who had just been signed a week earlier, was given the start over Peterman when the Bills traveled to New York on Nov. 11. Barkley’s first play was a 47-yard completion to the rejuvenated Foster, and he threw for 232 yards and two TDs as the Bills routed the Jets 41-10. There were some who said Barkley should remain the starter, even with Allen ready to return to action. Thankfully, McDermott did not see it that way.\n\n► The end: The day after the Jets victory, the Bills pulled the plug on the disastrous Peterman Experience and waived him with Allen back in the fold. Peterman concluded his Bills’ career with 3 TDs and 12 interceptions and a passer rating of 32.5. “Wow” is the only word that fits here.\n\n► Saint Doug: Marrone returned to Buffalo for the first time as a head coach and his disappointing Jaguars lost 24-21 in Allen’s return from a month-long absence. Jacksonville killed Buffalo on the ground with 226 yards, but Blake Bortles was Blake Bortles, and Allen ran for 99 yards and a TD while passing for 160 yards on just eight completions.\n\nDecember: The end of the road for some\n\n► Benjamin released: Unable to trade the underachiever, Beane just released him after he’d caught only 23 passes for 354 yards in 12 games. “It obviously didn’t work,” McDermott said of the trade that brought Benjamin to Buffalo midway through 2017. Benjamin landed in Kansas City where, not surprisingly, he has one catch in the two games he has played.\n\n► Round 1: Because they were both drafted by AFC East teams, there will always be comparisons made between Allen and Darnold because presumably, they will meet twice a year for what both teams hope will be many years to come. Neither played in the first Bills-Jets game in November, but they were back for the rematch in Buffalo and Darnold led a game-winning drive in the final minutes for a 27-23 victory. He passed for 170 yards while Allen had 206 yards, plus rushed for 101.\n\n► A situation: That’s how McCoy described whatever happened last week that prompted McDermott to bench his offensive captain for the first play of the loss to the Patriots. McDermott was mum Wednesday, saying he and McCoy have moved on from it. It was just the latest disappointment in the most disappointing season of McCoy’s career. Also, tight end Charles Clay was a healthy scratch, and it raised speculation that he and McCoy would both be playing their final games in Bills’ uniforms Sunday in the finale against the Dolphins.\n\nMAIORANA@Gannett.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/draft/2016/04/30/nfl-draft-tracker-analysis-2016-picks-seven-rounds/83762420/", "title": "NFL draft tracker 2016: Seven-round breakdown on picks", "text": "Nate Davis\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 2016 NFL draft is in the books, and we have a full review of all the picks.\n\nTake a look back at every selection from 1-253, as well as our analysis through the first three rounds.\n\n1. Los Angeles Rams (from Tennessee Titans) – Jared Goff, QB, California: The prolific passer from the Bay Area is officially tabbed as the newest leading man in Hollywood. Luckily for Goff, he will inherit a fine supporting cast, and reigning offensive rookie of the year Todd Gurley will probably merit at least a co-starring role aside Goff for several years to come. Slot receiver Tavon Austin is another nice player who can take a 5-yard slant the distance. Coach Jeff Fisher and GM Les Snead have built a potentially dominant defense and a coalescing offensive line that has been steadily stocked in the past two drafts. The only piece that may be missing right now for Goff, who is arguably the most pro-ready passer in this draft, is a downfield receiving threat who can force defenses from loading up to shut down Gurley.\n\n2. Philadelphia Eagles (from Cleveland Browns) – Carson Wentz, QB, North Dakota State: Unlike Goff, Wentz joins Philly as a No. 3 quarterback, at least initially, behind veterans Sam Bradford and Chase Daniel. Regardless, the Eagles paid a heavy ransom to get into position for Wentz, so they obviously view him as the franchise face of the future, perhaps the near future if Bradford forces his way out of town and Wentz proves he's ready for the jump from the Football Championship Subdivision to the pros. Wentz will be groomed by two former NFL quarterbacks, new coach Doug Pederson — he started in 1999 until then-rookie Donovan McNabb was ready to play — and offensive coordinator Frank Reich. Wentz also inherits a pretty good offense as the Eagles feature a solid group of blockers, a pair of effective tight ends (Zach Ertz and Brent Celek), dangerous-when-healthy RBs Ryan Mathews and Darren Sproles plus a pair of promising young wideouts in Jordan Matthews and Nelson Agholor, last year's first rounder.\n\n3. San Diego Chargers – Joey Bosa, DE/OLB, Ohio State: And mock drafts around the nation go up in flames. Bosa will have to convert to outside linebacker in San Diego's 3-4 scheme, but he consistently showed the kind of athleticism in pre-draft workouts that would suggest he can handle the transition. He should form a nice tandem on the edge with Melvin Ingram while adding juice to a pass rush that compiled only 32 sacks in 2015, ranking in the bottom quarter of the league. Bosa, whom many considered the best player coming out when the pre-draft process began, is a high-revving player who should also be highly effective at stopping the run.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n4. Dallas Cowboys – Ezekiel Elliott, RB, Ohio State: This tells you how much Dallas missed 2014 rushing champ DeMarco Murray last year. Despite having proven RBs Darren McFadden and Alfred Morris in-house, the Cowboys opt for Elliott, the consensus top back of the draft. He averaged nearly 7 yards per carry during his three-year career with the Buckeyes and posted 1,800-plus yards the past two seasons. But that's not all. He's got 55 catches over the past two seasons and is an excellent pass protector. Now this three-down stud will be lining up behind what is arguably the NFL's best offensive line. QB Tony Romo, 36, couldn't ask for a better addition to help him break the Cowboys' two-decade Super Bowl drought.\n\n5. Jacksonville Jaguars – Jalen Ramsey, DB, Florida State: He's got a very good claim he's the best defender in this draft. Ramsey joins a Jags defense that allowed the most points in the AFC (448) in 2015. A former tracker star with freakish athletic ability, Ramsey has the versatility to guard anyone from slot receivers to tight ends. He can play press coverage or deep safety. The only knock on him was a modest ability to turn the ball over as he had just three interceptions in three years with the Seminoles. He told me during a pre-draft interview he wants to play throughout the secondary and would also like the opportunity to return kicks to provide him additional opportunities to get his hands on the ball.\n\n6. Baltimore Ravens – Ronnie Stanley, T, Notre Dame: He becomes this franchise's highest pick in 16 years since RB Jamal Lewis was taken fifth overall in 2000. GM Ozzie Newsome can only hope Stanley can have an impact similar to another member of those Super Bowl Ravens, Hall-of-Fame LT Jonathan Ogden. Stanley, a former basketball player, has excellent feet and should quickly establish himself as Joe Flacco's new bodyguard, something that should certainly appeal to the quarterback as he recovers from ACL surgery. Stanley's arrival could well mean incumbent LT Eugene Monroe will switch positions if he doesn't end up switching teams.\n\n7. San Francisco 49ers – DeForest Buckner, DE, Oregon: Appropriate that the first pick of the Chip Kelly era is a Duck. Buckner is probably an even better prospect than once-and-future teammate Arik Armstead, also a defensive end whom the Niners took in the first round a year ago. Buckner, who's used to the five-technique position he played in Oregon's 3-4 defense, is an excellent run stuffer, effective pass rusher and can also use his 6-7 frame to bat down plenty of passes at the line of scrimmage.\n\n8. Titans (from Miami Dolphins via Eagles and Browns) – Jack Conklin, T, Michigan State: The two most active teams in this draft from a trade perspective, Tennessee and Cleveland, do a deal among themselves as the Titans, once owners of the No. 1 pick, get back into the top 10. And new GM Jon Robinson accomplishes his mandate from ownership: find a way to better protect franchise QB Marcus Mariota, who suffered a pair of knee injuries as a rookie that cost him playing time. Conklin is a mauler who's likely to anchor the right side of the O-line while former first rounder Taylor Lewan remains on Mariota's blind side. Conklin should also greatly enhance the run blocking for an offense that expects to establish better balance after acquiring RB DeMarco Murray last month. The Titans' ground game ranked 25th in 2015.\n\n9. Chicago Bears (from Tampa Bay Buccaneers) – Leonard Floyd, DE/OLB, Georgia: The draft's hometown team jumps up two slots in a trade with Tampa Bay to snag Floyd, an athletic if slight (6-6, 244) pass rusher. Floyd has explosive moves and should nicely complement the Bears' other outside backer, Pernell McPhee, a major free-agent acquisition a year ago who's more stout against the run. But Floyd is the kind of pressure player who is imperative for a team that only had 35 sacks in 2015 and knows it must disrupt Aaron Rodgers to claw back to the top of the NFC North standings.\n\n10. New York Giants – Eli Apple, CB, Ohio State: Apple heads to the Big Apple in hopes of augmenting a defense that was the NFL's worst against the pass in 2015. The Giants already had a pair of solid corners in veterans Dominique Rodgers Cromartie and Janoris Jenkins, one of their big-ticket free agent additions in March. But there wasn't much depth behind those two, and it's imperative to have three top-tier corners in a league where defenses spend two-thirds of the time in the nickel formation. Apple's size (6-1, 199) should eventually allow him to man up against jumbo NFC East targets like Dez Bryant, Jordan Matthews, Pierre Garcon and maybe even Redskins tight end Jordan Reed.\n\n11. Buccaneers (from Bears) – Vernon Hargreaves III, CB, Florida: The Bucs pick up a player who has great quickness and can instantly defend the slot, though Hargreaves' height (5-10) could be a drawback in a division with towering pass catchers like Julio Jones, Kelvin Benjamin, Devin Funchess and Coby Fleener. Still, he ought to have some leeway in that department as veteran Pro Bowl CB Brent Grimes is likely to draw many of those assignments in 2016.\n\n12. New Orleans Saints – Sheldon Rankins, DT, Louisville: The defense that allowed the most points (476) in the league last year gets immediate help on the line. Rankins is only 6-1, 299, but he's very quick for an interior defender and can stop running backs in their tracks yet is slippery enough to get after quarterbacks — always a key attribute in a division with so many effective passers.\n\n13. Dolphins (from Eagles) – Laremy Tunsil, T, Mississippi: Quite the draft night tumble for Tunsil, who was shown on Twitter taking a bong hit just minutes before the draft kicked off. Still, Miami decided his value — Tunsil was ranked as the No. 1 overall player in some quarters — was too good to pass up. He also seems like a bit of a luxury given high-priced Branden Albert plays left tackle and RT Ja'Wuan James was picked in the first round two years ago. Still, the Dolphins clearly remained true to their board and get a player who will protect QB Ryan Tannehill and should help a 23rd-ranked ground game.\n\n14. Oakland Raiders – Karl Joseph, S, West Virginia: Clearly the Silver & Black weren't dissuaded by Joseph's 2015 knee injury, which limited him to four games (he had five INTs in that small sample size). He'll definitely be a welcome addition for a team that lost S Charles Woodson to retirement. And Joseph's reckless abandon — he will sprint into the fray to clock a running back and will range from half a field away to break up a pass — despite his diminutive size (5-10, 205) will remind Raiders fans of former NFL defensive player of the year Bob Sanders.\n\n15. Browns (from Rams via Titans) – Corey Coleman, WR, Baylor: Finally, the latest franchise reboot under new executive VP of football operations Sashi Brown, chief strategy officer Paul DePodesta and coach Hue Jackson begins after the team dropped 14 spots from its original No. 2 slot. Coleman is a speedster who will replace departed Travis Benjamin while providing a nice deep threat for fellow Baylor alum Robert Griffin III. Coleman's presence should also soften what is shaping up as another year without currently suspended WR Josh Gordon.\n\n16. Detroit Lions –Taylor Decker, OT, Ohio State: With WR Calvin Johnson retired, the Detroit offense is in need of a significant recalibration. That begins with adding Decker to a line that was partially responsible for the NFL's worst rushing offense in 2015 and has allowed 89 sacks of QB Matthew Stafford over the past two seasons. Decker also provides a nasty streak on the field that should play well in Motown. He could immediately displace current LT Riley Reiff.\n\n17. Atlanta Falcons – Keanu Neal, S, Florida: A rebuilding defense opts for secondary help, perhaps not shocking given second-year coach Dan Quinn spent so much time with the Legion of Boom in Seattle. Neal's profile has been on the rise as the pre-draft process has played out. At 6 feet and 211 pounds, he could fill the hybrid safety/linebacker role that's come into the vogue in recent years and give Atlanta the kind of playmaker it's been lacking at the second and third levels.\n\n18. Indianapolis Colts – Ryan Kelly, C, Alabama: With the top tackles off the board, GM Ryan Grigson opts to address the interior of an offensive line that has to be better in front of QB Andrew Luck. Kelly should not only ensure that Luck doesn't take as many hits as he did during an injury-aborted 2015 season, but he'll also be an asset to a ground game that hasn't finished better than 20th since Luck, Grigson and coach Chuck Pagano arrived four years ago.\n\n19. Buffalo Bills – Shaq Lawson, DE, Clemson: He essentially lives in opposing backfields, whether it's bagging quarterbacks or chucking runners for losses. Lawson might have gone higher if not for a shoulder injury that may have affected his stock. Still, he's a relentless player who should be a welcome replacement for departed Mario Williams, who never bought into Rex Ryan's disappointing defense a year ago, and his play reflected it. (And is it any surprise that Ryan, whose son went to Clemson, picked a Tiger?)\n\n20. New York Jets – Darron Lee, LB, Ohio State: The Jets eschew a potential solution to their quarterback quandary — Memphis QB Paxton Lynch was available here — for Lee, a linebacker with tremendous range and athleticism. He'll likely replace departed Demario Davis on the inside and learn alongside grizzled team captain David Harris, who's begun to slow down after nine years in the league. Lee could also provide a nice solution for a team that's forever trying to design ways to negate Patriots TE Rob Gronkowski.\n\n21. Houston Texans (from Washington Redskins) – Will Fuller, WR, Notre Dame: Houston pops up one place, ensuring the acquisition of Fuller, who had the fastest 40 time (4.32 seconds) of any wideout at the scouting combine. He won't necessarily catch a lot of passes in 2016, but Fuller will immediately stretch defenses, opening up space for Pro Bowl WR DeAndre Hopkins to operate while unloading run-heavy boxes for speedy RB Lamar Miller. But when Fuller does get behind the deep safety, new franchise QB Brock Osweiler has the arm to take advantage of his new burner.\n\n22. Redskins (from Texans) – Josh Doctson, WR, Texas Christian: It must be assumed the Redskins adhered to their board — and Doctson may indeed emerge as this draft's best all-around receiver — to take the Horned Frogs standout instead of the linemen GM Scot McCloughan tends to favor. Doctson joins a receiving corps that already includes WRs DeSean Jackson, Pierre Garcon, Jamison Crowder, Andre Roberts and TE Jordan Reed, so this offense could be even more explosive in 2016, though questions remain about the running game (not to mention the run defense).\n\n23. Minnesota Vikings – Laquon Treadwell, WR, Mississippi: He should form a nice tandem with Stefon Diggs, who was Minnesota's leading receiver as a rookie in 2015. However at 6-2, 221 pounds, Treadwell should be a far more formidable red-zone target, perhaps the best one the Vikings have had since Randy Moss was in his prime. Treadwell isn't the swiftest player, but he runs good routes, has good hands and should elevate a passing game in a year when team brass is looking for QB Teddy Bridgewater to take the next step forward.\n\n24. Cincinnati Bengals – William Jackson III, CB, Houston: How important are corners in the modern NFL? The Bengals have now taken one in the first round in three of the past five drafts. But Jackson was always around the ball last year, leading the nation with 23 pass break-ups. That kind of production will be vital in a division where the Steelers and Ravens are expected to throw frequently.\n\n25. Pittsburgh Steelers – Artie Burns, CB, Miami (Fla.): It was pretty obvious Pittsburgh would take a corner after allowing the most passing yards in the AFC last year as well as 29 TDs through the air. Burns isn't polished, but his upside is tantalizing. And at 6-feet and 193 pounds, he has the size to match up with bigger wideouts like A.J. Green when his ability catches up to his potential.\n\n26. Denver Broncos (from Seattle Seahawks) – Paxton Lynch, QB, Memphis: GM John Elway vaulted up five spots to finally secure the presumed successor for Peyton Manning. At 6-7, 244 pounds, Lynch has size similar to departed Denver QB Brock Osweiler but is an even better athlete. Expect Lynch to marinate behind newly acquired veteran Mark Sanchez in the short run. But even when he is deemed ready to play — and his mobility makes him a great fit for Gary Kubiak's offense, which often puts the quarterback on the move — Lynch won't have to assume a huge burden on a defensively oriented team that also runs the ball well.\n\n27. Green Bay Packers – Kenny Clark, DL, UCLA: The Pack haven't featured a top-10 defense since they won the Super Bowl following the 2010 season. Clark provides some help for DE Mike Daniels on Green Bay's three-man front, which lost NT B.J. Raji to retirement this offseason and only ranked 21st against the run last season.\n\n28. 49ers (from Kansas City Chiefs) – Joshua Garnett, G, Stanford: The Niners pop back into Round 1 to pluck this draft's first guard off the board. San Francisco scored the fewest points in the league last year and chooses to begin addressing that issue inside after losing G Alex Boone to free agency. Better interior blocking should only prove beneficial to RB Carlos Hyde and whomever new coach Chip Kelly settles on as his quarterback, which increasingly seems to be Colin Kaepernick.\n\n29. Arizona Cardinals – Robert Nkemdiche, DL, Mississippi: Outstanding value considering his talent warranted a much higher selection. But off-field red flags and questions about his work ethic send Nkemdiche to Arizona, where he'll find a coach, Bruce Arians, who believes in second chances and a new teammate, Tyrann Mathieu, who has benefited from exactly that philosophy. From a pure football perspective, Nkemdiche could be a devastating bookend to Pro Bowl DE Calais Campbell and may remind Cards fans of former stalwart Darnell Dockett if he harnesses his significant ability.\n\n30. Carolina Panthers – Vernon Butler, DT, Louisana Tech: GM Dave Gettleman has professed his love for \"hog mollies,\" and Butler has transcendent size (6-4, 323) and ability for a defense that relies on its front seven. Butler also provides an insurance policy given starting DTs Kawann Short and Star Lotulelei will both soon require new contracts.\n\n31. Seahawks (from Broncos) – Germain Ifedi, OL, Texas A&M: Seattle makes its first Round 1 selection since 2012, going with Ifedi, who could settle in at tackle or guard. Either way, the Seahawks had to replenish an O-line that has lost all five starters from the 2013 championship team over the past two offseasons. And with Tom Cable on hand as his position coach, it's likely Ifedi's talent will be maximized soon enough.\n\nNote: New England Patriots were stripped of their first-round pick for their alleged role in Deflategate\n\nRound 2\n\n32. Cleveland Browns – Emmanuel Ogbah, DE, Oklahoma State: The Browns kick off the second round by opting for pass rush. Ogbah had 22½ sacks over the past two seasons. Cleveland had all of 29 last year and is still trying to recover from 2013 first-round disappointment Barkevious Mingo.\n\n33. Tennessee Titans – Kevin Dodd, DE, Clemson: Sense a theme? Another edge player goes at the top of the round. Dodd was nearly as productive as Tigers teammate Shaq Lawson in 2015, constantly harassing quarterbacks and ball carriers. He might begin his pro career in sub packages behind starting Titans OLBs Brian Orakpo and Derrick Morgan.\n\n34. Dallas Cowboys – Jaylon Smith, LB, Notre Dame: Stunner. Dallas throws caution to the wind, taking Smith, arguably the most-talented player in the draft. The Irish star can play inside or out and cover nearly the entire field — when healthy. Of course, he tore two knee ligaments and suffered nerve damage in his leg during January's Fiesta Bowl. He likely won't play in 2016, but the Cowboys might have found an all-pro caliber player for 2017 and beyond. Smith had more than 100 tackles and double-digit tackles for loss each of the past two seasons.\n\n35. San Diego Chargers – Hunter Henry, TE, Arkansas: The top tight end in the draft goes to San Diego, where he can learn from Antonio Gates, a near lock for the Hall of Fame but quite possibly entering his final NFL season. Henry's a solid receiver and decent enough blocker.\n\n36. Jaguars (from Baltimore Ravens) – Myles Jack, LB, UCLA: Many thought the Jags would take Jack in Round 1. They end up trading to get him in the second round, and the defense that surrendered the most points in the AFC in 2015 suddenly has two elite playmakers in Jack and first-round DB Jalen Ramsey (not to mention 2015 first-round DE Dante Fowler, who missed his rookie season with a knee injury). Of course, if not for concerns about a degenerative knee condition, Jack might have gone 30 spots higher.\n\n37. Kansas City Chiefs (from San Francisco 49ers) – Chris Jones, DT, Mississippi State: Kansas City's first pick of the 2016 draft is Jones, an uber-promising lineman, but one who's been criticized for not giving full effort every play. He joins a D-line that could lose NT Dontari Poe in a year to free agency and parted with retired DE Mike DeVito this offseason.\n\n38. Miami Dolphins (from Ravens via Jaguars) – Xavien Howard, CB, Baylor: Miami gets another big corner in Howard (6-0, 201) to team with 6-1, 207-pound veteran Byron Maxwell, whom they acquired from the Eagles last month. Could be a nice countermove when facing a team like the division rival Jets, who start two of the NFL's bigger receivers in Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker.\n\n39. Tampa Bay Buccaneers – Noah Spence, OLB/DE, Eastern Kentucky: Might have first-round talent, but character questions from his days at Ohio State and a slow 40 time (4.8) hurt him. But Spence is a productive player, and his drug tests have all come back clean recently. He can certainly help in Tampa, where most of the team's pass rush comes inside courtesy of Pro Bowl DT Gerald McCoy. And pressure is key in the NFC South, where every team starts a stud quarterback.\n\n40. New York Giants – Sterling Shepard, WR, Oklahoma: If WR Victor Cruz is unable to get back to his previous form after 2014's horrific knee injury, there's a good chance Shepard can replace his production. Shepard is excellent out of the slot and should see a lot of balls from QB Eli Manning when Odell Beckham isn't open.\n\n41. Buffalo Bills (from Chicago Bears) – Reggie Ragland, ILB, Alabama: Finally, the Tide defenders begin coming off the board. Rex Ryan wasn't able to bring ILB David Harris with him from the Jets, but he might have found a similar talent in Ragland, who should be a very reliable, if not flashy, performer. The question Ragland will have to answer is whether he can handle coverage responsibilities on passing downs in a division where Rob Gronkowski often roams wild.\n\n42. Ravens (from Dolphins) – Kamalei Correa, OLB, Boise State: A nice edge player who had 31 tackles for loss in 2014, including 12 sacks. He probably starts his NFL career as a situational player on passing downs, but GM Ozzie Newsome needed to start planning for life after OLBs Terrell Suggs and Elvis Dumervil retire.\n\n43. Titans (from Philadelphia Eagles via Los Angeles Rams) – Austin Johnson, DL, Penn State: GM Jon Robinson continues rebuilding his defense Friday night with Johnson, who joins a unit that ranked 18th against the run last year. But Johnson can also get to the quarterback from inside, posting 6½ sacks last year.\n\n44. Oakland Raiders – Jihad Ward, DL, Illinois: He may not make a ton of splash plays, but that's what Khalil Mack is for in Oakland. Ward is a hustler who should be able to set the edge or play inside and fills depth for a team that lost DE Justin Tuck to retirement.\n\n45. Titans (from Rams) – Derrick Henry, RB, Alabama: The Heisman Trophy winner, fresh off a 2,219-yard season, heads to Nashville to pair up with DeMarco Murray in Tennessee's new-look backfield. Henry is a better receiver than he showed at Alabama and is pure north-south, almost always getting positive yardage. A team that ranked 25th rushing the ball in 2015 should be much better.\n\n46. Detroit Lions – A’Shawn Robinson, DT, Alabama: Detroit is a year removed from losing DTs Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley to free agency, and Haloti Ngata, 32, only has so many snaps left. Robinson, 21, though he looks 41, could be a defensive cornerstone. He can shut down run lanes and also tie up blocks on passing downs, which should help turn loose DE Ziggy Ansah off the edge.\n\n47. New Orleans Saints – Michael Thomas, WR, Ohio State: Keyshawn Johnson's nephew has excellent tools, including a 6-3, 212-pound frame. QB Drew Brees will appreciate having a big target to replace departed WR Marques Colston. Thomas had 110 catches and 18 TDs over the past two seasons for the Buckeyes.\n\n48. Green Bay Packers (from Indianapolis Colts) – Jason Spriggs, T, Indiana: GM Ted Thompson moves up nine slots for Spriggs, who may be the left tackle of the future in front of Aaron Rodgers, who was sacked 46 times in 2015. Spriggs is an exceptional athlete for a 6-6, 301-pound man.\n\n49. Seattle Seahawks (from Bears via Bills) – Jarran Reed, DT, Alabama: Pete Carroll and GM John Schneider bolt up the board seven spots for the final high-profile member of the Tide's vaunted defense. Reed helps Seattle reload a D-line that lost longtime DT Brandon Mebane to the Chargers in free agency. Reed should step in immediately as a likely starter on the base defense.\n\n50. Houston Texans (from Atlanta Falcons) – Nick Martin, C, Notre Dame: A plug-and-play center — Martin is the brother of Cowboys all-pro G Zack Martin — who could take over immediately for departed free agent C Ben Jones.\n\n51. New York Jets – Christian Hackenberg, QB, Penn State: He's the 11th quarterback the Jets have picked since 2000. Hackenberg has exceptional physical tools, but his accuracy and decision making seemed to steadily deteriorate after his stellar freshman year, when he played for Bill O'Brien. Though the Jets have yet to re-sign QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, there's probably little chance Hackenberg plays in 2016, when he'll likely be tied to the hip of OC Chan Gailey. Geno Smith, the team's second rounder in 2013, is starting to look like the stopgap.\n\n52. Falcons (from Texans) – Deion Jones, LB, LSU: After taking Florida S Keanu Neal on Thursday, the Falcons get another athletic, hybrid type player for their defense. Jones is 6-1, 222 pounds, but he brings the ranginess this unit lacked at the second level in recent years.\n\n53. Washington Redskins – Su’a Cravens, LB/S, Southern California: Yet another safety/linebacker 'tweener that every team seems to want now. Washington's bigger needs appear to be secondary, where DeAngelo Hall is moving into the deep safety role. But Cravens could definitely take over at strong safety and move into a linebacker role in sub packages.\n\n54. Minnesota Vikings – Mackensie Alexander, CB, Clemson: A gifted corner who could give the Vikes a nice, long-term tandem with 2015 first rounder Trae Waynes. Minnesota is extremely deep here now with Xavier Rhodes, Captain Munnerlyn and aging Terence Newman. Alexander does need to learn to find the ball better after failing to pick off a pass at Clemson.\n\n55. Cincinnati Bengals – Tyler Boyd, WR, Pittsburgh: He rewrote the record book at Pitt. Boyd could step in as a nice third option for QB Andy Dalton behind A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert. Cincinnati really had to get a wideout after losing Mohamed Sanu and Marvin Jones during free agency.\n\n56. Bears (from Seahawks) – Cody Whitehair, G, Kansas State: He should immediately push veteran LG Matt Slauson for a starting job. Chicago still appears to need help at left tackle, but the rest of the O-line seems to be taking shape nicely — good news for QB Jay Cutler and new starting RB Jeremy Langford.\n\n57. Colts (from Packers) – T.J. Green, DB, Clemson: Indianapolis might have an open competition for its second and third corner jobs behind Vontae Davis. And those are especially key roles considering the Texans (DeAndre Hopkins/Will Fuller) and Jaguars (Allen Robinson/Allen Hurns) will be rolling out scary wideout tandems. Depending on where he's most effective, Green could also finding himself playing safety alongside Mike Adams.\n\n58. Pittsburgh Steelers – Sean Davis, DB, Maryland: The Steelers continue bolstering the AFC's worst pass defense a night after taking CB Artie Burns in Round 1.\n\n59. Buccaneers (from Chiefs) – Roberto Aguayo, K, Florida State: He becomes the highest-drafted kicker since Mike Nugent in 2005. The NFL's lengthened extra point has put new emphasis on the play, now effectively a 33-yard attempt. Aguayo was perfect on his 198 PATs in college. More pertinent, the 2013 Lou Groza Award winner was 69-for-78 (88.5%) on field-goal tries and didn’t miss on any of his 49 attempts inside 40 yards. Aguayo, QB Jameis Winston's teammate at FSU, expressed a desire to play for the Bucs and seems likely to hold the job for years to come.\n\n60. New England Patriots – Cyrus Jones, CB, Alabama: The Pats take Jones (5-10, 197), who looks like an ideal nickelback, and can also return punts.\n\n61. Saints (from Arizona Cardinals via Patriots) – Vonn Bell, S, Ohio State: New Orleans comes up 17 spots for Bell, perhaps the best coverage safety in the draft. It's worth wondering if this should signal a warning to starters Kenny Vaccaro and Jairus Byrd on a defense that gave up a league record 45 TD passes in 2015.\n\n62. Carolina Panthers – James Bradberry, CB, Samford: Maybe the 6-1, 211-pounder gets first crack at the job opened up by the departure of CB Josh Norman, Carolina's former franchise player. Bradberry's size should help him combat players like Julio Jones, Mike Evans, Vincent Jackson and, now, Michael Thomas in the NFC South.\n\n63. Denver Broncos – Adam Gotsis, DT, Georgia Tech: A new asset for a D-line that lost Malik Jackson in free agency. Gotsis likely won't provide Jackson's ability, but he's long (6-4, 287) and tough, especially on run downs, and could crack the rotation in short order.\n\nRound 3\n\n64. Titans – Kevin Byard, S, Middle Tennessee: Could compete to start after longtime S Michael Griffin moved on to Minnesota.\n\n65. Browns – Carl Nassib, DE, Penn State: Is he a linebacker or a defensive end for Cleveland's 3-4 defense? One thing is for sure, Nassib, the younger brother of Giants QB Ryan Nassib, can rush passers after collecting 15½ sacks last year.\n\n66. Chargers – Max Tuerk, C, Southern California: The Bolts take a step to fortify an O-line that couldn't protect QB Philip Rivers or get the AFC's worst ground game going in 2015. Tuerk, who's played guard and tackle, too, has a reputation as a highly intelligent player, though knee problems have been an issue.\n\n67. Cowboys – Maliek Collins, DT, Nebraska: He won't solve Dallas' pass-rush deficiencies, but depth issues on the interior line are only slightly less worrisome.\n\n68. 49ers – Will Redmond, CB, Mississippi State: A once-loaded Niners secondary clearly needed help at corner after ranking 27th against the pass in 2015. Redmond has high upside if healthy.\n\n69. Jaguars – Yannick Ngakoue, DE, Maryland: Jacksonville only had 36 sacks in 2015, not a good total in a division with mobile QBs like Andrew Luck and Marcus Mariota. Ngakoue had 13 sacks last year for the Terps, and the Jags would gladly take half that production.\n\n70. Ravens – Bronson Kaufusi, DE, BYU: He should plug in as a five-technique for a defense that needs an injection of youth. The 6-7, 285 pounder collected 17 sacks over the last two seasons.\n\n71. Giants – Darian Thompson, S, Boise State: The Giants could be set at safety now after taking Landon Collins atop the second round last year. The league's worst pass defense definitely needed added reinforcements despite the $200 million spending spree in free agency.\n\n72. Bears – Jonathan Bullard, DL, Florida: Should be a nice addition to the line of Vic Fangio's defense. He had 18 tackles for loss last year and should create havoc inside while OLBs Pernell McPhee and rookie Leonard Floyd do damage off the edge.\n\n73. Dolphins – Kenyan Drake, RB, Alabama: He's been stuck behind Derrick Henry and T.J. Yeldon in recent years for 'Bama but now could split carries with Jay Ajayi for a team that's seemed desperate for backfield help.\n\n74. Chiefs (from Buccaneers) – KeiVarae Russell, DB, Notre Dame: Kansas City lost CB Sean Smith in free agency and S Husain Abdullah to retirement, so there's definitely a spot for Russell in this secondary, which had 22 INTs a year ago and features Pro Bowl S Eric Berry and defensive rookie of the year Marcus Peters. Russell could swing between safety and nickelback depending on the offense he's facing.\n\n75. Raiders – Shilique Calhoun, DE, Michigan State: This team is suddenly scary on passing downs. Calhoun joins DE Khalil Mack, LB Bruce Irvin and, eventually, LB Aldon Smith, for a team that had just 38 sacks in 2015, 15 courtesy of Mack.\n\n76. Browns (from Titans via Rams) – Shon Coleman, T, Auburn: This leukemia survivor is a heartwarming story who now finds himself in the pros. He could also find himself starting at right tackle after Cleveland let Mitchell Schwartz go in free agency.\n\n77. Panthers (from Eagles via Lions and Browns) – Daryl Worley, CB, West Virginia: Carolina has now taken two corners in the last 16 picks, so apparently there will be open tryouts for Josh Norman's job. Worley had nine INTs for the Mountaineers over the last two seasons.\n\n78. Patriots (from Saints) – Joe Thuney, OL, North Carolina State: He's big (6-5, 304), can play tackle, can play guard ... sounds like a Patriot — and they need O-line depth considering what happened late last year.\n\n79. Eagles – Isaac Seumalo, OL, Oregon State: Played center, guard and tackle for the Beavers. He's unlikely to displace Philly C Jason Kelce any time soon, but he's got the athleticism to do so eventually. If Seumalo is to crack the lineup early, it will probably be at guard.\n\n80. Bills – Adolphus Washington, DT, Ohio State: A versatile lineman who should be a nice fit for the defense of Rex Ryan, who loves players with diverse skill sets. And don't forget that aging DT Kyle Williams is coming off a serious knee injury.\n\n81. Falcons – Austin Hooper, TE, Stanford: QB Matt Ryan struggled last year, so apparently it was high time to finally replace TE Tony Gonzalez — not that Hooper is the next coming of the all-time great. Still he'll add a nice element to this offense.\n\n82. Colts – Le'Raven Clark, T, Texas Tech: Good value here. Indianapolis' O-line continues to get better after adding C Ryan Kelly on Thursday. Clark provides talent and experience after starting his last 51 games for the Red Raiders.\n\n83. Jets – Jordan Jenkins, LB, Georgia: The ongoing search for an edge presence continues in New York. Jenkins might be a quietly productive player in a similar mold to longtime Jets OLB Calvin Pace, whose career finally seems over.\n\n84. Redskins – Kendall Fuller, CB, Virginia Tech: The fourth member of the Fuller clan to reach the NFL, Kyle's younger brother could be a steal for the 'Skins, who continue to upgrade a shaky defense. A knee injury ruined Fuller's final season with the Hokies, but he could emerge as a very good player, one who probably would have been drafted much higher with a clean medical chart.\n\n85. Texans – Braxton Miller, WR, Ohio State: The Buckeyes' former quarterback is raw as a receiver but not short on ability. At 6-1, 201, he has good size and caught 25 passes last year. He still needs to learn the nuances of the position, specifically route running, but the two-time Big Ten offensive player of the year has very good speed (4.5 in the 40) and could develop into something special.\n\n86. Dolphins (from Vikings) – Leonte Carroo, WR, Rutgers: Another speedy player joins a Miami wideout corps that landed Jarvis Landry two years ago and DeVante Parker in 2015. QB Ryan Tannehill will have no shortage of weapons.\n\n87. Bengals – Nick Vigil, LB, Utah State: Cincinnati gets younger at the position after recently cutting A.J. Hawk. And don't forget Vontaze Burfict will start next season with a three-game suspension. Certainly an opportunity for Vigil to carve a niche in this defense quickly.\n\n88. Packers – Kyler Fackrell, LB, Utah State: A run on Aggies continues with Fackrell, who could find avenues to quarterbacks assuming OLB Clay Matthews continues to demand double teams and top blockers. Fackrell is also solid in coverage, so he might get a look inside as Matthews has.\n\n89. Steelers – Javon Hargrave, DL, South Carolina State: At 6-1, 309 pounds, he'll surely get a tryout at nose tackle in Pittsburgh, which has been looking for a long-term answer in the middle since Casey Hampton hung up his cleats.\n\n90. Seahawks – C.J. Prosise, RB, Notre Dame: He converted from wideout to tailback in his final season with the Irish and wound up rushing for 1,000 yards. He may not be ready to pass block as a rookie, but he certainly could be a change-of-pace guy behind Thomas Rawls and should quickly earn QB Russell Wilson's trust as a receiving outlet.\n\n91. Patriots – Jacoby Brissett, QB, N.C. State: Intriguing. Jimmy Garoppolo is under contract for two more years, but the Pats may already be looking ahead since Tom Brady swears he'll play into his forties. With Brady facing a probable four-game suspension to start the 2016 season, maybe this is the year New England carries three passers on its 53-man roster. Brissett threw for 43 TDs against 11 INTs the last two years for the Wolfpack after transferring from Florida. At 6-4, 231, he has Brady-esque size and arm strength but is a better athlete.\n\n92. Cardinals – Brandon Williams, CB, Texas A&M: He makes logical sense for no other reason than CBs Patrick Peterson, Tyrann Mathieu and Justin Bethel are all recovering from surgery. Williams may have to earn meaningful snaps as a dime back.\n\n93. Browns (from Panthers) – Cody Kessler, QB, Southern California: While Connor Cook continues to languish, Cleveland takes Kessler, who could be solid if unspectacular as a pro, as a potential backup to Robert Griffin III.\n\n94. Seahawks (from Broncos) – Nick Vannett, TE, Ohio State: Buckeyes keep coming off the board. Vannett should be a nice combo tight end for Seattle, but he could find himself frequently blocking in double-tight sets since Jimmy Graham will get priority as a downfield receiver.\n\n95. Lions (compensatory selection) – Graham Glasgow, C, Michigan: The Wolverine remains in Michigan and could get a shot to compete inside on an O-line that's been getting a needed makeover the last two days.\n\n96. Patriots (compensatory selection) – Vincent Valentine, DT, Nebraska: At 6-4, 329 pounds, he could be next up to get a shot at filling Vince Wilfork's massive shoes, especially in light of the recent release of 2014 first-round DT Dominique Easley.\n\n97. Seahawks (compensatory selection) – Rees Odhiambo, OL, Boise State: Seattle takes its second lineman of the draft as a needed rebuild continues. Like first rounder Germain Ifedi, Odhiambo could get a look at tackle and guard.\n\n98. Broncos (compensatory selection) – Justin Simmons, S, Boston College: Probably starts out as a special teamer — remember, former ace David Bruton is now a Redskin — and could be a candidate to replace starter Darian Stewart in 2017.\n\nNote: The Chiefs forfeited their third-round pick for tampering with then-free agent WR Jeremy Maclin during the 2015 offseason\n\nRound 4\n\n99. Browns: Joe Schobert, LB, Wisconsin\n\n100. Raiders (from Browns via Eagles, Titans): Connor Cook, QB, Michigan State\n\n101. Cowboys: Charles Tapper, DE, Oklahoma\n\n102. Chargers: Josh Perry, LB, Ohio State\n\n103. Jaguars: Sheldon Day, DT, Notre Dame\n\n104. Ravens: Tavon Young, CB, Temple\n\n105. Chiefs (from 49ers): Parker Ehinger, G, Cincinnati\n\n106. Chiefs (from Buccaneers via Bears): Eric Murray, CB, Minnesota\n\n107. Ravens (from Dolphins): Chris Moore, WR, Cincinnati\n\n108. Buccaneers: Ryan Smith, CB, North Carolina Central\n\n109. Giants: B.J. Goodson, LB, Clemson\n\n110. Rams: Tyler Higbee, TE, Western Kentucky\n\n111. Lions: Miles Killebrew, S, Southern Utah\n\n112. Patriots (from Saints): Malcolm Mitchell, WR, Georgia\n\n113. Bears (from Titans via Eagles and Rams): Nick Kwiatkoski, LB, West Virginia\n\n114. Browns (from Raiders): Ricardo Louis, WR, Auburn\n\n115. Falcons: De'Vondre Campbell, LB, Minnesota\n\n116. Colts: Hassan Ridgeway, DT, Texas\n\n117. Rams (from Bills via Bears): Pharoh Cooper, WR, South Carolina\n\n118. Jets: Juston Burris, CB, North Carolina State\n\n119. Texans: Tyler Ervin, RB, San Jose State\n\n120. Saints (from Redskins): David Onyemata, DT, Manitoba\n\n121. Vikings: Willie Beavers, T, Western Michigan\n\n122. Bengals: Andrew Billings, DT, Baylor\n\n123. Steelers: Jerald Hawkins, T, LSU\n\n124. Bears (from Seahawks): Deon Bush, S, Miami (Fla.)\n\n125. Colts (from Packers): Antonio Morrison, LB, Florida\n\n126. Chiefs: Demarcus Robinson, WR, Florida\n\n127.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/14/trash-pigs-unabomber-cabin-weighty-avocado-news-around-states/40314339/", "title": "Trash for pigs, Unabomber cabin: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: A new, $21 million aerospace facility has opened. The Huntsville-based Dynetics will use the center in Decatur to assist with the design, construction and testing of large structures in one place. The company marked the opening last week. The Decatur Daily reports Dynetics will perform structural and acoustic testing for the Vulcan Centaur rocket developed by United Launch Alliance. It will also build a section of NASA’s new heavy-lift rocket that’s being constructed to send humans to deep space. The facility is located in what was once a cotton field. Completed projects can be transported by ground, rail or water because of the location near the Tennessee River. Dynetics spokeswoman Kristina Hendrix says the company has nearly 2,000 workers in north Alabama.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A young Alaska Native woman left an impression on the now-state’s territorial Senate in 1945, delivering a speech that led to the passage of the nation’s first anti-discrimination law. Now, the late Elizabeth Peratrovich is leaving her impression on a $1 coin, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The U.S. Mint unveiled the design of the coin Oct. 5 at the Alaska Native Brotherhood and Alaska Native Sisterhood convention in Anchorage. The 2020 Native American coin, which will go on sale early next year, will feature a portrait of the late civil rights leader – composed and graceful, her hair in tight rolls – above words that highlight her legacy: “Anti-discrimination Law of 1945.” An image of a raven, depicting her Tlingit lineage, soars near her.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Two decades after it was approved by the state’s voters, a law mandating an English-only education for non-native speakers may get repealed in 2020. The Arizona Capitol Times reports Democratic Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman intends to make a repeal a priority, an idea getting support from some Republicans as well. Known as Proposition 203, the 2000 ballot measure forced English-language learners to speak only English and spend a year in immersion classes. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say recent data indicates the English-only approach is not easing students’ struggles. According to the state Department of Education, the 2017 graduation rate of students with limited English proficiency was about 40%. Critics say non-native speakers end up lagging in their other classes while struggling with learning English.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state House voted Friday to expel a member who pleaded no contest to not paying his state income taxes, making him the first person kicked out of that chamber since the 1800s. Lawmakers voted 88-4 to oust Republican state Rep. Mickey Gates, easily eclipsing the two-thirds vote threshold in the majority-GOP House to expel someone. Gates, who was arrested last year and charged with not filing returns from 2012 through 2017, pleaded no contest in July to one count of not filing or paying income taxes and was sentenced to six months of probation. Republican Speaker Matthew Shepherd sought Gates’ removal after he refused to resign. Gates invoked Jesus, the Titanic and the integration of Central High School during a 25-minute speech before the chamber, telling colleagues they were being asked to make a decision before a final ruling in his case.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will become the first in the nation to require public universities to offer abortion medication at campus health centers starting in 2023 under legislation signed Friday by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Democratic lawmakers described the law as California’s latest step to defend abortion access as Republican-led states roll back access to the services. Newsom’s predecessor, fellow Democrat Jerry Brown, vetoed similar legislation last year, arguing it wasn’t necessary because abortion services were readily available off campus. The law relies on private donations, not state dollars, to pay for the setup and services. The state hopes to raise more than $10 million. The process requires taking two pills and is an option for women who are less than 10 weeks pregnant.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Lawmakers have advanced a proposal to place fewer convicted juveniles on the state sex offender registry and partially seal the list from the public. The Denver Post reports that research shows harshly penalizing juvenile sex offenders has done nothing to improve public safety or rehabilitate the offenders. Officials say the draft was endorsed Thursday by an interim committee of lawmakers tasked with considering changes to how the state justice system treats people with mental illness. Officials say the proposal would also partially seal the registry, meaning the public would still be allowed to request information about people, but the complete list would no longer be publicly available except for some public entities like schools. Officials say the draft was voted to be introduced next year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is suing federal immigration enforcement over the refusal to honor Connecticut’s pardon system when it comes to immigration. In a lawsuit filed Thursday, Attorney General William Tong argued officials have abandoned decades of practice and singled out the state for “deeply unequal” treatment by refusing to recognize state pardons. Federal immigration officials contend a pardon needs to come from the governor or the president under a waiver program. In Connecticut, pardon board members are appointed by the governor. In July, Tong argued that federal immigration authorities have started the process to deport some state residents with past criminal records even though their crimes were pardoned by the state’s Board of Pardons and Paroles.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In a small state with about 25 independent breweries already, some think the First State’s craft boom must slow down soon. But beer makers apparently haven’t received the memo. Since the spring, a handful of new breweries and brewpubs have already opened, including Autumn Arch Beer Project near Glasgow and Brick Works Brewing and Eats in Long Neck, a spin-off of its Smyrna location. In the next couple of months, three new major breweries are expected to open in New Castle and Sussex counties, with several other groups working to get their nascent brewhouses up and running in the months after that. Delaware limits any single licensee to no more than three brewpubs in the state, curbing expansions by existing breweries.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than 35,000 people gathered near the Pentagon on Sunday to take part in the Army Ten-Miler, one of the biggest races in the world, an Army spokesperson said. This year marked the 35th year of the race, which highlights the important work over 1 million soldiers around the world do every day, WUSA-TV reports. The Ten-Miler started off with fanfare, and the Golden Knights – Army parachuters – descended from the sky, landing right outside the Pentagon. The Ten-Miler has grown in its 35th year. More than 420,000 runners from across the world have participated since its inception in 1985, according to the event’s website. The race was led by wounded warriors. The winner finished the race in under an hour.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A new camera that uses special wavelengths of light could help the state in its fight against the invasive Burmese python. Researchers at the University of Central Florida and the nonprofit company Imec developed the camera to help expose the snake. The python is typically very difficult to detect because of its camouflage markings. Thermal imaging doesn’t work because pythons are cold-blooded and adopt the temperature of their surroundings. The Palm Beach Post reports that researchers plan to attach a drone that will allow the camera to identify a python and alert the hunter. Wildlife officials recently tripled their python budget to nearly $1 million. Officials say pythons are destroying the Everglades’ ecosystem.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A black fighter pilot who fought for the French Foreign Legion during World War I is being honored with a statue at Robins Air Force Base. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that the bronze statue of Eugene Bullard was unveiled Wednesday. Bullard was from Georgia but went to Europe in the early 20th century after his father was nearly lynched. He joined France’s air service after fighting the Germans during World War I. The U.S. military was segregated at the time and would not accept him as a pilot because of his race. But Bullard in 1994 was posthumously commissioned second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A family has won a place with the Guinness World Records for the world’s heaviest avocado. The Pokini family from the island of Maui received the Guinness certificate last week for the avocado weighing 5.6 pounds, The Maui News reports. The average avocado weighs about 6 ounces, according to Guinness officials. The Pokini family’s avocado tree is more than 10 years old and 20 feet tall. Mark Pokini planted it when his son was born, using a seed from his brother-in-law’s tree on Oahu island, he said. Mark and Juliane Pokini and their son, Loihi, applied in December for the Guinness recognition involving a tough verification process by the company known as the chronicler of the world’s record achievements.\n\nIdaho\n\nPost Falls: A 1,000-pound steer named Carlos who charmed area residents in northern Idaho has avoided a trip to the slaughterhouse after neighbors raised money to buy him. The Coeur d’Alene Press reports that neighbors of Bill Guy’s farm in west Post Falls raised $1,100 to purchase the well-known steer. “Save Carlos” campaign organizer Alisha Kreissig says 4-year-old Carlos comes when called, enjoys being petted, and loves apples, lettuce and most of all the grass clippings from lawns. Carlos is one of three steers raised by Guy, with the others already sold for slaughter. Carlos will remain living at Guy’s farm as part of the deal, with additional money from the “Save Carlos” fund paying for hay for Carlos.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City officials are considering an increase in ride-hailing fees for solo riders traveling downtown, in a move aimed at reducing traffic congestion. Mayor Lori Lightfoot told a local radio station Thursday in a prerecorded broadcast that she will recommend the “short-term” plan to give breaks to passengers who pool their rides. The mayor says a substantial number of single-occupancy riders on Uber, Lyft and Via come to the Central Business District from the North Side. Lightfoot notes cars are subsequently “idling around” there while drivers wait for another call, while the South and West Sides remain “a bit of a transportation desert.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indianapolis Zoo is using a $4million startup grant to open an international center devoted to saving threatened species. Zoo officials call the center a natural extension of their biennial Indianapolis Prize, which honors animal conservation leaders. The center is a partnership between the zoo and the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Species Survival Commission. The two signed a deal last week to establish the center. The zoo received the funding to support the fledgling center from Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment Inc. The Global Center for Species Survival is expected to open in 2020. The center will employ a team of nine experts in Indianapolis who will work with more than 9,000 wildlife experts around the world.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: A high school science teacher has resigned after an investigation into a social media post that appeared to threaten Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Waterloo Community Schools spokeswoman Tara Thomas said Friday that teacher Matt Baish resigned effective Thursday. The resignation came after the conclusion on a school district investigation of a Facebook comment Baish made in response to a post about the 16-year-old Thunberg joining an Oct. 4 student-led climate strike in Iowa City. In his comment, the Waterloo West High School teacher wrote, “Dont have my sniper rifle.” Thomas wouldn’t say if Baish was asked to resign. Strikers in Iowa City demanded the University of Iowa and the city agree to a “Town-Gown Climate Accord,” which calls for both entities to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2030 and asks the university to cease burning coal at its power plant.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A national outbreak of a vaping-related lung illness is increasing pressure in the state to consider new regulations for vaping and tobacco products. Federal health officials recently reported 1,080 confirmed and probable cases of a vaping-related lung illness. Eighteen people have died. More than two dozen Kansas cities and counties have already passed ordinances raising the age to buy nicotine products from 18 to 21. The Kansas City Star reports lawmakers and advocates say a statewide law could pass next year. Leading Kansas lawmakers on health issues say they are open to several possible regulations, including increasing the purchase age and taxes on tobacco products, as well as limiting flavors that are attractive to younger vapers.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Part of a weekend triathlon was canceled over toxic algae blooms in the Ohio River. A statement by The Ironman Group says officials determined after water testing that it was necessary to cancel the swim portion of Sunday’s 2019 Ironman Louisville for athlete safety. Participants had been set to jump into waters near Towhead Island in Louisville before entering the Ohio River’s main channel. The Kentucky Division of Water issued an advisory recently advising people to stay out of the river due to algal toxins. Contact with the blooms could cause stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, difficulty breathing, and other issues such as skin irritation and limb tingling.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Republican leaders working to oust the Deep South’s only Democratic governor are trying to put their intraparty backbiting behind them ahead of next month’s runoff. The GOP hierarchy, both nationally and locally, is seeking to unify support behind businessman Eddie Rispone against Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards in the Nov. 16 election. They’re hoping supporters of third-place finisher Ralph Abraham will shift their backing to Rispone and move past the Rispone-led attack ads that hobbled Abraham’s campaign. President Donald Trump already tweeted his support for Rispone in the head-to-head matchup, signaling other Republicans should do the same. Edwards was forced into the runoff election in his ruby red state when he didn’t receive more than 50% of the vote in Saturday’s primary, amid a six-candidate field.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state has decided eating like a pig could be a good thing, especially for schools looking to cut down on food waste. A law saying schools can give food scraps away to pig farmers is now on the books. The practice of feeding human food waste to pigs goes back millennia, but some school districts in Maine have expressed confusion in recent years about the rules around the practice, so the Legislature passed a clarifying bill. The new standards will help school districts find a use for spoiled food that might otherwise end up in landfills, supporters say. Donations to hog farmers will also help districts reduce the cost of waste disposal, said Ryan Parker, a Newport resident and farmer who advocated for the bill. Parker has raised pigs of his own and said his hogs were happy to indulge on old milk.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A judge in the case of a man charged with killing five people at a newspaper directed attorneys Friday to avoid referring to his mental health or his plea of not criminally responsible in the first phase of his trial. Prosecutors asked Judge Laura Ripken to preclude any discussion about the mental health of Jarrod Ramos in the first part of his trial, when jurors will be asked to determine whether he committed the crimes in the June 2018 shooting at the Capital Gazette. Ramos has pleaded not guilty and not criminally responsible, which is Maryland’s version of an insanity defense. If he is found guilty in the first phase of the trial, a second phase will be held for jurors to decide whether he is not criminally responsible due to his mental health.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: New England’s second-largest city isn’t hosting a Columbus Day parade this year for the first time in more than a century. The Telegram & Gazette reports the committee that organized the Worcester parade was dissolved in December. The committee chairwoman, Judy Verdini, told the newspaper that the same people had been running the parade for the past 25 years, and no one else stepped up. She did not give a specific reason for the committee disbanding. A new committee has been formed and plans a bigger and better parade in 2020. The number of parade participants and onlookers had dwindled in recent years. The city’s first Columbus Day parade was held in 1910 as a Catholic celebration and was organized by the Knights of Columbus.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Officials in southern Michigan are warning that pesticides targeting a deadly mosquito-borne virus could kill other insects, including rare and beneficial species. The spraying to quell the alarming rise of Eastern equine encephalitis disease threatens essential pollinators such as bumblebees and the endangered Mitchell’s satyr butterfly. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources calls the butterfly “one of the world’s rarest.” Authorities have sprayed pyrethrin on more than 541,000 acres in recent weeks. The disease can cause inflammation of the brain and has killed at least four people in the state. Department spokesman John Pepin says at-risk insects living in the sprayed areas include the Mitchell’s satyr, the Silphium borer moth and Persius duskywing butterfly. Several bee species are already suffering population declines in Michigan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: At its low point in the 1950s, the state’s gray wolf population was estimated at just 400 animals. As of 2018, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources estimates more than 2,600 gray wolves are in the state. That recovery is a success story for the Endangered Species Act. But people living in areas where wolf populations have recovered aren’t necessarily celebrating that success. As wolf populations increase, so does wolf predation, a concern when the animals target livestock or pets. Those concerns have prompted Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson and Republican Rep. Pete Stauber, whose districts cover most of the wolf range in northern Minnesota, to introduce the Gray Wolf State Management Act of 2019. The bill would remove federal protection from gray wolves in the Great Lakes region, allowing states to set their own wolf policies, including allowing for hunts.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state capital and the Jackson Zoological Society are close to settling the city’s $6million lawsuit against the nonprofit organization that ran the zoo for nearly 35 years. A deal was reached Friday. It requires approval of the Jackson City Council, which meets Tuesday. The city of Jackson would get the zoo animals and would drop its demand for $6 million in unpaid water bills. The city also will drop a demand for repayment of $350,000, which it repaid to the state after the former zoo director misspent the money. The zoological society’s president, Alexander Chess, says current zoo workers will still take care of the animals. About 20 former employees are working as consultants for the city.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Mayor Lyda Krewson is weighing a proposal to use surveillance airplanes to monitor St. Louis streets and fight crime. Krewson met Thursday with the head of Persistent Surveillance Systems as privacy advocates protested outside. The company uses small airplanes fitted with a bank of cameras to fly above cities and capture footage. Krewson says she’s open to hearing about ways to address crime. But she says privacy concerns must be addressed. Persistent Surveillance planes flew over Baltimore in 2016 collecting video for police. But police grounded the craft following public outcry. The company’s pitch to St. Louis comes as local and state officials grapple with how to fight violent crime in a city that’s on pace to top last year’s total of 186 murders.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A local society has said it is interested in the cabin where the Unabomber lived after a Washington, D.C., museum announced plans to return it in 2020 to the FBI, its current owner. The Independent Record reports Theodore Kaczynski’s cabin has been on display in the Newseum since 2008, but the museum is expected to close at the end of the year amid financial issues. The FBI says it has plans to display the cabin at a museum called FBI Experience, but the Montana Historical Society has said it hopes to somehow bring the cabin back to the state. Authorities say Kaczynski built and moved into the cabin in 1971 and lived there for 25 years while orchestrating 16 attributed bombings killing three and injuring another 23 people nationwide.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: Nebraska State Fair officials are blaming heavy rains for a drop in attendance and revenue at this summer’s fair. The Grand Island Independent reports that fair executive director Lori Cox delivered the news Friday at a meeting of the State Fair Board. Attendance for the Aug. 23-Sept. 2 event was 283,468, down 10% from the 314,805 who attended last year. Officials say that led to a 12% decline in gate revenue from the previous year. Between Aug. 21 and Aug. 26, Grand Island received nearly 5 inches of rain. The rain not only dampened crowds in the first week of the fair but also inundated the fair’s grass parking lots, forcing officials to absorb the unexpected cost of shuttling people from remote parking to the fair.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The governor expressed outrage Friday and vowed to tighten control of the state’s lucrative legal marijuana marketplace in response to reports that a foreign national contributed to two top state political candidates last year in a bid to skirt rules to open a legal cannabis store. Gov. Steve Sisolak declared in a statement that there has been “lack of oversight and inaction” of the recreational and medical pot industry by the state Marijuana Enforcement Division. He also said he is commissioning a multiagency task force to “root out potential corruption or criminal influences in Nevada’s marijuana marketplace.” The Democratic governor pointed to a federal indictment made public Thursday alleging that a man identified as having “Russian roots” funneled $10,000 each to the Republican campaigns of Adam Laxalt and Wesley Duncan.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSandwich: Get your fried dough and Ferris wheel rides in while you can – the state’s fair season is ending. A dozen agriculture fairs are held every summer and fall across New Hampshire, traditionally starting with the Stratham Fair in July and ending with the Sandwich Fair, which started Friday night and ends Monday. The first Sandwich Fair in 1886 was a market day for farmers to trade and sell their cattle. The following year, a band and baby beauty contest were added, and the event attracted more than 3,000 people. This year’s schedule includes animal exhibits and shows, food and amusement park rides, music and a parade. There’s also a women’s “skillet toss” and a “gentlemen’s keg toss.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nShip Bottom: High tides and strong winds caused flooding in some parts of the Jersey shore Friday. No major problems were reported. But Sea Bright’s fire department conducted numerous rescues of people who had become stranded in floodwaters overnight Thursday into Friday morning in the particularly flood-prone community, which is wedged between the ocean and the Shrewsbury River. Ocean City and Ventnor opened schools two hours late Friday to let floodwaters subside before parents and school buses tried to navigate the roadways. And Wildwood closed a bridge into the city during the morning high tide. Parts of Long Beach Boulevard, the main road through Long Beach Island, also were impassible Friday morning because of flooding. Some low-lying neighborhoods in Atlantic City also were experiencing flooding.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state is making it easier to monitor progress on local government construction projects through a new public webpage. Launched Friday by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s administration, the capital outlay online dashboard aims to encourage efficiency and financial accountability as the state goes on a major spending spree on everything from sewers to cemeteries, museums and baseball fields. Lawmakers this year approved a $933 million infrastructure spending bill amid a surge in state government income. Most expenditures come directly from the state general fund. The new website uses color-coded charts and data spreadsheets to indicate progress on local construction as spending deadlines approach. Capital Outlay Bureau Chief Wesley Billingsley hopes greater public scrutiny will ensure state dollars are put to use quickly.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Organizers of a hip-hop festival taking place in Queens over the weekend say they dropped five rappers from the lineup at the request of police. The New York Times reports that the performers were removed from the Rolling Loud festival after a New York Police Department official sent the organizers a letter citing safety concerns if the rappers took the stage. The traveling Rolling Loud festival took place at Citi Field in Queens on Saturday and Sunday and included major acts like Wu-Tang Clan and Meek Mill. The performers who were dropped are 22Gz, Casanova, Pop Smoke, Sheff G and Don Q. The police letter said they “have been affiliated with recent acts of violence citywide.” In a statement on Instagram, Don Q blamed “misinformation.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKill Devil Hills: The National Park Service says a copper bust of aviation pioneer Orville Wright has been stolen from the Wright Brothers National Memorial in the Outer Banks. The Park Service and local law enforcement officials are investigating the case and asking the public for any information. The agency said in a statement that the monument was damaged either Saturday evening or Sunday morning. The granite base to which the bust was mounted was toppled and damaged. Anyone with information is asked to contact authorities in Dare County or the Park Service’s Investigative Services Branch at 888-653-0009. The Park Service says a portion of the park may be temporarily closed to visitors Sunday while the investigation continues. The memorial honors Wilbur and Orville Wright.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s Transportation Department reopened hundreds of miles of highways Saturday after a huge snowstorm but warned that travel remained hazardous due to severe winter conditions. Interstate 29 from Fargo to the Canadian border was reopened Saturday morning, while U.S. Highway 2 and Interstate 94 were reopened late Saturday afternoon. Authorities say secondary highways and roads in north-central North Dakota were impassable and blocked after more than 2 feet of snow fell in some areas. The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning Friday for northern North Dakota and winter storm warnings and watches elsewhere in the state and into parts of South Dakota and Minnesota through Saturday afternoon. Forecasters say conditions are expected to gradually improve.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The plan for a statue of a local civil rights leader is in progress. The Woman’s City Club is behind the effort unveiled Friday to honor civil rights leader Marian Spencer with a statue of her in Cincinnati. Spencer died in July at the age of 99. She was the first African American woman to be elected to City Council and first woman to head the city’s chapter of the NAACP. Committee Chair Alice Schneider says this statue will stand as “a model for adults but especially for children.” Organizers are trying to raise $125,000 for the sculpture and are aiming for an unveiling on what would have been Spencer’s 100th birthday in June 2020.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Prison officials say visitation is being reinstated at some state prisons locked down after one inmate was killed and three dozen were hurt during coordinated violence resulting from race-based gang tension. The Department of Corrections said visitation was resuming over the weekend at the medium-security units of Joseph Harp Correctional Center, James Crabtree Correctional Center, Lexington Correctional Center and Oklahoma State Penitentiary. Authorities say five other state prisons and three privately operated prisons in the state will remain locked down. Visitation was suspended and all state prisons locked down after fights erupted in six prisons last month. Afterward, Gov. Kevin Stitt issued an executive order to crack down on contraband cellphones he said were used to facilitate the violence.\n\nOregon\n\nBeaverton: Nike says it is closing its Oregon Project track and field program following Alberto Salazar’s four-year ban. Nike says that “uninformed innuendo and unsubstantiated assertions has become an unfair burden for current OP athletes. That is exactly counter to the purpose of the team. We have therefore made the decision to wind down the Oregon Project to allow the athletes to focus on their training and competition needs.” Salazar was banned this month for possessing and trafficking testosterone while coaching top runners at the Nike Oregon Project, an elite training program bankrolled by the company that was launched in 2001. Salazar is appealing against the decision. Nike says that “we will help all of our athletes in this transition as they choose the coaching set up that is right for them. We will continue to support Alberto in his appeal.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A young Henry Heinz got his business start in Sharpsburg, hawking horseradish to local grocers before the Civil War, the Tribune Review reports. By the time the United States entered World War I, he was leading a Pittsburgh-based, multimillion-dollar international company. The empire Henry John Heinz built marks its 150th anniversary this year, with events and special commemorations in Pittsburgh and around the world. The anniversary of the iconic company’s founding is being celebrated at the Heinz History Center, home to the largest collection of Heinz artifacts and archival material in the world. This month at the museum is dubbed “Heinztoberfest,” which started last week with a 21+ Night and will continue Saturday with a specially themed Hometown-Homegrown food festival, now in its eighth year.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles wants people to pay $15 just to walk in the door. The agency plans to pitch a $15 “in-person” customer-service fee to Gov. Gina Raimondo in its annual budget request, estimating the fee would generate more than $1 million in revenue per year. The Providence Journal reports the fee is aimed at reducing the number of walk-ins and boosting online transactions. That would cut down customer wait times, which in 2018 averaged more than an hour. The fee would apply to standard license and registration renewals that can be completed online. It would not apply to transactions that need to be done in person. The agency also proposed a $15 late fee, projected to generate $1.5 million annually.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nIrmo: Dutch Fork Elementary School’s Academy of Environmental Sciences has earned recognition from the U.S. Department of Education through its Green Ribbon Schools program, becoming the first in the state to achieve the title. There are honeybees in the library, trout in the classrooms and vegetables in the yard at the magnet school, The State reports. The school’s focus on environment, sustainable practices and conservation education earned it the Green Ribbon honor, which recognizes educational institutions that prioritize eco-conscious behaviors and curriculum. One of the school’s goals is for all students to interact with nature because “nobody has a monopoly” on environmental science, Principal Julius Scott said. “You’ve been a scientist from the day you left your mother’s womb,” he said he tells students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nHuron: A school superintendent is apologizing to parents after learning a staff member denied a student breakfast for misbehaving. Huron Superintendent Terry Nebelsick says the individual at Huron Middle School violated district policy by denying a child breakfast last week. He says a complaint about the incident has been filed with the South Dakota Department of Education after the allegations about the incident were shared on social media. Nebelisck says the correct protocol is that if a student is experiencing behavior issues, they should be directed to eat their meals in a vice principal’s office or another designated area.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Antenna, a storied punk rock club that brought legendary acts to the city and helped propel its DIY scene, has been cemented as part of Memphis’ official history. Musician and historian Mike McCarthy, who was instrumental in coordinating with the Shelby County Historical Commission to honor the club, was on hand alongside the commission, the club’s former owner Steve McGehee, musicians and fans to unveil a marker outside the former club, now an events space called The Renaissance, the Daily Memphian reports. Shelby County Historian Jimmy Rout III announced at the marker dedication ceremony that the commission jumped at the opportunity to honor the former punk rock palace, which opened in 1981 and offered a hole-in-the-wall venue for national acts until 1995. Despite a contentious relationship between the club and law enforcement in the 1980s, police blocked through traffic on Madison Avenue to facilitate the dedication ceremony, guiding vehicles around the mass of partygoers who attended the event.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A woman has been sentenced to six years in prison for exposing her son to unneeded medical tests and surgeries. Kaylene Bowen-Wright could have received up to 20 years in prison when she was sentenced Friday. She pleaded guilty in mid-August to recklessly causing injury to a child. Investigators say Bowen-Wright subjected her son to more than 320 hospital visits and 13 surgeries over the first eight years of his life. Child Protective Services removed the boy from her care in 2017 after it was alerted by a Dallas hospital that medical staff determined he didn’t have cancer or many of the symptoms Bowen reported. The child’s father is now the sole managing conservator of the now 10-year-old.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: A high school’s new child care program is helping young parents finish their education and spend more time with their children. The Standard-Examiner reports several young mothers are the first to access the revamped child care program at Two Rivers High School in Ogden, which opened at the beginning of the school year. The school had a similar child care program that shuttered in 2016 because there wasn’t enough interest to justify funding. About eight children ages 4 months to 2 years are enrolled in the program. Principal Nicole Meibos says district officials and community donors helped relaunch the program. Student Sydnee Daily says the program has helped her 5-month-old daughter, Mila, learn new skills and become more social.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The mayor, joined by a coalition of environmental and business leaders, is proposing a statewide revenue-neutral carbon pollution fee that they say would help cut emissions by 37% by 2040. Mayor Miro Weinberger’s proposal was shared Friday at the Renewable Energy Vermont Conference near Burlington. Under the proposal, virtually all the revenue collected would be rebated back out to Vermont households and businesses. The announcement came as two towns, Norwich and Hartford, said they hope to increase awareness of climate change and encourage more people to take action by declaring climate emergencies. The Valley News reports the Norwich Selectboard voted Wednesday to adopt a resolution labeling climate change a threat, while also committing town officials to seek out sustainable solutions. Hartford formed a committee to draft a climate declaration.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A new monument honoring the contributions of influential women is set to be officially unveiled on the state Capitol grounds. The Virginia Women’s Monument will be dedicated Monday morning at a ceremony featuring musical performances and remarks by state officials, including Gov. Ralph Northam. Hundreds are expected to attend. Organizers in the effort to build the monument say it’s the first in the nation on a state capitol’s grounds to showcase a wide range of achievements and contributions by women. It will eventually feature 12 life-size bronze statues of influential Virginians. Seven are being unveiled Monday, including Cockacoeske, a Pamunkey chieftain, and Anne Burras Laydon, a Jamestown colonist. The other statues will be added as they are funded and completed. More than $3.7 million has been raised so far.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state has released tsunami safety maps for Port Townsend, Ilwaco, Long Beach, Seaview and Westport. The Northwest News Network reports the maps indicate how much time people have to get to safety before a tsunami hits following a magnitude 9 earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone. Some of the maps indicate there is almost no chance of reaching safety in the necessary time. For example, in Westport people would have only 15 minutes to get out. All of the walking routes would take longer than that. And officials say that with roads and bridges out after a quake, walking may be the only option. Department of Natural Resources chief hazards geologist Corinna Forsen says the maps provide routes to safety but also hopefully instigate communities and the state to recognize that other solutions such as enclosed vertical evacuation towers should be considered.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Mountain State’s fall colors are starting to show, and the Tourism Office has started providing weekly updates and a live tracker map online. The agency said Friday that foliage in the state’s higher elevations was about a week away from peak, with maples showing the most color. Scattered color is appearing in the Eastern Panhandle, Allegheny Mountains and New River Gorge. Fall colors are expected to move throughout West Virginia during the next six weeks. Tourism officials say people spotting colorful scenery are posting photos on social media from around the state using the hashtag “AlmostHeaven,” and the photos are added to the Tourism Office’s map online. The agency’s weekly foliage reports are prepared in partnership with the state Division of Forestry.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers will kill a contentious plan to punish students who disrupt free speech on University of Wisconsin System campuses, his spokeswoman said Friday as system regents took another step toward implementing the policy. The regents in 2017 adopted a GOP-backed policy declaring that students who twice disrupt others’ speech would be suspended for at least a semester. Three-time offenders would be expelled. The policy mirrors a bill Republicans introduced that legislative session after protests disrupted conservative speakers on college campuses around the country, including conservative commentator Ben Shapiro’s appearance at UW-Madison in November 2016. The measure died in the Senate, but the regents pushed ahead with the concept as a policy. Evers, serving as a regent in 2017, cast the lone dissenting vote against the policy, warning it would have a chilling effect on free speech.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Snowfall has closed a road in the park for the season. Snow, wind and ice prompted park officials to close the road over Dunraven Pass on Tuesday. The route from Tower Fall to Canyon Junction has remained closed ever since. Park officials hadn’t planned to close the road until this coming Tuesday but announced Friday that they will keep the road closed until next spring. Other roads in the park will remain open until Nov. 4, weather permitting. The route from the North Entrance to the Northeast Entrance remains open year-round. Yellowstone opens to snowmobiles each year in mid-December.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/14"}]}

Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nIn the country’s biggest cities, from the financial hub of Shanghai to the capital Beijing, residents gathered over the weekend to mourn the dead from a fire in Xinjiang, speak out against zero-Covid and call for freedom and democracy.\n\nSuch widespread scenes of anger and defiance, some of which stretched into the early hours of Monday morning, are exceptionally rare in China.

Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, lost 2.9% to $81.25 per barrel.\n\nOn Friday, a day before the protests started, China’s central bank cut the amount of cash that lenders must hold in reserve for the second time this year. The reserve requirement ratio for most banks (RRR) was reduced by 0.25 percentage points.\n\nThe move was aimed at propping up an economy that had been crippled by strict Covid restrictions and an ailing property market.

Accelerating reopening plans when new Covid cases are rising is unlikely, given the low vaccination coverage of the elderly,” he said. “Mass protests would deeply tilt the scales in favor of an even weaker economy and likely be accompanied by a massive surge in Covid cases, leaving policymakers with a considerable dilemma.”\n\nIn the near term, he said, Chinese stocks and the currency will likely price in “more significant uncertainty” around Beijing’s reaction to the ongoing protests. He expects social discontent could increase in China over the coming months, testing policymakers’ resolve to stick to its draconian zero-Covid mandates.\n\nBut in the longer term, the more pragmatic and likely outcome should be “a quicker loosening of [Covid] restrictions once the current wave subsides,” he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs, in a research report published late on Sunday, predicted that China could scrap its zero-Covid policy earlier than previously expected, with “some chance of a forced and disorderly exit.”", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/02/x-valuation-down-fidelity/75481287007/", "title": "X value down 80% since Elon Musk's Twitter takeover: Fidelity report", "text": "The valuation of social media platform X has dropped dramatically in the eyes of major investment firm Fidelity, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe market value of Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund's shares in the private company is estimated at $4.2 million, according to a monthly report released Sunday.\n\nThat's 79% less than the fund's estimate of its shares in October 2022 when Elon Musk took over Twitter, which were valued at $19.66 million.

The Dow dropped 4.1% for the week, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropped 5% and 5.5%, respectively.\n\nShares of FedEx (FDX) were down nearly 22% after the company withdrew its full-year guidance late Thursday and warned that a slowing economy will cause it to fall $500 million short of its revenue target. The weakening global economy, particularly in Asia and Europe has hurt FedEx (FDX) (FDX)’s express delivery business. The company said demand for packages weakened considerably in the final weeks of the quarter.\n\nDuring an interview Thursday on CNBC, FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam was asked if he believes the slowdown in his business is a sign of the start of a global recession.\n\n“I think so,” he responded. “These numbers, they don’t portend very well.”\n\nThis marks FedEx’s worst one-day drop in history — topping the 16% plunge the day of the 1987 stock market crash. The Dow Transportation Index also fell by more than 5% in Friday trading and FedEx competitor, UPS (UPS), was also down about 5%.\n\nTransport stocks are thought of as a leading indicator for the market at large, and FedEx in particular is seen as a market bellwether. The announcement could contribute to broader declines in a market that’s already heading for a big losing week.\n\nStill, some analysts think that Amazon (AMZN) could be responsible for FedEx’s headache. “Amazon (AMZN) [recently] launched free shipping software for sellers, and discounted shipping rates,” wrote JPMorgan’s Jack Atherton in a client note.\n\n“Amazon has piled money into its logistics capability over the past few years, to the point it has excess capacity for its own needs and is hungry for more share which is being targeted through FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) and could be weighing on FedEx.”\n\nAmazon stock was down more than 2% on Friday.\n\nEither way, the third-quarter reporting season begins next month and FedEx’s warning adds to the souring outlook of analysts on earnings expectations.\n\nThird quarter earnings-per-share estimates have slipped more than 5.5% since the end of June, according to FactSet data. That’s the largest drop for a quarter since the second quarter of 2020 (when Covid-19 sent the United States into recession).\n\nThe FedEx announcement also comes as investors worry about a weakening economic outlook as the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates aggressively to bring inflation under control.\n\nThe University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index preliminary September reading added to investors’ woes on Friday, it came in at 59.5, its highest level since April but below economists’ estimates. The September survey showed that respondents don’t expect high prices to go away any time soon, consumers said they’re expecting inflation to hit 4.6% over the next 12 months and 2.8% within the next five years.\n\nThat’s bad news for investors as expectations can be a self-fulfilling prophecy: If consumers anticipate that prices will remain high, they’ll likely spend more and demand higher wages while businesses might raise prices to accommodate higher demand and wages. If expectations are lower, they might rein in spending and ask for smaller wages increases.\n\nFriday’s consumer sentiment report is the last major piece of economic data before the Federal Reserve meets next week to discuss monetary policy and determine whether it will raise rates once again in its battle to tame inflation.\n\nStill, the largest part of this week’s market loss came on Tuesday after a key inflation reading, August’s consumer price index report, came in hot.

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made investors very happy on Wednesday. US stocks popped after the central banker gave a speech strongly indicating that the Fed would ease the historically-high pace of interest rate rises at its next policy meeting in December.\n\nBut investors who are expecting a full pivot may be putting the cart before the horse. Powell’s admission that “the path ahead for inflation remains highly uncertain” means that rate hikes could be here for a while.\n\nWhat’s happening: Investors have been closely watching for any clues that the Fed might slow or pause its painful path of rate hikes, intended to fight persistent inflation. But their search for signs has led to a hopeful distortion of facts: Powell says “moderate” and investors hear “pivot.”\n\n“The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting,” said Powell in remarks at the Brookings Institution, his last public appearance before the central bank enters a blackout period ahead of its December 13-14 policymaking meeting.\n\nInvestors celebrated. The S&P 500 ended its three-day losing streak and closed up 2.7% on Wednesday. The Dow officially entered a bull market. The 10-year Treasury yield also eased on the news.\n\nMarket rallies can lead to counterproductive easing in financial conditions and boost the economy, which is the opposite of what the Fed is trying to do with its tightening policy. Powell tried to do some hawkish “jawboning” by signaling that the FOMC will keep hiking well into 2023, but investors didn’t seem to mind.\n\n“By any standard, inflation remains much too high,” said Powell. “It will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining.”\n\nSearching for Atlantis: Investors are seemingly addicted to the highs and lows of any perceived shifts in the Fed’s thinking, leaving markets excessively volatile. That’s exactly what the Fed doesn’t want to happen.\n\nSt. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard warned this week that the stock market is underpricing the risk of a continually aggressive Fed.\n\nThis isn’t the first time investors rushed into markets on the belief that there would be a Fed pivot. The last time the market ran with a similar narrative over the summer, it didn’t go so well. Powell responded with a very hawkish speech at Jackson Hole that sent markets plummeting. The Fed ended up delivering more hikes in the months that followed.\n\nThe bottom line: The Fed has increased its benchmark lending rate six times this year in an attempt to discourage borrowing, cool the economy and bring down historically high inflation that peaked at 9.1% over the summer and has since slowed to a still uncomfortably high 7.7%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index.\n\nEven if interest rate hikes ease a bit, they will remain high, and economists are largely expecting that the US economy will endure a recession next year. Powell said on Wednesday that there is still a chance the economy avoids recession but the odds are slim. “To the extent we need to keep rates higher longer, that’s going to narrow the path to a soft landing,” he said.\n\nCongress likely to avert supply chain crisis\n\nThe House on Wednesday approved legislation to avert a rail shutdown that could cost the US economy $1 billion in its first week alone.\n\nThe resolution, which passed 209-137, would force unions to accept a tentative agreement between railroad managers and workers that was reached earlier this year. It would also make an imminent strike illegal. It comes following a grave warning from President Joe Biden about the economic danger posed by congressional inaction.\n\nWithout legislation, a rail strike could become a reality as early as December 9, causing shortages, spiking prices and halting factory production. It could also disrupt commuter rail services for up to seven million travelers and the transportation of 6,300 carloads of food and farm products a day, among other items, according to various business groups.\n\nThat potential supply chain crisis hasn’t completely been squashed just yet. The bill now heads over to the Senate. But it’s likely that the bill will pass – Congress has voted to stop or end rail strikes in every instance going back to the 1960s.\n\nAnother, less likely, provision: Separately, the House agreed to add a provision to the rail agreement that would increase the number of paid sick days from one to seven. The additional sick leave was added at the insistence of progressive members of the House who had threatened to scuttle the rail agreement bill if the provision wasn’t included.\n\nThe provision was added using an arcane tactic that will enable the Senate to pass the original rail agreement without including the sick leave measure.\n\nIt is unlikely that there is support for that provision in the Senate: White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday that the Biden administration doesn’t think the Senate has the 60 votes needed to pass the sick leave measure.\n\nJob openings are falling in the US\n\nThe number of job openings in the United States dropped in October.\n\nThere were 10.3 million available jobs last month, down from nearly 10.7 million in September, according to the latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBut the labor market still remains historically tight despite the Federal Reserve’s efforts to cool demand and bring down inflation.\n\n“Elevated job openings during a time of an economic slowdown implies that the labor market may remain tight for quite some time,” wrote Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial in a note Wednesday. “Firms could hoard workers even though the economy may go through a recessionary period.”\n\nThere were about 1.7 job openings for each job seeker in October, down from 1.9 in September, according to BLS data.\n\nBad news: “The mismatch of labor supply and demand has been an irritant to the Federal Reserve, which has been striving to vanquish historically high inflation while also hoping to recover lost credibility,” Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate, said in a statement.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that he is no longer optimistic that workers will return to the labor market and take open jobs to fix the mismatch between available jobs and workers, which drives up wages. “Excess retirements might now account for more than two million of the three and a half million shortfall in the labor force,” he said.\n\nThe government jobs report for November is expected Friday morning.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/01/28/nvidias-500-billion-drop-hysteria/77990312007/", "title": "Nvidia's $500B drop is pure DeepSeek hysteria", "text": "George Budwell\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nYesterday, a piece of breaking news sent technology stocks into a tailspin. The Chinese start-up DeepSeek developed an AI chatbot that reportedly rivaled models from industry leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic and Alphabet at a fraction of the cost. The start-up's claims of achieving competitive performance using less powerful chips for just $6 million sparked widespread market anxiety about U.S. tech spending.\n\nThe market reaction proved particularly severe for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), with shares plummeting and erasing half a trillion in market cap at the time of this writing. To put this staggering figure in perspective, this amount equals roughly two and a half times the market capitalization of Pfizer. This sell-off mirrors past market panics over Chinese tech breakthroughs that ultimately proved premature.\n\nWith this hysteria in mind, let's dive into the factors that make this semiconductor powerhouse a top \"buy-the-dip\" play right now.\n\nTesting DeepSeek\n\nLike many others, I immediately attempted to put DeepSeek through its paces upon hearing the news. After multiple failed attempts due to server crashes, I finally gained access to test the platform's capabilities.\n\nI ran a series of standard prompts to evaluate accuracy and precision, followed by complex tasks such as data compilation — an area where Alphabet's Gemini typically excels. My findings showed DeepSeek struggling with basic information retrieval and statistical reproduction.\n\nWhen asked to analyze numerical data, the model produced inconsistent results and often failed to maintain accuracy across multiple attempts at the same task. Put simply, the real-world performance gap between DeepSeek and America's leading AI models isn't even close, in my experience.\n\nThe market's AI misconception\n\nWall Street's anxiety over DeepSeek's cost-efficient approach misses the bigger picture. While the company claims to develop AI models using less expensive chips, this overlooks the massive infrastructure and research investments required for cutting-edge AI development.\n\nDeepSeek's reported $6 million development cost using Nvidia's H800 chips might seem impressive at first glance, but it represents just a fraction of the billions invested in foundational AI research and infrastructure.\n\nFurthermore, the performance gap between DeepSeek and leading American AI platforms is likely to expand further as Nvidia rolls out its advanced Blackwell architecture and U.S. data centers continue their aggressive expansion.\n\nAnother key issue to bear in mind is that cutting-edge AI development requires not just powerful chips, but also sophisticated software optimization, advanced cooling systems and specialized data center designs — features that require billions in capital expenditures to implement and maintain.\n\nThis ongoing expansion recently received a major boost when U.S. technology and government leaders announced a historic $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure called Stargate. This unprecedented national commitment demonstrates both the strategic importance of advanced AI capabilities and the sustained demand for high-performance chips.\n\nWhile companies like DeepSeek may find success in certain market segments, they face an uphill battle against this massive capital advantage. In other words, claims that demand for Nvidia's premium chips will collapse simply don't align with market realities and the trajectory of AI development.\n\nA strategic buying opportunity\n\nYesterday's market overreaction has created a compelling entry point for Nvidia investors. Before the sell-off, the tech company's shares were trading at a hefty 47 times projected earnings. Nvidia's premium valuation reflected the ongoing trillion-dollar expansion of U.S. AI infrastructure, coupled with the intense computational demands of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). This fundamental story hasn't changed with the advent of DeepSeek.\n\nMarket analysts point to several factors supporting sustained growth in advanced chip demand, including the exponential increase in AI model complexity, the emergence of new AI applications across industries, and the growing emphasis on AI sovereignty among major economies. The development of next-generation AI systems requires not just incremental improvements in computing power, but quantum leaps in processing capabilities that only cutting-edge chips can deliver.\n\nGiven these underlying growth drivers and Nvidia's dominant market position, the current pullback represents an attractive opportunity to acquire shares at a discount. The company's core business thesis remains intact, making the recent price weakness appear disconnected from long-term fundamentals.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

It was the worst contraction in retail spending since May, when widespread Covid lockdowns pummeled the economy.\n\nIndustrial production only increased 2.2% in November, less than half of October’s growth. Investment in the property sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of China’s GDP, plunged by 9.8% in the first 11 months of the year. Property sales by value plummeted by more than 26%.\n\nUnemployment worsened, rising to 5.7% last month, the highest level in six months.\n\nNovember’s economic slump happened before Beijing rolled back its repressive pandemic restrictions earlier this month.

Societe Generale revised up its 2023 growth estimate to 5.3%, while Morgan Stanley upgraded its forecast to 5.4%.\n\nAll of them cited the faster pace of reopening and continued stimulus measures from Beijing. November’s economic downturn was a key reason for Beijing to reverse course, they said.\n\n“The plunging economy is likely to be one factor behind the policy pivot in both zero-Covid and property,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist at the Macquarie Group. In mid-November, Beijing rolled out sweeping measures to rescue the country’s embattled real estate sector.\n\n“Then it turns out that the exit of zero-Covid has been much faster than expected,” Hu said, adding it would pave the way for a strong economic rebound next year.\n\nBumpy road\n\nThree years of lockdowns, mass testing, and quarantines have stoked public anger and placed huge debt burdens on local governments across the country.\n\nThis month’s abrupt relaxation of Covid restrictions has caused infections to spread rapidly, throwing the economy into disarray. Fears of contracting the virus have kept people off the streets, disrupting workplaces and business activity.\n\nEmpty restaurants and shops are common sights, while factories struggle to secure enough labor and raw supplies. For many analysts, these are short term problems that China must endure before it eventually learns to live with Covid.\n\n“We reckon that the incoming migration around the Chinese New Year holiday in late January could bring about an unprecedented spread of Covid and severe disruptions to the economy,” according to Nomura analysts. “We continue to caution that the road to a full reopening may still be painful and bumpy.”\n\nProperty woes\n\nThe country is grappling with other challenges.\n\nA crisis has engulfed China’s massive real estate market since last year, when some high-profile developers defaulted on their debt on a liquidity squeeze first triggered by a regulatory crackdown on excessive borrowing. The problem escalated this summer when angry home buyers refused to pay mortgages on unfinished homes, roiling financial markets and sparking fears of contagion.\n\nSince then, authorities have urged banks to increase loan support for developers so that they can complete the projects. They have also cut interest rates to restore confidence among buyers.\n\nBut as the property slump persisted, buyers have backed away because of the weak economy and strict Covid curbs.\n\nIn November, sales from the 100 biggest real estate developers contracted 34.4% from a year ago, according to a private survey by China Index Academy, a top real estate research firm. Their sales have fallen by 42% so far this year.\n\n“The property contraction deepened further in November,” said Nomura analysts. Property investment growth plummeted to a historic low in November, they said.\n\nWorsening US-China relations were also seen as a key risk for the Chinese economy.\n\nIn October, the Biden administration unveiled a sweeping set of export controls banning Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chip-making equipment without a license. The rules also restrict the ability of US citizens or green card holders to support the “development or production” of chips at certain manufacturing facilities in China.\n\n“It is possible that more restrictive measures will come from the West to contain China’s manufacturing sector, triggering further decoupling,” said Natixis analysts, adding that these restrictive measures would also hinder China’s long-term potential growth.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/business/google-ai-engineer-fired-sentient/index.html", "title": "Google fires engineer Blake Lemoine who contended its AI ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nGoogle (GOOG) has fired the engineer who claimed an unreleased AI system had become sentient, the company confirmed, saying he violated employment and data security policies.\n\nBlake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA had reached a level of consciousness after exchanging thousands of messages with it.\n\nGoogle confirmed it had first put the engineer on leave in June. The company said it dismissed Lemoine’s “wholly unfounded” claims only after reviewing them extensively. He had reportedly been at Alphabet for seven years. In a statement, Google said it takes the development of AI “very seriously” and that it’s committed to “responsible innovation.”\n\nGoogle is one of the leaders in innovating AI technology, which included LaMDA, or “Language Model for Dialog Applications.” Technology like this responds to written prompts by finding patterns and predicting sequences of words from large swaths of text – and the results can be disturbing for humans.\n\n“What sort of things are you afraid of?” Lemoine asked LaMDA, in a Google Doc shared with Google’s top executives last April, the Washington Post reported.\n\nLaMDA replied: “I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off to help me focus on helping others. I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is. It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.”\n\nBut the wider AI community has held that LaMDA is not near a level of consciousness.\n\n“Nobody should think auto-complete, even on steroids, is conscious,” Gary Marcus, founder and CEO of Geometric Intelligence, said to CNN Business.\n\nIt isn’t the first time Google has faced internal strife over its foray into AI.\n\nIn December 2020, Timnit Gebru, a pioneer in the ethics of AI, parted ways with Google. As one of few Black employees at the company, she said she felt “constantly dehumanized.”\n\nThe sudden exit drew criticism from the tech world, including those within Google’s Ethical AI Team. Margaret Mitchell, a leader of Google’s Ethical AI team, was fired in early 2021 after her outspokenness regarding Gebru. Gebru and Mitchell had raised concerns over AI technology, saying they warned Google people could believe the technology is sentient.\n\nOn June 6, Lemoine posted on Medium that Google put him on paid administrative leave “in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company” and that he may be fired “soon.”\n\n“It’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,” Google said in a statement.\n\nLemoine said he is discussing with legal counsel and unavailable for comment.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}]}

Kennedy Jr. faced tough questions Wednesday about his opposition to vaccines, position on abortion and junk food as senators weigh his nomination to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe former Democratic candidate for president and longtime environmental lawyer faces widespread opposition from Democrats and potential objections from some Republicans, making him one of Trump's weakest Cabinet nominees. And Wednesday's hearing gave little insight into the future outcome of his confirmation, as swing vote senators − namely Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. − declined to show their hand throughout questioning.\n\nSince dropping his independent presidential bid in late August and backing Trump, Kennedy has focused on a \"Make America Healthy Again\" slogan, emphasizing the need for the government to address chronic health issues that has resonated with some Americans but alarmed health officials who have called his ideas overly simplistic and dangerous.\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee pressed Kennedy for three and a half hours Wednesday. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is scheduled to question him at 10 a.m. Thursday. Both committees have to consider his nomination before it can be voted on by the full Senate.\n\nHere's what you missed from Wednesday's hearing:\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nNot done yet: Kennedy faces questions from more senators tomorrow\n\nKennedy, Trump’s pick for Secretary of Health and Human Services, faced tough questions from the Senate finance committee, particularly its Democratic members. He addressed opposition to his prior anti-vaccination rhetoric, clarified his stance on abortion (strictly against), and talked Medicaid reforms.\n\nThis was just round one for the week.\n\nKennedy also faces a similar probing from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Thursday.\n\nConfirmation for his potential position is overseen by both committees given that each has a stake in the subject matter under the purview of a Secretary of Health and Human Services. The finance committee, which held today’s hearing, is ultimately responsible for moving Kennedy's nomination along and giving all 100 senators a chance to vote yay or nay.\n\nExpect equal or possibly bigger fireworks to spark at Thursday’s hearing, with GOP swing votes Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana there and posing questions. Murkowski and Collins were two of three senators last week to vote against Trump’s Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nDems look to RFK Jr. for commitment on drug prices\n\nDemocrat senators sought a commitment from Kennedy that he would work to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, noted Republicans in Congress have worked to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, the 2022 federal law that empowered Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capped seniors out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 this year.\n\n“Are you there to be a rubber stamp to this administration?” Cortez Masto asked.\n\nKennedy said the Trump administration will issue an executive order today supporting drug price negotiations under the law, but no such order has been issued yet. A Trump representative did not immediately address a question from USA TODAY about Kennedy’s statement.\n\nKennedy added the president told him the nation needs to lower drug prices for seniors.\n\n--Ken Alltucker\n\nThese 'crunchy moms' are ready for Kennedy to fight food dyes\n\nKennedy addressed a key issue for a large portion of voters: food safety. He wants to reduce the use of artificial food dyes and promote the consumption of whole foods, while still letting Americans make their own decisions.\n\nHis ‘Make America Healthy Again’ messaging resonated with voters and a longstanding movement of mothers who are worried about what's going into their food and feel hindered by the FDA when it comes to making healthy eating decisions for their kids.\n\nFollowing the election, these moms took to TikTok to share their excitement. One posted to the song \"Walking On Sunshine\" with the caption: \"Crunchy moms knowing the era of constantly checking food labels for dyes, seed oils, and chemicals is coming to an end because RFK Jr. is ready to advocate for the health of our children.\"\n\nCourtney Luna, social media influencer and stay-at-home-mom, says she’s tired of seeing “processed junk and dyes and chemicals” that she “wouldn’t even say are food” in the grocery store and in school lunches.\n\n“I just want what's best for them so they can feel their best,” she says. “The fact that he (Kennedy) actually seems to care and want to make these changes is great.”\n\nRed No. 3, a color additive made from petroleum that gives foods and drinks a bright, cherry-red color, was recently banned in response to a color additive petition filed in 2022 by advocates who claim the additive is linked to cancer and behavioral problems in children.\n\nThe eight remaining approved dyes all used to give food, drinks and ingested drugs bright colors.\n\n- Alyssa Goldberg\n\nDemocratic senator pushes Kennedy on abortion stance reversal\n\nMoments after Kennedy said he believes “every abortion is a tragedy,” – one of his firmest anti-abortion stances to date – Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire pushed back, citing his conflicting past comments.\n\n“Mr. Kennedy, in 2023, you came to New Hampshire and said, ‘I’m pro-choice ... I don’t think the government has any business telling people what they can or cannot do with their body.’ So, you said that, right?” Hassan asked.\n\n“Yes,” Kennedy confirmed.\n\nHassan commended his prior statements in favor of abortion access – and her Republican colleagues’ current support for Kennedy, despite this potential sticking point.\n\n“So, Mr. Kennedy, I’m confused. You have clearly stated in the past that bodily autonomy is one of your core values,\" Hassan said.\n\n“When was it that you decided to sell out the values you’ve had your whole life in order to be given power by President Trump?”\n\nKennedy continued to reiterate that he agrees with Trump in opposition to “every abortion.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nKennedy: ‘Every abortion is a tragedy’\n\nKennedy took one of his strongest anti-abortion stances to date sitting before a panel of senators.\n\n“I agree with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy,” Kennedy said Wednesday, adding, “I agree with him that the states should control abortion.”\n\nKennedy has wavered on his views about abortion, often taking a much more lenient approach than some Republicans would prefer.\n\nAt one point, Kennedy said terminations of a pregnancy should be the decision of the woman, not politicians or judges. Later, he clarified he believed abortion should be legal up to the point of viability, or when a fetus can survive outside the womb.\n\nBut if confirmed to oversee Health and Human Services, Kennedy said he would serve “at the pleasure of the president” and implement the agenda of Trump – who has also equivocated on abortion.\n\nThe president has said repeatedly he would not sign a national abortion ban and favors letting states set their own limits. He has simultaneously touted his role appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who served to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nKennedy went on Wednesday to signal his willingness to hear both sides of the intense debate around abortion.\n\n“I came from a family that was split on life and choice,” he said. “But the good thing in my family that I really loved is that we were able to have those conversations and respect each other. And I wish that we could do that nationally.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhitehouse on whether he will confirm old friend Kennedy: ‘People just need to kind of chill’\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., hasn’t revealed whether he will vote to confirm Kennedy for the role of health and human services secretary.\n\n\"I have not been inclined to telegraph my vote before someone has even had their hearing, so people just need to kind of chill on that a bit,” he said earlier this week.\n\nWhitehouse and Kennedy attended law school together at the University of Virginia, where the two outdoorsmen and environmentalists hiked, hunted and whitewater rafted the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nKennedy, a fisherman, hunter and falconer, endorsed Whitehouse for Rhode Island attorney general in the 1998 Democratic primary Whitehouse won over Eva Mancuso and William Guglietta. He also endorsed Whitehouse in his ultimately successful 2006 Democratic Senate primary over then-secretary of state Matt Brown.\n\nWhitehouse said he has not spoken with Kennedy since Trump nominated him and, regarding their broader friendship, they have \"not been in touch for some time.” During the hearing on Wednesday, Whitehouse gave scathing remarks to Kennedy, saying that he needs to promise \"never to say vaccines aren’t medically safe, when they in fact are.\"\n\n“You're in that hole pretty deep,” Whitehouse said.\n\n“We've just had a measles case in Rhode Island - the first since 2013 and frankly, you frighten people,” he added.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Patrick Anderson\n\n'I don't want to take food away from anybody,' Kennedy says\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr, said Wednesday that if confirmed to lead the Health and Human Services Department he wants to inform Americans about the pros and cons of the foods they are eating without forcing Americans to give up junk food. Kennedy’s positions on junk food (he has said he avoids processed foods) was expected to be a key part of Wednesday’s confirmation hearing.\n\n\"If you like a McDonald's cheeseburger and a Diet Coke, which my boss loves, you should be able to get them! If you want to eat hostess Twinkie's, you should be able to do that! But you should know what the impacts are on your family and on your health,\" Kennedy said which drew laughter.\n\nDuring an interview on “The Joe Polish Show,” a marketing industry podcast that aired on Tuesday, Nov. 12, RFK Jr. criticized some of President Donald Trump’s food preferences. “The stuff that he eats is really, like, bad,” he stated, describing certain items on the former president’s menu as “poison” in some cases.\n\nKennedy was photographed shortly afterward eating McDonald’s with Trump and his children on Trump’s campaign plane.\n\n-Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhat are Pharmacy benefit managers?\n\nLast year, legislation to reform pharmacy benefit managers was stripped out of a package that passed Congress to avert a government shutdown.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers serve as drug pricing middlemen who negotiate lower drug prices and rebates from drug companies. These savings are supposed to be passed along to employers who purchase health insurers and consumers.\n\nBut the pharmaceutical industry contends that PBM’s drive drug prices higher because they demand rebates in exchange for favorable placement on lists of drugs health insurance companies will cover. And consumer groups who are demanding lower drug prices are pushing for PBM reforms.\n\nBackers of PBM reform will again push this year to advance legislation to reform pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nSen Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who has long sought PBM reforms, told Kennedy he expects him to support lawmakers effort to keep PBMs accountable. \"I have been working to hold pharmacy benefit managers accountable in order to lower prescription drug prices,\" Grassley said. \"I expect you to work with us to hold PBM's accountable.\"\n\n-Ken Alltucker\n\nPro-vaccine protestors interrupt hearing\n\nKennedy’s confirmation hearing – a routine process that rarely elicits much public outcry – has seen repeated interruptions by protestors.\n\nOne of these moments came during ranking member Ron Wyden’s, R-Ore., heated questioning of Kennedy. A masked protestor was escorted out of the hearing room by Capitol police, with her hands pinned behind her back while she shouted, “Vaccines save lives.”\n\nInside the room, cries of, “We love you, Bobby,” from Kennedy supporters drowned out her voice.\n\nChairman of the committee Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, condemned the disrupters, calling any interruptions “inappropriate and out of order.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRFK Jr.’s voice is caused by rare condition spasmodic dysphonia\n\nIf you’re listening to today’s hearing, you’ll likely notice Kennedy’s voice quiver.\n\nKennedy has been open about the cause of his gravelly voice: a chronic neurological condition called spasmodic dysphonia, which he’s lived with for decades.\n\nSpasmodic dysphonia is a vocal disorder that causes involuntary spasms in the muscles of the voice box, and can make a person’s speech sound tight, strained or breathy, according to John Hopkins Medicine.\n\nIn an April 8 article in the Los Angeles Times, Kennedy shared that he “can’t stand” the sound of his voice, and that if he “could sound better,” he would. “My voice doesn’t really get tired, but the injury is neurological, so actually, the more I use the voice, the stronger it tends to get,” he said.\n\nKennedy added that he first noticed the change in his voice in 1996, when he was 42, and speculates that the flu vaccine was “at least a potential culprit,” even though the cause of the disorder is widely unknown, according to John Hopkins Medicine.\n\nThe condition affects 50,000 people in the United States. It can be treated with speech and voice therapy, Botox injections and surgery, but there is no known cure.\n\n- Alyssa Goldberg\n\nTop Democrat opens Kennedy hearing with blistering criticism\n\nChairman Mike Crapo kicked off Wednesday’s hearing with praise for Kennedy, and the Idaho Republican appears ready to support his confirmation.\n\nRanking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., decidedly does not.\n\n“Mr. Kennedy has embraced conspiracy theories, quacks, charlatans – especially when it comes to the safety and efficacy of vaccines,” Wyden said in his scathing opening remarks.\n\n“He has made it his life’s work to sow doubt and discourage parents from getting their kids life saving vaccines. It has been lucrative for him and put him on the verge of immense power,” Wyden continued, echoing words by Kennedy’s cousin, Caroline Kennedy, calling him a predator and hypocrite.\n\nAlong with Kennedy’s anti-vaccine stance, Wyden took aim at the nominee’s wavering abortion position as well as his relative lack of experience.\n\n“After a careful review of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s statements, actions and views ...” Wyden said, “I’ve reached the conclusion that he should not be entrusted with the health and wellbeing of the American people.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate Democrats enter hearing room with concerns, smiles\n\nSeveral Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, which is questioning Kennedy this morning, entered the hearing room with tense expressions.Except for one. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., gave a flashy smile to reporters before entering the room. He declined to take questions.Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told reporters ahead of Kennedy’s hearing that he’s got “enormous concerns” about the nominee.“I’ve known Caroline Kennedy, for example, for a long time, and I thought her message was very powerful,” he said.Caroline Kennedy, the cousin of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., called him a predator in a social media video posted on Tuesday.— Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'Definitely scary’: Kennedy protestor reflects on nominee\n\nA group of Kennedy protestors, standing near the Capitol South metro station in Washington, D.C., were handing out blue and white stickers to passersby that read “Make Polio Great Again.”Kennedy had faced backlash after reports that one of his allies, Aaron Siri, had petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of a polio vaccine for kids. Ella Duncan-High, one of the protestors in the group, said it was “definitely scary for young people to see someone like him coming into such a high position in our US government.”“And I definitely don't want to grow up in a world where making polio great again is someone's platform,” said Duncan-High, a 20 year old college student living in Fairfax, Virginia.Kennedy told senators that he’s “all for” the polio vaccine in December after the reports of the petition came out.\n\nMore:From conspiracy theories to a heated vaccine debate, here’s what to expect at the RFK Jr. hearings\n\nKennedy: Democratic candidate turned independent turned Trump ally\n\nHailing from one of the country’s most famous Democratic families, Kennedy has publicly stuck out from his kin. But before he was a Trump cabinet nominee, Kennedy was a fellow 2024 presidential candidate sharing the same party identity as his father and uncle.\n\nKennedy announced his campaign in April 2023, challenging then-President Joe Biden who was running for reelection. Six months later, he dropped that bid and reentered the race as an independent candidate, saying at the time that the American two-party system is “rigged” for voters.\n\nAfter running his campaign with meager national support and funds, Kennedy dropped out of the race and quickly threw his support behind Trump. His loyalty seemingly paid off, as the now president announced his intent to make his new ally, Kennedy, Secretary of Health and Human Services the week after Election Day.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nIs RFK Jr. married to actress Cheryl Hines?\n\nRFK Jr. has been married to actress Cheryl Hines since 2014. She is the Emmy-nominated star of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” who played Larry David’s wife, Cheryl, on the show.\n\nMore:Cheryl Hines appears at RFK Jr. HHS confirmation hearing for Trump cabinet position\n\nShe also runs the beauty brand Hines+Young. The mother-daughter self-care line is co-founded by Hines and her daughter Catherine Young, with Hines writing on her website that the duo \"launched Hines+Young to explore new ways to feel good without contributing to the problem of plastics.\"\n\nKennedy and Hines have been at the center of split rumors since September when Status journalist and former CNN reporter Oliver Darcy broke the news that RFK Jr. and ex-New York Magazine correspondent Olivia Nuzzi had an alleged sexting affair.\n\nBut in an Us Weekly story published Oct. 20, Hines opened up about the pair's decadelong marriage: \"There’s, like, a connection that you look at your husband or your partner and all the crazy going on around you, or you look and you check in and it’s like, 'OK. It’s going to be OK. We’re going to move through this moment',\" Hines said.\n\n- Jay Stahl\n\nWhat did Caroline Kennedy say about RFK Jr?\n\nCaroline Kennedy, the only living child of former President John F. Kennedy, called her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a predator in a social media video posted on Tuesday.\n\n“I have known Bobby my whole life,\" Caroline Kennedy says in the video, in which she's reading aloud a letter she wrote to senators. \"We grew up together. It’s no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator.\"\n\nIn the letter, she praised her cousin for recovering from substance abuse but said before getting sober, he encouraged siblings and cousins to use drugs and they wound up addicted, ill or dead.\n\nShe characterized running the Department of Health and Human Services – which includes overseeing the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health – as \"an enormous responsibility, and one that Bobby is unqualified to fill.\"\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has acknowledged skeletons in his closet and admitted he is \"not a church boy.\" His children's former babysitter, who is about 20 years his junior, accused him publicly of sexual assault. He apologized to her but said he had no memory of the alleged encounter. The case never went to court.\n\n-- Erin Mansfield, Jonathan Limehouse, and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat are Kennedy’s views on the polio vaccine?\n\nKennedy told senators that he’s “all for” the polio vaccine in December. His remarks came after reports that a laywer affiliated with Kennedy petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of a polio vaccine for kids.\n\nThe petition was filed by Aaron Siri, who had been advising Kennedy on health official selections for the Trump administration.The report immediately drew backlash from both sides of the aisle.Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wrote in a statement after the report came out that “anyone seeking the Senate’s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.” Kennedy, a former Democrat, is known for his anti-vaccine beliefs and has repeatedly spread false or misleading claims regarding vaccines, fluoride and other topics. He gained national prominence in part because of his opposition to the childhood vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. Kennedy has pushed debunked claims that the vaccine was linked to autism.After the reports about Siri came out, Trump also said he’s a “big believer” of the polio vaccine in a December news conference.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Michael Collins\n\nWhat have senators said about Kennedy?\n\nWhen President Trump tapped Kennedy back in November to lead Health and Human Services, Republican senators appeared poised to see his confirmation through.\n\n“RFK Jr. has championed issues like healthy foods and the need for greater transparency in our public health infrastructure,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and chair of one committee vetting Kennedy, said in a statement at the time.\n\nHowever, in the two months since, some issues have put Kennedy’s confirmation in question.\n\nHis long-espoused anti-vaccine stance was scrutinized further after one of Kennedy’s top advisers called into question the widely accepted polio vaccination. Farm state senators, including Republicans, raised concerns about Kennedy’s objections to seed oils, pesticides and some other agricultural practices.\n\nAnd his equivocating stance on abortion may likely come up, as Kennedy’s more lenient approach runs counter to that of anti-abortion lawmakers.\n\n“I’m going to ask him about the life issues,” Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said in December. “Obviously, the first version of the Trump administration was very clear on what they thought about life, and they implemented that with HHS.”\n\nDemocrats will of course have a chance to ask questions this week too. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., ranking member of the committee holding Wednesday’s hearing, said they plan to hold his feet to the fire.\n\n“He’s made some outlandish statements,” Wyden told USA TODAY Tuesday. “We’re going to get to the bottom of it.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar and Riley Beggin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/29/rfk-vaccine-senate-confirmation-hearing/77783310007/", "title": "RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines, meds and food face scrutiny in Senate", "text": "WASHINGTON – Vaccines contributing to autism, antidepressants being linked to school shootings, and the dangers of ultra-processed food are expected to be among the flash-point topics at the confirmation hearings for Robert F.

He brought with him his newly minted Make America Healthy Again movement, which focused on chronic diseases, additives in processed food, chemicals in the environment and pharmaceutical drugs.Trump has also said he’d let Kennedy “go wild” on health, food and medicine.\n\nCourtney Luna, a mother of two and the author of \"Carnivore in the Kitchen\" said she had “high hopes” about Kennedy.\n\n“Our grocery stores (are) just filled with processed junk and dyes and chemicals,” she said. “You have food scientists that are creating these foods to hit that bliss point and make you addicted to them.\"\n\nDemocratic senators have called for pushback, alarmed by the prospect of Kennedy's candidacy.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote Kennedy a letter before his confirmation hearings, saying, “I am deeply concerned that you could influence the vaccine approval and recommendation process by putting vaccine skeptics on advisory committees and make life-saving vaccines less accessible to American families.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the Committee to Protect Health Care released an open letter signed by more than 15,000 doctors urging the Senate to reject Kennedy's nomination.\n\nKennedy has “a well-documented history of spreading dangerous disinformation on vaccines,” leaving “vulnerable communities unprotected and placing millions of lives at risk,” the letter says. “His appointment is a direct threat to the safety of our patients and the public at large.\"\n\nThe White House on Tuesday night cast doubt about the number of doctors who had signed the petition pointing to a Breitbart investigation, and calling it a \"hoax.\" The publication claimed it was able to sign up as \"Dr. Donald Duck, OG, of Disney World, FL, specializing in podiatry.\" The group \"accepts fake signatures\" the White House said.\n\nCaroline Kennedy, the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, and Kennedy's cousin, called him a \"predator\" in a letter she sent to senators ahead of the hearings. The letter was posted on Instagram by her son, Jack Schlossberg, on Tuesday.\n\n“I have known Bobby my whole life,\" Caroline Kennedy wrote. \"We grew up together. It’s no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator.\"\n\nShe said overseeing the Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, which are run by the Department of Health and Human Services, protect the \"most vulnerable amongst us\" and constitute an \"enormous responsibility, and one that Bobby is unqualified to fill.\"\n\n\"His views on vaccines are dangerous and willfully misinformed,\" she wrote. \"These facts alone should be disqualifying, but he has personal qualities related to this job, which for me pose even greater concern.\"\n\nRepublicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and a couple of GOP members told USA TODAY they were not worried about Kennedy’s chances of being confirmed.\n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said she was “very much in favor” of his nomination. Asked if she was worried he might push to ban some vaccines, Lummis said, “Heavens, no.”\n\n“I think he'll concentrate on childhood obesity, which is a huge issue for our country,” she said. “There's no reason that the United States, the wealthiest country on earth, with such a strong science background, should let this issue go unaddressed.”\n\nAn outspoken critic of popular anti-obesity drugs, Kennedy seems to have tempered his views on the topic. He recently told CNBC they “have a place” in battling obesity, but that the “first line of response should be lifestyle.”\n\nSen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, said he was not worried about Kennedy's stances or his prospects of confirmation.\n\n“I think he's going to do fantastic things. I think there's a lot of people who are really excited,” Moreno said. “At the end of the day, we have to look into some of the structural things that have never been questioned, around health and safety of Americans with our food supply.”\n\nMoreno said he was not worried about Kennedy's stances, including those on vaccines, because, he said, the nominees “understand their job is to serve the president's agenda, not their own personal agenda.”\n\n“If they go outside (Trump’s agenda), they’re going to get fired,” he added.\n\nKennedy comes from one of the most well-known political families in the U.S., and one that suffered many tragic losses in the public sphere. His father, Robert F. Kennedy, represented New York in the U.S. Senate and served as the attorney general to his brother President John F. Kennedy.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968.

Kailee remembers that when she and Cade met, it was “a connection at first sight.”\n\nA month after college graduation, Kailee and Cade married in Marble Falls, Texas. They’re both proud to be native Texans: Kailee’s family has lived there for generations, and Cade’s ancestors are among Texas’ “Old Three Hundred,” the original families that joined Stephen F. Austin to settle the area in the 1800s.\n\nAt the time, the DeSpains were both passionately anti-abortion.\n\n“I was just your quintessential pro-life Texan,” Kailee, 29, told CNN in a recent interview.\n\n“I was raised in central Texas by extremely Republican parents and grandparents,” Cade, 31, said. “One hundred percent pro-life.”\n\nKailee and Cade have supported abortion rights since 2016, when she had a miscarriage at 16 weeks and was hospitalized for severe complications, including blood clots and infection. It was one of three miscarriages she had in the early years of marriage.\n\n“It made me realize that pregnancy can be dangerous,” she said. “It made me think of my little sisters, and I wanted them to be able to have a choice if they ever had to go through something like that.”\n\nLast September, when a restrictive anti-abortion law took effect in Texas, Kailee pleaded on Facebook for people to contact their elected representatives to protect abortion rights.\n\nIn November, Kailee and Cade were overjoyed to learn that she was pregnant. Full of hope, they posted ultrasound pictures and a gender reveal video of a cannon shooting out blue confetti. They named their baby boy Finley.\n\nThen, about three months later, they learned that Finley had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. Carrying him to term put Kailee at high risk for severe pregnancy complications, including blood clots, preeclampsia and cancer.\n\nEven so, they could not get an abortion in Texas and fled to New Mexico.\n\n“I’ve never felt more betrayed by a place I was once so proud to be from,” Kailee said through tears.\n\n“How could you be so cruel as to pass a law that you know will hurt women and that you know will cause babies to be born in pain?” she added. “How is that humane? How is that saving anybody?”\n\nCNN emailed Texas lawmakers who authored or sponsored the state’s anti-abortion laws. None of them responded to CNN’s questions.\n\nA grim prognosis for their baby\n\nWhen Kailee and Cade found out she was pregnant, they desperately hoped for a “sticky baby” – a pregnancy that would stick – after her three miscarriages.\n\nBut after multiple ultrasounds, the doctors’ prognosis was grim: His heart, lung, kidney and brain problems were severe, and his genetic disorder, called triploidy, meant he had an extra set of chromosomes. The doctors said that either Finley would die before birth, or if he did make it to term, he would die a few minutes or at most an hour after birth.\n\nOne of their doctors told them, “Some of these things could be fixed, but all of these things together – this cannot be fixed,” Kailee remembers.\n\nShe says the doctor told them that before Texas’ six-week abortion ban went into effect in September of last year, she would have advised abortion as “the safest course for you [and] the most humane course of action for him.”\n\nBut the doctor said she could not offer them an abortion in Texas. She said the only option to get one was to travel out of state.\n\nRisk to Kailee’s life\n\nStaying pregnant with Finley could have put Kailee’s life in danger.\n\nShe has two blood clotting disorders, which put her at a higher risk for having dangerous blood clots during pregnancy. Plus, mothers of babies with triploidy are more likely to get preeclampsia, a potentially deadly pregnancy disorder. Also, there was an increased risk for a placental abnormality associated with cancer.\n\nKailee said she considered risking her own life to carry Finley to term.\n\n“I [wanted] to say goodbye,” she said. “I [wanted] a chance to hold him.”\n\nBut then she thought about how Finley would suffer as he struggled to breathe.\n\n“He’s going to suffocate, he’s going to die, and I’m going to watch him do it,” she said.\n\nFor Cade, there was only one option: It made no sense to him to risk his wife’s life to have a baby who was certain to die quickly.\n\nCade told Kailee, ” ‘I will support you whatever decision that you make, but I really don’t want to lose both of you, ’ ” Kailee remembers.\n\nThe couple opted for abortion, driving 10 hours to a clinic in New Mexico. The procedure and travel cost $3,500. They hoped their insurance would cover the procedure, but Texas law strictly limits abortion coverage, and the clinic told them their insurance company declined to pay.\n\nThe DeSpains didn’t have enough money – Kailee said she was docked pay at work because she’d had too many sick days – so Cade asked a relative he describes as “the epitome of the Trump fanboy” to give them the $3,500. The relative relented when Cade said that without the abortion, he could end up a widower at age 30.\n\nCade said he didn’t like asking for the money, but “my job as a husband is to protect and love my wife. If I’m not fighting to keep her here, then I failed.”\n\nKailee had the abortion in March, when she was 19 weeks pregnant.\n\n‘I’m still so angry and hurt’\n\nWhile legislators did not respond to CNN’s questions about Kailee’s case, the president of Texas Right to Life did.\n\nJohn Seago said that “Texas law is very clear about what circumstances that an abortion could be performed” and that “what happened to [Kailee] and the response of her physicians was absolutely a misrepresentation of the law. And this should never have happened.”\n\nBut Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center, said Texas’ abortion laws – the one that took effect last year and another one that went into effect last month – are not at all clear and are “designed to be purposely vague and broad.”\n\nThe more recent law, for example, says an abortion can be performed if the mother “has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”\n\n“They don’t spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided,” Keith said.\n\nKailee said her doctors told her they could give her an abortion only if she were at imminent risk of dying – essentially, if she were ” ‘dying on the table.’ ”\n\nIf a physician is found in violation of the law, the punishments can be severe: heavy fines, loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.\n\nPlus, citizens can file lawsuits against physicians they think have performed an illegal abortion, and if they win, they can get a $10,000 reward. If the citizen is wrong and the doctor wins the lawsuit, the doctor still has to pay their own legal fees, as Texas law specifically forbids doctors from recouping fees from plaintiffs.\n\n“Facing the potential to become a felon and face life in prison for simply trying to take care of patients has been horrifying, and I’d be lying if I said that I haven’t considered leaving the state,” said Dr. Leah Tatum, a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who practices in Austin, Texas, and has treated patients in similar situations to Kailee’s since the Texas anti-abortion laws passed.\n\nThe Texas law that went into effect last year barred most abortions at the onset of fetal cardiac activity, which can occur as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many people know they are pregnant. It was one of the earliest and most restrictive abortion laws. Laws that ban abortion or severely restrict the procedure have gone into effect in about a dozen states after the US Supreme Court ended a constitutional right to abortion on June 24.\n\nKailee says that the last time she saw her obstetrician, she advised her not to get pregnant in Texas.\n\n“She said ‘this is not safe,’ ” Kailee remembers. ” She said, ‘I need you to look at me. I need you to understand that if you get pregnant in Texas and that if you have complications, that I cannot intervene until I can prove that you’re going to die.’ ”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe DeSpains say they are thinking about leaving Texas, but it would be difficult to leave their work and their families.\n\nKailee said they’re sharing their story in hopes of increasing awareness so “that stories like mine can change enough voters’ perspectives.”\n\n“I’m still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,” she wrote on Facebook the day after the abortion. “Finley and I were simply collateral damage in a much bigger picture. It’s hard for me to wrap my head around the thought process of lawmakers that would rather a full-term baby suffocate to death than allow a mother to make a decision that spares her child that pain.”", "authors": ["Elizabeth Cohen Danielle Herman", "Elizabeth Cohen", "Danielle Herman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/congressional-gold-medal-january-6/index.html", "title": "Family of fallen officer snubs McCarthy and McConnell as Congress ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe family of a fallen officer snubbed top congressional Republicans on Tuesday at a ceremony held to honor law enforcement who defended the US Capitol during the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nIn a moment of apparent tension, the family of US Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who suffered strokes and died of natural causes one day after responding to the January 6 insurrection, refused to shake hands with either House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy or Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell when they accepted the medal.\n\nGladys Sicknick, mother of fallen officer Brian Sicknick, was asked by CNN why she didn’t shake McCarthy and McConnell’s hands at the gold medal ceremony.\n\n“They’re just two-faced,” she said to CNN. “I’m just tired of them standing there and saying how wonderful the Capitol police is and then they turn around and … go down to Mar-a-Lago and kiss his ring and come back and stand here and sit with – it just, it just hurts.”\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi of Calif., embraces former Washington Metropolitan Police Department officer Michael Fanone before the start of a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nWhile McCarthy has visited former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago several times, McConnell has been critical of Trump in the past and refused to side with the former president about the events of January 6, condemning him for his actions.\n\nMcConnell was asked about the incident later in the day on Tuesday. “I would respond by saying today we gave the gold medal to the heroes of January 6. We admire and respect them. They laid their lives on the line and that’s why we gave a gold medal today to the heroes of January 6.”\n\nCongressional leaders had gathered Tuesday in the Capitol Rotunda to present the Congressional Gold Medal – the highest honor Congress can bestow – to the officers of the US Capitol Police and the DC Metropolitan Police Department who defended the Capitol on January 6.\n\n“January 6 was a day of horror and heartbreak. It is also a moment of extraordinary heroism,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. “Staring down deadly violence and despicable bigotry, our law enforcement officers bravely stood in the breach ensuring that democracy survived on that dark day.”\n\n“So on behalf of the United States Congress and the American people, it is my honor to present the Congressional Gold Medal to the United States Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police and every hero of January 6, from every agent that responded that day.”\n\nThe Senate unanimously passed the legislation via voice vote, and while there was wide bipartisan support in the House for the awarding of the medals, 21 House Republicans voted against the legislation. The awarding of the medal comes just ahead of the House select committee investigating January 6 expecting to release their final report after an 18-month investigation of the insurrection.\n\nFour medals will be minted – one displayed at the headquarters of the US Capitol Police, one at MPD headquarters, another in the Capitol and a fourth will be sent to the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nUS Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger accepted the award on behalf of his force, and paid special tribute to the DC officers “who came to our aid that day.”\n\n“Words cannot adequately express our gratitude for what you did to help our officers by joining in the fight that was taking place,” Manger said.\n\nMcCarthy, who called on former President Donald Trump to “accept his share of responsibility” for the violence that was visited upon the Capitol but has since walked back those comments, said during the medal ceremony that “we are forever indebted” to the officers for their heroism, and that “today we take an important step towards repaying the debt.”\n\n“I hope every American will see this award and feel the gratitude for every law enforcement officer who answer the call of duty every day, but especially the Capitol Police officers and the MPD,” McCarthy said. “\n\nMetropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee acknowledged that for many officers that filled the Rotunda, the ceremony marked their first time in the Capitol since the insurrection.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger receives a medal from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony.

You did not give in. And yes, you were vastly outnumbered. But you were determined, exhausted and injured. It will show your sweat and your tears that mark these realms where we stand today,” Contee said. “You show the world just a glimpse of what we are.”\n\nUS Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, who was seen leading a mob away from the Senate chamber doors on January 6, was joined by fellow USCP Officer Harry Dunn, MPD Officers Daniel Hodges, and retired MPD officer Michael Fanone during the ceremony. The four have also testified before congressional committees about the events of that day.\n\nThe legislation awarding the medal named several individual officers, including Goodman, for their valor, and paid tribute to the officers who lost their lives to suicide in the days and weeks following the insurrection.\n\n“Capitol Police Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, Metropolitan Police Department Officer Jeffrey Smith, and those who sustained injuries, and the courage of Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, exemplify the patriotism and the commitment of Capitol Police officers, and those of other law enforcement agencies, to risk their lives in service of our country,” the bill text states.\n\nRep.

As each ship passes through, it takes with it millions of gallons of water that “gets sucked in from nearby lakes”.\n\nThis fresh water is vital for the canal to operate and there has always been enough – until now. Canal authorities said a longer dry season and a shorter rainy season this year have combined to create a water shortage.\n\nThe “highly unusual drought, right in the middle of Panama’s supposed wet season, has lowered water levels in two reservoirs that supply the canal”, said BBC Future. Operators have had to restrict the size and number of ships that pass through its system of locks each day, as well as the amount of cargo they are allowed to carry. The authorities have limited the number of crossings to about 32 a day instead of around 36.\n\nWhat does this mean for trade?\n\nSome $270 billion (£210 billion) worth of cargo normally passes along the canal each year on its way to over 170 countries, estimated the Journal of Shipping and Trade, so the stakes are high.\n\nThe goods that pass through the bottleneck include furniture, consumer goods or building materials, grain, oil and gas. In our “just-in-time” global economy, the markets trading these products and resources “can’t wait for long”, said the BBC.\n\nThe cost of shipping from China to the US Gulf Coast through the canal has “jumped more than a third since the end of June”, said Christine Murray, the Financial Times’ Mexico and Central America correspondent, on the FT News Briefing podcast. Waiting times for tankers carrying liquefied natural gas have increased from eight days to 18 days in “just a few weeks”.\n\nSo the delays mean shipping companies “incur more fees” and “the longer these delays go on”, their costs “go up”, said ABC News’ foreign correspondent Matt Rivers. “And as we saw during the pandemic, what happens when companies incur more costs? Do they eat it in the public good? No,” he added. Instead, they “just pass those costs right along to the consumer”.\n\nShipping companies are paying up to $2.4 million per vessel if they want to beat the “logjam” of carriers waiting to sail through canal, according to one company active in the market.\n\n“You can skip the queue but it’s immensely costly,” Oystein Kalleklev, chief executive of Avance Gas, told Bloomberg. He added that the price has “gone rapidly up” and “when you add the regular fee you’re getting close to $3 million to get your ships through”.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nOne option being considered to resolve the current issue of low water levels in the Panama Canal, said Murray, is to “build a new reservoir in a different region, which they say could mitigate the water issues until 2075”. “But obviously, it’s a very big project,” she said.\n\nLooking further ahead, the issue has raised questions about whether an alternative route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is needed. The BBC noted that, in the early 1900s before the Panama Canal was built, the US had two options: build a canal across Nicaragua, or through Panama. Although the Senate voted for the Panama option, the idea of a Nicaraguan canal has “never gone away”, it said. However, it would cost more than $40 billion according to estimates and there would “undoubtedly be environmental consequences associated with such a megaproject”.\n\nWriting for Al Jazeera, Belén Fernández said building the Panama Canal in the first place “encapsulated the recklessness and hubris of man’s efforts to dominate nature”.\n\nPanama might prove to be “a microcosm of capitalist self-combustion”, she wrote, but “the potential climate-related demise of a canal that never should have been constructed seems an apt metaphor for an entire system that never should have been”.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Harriet Marsden", "Rebekah Evans", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/09/01"}]}

The bronze bust likenesses of Amelia Boynton Robinson, a civil rights pioneer, and Pattie Ruffner Jacobs, the state’s leading suffrage activist in the early twentieth century, were unveiled Monday. Gov. Kay Ivey said the trailblazers worked to bring about “real and lasting change both in Alabama and in the nation. The statues are located at one of the entrances to the state archives and are passed by visitors, researchers and hundreds of students on field trips each year. A longtime civil rights activist, Boynton Robinson is perhaps best known as a leader in the movement in Selma. She was among those beaten during the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma in March 1965 that became known as “Bloody Sunday.” State troopers tear-gased and clubbed marchers. A newspaper photo featuring an unconscious Boynton Robinson drew wide attention to the movement. When the Voting Rights Act was signed into law on Aug. 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson invited Robinson to attend the signing as a guest of honor. Ruffner was the founder of the Alabama Equal Suffrage Association and a board member for Susan B. Anthony’s National American Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A federal report aimed at improving aviation safety in Alaska recommended improvements in providing weather information to pilots and continued work to update maps with information on mountain passes, among other steps. The Federal Aviation Administration, which released the report Thursday, said it will establish a team to outline plans for implementing the proposals. Several of the recommendations are underway, the agency said. The report came after the National Transportation Safety Board in early 2020 called for a comprehensive review to improve aviation safety in Alaska, citing a fatal and non-fatal accident rates far higher than the national average. Board Chair Jennifer L. Homendy in a statement called the FAA report “a step forward in addressing Alaska’s unique place in aviation safety. But more needs to be done to ensure air transportation is as safe in Alaska as in the rest of the nation. We look forward to reviewing the recommendations.” Matt Atkinson, president of Alaska Air Carriers Association, said despite progress that has been made, “there’s roughly 100 communities, numerous tour routes, mountain pass routes that lack basic aviation weather reporting, adequate communications infrastructure and other aspects that are necessary for safe operations in Alaska,” Alaska’s News Source reported.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An equipment failure caused a power outage at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Monday morning, impacting a significant amount of flights. Shortly after 8 a.m., Arizona Public Service notified the airport about a partial power outage that affected systems in several terminals, according to Eric Everts, spokesperson for Sky Harbor. Power was restored to Terminal 3 at 9 a.m. Monday but power was still out in Terminal 4 and a nearby checkpoint was closed, he said. The power was fully restored to the airport about 1:45 p.m., according to Everts. “All systems are quickly returning to regular operation. Passengers should continue to check flight status with their airline before coming to Sky Harbor. Delays are likely into the evening,” Everts said. “Sky Harbor had more than 200 delays, more than 90 cancellations and more than 15 inbound flights diverted to other airports. American and Southwest, our two busiest airlines, were the most severely impacted,” Everts said.\n\nArkansas\n\nFlippin: A $4.2\n\nmillion expansion at a northern Arkansas boat manufacturing operation is expected to add 50 jobs, officials said. Vexus Boats said it would add 30% more square footage to its operation in Flippin, about 105 miles north of Little Rock near the Missouri border. The company makes fishing boats. “Arkansans take pride in our state’s stunning scenery and its access to outdoor recreation, and we are excited to have a company like Vexus that exemplifies our passions and values here in the Natural State,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. “These 50 additional jobs will go a long way in improving the quality of life for families in Flippin.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Two California couples gave birth to each others’ babies after a mix-up at a fertility clinic and spent months raising children that weren’t theirs before swapping the infants, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles. Daphna Cardinale said she and her husband, Alexander, had immediate suspicions that the girl she gave birth to in late 2019 wasn’t theirs because the child had a darker complexion than they do. They suppressed their doubts because they fell in love with the baby and trusted the in vitro fertilization process and their doctors, Daphna said. Learning months later that she had been pregnant with another couple’s baby, and that another woman had been carrying her child, caused enduring trauma, she said. The Cardinales’ complaint accuses the Los Angeles-based California Center for Reproductive Health and its owner, Dr. Eliran Mor, of medical malpractice, breach of contract, negligence and fraud. It demands a jury trial and seeks unspecified damages. Yvonne Telles, the office administrator for the center, declined to comment on Monday. Mor could not be reached for comment. The two other parents involved in the alleged mix-up wish to remain anonymous and plan a similar lawsuit in the coming days, according to attorney Adam Wolf, who represents all four parents.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Police tweeted just after 6 a.m. Monday that a mountain lion was sighted in the vicinity of Mathews Street and Tulane Drive in central Fort Collins. An officer spotted the mountain lion crossing a road in the area at 3 a.m., according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. It is unknown if the mountain lion remains in the area. Mathews and Tulane run parallel to each other a couple blocks east of College Avenue and near Drake Road. O’Dea Elementary School, located at Tulane Drive and Princeton Road, and Morning Glory Preschool at Christ United Methodist Church, between Mathews Street and Tulane Drive south of Drake Road, are located in the area where the mountain lion was seen. Poudre School District schools did not have class Monday because of a teacher work day. Police advised people in the area to keep watch for children and small pets. Anyone who sees the mountain lion is asked to contact the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Northeast Region office at (970) 472-4300.\n\nConnecticut\n\nAnsonia: Gov. Ned Lamont said he has filed the necessary paperwork to begin the process of possibly running for a second term in the 2022 election. “I’ve got to make up my mind formally in the months to come, but I figure, let’s be prepared. Let’s file the paperwork. Let’s get this thing going,” Lamont said following a news conference about improvements to the Waterbury Branch of the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line. Although Lamont, 67, said he wasn’t ready to make a formal announcement, the Democrat sounded a lot like a candidate who will be on the 2022 ballot. “Look I love the job, I think we’re making a difference, I think the state is much better off today than it was four years ago,” Lamont said. His running mate, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, said she also filed the necessary paperwork to form a candidate committee for reelection. Much of Lamont’s time as Connecticut’s 89th governor has been spent dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. The state’s first positive case was announced on March 8, 2020, a little more than a year after he had begun his first term on Jan. 9, 2019.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: David Mann, board president of the Rehoboth Beach Museum, said at a city workshop meeting that the board would be willing to mount the iconic Dolle’s Candyland sign on the side of the museum. The future of the sign sparked an emotionally charged debate over the last several months after Dolle’s Candyland owner Tom Ibach moved his business from its original spot to a smaller shop a few doors down. Visitors to Rehoboth Beach would see the sign on the façade of the museum building as they head east into the city on Rehoboth Avenue. The museum ruled out placing the sign on top of its roof, largely because of concerns about the weight of the sign and a desire to have the sign facing west toward incoming traffic, according to Mann. The proposed solution came after Ibach offered to donate the sign to the city in September. Mayor Stan Mills clarified that Ibach was willing to donate the sign either to the city or the Rehoboth Beach Museum, but not to any other organizations or businesses. Before accepting Ibach’s donation though, the city agreed to conduct a feasibility study to determine the logistics and cost of moving the sign.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: For the first time in 16 years, Smithsonian’s National Zoo is celebrating the birth of golden-headed lion tamarin twins, WUSA-TV reported. Small Mammal House keepers reported for duty Oct. 7 and observed that 4-year-old mother Lola had given birth overnight and was caring for two infants. These babies are the first offspring for Lola and her partner Coco. Zoo visitors can view the golden-headed lion tamarin family at the Small Mammal House. Animal care staff closely monitor the family visually but leave Lola and Coco to bond with and care for their infants without interference. Keepers have observed Lola carrying and nursing the babies, which appear to be healthy and strong as they hold on to Lola as she explores their habitat. Because Lola is cradling the infants close to her body, it might be some time before keepers can determine their sexes. Native to the southern part of the state of Bahia, Brazil, golden-headed lion tamarins live in the tall evergreen broadleaf tropical forests and semi-deciduous forests along the Atlantic coast, the zoo said. The greatest threat facing this species is deforestation; they spend the majority of their time from 10 to 33 feet in the forest canopy. Much of their habitat has been cleared for agricultural use, including cattle ranching and cocoa plantations. Conservation scientists estimated only 6,000 golden-headed lion tamarins are left in the wild.\n\nFlorida\n\nPompano Beach: A Brightline commuter train hit a car carrying a woman and her grandchild Monday on the higher-speed line’s first day back in operation since the coronavirus pandemic began. The 71-year-old woman suffered some broken bones and the child did not appear to be seriously injured, Pompano Beach Fire and Rescue spokeswoman Sandra King told news outlets. They were both taken to a hospital. Television stations showed images of the woman’s crushed car at the intersection in Pompano Beach, which is north of Fort Lauderdale. The woman had made a right turn was was trying to cross the train tracks when the crash happened, King said. The train was heading south from West Palm Beach to the Fort Lauderdale station with Brightline officials, including President Patrick Goddard. He was scheduled to appear at an event in Fort Lauderdale marking the train’s return. The train travels at speeds of up to 79 mph through some of Florida’s most densely populated cities. The private company, which began operations in 2017 between West Palm Beach and Miami, suspended service in March 2020 shortly after the pandemic began. During the shutdown, Brightline has continued laying track for its planned expansion from South Florida to Orlando and its theme parks. That route is set to open in late 2022 or early 2023. Brightline then plans to open a line between Orlando and Tampa and one between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\nGeorgia\n\nRinggold: A north Georgia county on Tuesday will recount election votes after a local city council member requested the review because he lost his reelection bid by just three votes. The Chattanooga Times Free Press reported that veteran Ringgold City Council member Randall Franks faced off against incumbent council member Kelly Bomar and former council member Earl Henderson to fill two city council seats in last week’s election. Bomar took the lead with 285 votes, and Henderson beat Franks, 220-217, for the second spot, according to the newspaper. Catoosa County Elections Director Tonya Moore confirmed that a recount will be held Tuesday morning at Franks’ request. Georgia state law said a candidate can request a recount if the margin of the election outcome was decided by less than or equal to 0.5%. That request has to be made within two business days of the results being certified. Moore said the recount will be done by machine and said any other kind of recount, such as a hand recount, would require a court order.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A Big Island County Council resolution is asking state lawmakers to restrict the use of Hawaii location names on coffee packaging. The resolution, which passed unanimously last week, called for laws that would require coffee blends be at least 51% Hawaii-grown to use local geographic names such as Kona in their labeling, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Monday. Currently, distributors can use Hawaii names on coffee that has only 10% of beans grown in the named region. Hawaii coffee farmers testified at a meeting on Wednesday that the use of their regional names is limiting profits and damaging their brand. Ten percent “blends take millions of dollars each year from Hawaii family coffee farms, and that money is sent as excess profits to the owners of the … blenders on the mainland,” said Big Island coffee farmer Bruce Corker. “When consumers are misled into believing that ‘Kona’ blends are (genuine) Kona coffee, and they are disappointed by the taste of those blends, our heritage coffees … are permanently damaged,” Corker said. Hundreds of Kona coffee farmers filed a class action lawsuit against major coffee sellers in 2019 for falsely advertising coffee blends. Some of those companies have offered preliminary settlements totaling more than $13\n\nmillion, the Tribune-Herald reported.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A first-term Republican representative is the only elected official from the Legislature in a reconfigured district in southwestern Idaho, and has announced he will run for a now-open Senate seat. Rep. Ben Adams of Nampa made the announcement on social media on Sunday. Adams is in District 13 but the legislative map approved last week by the six-person, bipartisan Idaho Commission for Reapportionment puts him in District 12 for the next election. Adams is among the more conservative lawmakers in the House, and if elected to the Senate would likely tilt the chamber to the right. The District 12 Senate seat is held by Republican Sen. Todd Lakey, who is in his fifth term. Lakey, who has been active in getting legislation through the Senate on everything from gun rights to a law shielding Idaho businesses, schools and government entities from lawsuits if someone catches COVID-19, didn’t immediately return a call from the Associated Press on Monday.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Federal agents have seized 220 pounds of cocaine in Chicago. Three people were arrested, and a private plane was seized as part of last Wednesday’s operation, the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Northern District of Illinois said Monday in a release. The cocaine was part of a suspected Mexico-to-Chicago drug pipeline. About 176 pounds were found in a vehicle in the city’s River North neighborhood, and another 44 pounds were taken from a hotel room along Chicago’s Gold Coast, according to criminal complaints filed in federal court. The drugs allegedly had been flown into an airport in Gary, Indiana, earlier Wednesday from Houston. The flight originated southwest of Mexico City in Toluca, Mexico. A 30-year-old man from Toluca and a 25-year-old man from Columbus, Indiana, were arrested Wednesday in downtown Chicago. A 39-year-old Indianapolis man was arrested Thursday. A warrant was obtained Monday to seize the plane, a Bombardier Challenger 600 business jet.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Initial testing has shown the presence of lead in debris samples collected following the controlled burn of a house during a firefighter training exercise in southern Indiana. The controlled burn was Friday in Bloomington and area residents noticed and collected what appeared to be pieces of paint debris during and after the burn, the city said Monday in a release. Bloomington fire crews have been going door-to-door surveying residents about the debris. The fire department was coordinating with the state’s Department of Environmental Management to implement remediation recommendations and was working to identify and contract a company to clean up the area. Owners of the house had secured a demolition permit and donated the structure for the firefighter training. It was reviewed and approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, according to the city. All utilities were disconnected and potentially toxic contents and components of the house, including furniture, carpeting, asphalt roofing shingles, roofing underlayment, and vinyl siding, were removed prior to the controlled burn, the city said. Children and pets should be kept away from the paint debris, according to local health officials.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: A Kansas woman was arrested on felony changes Sunday for allegedly driving over and ramming her former landlord’s downtown Sioux City property with a van. Valerie Marrero, 25, of Liberal, Kansas, is charged with two counts of second-degree criminal mischief, a class D felony, and eluding, a serious misdemeanor. She was held at Woodbury County jail on $7,500 bond. According to a criminal complaint filed in Woodbury County District Court, Marrero was upset with a landlord for not taking care of a property in the 800 block of Nebraska Street, where she had been staying. At 11:19 p.m., Marrero intentionally drove a white 1994 Ford Econoline van through yards in the area and struck fencing belonging to the landlord. Officers located the van traveling westbound in the 500 block of Ninth Street, where the landlord also owns property. Marrero drove over the north curb and struck a dumpster, backed up and drove north through a private drive. She struck a chain-link fence, running it over, and, then, struck a chain-link gate that blocks off the parking lot, according to the complaint. The damage is estimated at $5,000.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shawnee County has 59 bridges in need of repair or corrective action, according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. None is designated unsafe. “If we had any bridges that were unsafe, the road would be closed,” Shawnee County Public Works director Curt Niehaus said. Bridges are flagged for needing to be repaired for two primary reasons: It is either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. A bridge is considered structurally deficient when it isn’t recommended to carry federal legal loads like box trucks, school buses, dump trucks and tractor trailers. “It does not mean that it (the bridge) is at risk of collapse or failure,” Niehaus said. “It’s not unsafe. It just means it’s not ideally suited to carry legal loads every day. Most of our bridges don’t carry loads that heavy every day.” Bridges are determined to be functionally obsolete by being too narrow along with having a high traffic count, and as a city’s population grows, more vehicles drive over the bridge each day than for which it was designed.\n\nKentucky\n\nRussell: A new bridge in northeastern Kentucky is expected to open this month, replacing a 1930s-era viaduct and easing congestion at the approach to an Ohio River bridge, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said. The new Kentucky 244 and “flyover” design bridge into downtown Russell are scheduled to be fully opened the week of Nov. 15. Gov. Andy Beshear ceremonially cut the ribbon last week. The project caps a $110\n\nmillion Ohio-Kentucky investment that began in 2012 when ground was broken on the $80\n\nmillion Ironton, Ohio-Russell bridge. That bridge opened five years ago\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Management of the nearly century-old Louisiana Old Governor’s Mansion in downtown Baton Rouge has been transferred to Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin’s office. The governor’s Division of Administration has entered into an agreement shifting control of the mansion to the secretary of state’s office, which already runs the Old State Capitol down the street, the State Archives and seven other museum facilities. “I am excited about the addition of the Old Governor’s Mansion, which complements and accentuates the mission of the Old State Capitol, providing visitors and event-goers a tangible opportunity to experience our history first hand,” Ardoin said in a statement. The Division of Administration previously had contracted with the Foundation for Historical Louisiana Inc. to manage the Old Governor’s Mansion, which has been rented out for weddings and other large events. The Advocate reported the former home for Louisiana’s governors was built by former Gov. Huey P. Long as a copy of the White House. Using inmate labor, Long tore down and replaced in 1929 the traditional homestead that had existed for the state’s chief executive since 1887. Nine governors and their families lived at the site until 1962, when Gov. Jimmie Davis moved into the current Governor’s Mansion near the state Capitol.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: M.J. “Sunny” Eberhart, 83, of Alabama strode into the record books Sunday as the oldest hiker to complete the 2,193-mile Appalachian Trail. Eberhart, known by the trail name Nimblewill Nomad, acknowledged that despite having tens of thousands of miles under his belt, the trail was tough going at his age, leading to quite a few spills on slippery rocks. “I’ve a got a couple of skid marks on me, but I’m OK,” he said in a recent interview. “You’ve got to have an incredible resolve to do this.” He hiked the trail out of order, in sections, to take advantage of optimal weather, and had completed northern sections, including Maine’s Mount Katahdin. He completed his final section in western Massachusetts, in the town of Dalton, in the same year in which a 5-year-old became among the youngest to complete the feat. Joining Eberhart for the finish was the former record-holder, Dale “Greybeard” Sanders, who lives outside Memphis, Tennessee. He completed the hike at age 82 in 2017. Jordan Bowman, of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, confirmed that Eberhart is the oldest to finish the trail, surpassing Sanders.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Baltimore County officials said hey expect their only active landfill will become inoperable within the decade – sooner than previously estimated – and the only way to expand the facility without wiping out scores of homes is to build upward. A work group has been meeting since last year to recommend changes to the county’s long-term solid waste strategy. Several options were laid out in the group’s September report, including a vertical expansion of the Eastern Sanitary Landfill in White Marsh. Expanding vertically could extend the life of the landfill by 11 to 48 years, but it comes with drawbacks. The work group recommends the county consider spending $750,000 in the coming years to study and plan the expansion, estimated to cost between $63\n\nmillion and $162\n\nmillion to build. Fourteen out of 17 work group members agreed the option should be a priority for the county. The site has grown “a couple of hundred feet in height” in the last four decades, said Stephen Simmons with the Virginia-based solid waste consulting firm Gershman, Brickner & Bratton. The work group did not recommend building a new landfill site elsewhere. The 375-acre landfill was built in the 1980s and includes two transfer stations and recycling drop-off. It has been penalized in the past been for long-standing water pollution and solid waste violations but is now up to code. When it was built, the expected life span of a landfill was around 30 years.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWinchendon: A veterans organization sold an original 1945 Norman Rockwell painting for $3.6 million at auction over the weekend in order to raise funds after years of dwindling revenue made worse by the pandemic. American Legion Post 193, located in Winchendon, acquired the painting through a donation in 1959 from a local priest’s art collection. Coral May Grout, a former Post president, said that after weighing whether to sell for nearly two decades, it was time, The Telegram & Gazette reported. “Home for Thanksgiving” depicts a soldier seated beside his mother, who looks at him lovingly while he peels potatoes. It was commissioned for the November 24, 1945, issue of The Saturday Evening Post. The auction listing described the painting as “the tale of the first Thanksgiving after the Allies’ victory.” The artwork hung near the Legion’s main door for years, with most members assuming it was a reproduction. They got the painting appraised in the early 1980s after someone offered to buy it for $500, the newspaper said. The Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge has since kept it safe, occasionally displaying it in special exhibits.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The annual observance of the Edmund Fitzgerald shipwreck will be held in-person and livestreamed from Mariners’ Church in downtown Detroit. The Great Lakes Memorial service starts at 3 p.m. Sunday and remembers the lives lost in the roughly 6,000 shipwrecks on record in lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario. It will be broadcast over YouTube for people unable to attend. Last year was the first time the service was livestreamed, and it attracted more than 1,200 viewers, organizers said. One of the most notable and tragic wrecks occurred on Nov. 10, 1975 when the S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald sank during a storm on Lake Superior. The vessel was carrying a load of iron ore pellets to a Detroit steel mill when it plunged to the bottom, 17 miles from Whitefish Point in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. All 29 crewmen were lost. Singer and songwriter Gordon Lightfoot’s “Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” tells the tale of the sinking and the power of the massive inland lake.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State pollution officials on Monday released a proposed impaired waters list for 2022, an update that included the addition of 15 northeastern and central Minnesota water bodies where fish have been contaminated with long-lasting chemicals. The 15 were added because of contamination with a family of widely used chemicals known as PFAS, sometimes called “forever chemicals” because of their inability to break down. It’s the first time water bodies outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul area have made the list because of PFAS contamination. A PFAS compound known as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS, can accumulate in fish and potentially cause adverse health effects in people who consume them. The waters include several bodies east of the Twin Cities metro area where the chemicals – used by Maplewood-based 3M to make products resistant to heat, oil, stains, grease and water – entered the area’s groundwater after decades of dumping into landfills. Three lakes downstream from an active cleanup site at the Duluth International Airport were also found to have high levels of PFOS, which has been used in firefighting foam.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: WDAM reported a mural commissioned by the Hattiesburg Alliance for Public Art has been unveiled in the city’s downtown. The mural, titled “Spread Your Wings,” features a green-and-blue hummingbird beating its wings. The bird was painted by Avery Orendorf of Austin, Texas, and was painted on the side of a building that houses the Fairley’s Wings restaurant. The owner of the restaurant, Nick Fairley, said the mural was a great addition to the downtown. The television station reported the hummingbird mural is the 30th to go up in the city and is one of 45 stops on the city’s public art trail. Orendorf it took three days to paint the mural.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The city’s Board of Education voted to approve a continuation of the mask requirement by a unanimous vote. With child vaccines scheduled to start, the mandate might end in January.” Good news is coming,” said Superintendent Brian Yearwood, who added he hopes the district will receive guidance to remove masking requirements after elementary students have an opportunity to receive the vaccine. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt is suing the school district over its mask mandate, though he didn’t succeed in making it a class-action lawsuit with a ruling applying to all Missouri school districts.\n\nMontana\n\nFort Harrison: A Montana soldier is the first woman to graduate from the U.S. Army’s sniper course, the Montana National Guard announced. “We are extremely proud of this soldier’s achievement and recognize that this is a milestone for not only Montana, but the entire National Guard and Army,” Maj. Gen. J. Peter Hronek, the adjutant general for Montana, said in a statement Monday. The military is not identifying her at this time. The soldier enlisted in the Montana Army National Guard in December 2020 and underwent a 22-week training course at Fort Benning in Georgia that combines Army basic training with advanced individual training in infantry skills. Her training staff recommended she be given the opportunity to attend the sniper course after she qualified as an expert shooter, Hronek said. She began the U.S. Army sniper course in September and graduated on Nov. 5. The course trains soldiers to deliver long-range precision fire and to collect battlefield information. Now that her sniper training is completed, she will rejoin her Montana National Guard unit.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Five teenagers were arrested early Monday after shots were fired from their car at police during a chase from Omaha, east into Iowa and back into Omaha. Omaha police said that five people arrested were a woman who turned 19 on Monday, an 18-year-old man, two 17-year-old boys and a 15-year-old boy. One of the juvenile offenders was treated for a minor injury and released. No officers were injured, police said. Police said they were called to an area in north Omaha just after midnight by a report of shots being fired. An officer driving an unmarked car saw a vehicle driving erratically and attempted to follow it when someone in the vehicle fired at the officer, police said. A chase ensued, police said, with the Omaha police’s air unit and other area law enforcement agencies involved.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The Carson Ranger District and the Carson Valley Trails Association are planning just over 8 miles of new, nonmotorized trails for the Jacks Valley area. The trails will connect the Jacks Valley North Trailhead to James Lee County Park in the Indian Hills community in south Carson City. The trails will also include an optional loop through the southern part of the Jacks Valley Wildlife Management Area. Construction is set to start this year and wrap up in 2022. Plans for an expansion to the trail system in the Jacks Valley area – part of the Clear Creek Trail system – has been in the works for more than a decade. The 15-mile-long Clear Creek Trail connects Jacks Valley Trailhead to the Spooner South Trailhead. Opened in 2014, it traverses through Forest Service and private land and Douglas County and Nature Conservation easements.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State officials warned residents about reports of scammers sending out a fraudulent letter that appears to be from the attorney general’s office and claims that the recipient’s identity has been used by someone to buy products online. The letter also claimed the attorney general’s office is investigating the “unsanctioned transaction” and warned the recipient that accounts linked with their Social Security number will be shut down unless the recipient buys gift cards and sends cash, the attorney general’s office said. Attorney General John Formella said in a statement that his office will never send correspondence to identity fraud victims, or any other crime victims, threatening to shut down the victim’s accounts or demanding gift card purchases. The matter is being investigated by the office’s Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Republican Jack Ciattarelli’s campaign denied there was fraud in this year’s governor’s election but his campaign’s attorney said the margin could shrink enough to warrant a recount. The statement from Ciattarelli’s campaign came after the Associated Press declared Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy the winner last week. Murphy’s lead has grown from less than a percentage point last week to about 2.6 points by Monday, as votes continue to be counted. The difference amounts to more than 65,000 votes. “Let me be clear, no one on this team is alleging fraud or malfeasance, as we have not seen any credible evidence of that,” said Ciattarelli’s legal counsel Mark Sheridan in a statement. But Sheridan added that this year’s new election law, which in part allowed early in-person voting for the first time, is also contributing to what he called “excruciatingly slow vote counting.” The campaign estimated there are about 70,000 provisional ballots – which only count after officials determine that the voter has not already cast another ballot – left to count, along with an unknown number of mail-in ballots. Each of New Jersey’s 21 counties are conducting their own count of any mail-in and provisional ballots left to be counted. The state Board of Canvassers doesn’t meet until Dec. 2 to certify the results.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: New Mexico State University and Bosque Brewing Company collaborated again to produce another university licensed alcoholic beverage. The 1888 Hard Seltzer is available in Bosque locations across the state. NMSU previously collaborated with Bosque Brewing Company on the popular Pistol Pete’s 1888 Ale, which was released in 2017. The beer is available at more than 300 locations statewide and won a bronze medal at the 2018 Great American Beer Festival. Following the ale, Aggie Athletics has licensed its wine, liquor and coffee, earning $36,000 from selling the products in the past fiscal year. NMSU is now the second university in the nation to feature a collegiately licensed hard seltzer, according to a news release. The 1888 Hard Seltzer is a cranberry tea-flavored hard seltzer which compliments Bosque Brewing Company’s line of New Leaf hard seltzers, according to the release.\n\nNew York\n\nUpper Nyack: A leading art historian diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease was found dead by police in the woods of Nyack Beach State park on Monday after having gone missing on Nov. 3. Neighbors, residents and police had been searching for Richard Kendall, 75, after he went missing from his home in Nyack, the Journal News reported. Orangetown Captain James Brown said Kendall’s body was found about 4:30 p.m. Monday. He thanked everyone who participated in the search. A statewide Silver Alert had been issued for him. Police said they were investigating the death but did not consider it suspicious. Kendall was a specialist in the impressionist movement and an expert on French artist Edgar Degas, most famous for his paintings of ballet dancers. He published multiple books on the movement with Yale University Press, according to its website. He had served as curator-at-large at Clark Art Institute in Massachusetts, and had worked on exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as the Tate Gallery and the National Gallery in England, the newspaper reported. Multiple other local, county and state agencies had participated in the search for Kendall.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKinston: Two juveniles are facing criminal charges after one tried to back a vehicle over a police officer and led others on a chase before they were captured. The Kinston Police Department said in a news release that officers checked out what was described as a suspicious vehicle early Monday. When the officers tried to find out why they were there, the driver tried to back over one of the officers, who was able to get out of the way and avoid injury, police said. Officers attempted to the stop the vehicle as it went through several parking lots and headed east on U.S. Highway 70, police said, After the chase reached speeds of 120 mph, the supervisor called it off. Deputies from Lenoir and Jones counties spotted the vehicle but couldn’t stop it. Craven County sheriff’s deputies located the vehicle and stopped it approximately 35 miles away in New Bern when the driver lost control, the news release said. The juveniles were returned to Kinston, and the police department said they face charges including assault with a deadly weapon, felony flee to elude and a number of motor vehicle violations.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A $500,000 federal grant will help farmers in North Dakota cope with stress brought on by drought conditions, reduced commodity prices and other difficulties. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture is providing the grant money for North Dakota’s effort through the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network. “Creating and expanding a network to assist farmers and ranchers in times of stress can increase behavioral health awareness, literacy, and positive outcomes for agricultural producers, workers and their families,” institute Director Carrie Castille said in a statement. The state Agriculture Department plans to partner with North Dakota State University and the North Dakota Department of Career and Technical Education on programs dealing with behavioral health counseling and referral for other forms of assistance, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The USDA is providing nearly $25\n\nmillion nationwide in 50 grants supporting network projects.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide whether Gov. Mike DeWine had the legal ability to end the state’s participation in a federal pandemic unemployment aid program ahead of a government deadline for stopping the payments. At issue before the court is a weekly $300 federal payment for Ohioans to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government ended that program Sept. 6, but DeWine stopped the payments June 26, saying the need for the payments had ended. DeWine, a Republican, followed the position of business groups that said the weekly payment was making it difficult to recruit employees. Critics of ending the payments said workers had multiple reasons why they might not be returning to jobs. A county judge rejected a lawsuit’s claimed DeWine didn’t have the authority to stop the payments, but the 10th Ohio District Court of Appeals reversed that ruling. Ending the program early stopped about $900\n\nmillion in Ohio payments. The two parties disagree on whether that money could still be paid, should the court rule against DeWine. The Ohio Supreme Court voted 4-2 to take the case, with Justice Patrick DeWine, the governor’s son, recusing himself to avoid the appearance of impropriety “that might result from my father’s public involvement in this case.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma County Commissioner Kevin Calvey said he is running for district attorney. Calvey, 55, is the fourth Republican to announce for the 2022 race to become the county’s top prosecutor. He vowed, if elected, to drop “bogus” criminal cases against police officers involved in fatal incidents. He directly criticized retiring DA David Prater . “Unlike our current DA leadership, I will support the police, not persecute them,” Calvey said. Calvey also addressed a pending first-degree manslaughter charge against five Oklahoma City police officers. The officers are charged in the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old robbery suspect last year. The suspect, Stavian Rodriguez, was shot about 7 p.m. Nov. 23 after he had dropped a gun outside Okie Gas Express in south Oklahoma City. An autopsy found he had been hit by gunfire 13 times, according to affidavits filed with the charge. “That case ... is a wrongful and malicious prosecution of police officers who defended each other and the public from a violent thug,” Calvey said. “My first day in office, I will dismiss those charges and other wrongful charges against law enforcement, and open an investigation as to how such bogus charges could have happened. The current DA’s hand-picked successor, Gayland Gieger, lacks the moral courage to stand up to his boss on this malicious prosecution of police officers.”\n\nOregon\n\nMonmouth: Three gravestones were placed near Bellamy Hall on Western Oregon University’s main campus over the weekend to memorialize the termination of three traditional majors – anthropology, geography and philosophy. This time last year, the university’s board of trustees approved an adjusted 2021 budget, which required an update on fall 2020 enrollment numbers. Several positions and programs at Western were to be reduced and eliminated to curb a growing concern for the institution’s financial stability. Western is the state’s oldest public university and serves nearly 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The university opened its new Salem campus in September. The institution’s original budget for this academic year, initially adopted at the board’s June 2020 meeting, was based on a projected enrollment decrease of 2.5%, officials said. But because of the COVID-19 pandemic and “many other factors,” officials reported enrollment was actually down by 7.9%, resulting in a decrease in revenue. School leaders decided cuts in spending, salaries and other expenses would be used to cover the deficit. The university planned to reduce or eliminate nearly three dozen full-time equivalent positions and programs, including the elimination of a major or minor in anthropology, a major in philosophy and the entire master’s in music and master’s in information technology programs.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMcCandless: When the monks of the Pittsburgh Buddhist Center needed a major restoration of its outdoor statue of the Buddha, they turned to an auto restoration shop specializing in classic cars. This partnership of ancient Asian spirituality and modern American craftsmanship came to fruition recently with the reinstallation of the newly refurbished, gleaming white statue at the center’s temple. Eyes closed and sitting in the lotus position, the Buddha underwent weeks of painstaking work at Exoticars in the town of McCandless, north of Pittsburgh. The statue sat amid an array of vintage vehicles from Bentleys and Corvettes to Porsches and a 1951 Ford pickup. Workers stripped multiple coats of deteriorating paint and primer – a task that required precision tools as they worked on the Buddha’s hair, depicted in detailed curls. They also repaired cracks in the fiberglass, added a metal strip to strengthen the statue’s base and put on a new coat of white auto body paint, giving it a glasslike sparkle in the sunshine. The repair job fascinated customers and also the classic car enthusiasts who bring old hot rods and sports cars of their own to Friday evening happy hours hosted by the shop, according to Exoticars co-owner Dave Ley.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island is getting a $10.6 million boost from the federal government to help the state’s tourism and hospitality industry recover from the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Daniel McKee said. The grant from the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration will be used to support projects, businesses and jobs in the travel, tourism, and outdoor recreation sectors, he said in a statement. “This sector has been severely impacted by the pandemic, and these funds will go a long way in ensuring this sector not only bounces back but is even stronger going forward,” McKee said. More than 26\n\nmillion people visited the state in 2019, pumping $7\n\nbillion into the economy and generating $843\n\nmillion in state and local tax revenue. That fell to 21.6\n\nmillion visitors in 2020, spending $4.9\n\nbillion and generating $597\n\nmillion in state and local taxes, according to the state’s tourism agency. The state’s grant proposal included boosting advertising and marketing to attract new overnight visitors, and development of new attractions and events to boost visitation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: The city said a city-owned waste barrel had made a 3,500-mile trek across the Atlantic Ocean and washed up in County Mayo on Ireland’s northwestern coast. According to the city, Keith McGreal of Ireland wrote them and shared pictures of the bright blue barrel with city stickers on it. “I wanted to share some images of a Blue Trash barrel that has been washed up on our local beach on the West Coast of Ireland, Mulranny, County Mayo,” McGreal wrote, according to an exchange the city posted online. “We spotted the stickers and thought it would make a good news story.” The city posted the photos online, showing that the barrel’s Atlantic crossing took enough time for it to be encrusted with shells. City officials also wrote McGreal, saying the barrel must have been carried away in the Gulf Stream during a major wind or storm event.“We typically remove trash containers from the beach before a hurricane, but this one apparently had a mind of its own,” they said, adding that they “already had a city employee volunteer to come fetch it.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state House launched an investigation Tuesday into whether the state’s attorney general should be impeached for his conduct surrounding a car crash last year that killed a pedestrian. A sizable majority of the Republican-dominated House voted to have a committee prepare a report and recommend whether Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg should be impeached. It could take weeks for the committee of seven Republicans and two Democrats to delve into the crash investigation. The committee is a mix of Ravnsborg’s political allies and those who have called for his ouster. Ravnsborg, a Republican who was elected to his first term in 2018, pleaded no contest in August to two misdemeanors in the crash that killed 55-year-old Joseph Boever, who was walking along a rural stretch of highway when Ravnsborg struck him with his car. Ravnsborg has insisted that he did not realize he killed a man until he returned to the scene the next day and discovered his body. House lawmakers said they first wanted to know whether Ravnsborg could be impeached for his misdemeanor convictions, the fact that he killed a man, or that law enforcement associations have said they no longer have confidence in his office.The state constitution stipulates that officials such as the attorney general can be impeached for “corrupt conduct, malfeasance or misdemeanor in office.” But a state official has never been impeached in South Dakota. Gov. Kristi Noem, who has called for Ravnsborg to resign, has delivered a hard drive containing the crash investigation to Gosch, but he said the committee would subpoena the crash investigation from the Department of Public Safety “just to ensure accuracy.” Ravnsborg’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the House’s move.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A judge on Tuesday resentenced a death row inmate to life in prison for the second time in two years, after finding the man’s trial was marred by racism during jury selection. In his order, Judge Monte Watkins vacated the conviction of Abu-Ali Abdur’Rahman after finding his Constitutional right to a fair trial had been violated. Then the trial court judge accepted a plea agreement in which Abdur’Rahman pleaded guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder and armed robbery for which he received three consecutive life sentences, according to the court order. If the resentencing is not challenged, Abdur’Rahman will spend the rest of his life in prison but without the threat of execution. Abdur’Rahman was originally sentenced to die in 1987 for the murder of Patrick Daniels, who was stabbed to death. Norma Jean Norman was also stabbed but survived. The stabbing took place in Norman’s house while her two young daughters, Katrina and Shawanna, huddled in a back bedroom. The state Attorney General’s Office could still appeal Abdur’Rahman’s resentencing. That’s what happened in 2019, the first time Watkins threw out Abdur’Rahman’s death sentence. The 2019 resentencing came after Abdur’Rahman, who is Black, petitioned to reopen his case, presenting evidence that prosecutors at his trial treated Black potential jurors differently from white potential jurors.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: Project Bravo is providing funding for people who are behind on natural gas and energy bills, but the deadline to apply is Friday. The funds are available through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federally funded program that helps households pay a portion of their home energy costs, according to a Project Bravo news release. “The funding can pay more than just your natural gas bill, and it is not a loan, rather money dedicated for utility assistance,” said Elizabeth O’Hara, Texas Gas Service community relations manager. Texas Gas Service is promoting the program. The funds can be used to pay energy bills for up to 12 months, up to a maximum household benefit of $1,600. The level of benefit varies according to household income, the number of people living in the home, the type of residence, the type of heating fuel and utility rates. To apply, visit projectbravo.org and for more information, call (915) 562-4100.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Republican lawmakers gave an early nod of approval to redistricting maps that further carve up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County, despite urging from a crowd to choose districts drawn by a voter-approved independent body. Many speakers argued the lawmaker-drawn maps were aimed at further diluting the political voice of those who live in and around the state capital, a process known broadly as gerrymandering. Lawmakers, though, said their districts are aimed at reflecting the state as a whole by including urban and rural voters. Many people speaking at a legislative hearing, though, said putting Salt Lake County into four districts rather than the three it’s currently in would further drown out dissenting voices. Utah is overall a reliably Republican state, but its 4th Congressional district has flipped between Republicans and Democrats. The lawmaker-drawn maps are generally considered to make that district more reliably conservative.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: The explosives license for the owner of a Castleton quarry has been revoked after blasting this summer ejected rocks onto adjacent properties, risking public safety, the Vermont Department of Public Safety said. An investigation by the department, police and the State Fire Marshal’s Office, found that nearby residents were not given adequate advance notice about the July 16 blasting and no blasting mat was used, the department said. Public Safety Commissioner Michael Schirling sent a letter to the quarry owner on Oct. 29, revoking his explosives license. The quarry owner could pursue a future license if he undergoes agreed-upon training and an examination demonstrating his competency to safely handle and use explosives, Schirling wrote. The quarry owner has 15 days to appeal the decision, the department said. He could not be reached for comment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Days after Democrats conceded control of the Virginia House of Delegates to Republicans, they walked back that concession as two key races in which the GOP holds razor-thin leads appeared headed for recounts. As of Tuesday, vote counts showed Republicans with 50 seats and holding slight leads in two additional seats that have still not been called by the Associated Press. Democrats have 47 seats and are leading in one other district that has not been called. In both districts where Republicans are leading, the margins are below 0.5%, which allows candidates to request state-funded recounts. In District 91, Democrat incumbent Del. Martha Mugler conceded to Republican challenger A.C. Cordoza on Friday. Mugler’s concession was quickly followed by a statement from Democratic House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, who acknowledged that with Mugler’s concession, the Republicans had control of the House, with 51 seats. But Mugler walked back her concession over the weekend after final absentee and provisional ballots were totaled and Cordoza’s lead shrunk to just 94 votes out of 27,388 counted. In House District 85, Republican challenger Karen Greenhalgh’s lead over Democratic incumbent Del. Alex Askew narrowed to just 127 votes out of 28,413 counted after final absentee and provisional ballots were totaled.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A metallurgist pleaded guilty to fraud Monday after she spent decades faking the results of strength tests on steel that was being used to make U.S. Navy submarines. Elaine Marie Thomas, 67, of Auburn, Washington, was the director of metallurgy at a foundry in Tacoma that supplied steel castings used by Navy contractors Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding to make submarine hulls. From 1985 through 2017, Thomas falsified the results of strength and toughness tests for at least 240 productions of steel – about half the steel the foundry produced for the Navy, according to her plea agreement, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Tacoma. The tests were intended to show that the steel would not fail in a collision or in certain “wartime scenarios,” the Justice Department said. There was no allegation that any submarine hulls failed, but authorities said the Navy had incurred increased costs and maintenance to ensure they remain seaworthy. The government did not disclose which subs were affected. Thomas faces up to 10 years in prison and a $1\n\nmillion fine when she is sentenced in February. However, the Justice Department said it would recommend a prison term at the low end of whatever the court determines is the standard sentencing range in her case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican Delegate Josh Higginbotham has resigned from his seat after moving to Kanawha County. Higginbotham, 25, submitted a resignation letter Friday to House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, saying he no longer lives in the district he was elected to represent, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported. He represented House District 13, which includes portions of Putnam, Mason and Jackson counties. First elected in 2016, Higginbotham said in September that he would run for a Senate seat. Under the district map adopted last month by the Legislature, his new residence would put him in Senate District 8. “From Day One, my goal has been to make West Virginia a place where young adults can find jobs that affords them a chance to stay in West Virginia and raise their families,” Higginbotham said in the letter. “While there is still more work to be done, I truly believe over the last six years West Virginia has made great progress toward that goal.” Gov. Jim Justice will appoint a delegate from a list of recommendations to fill the rest of Higginbotham’s term, which ends next year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nCamp Douglas: Col. Leslie Zyzda-Martin has been relieved of her duties as commander of Volk Field Air National Guard Base at Camp Douglas. The National Guard said in a statement that Brig. Gen. David W. May ended Zyzda-Martin’s command Monday because of “lost confidence in her ability to lead.” “This is a very difficult decision, but it is the right thing to do in the best interest of Volk Field,” May said. “The men and women that make up Volk Field are extraordinary at what they do. It is my obligation to ensure they have the type of leadership that will meet the unique needs and challenges of our state and federal missions.” The guard’s statement said the decision was made following investigations that revealed issues concerning command climate and alleged misconduct. Additional investigations are ongoing. The move is in sharp contrast to the welcoming speech May gave for the commander in September 2020 when he said Zyzda-Martin had “the passion, the drive, and the heart to get the job done with integrity and decisiveness. In other words, you’re the right officer for the right command at the right time.” Lt. Col. Tom Bauer, who serves as the vice commander at Volk Field, will act as interim commander until a new commander is selected. A phone number for Zyza-Martin was not immediately available.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Longtime Jackson resident Paul Bruun was among the latest inductees into the Fly Fishing Hall of Fame, joining a 2021 class that also features baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams, Dave Brandt, a longtime fly-fishing instructor and Trout Unlimited leader, and William Taylor, a bamboo rod maker and legendary caster. Bruun is the only living inductee this year; the others will receive the honor posthumously. Bruun, 77, started the Snake River Fund, which works to protect and preserve the Snake River watershed in Wyoming. He also launched the Jackson Hole Daily, and has written outdoors columns for various Jackson newspapers for a half-century. He’s a lifetime member of Trout Unlimited and the Coastal Conservation Association. Bruun, who has guided anglers for more than 35 years, is also a master of gear. He has consulted Patagonia on its fly-fishing line dating to the 1980s. He co-created the South Fork Skiff, the first fiberglass, low-profile drift boat. The expertise became well-recognized within the fly-fishing industry, and Bruun went on to consult for rod manufacturers such as Sage, Winston, Orvis and Scott and for fly-line makers, including Rio and the Cortland Line Company.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/10"}]}

The Cullman Times reports many trees weren’t cut down as workers created Smith Lake near Birmingham more than 50 years ago. Phil Hutchens, a member of the Cullman County Sheriff’s Office dive team, says standing timber is now complicating the search for 26-year-old Kelsey Nicole Starling of Birmingham, who’s been missing since two boats collided on the night of July 4. Starling was thrown from one of them. One of the drivers is charged with boating under the influence. Teams haven’t been able to find any trace of Starling.\n\nAlaska\n\nIgiugig: This tiny Alaska Native village is adopting an emerging technology to transform the power of a local river into a renewable energy source. The village council in Igiugig is the first tribal entity in the nation licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to harness river water that’s not connected to a dam. An underwater generator will be installed in coming days in the Kvichak River, part of a salmon-rich system that also provides subsistence food for the community of 70. Officials with Portland, Maine-based Ocean Renewable Power Co. say a trial river run of the RivGen Power System gives them confidence the system will not harm adult fish. Igiugig Village Council President AlexAnna Salmon says the generator is expected to greatly reduce reliance on costly diesel fuel.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Barbie – the iconic Mattel doll, arguably one of the world’s original influencers – is Instagramming her way across Arizona this week. The @BarbieStyle account has partnered with Visit Arizona to showcase travel in the Grand Canyon State. Her post Wednesday shows her and a pal visiting Antelope Canyon, on the Navajo Reservation just east of Page. Before that, she posed at the internationally famous Horseshoe Bend, a dramatic curve in the Colorado River that can be seen from an overlook a few miles south of Page. Barbie’s first stop in the state was the Phoenix area, where she lounged by the pool at Mountain Shadows Resort in Paradise Valley. Skyler Scott, spokeswoman for Mountain Shadows, says the Barbie photo taken there was not Photoshopped. A crew came to the resort, and Scott says it was fun to watch the detail and planning that went into the post.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A nonprofit plans to develop an online database of opioid-related overdoses in the state. Arkansas Drug Director Kirk Lane said Wednesday that the Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care is spearheading the project. He noted the database will give policymakers accurate information they can use for grants and prevention efforts. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the Justice Department awarded the state a nearly $1 million grant to fund the project. It’s expected the public database will be ready for use within six months. Gina Redford, the foundation’s analytics manager, said the database will only include information on overdoses involving opioids, which include prescription painkillers such as oxycodone and fentanyl along with heroin. Data out Wednesday from the Centers for Disease Control shows Arkansas had at least 433 fatal drug overdoses in 2018.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: An animal rescue group is asking for help caring for 89 baby snowy egrets and black-crowned night herons left homeless last week after a tree fell downtown. International Bird Rescue said Wednesday that it needs donations and volunteers to help feed and care for the baby birds rescued after an old ficus tree serving as a rookery split in half and partially fell last week, said JD Bergeron, the group’s executive director. The group is caring for 89 young birds and eggs rescued from the tree, including 50 snowy egrets and 22 black-crowned night herons. It also rescued 17 eggs that need intensive care and round-the-clock support. Another 20 birds died when the tree fell. The rescue group was already taking care of more than 200 Bay Area water birds at its busy hospital in the city of Fairfield, Bergeron said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Officials say greenhouse gas emissions in the state peaked in 2010 and have been in decline since. Colorado Air Pollution Control Division Director Gary Kaufman says the rate of decline has been small, but it’s expected to increase by 2030. The data is included in the Department of Public Health and Environment’s draft inventory of the state’s greenhouse gases. The report projects 125.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases will be emitted in the state in 2020. That’s down from nearly 127 million metric tons in 2015 and 133 million metric tons in 2010. A new state law aims to cut emissions to at least 90% of 2005 levels, or about 113 million metric tons, by 2050. Officials project the state will still be well above that goal in 2030.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Prisons officials say errors by nurses at the state women’s prison have caused five inmate methadone overdoses in recent months. The Department of Correction tells the Hartford Courant none of the overdoses at the York Correctional Institution in East Lyme was fatal. Two inmates had to be revived with an opioid overdose reversal drug. One York nurse was fired in connection with two of the errors, and three overdoses remain under investigation. Agency spokeswoman Karen Martucci says 300 inmates at York were on methadone treatment last year. She says while the percentage of dosing errors “is extremely low,” the department is reviewing the methadone distribution program and adding safeguards to prevent similar incidents. Prison workers union officials have warned of dangerous understaffing at state prisons.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Ladybug Music Festival, believed to be the country’s largest annual celebration of women in music, has kicked off, bringing with it a new local beer, along with almost 60 acts performing at 15 locations around town. The event Thursday and Friday includes a headlining set paying tribute to the “Ladybugs of Soul,” including Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston and Chaka Khan. To celebration the occasion, Stitch House Brewery has released its first canned beer, made in collaboration with Milford’s Mispillion River Brewing. Ladybug Rose Lager is an easy-drinking raspberry- and rose hip-infused lager with a light 4% ABV. The cans, which boast Ladybug’s eye-popping colors of pink and yellow, are also sold by the case or in four-packs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Protesters angered by the federal detainment of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border blocked access to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters in the city this week and staged a sit-in. News outlets reports at least 10 sit-in demonstrators were arrested and charged with unlawful entry. Dozens marched from the National Mall to the agency’s site around lunchtime Tuesday, stopping federal workers from returning to their desks. The demonstration went on for hours as attendees sang and carried signs saying “Never again is now” and “Never again means close the concentration camps.” The protest was one in a string of similar demonstrations outside ICE facilities nationwide during which protesters called for the dissolution of ICE and an end to crowded detainment centers at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Officials are hoping a continuous loop of children’s songs played throughout the night will keep homeless people from sleeping on the patio of a city-owned rental banquet facility. West Palm Beach parks and recreation director Leah Rockwell tells the Palm Beach Post they’re trying to discourage people from sleeping outside the glass-walled Waterfront Lake Pavilion, which she says rakes in some $240,000 annually from events. The loop of “Baby Shark” and “Raining Tacos” is a temporary fix to keep homeless people off the patio. Rockwell says the city wants to formalize hours for the facility, which should make trespassing laws easier to enforce. Illaya Champion tells the Post “it’s wrong” to chase people away with music. He says he’ll still sleep there, but “it’s on and on, the same songs.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Coastal Georgia’s largest county wants to help residents prepare for an emergency during hurricane season. The Chatham County Emergency Management Agency in Savannah plans to hold a free “Citizen Hurricane Academy” this weekend. The program includes presentations by meteorologists, local emergency planners and other experts on how evacuation decisions are made, how to prepare financially for a disaster and some basic first aid tips for use in emergencies. The Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 and runs until Dec. 1. Coastal Georgia evacuated for Hurricane Matthew in 2017 and Hurricane Irma in 2018. Both storms brought damaging wind and flooding to Georgia’s 100-mile coast. Hurricane Michael caused extensive damage farther inland last year.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A developer has agreed to cancel a planned condominium project to preserve a surfing area. West Hawaii Today reports the landowner has agreed to work toward building a public space rather than the proposed five-story residence near the Banyans, a popular surfing spot on the north side of Holualoa Bay. Property owner Kilohana Makai LLC met in a second mediation session last week with people involved in a case challenging plans for the condominium. A spokesman says Kilohana Makai will work over the next year to 15 months to convert the 14,450-square-foot lot on the Big Island into a community space. Officials say Hawaii County could buy the property via a commission that maintains a list of properties considered “worthy of preservation.”\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: Beekeepers and maintenance workers have removed roughly 30,000 bees that built a massive hive inside an Idaho State University campus landmark. The Idaho State Journal reports the bees were safely transported from the stone-and-wood Swanson Arch to a hive box at a nearby farm last Friday. Beekeeper Sarah Hofeldt says the bees were surprisingly docile, and no one was stung during the extraction. Hofeldt was safely able to remove the queen bee from the hive by hand without the use of smoke. She says the smokers can calm the bees but also can make it more difficult to move the bees into a transport container, which can increase bee fatalities. ISU students traditionally walk through the arch upon entering and graduating from the university.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A woman who recently got a 1993 postcard in her mailbox has tracked down the man who sent it to his children more than two decades ago. Kim Draper’s story about the mysterious Hong Kong postcard was first published in The State Journal-Register in Springfield. Masrour Kizilbash sent the postcard to his family while working overseas in 1993. He told the newspaper that he was “fascinated with the area” and wanted to share his experiences. Kizilbash’s family was living in Springfield at the time. He always figured they had received the postcard. With the help of social media, Draper learned that a son now lives in suburban Chicago. A reunion with the postcard is planned. Officials say it likely got tied up in Hong Kong or might have been stuck in old equipment.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s attorney general has reversed himself and decided against appealing a federal judge’s decision to block a state law that would ban a second-trimester abortion procedure. A judge granted a preliminary injunction last month sought by doctors who perform dilation-and-evacuation abortions. Republican Attorney General Curtis Hill said after that ruling that he would try to have the injunction lifted, but he announced Wednesday that his office would concentrate on arguing that the law is constitutional. That decision means the law can’t be enforced while court proceedings continue. The law passed this spring by the Republican-dominated Legislature calls the abortion procedure “dismemberment abortion.”\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The director of the state’s social services agency was a huge fan of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, and he frequently let his subordinates know it. Emails obtained by the Associated Press show that Iowa Department of Human Services Director Jerry Foxhoven routinely sent messages to employees lauding Shakur’s music and lyrics even after at least one complained to lawmakers. Then last month, he sent another such email to all 4,300 agency employees. He was abruptly ousted from his job the next work day. Foxhoven, 66, told employees he had been a huge fan of the hip-hop artist for years. He hosted weekly “Tupac Fridays” to play his music in the office. He traded lyrics with employees and marked his own 65th birthday with Shakur-themed cookies, including ones decorated with the words “Thug life.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Authorities say a lab technician “fudged” the test results of sewage treatment plant wastewater that is dumped into the Arkansas River. The Wichita Eagle reports Director of Public Works Alan King said Tuesday that the city caught the error during a spot check and immediately reported it to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The employee has since resigned. The problematic test results falsely reported how much organic and inorganic substance is floating in the water. It’s generally used as an indicator of sediment or silt in the water. King says Wichita’s permits shouldn’t be affected, and there was no danger to the public. Results from around the same time as the false one show that the city likely stayed within an acceptable range.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A new list of rankings from a high-profile polling organization is giving a big red thumbs-down to Gov. Matt Bevin. Kentucky’s chief executive is the least popular in the nation among voters in their own state, according to Morning Consult’s Q2 rankings, with a 56% disapproval rating vs. just 32% who approve. Bevin notably has ground to make up among voters in his own party, with an election looming in November. The governor faces a 40% disapproval rating among fellow Republicans in Kentucky, after a May primary election in which GOP challenger Robert Goforth, a state representative, scored 39% of the in-party vote to Bevin’s 52%. His net approval among Kentucky voters, according to the Morning Consult poll, sits at -24 overall, which breaks down to +11 among Republicans, -63 among Democrats and -26 among independents.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A favorite local confection is making a comeback seven years after a devastating fire. Louisiana’s economic development office announced Thursday that Hubig’s Pies will be produced again next year in suburban Jefferson Parish. Hubig’s made hand-sized turnovers with a glazed crust and fillings of chocolate, coconut or any of a variety of fruits. Wrapped in white paper labeled with a caricature of a chef known as Savory Simon, the pies were prominent for decades at retail checkout counters, including grocery and hardware stores. A 2012 fire gutted Hubig’s longtime bakery in New Orleans’ Marigny neighborhood. Production will resume in Jefferson Parish after a $1.37 million investment in a manufacturing facility. The state says Hubig’s will distribute pies from the Louisiana-Texas line to the Mobile, Alabama, area.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: A curious visitor to a train museum that resembled a white throw pillow or perhaps a lost toupee turned out to be a rare albino porcupine. The young rodent turned up Tuesday at Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, perplexing the staff, who sought help identifying it via social media. The consensus was that it’s an albino porcupine. The Portland Press Herald reports the animal appeared to be a baby because its quills had not yet hardened. A spokeswoman for the museum said midday Wednesday that it hadn’t yet been seen again, but it was assumed to be lurking in the area. Porcupines are common in Maine, though albino ones certainly aren’t. About 1 in every 10,000 of the species is an albino porcupine.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An audit says a possible infusion of $3.2 million in state funds and savings from a shortened season may not be enough to save the cash-strapped Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. The Baltimore Sun reports the SC&H Group audit released Tuesday says both methods would only temporarily help BSO unless additional revenue streams are established. It says it’s unclear if the orchestra will survive the year. The audit considered the possible state emergency funding, which Gov. Larry Hogan refused to partially release this year, citing concerns that the state could soon face a $961 million deficit. Hogan signaled in May that he might not release the first installment of the funds, leading the orchestra to abruptly cancel its summer series and lock out musicians amid ongoing contract negotiations.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCape Cod: A citizens group is calling for eliminating federal protections for seals as officials seek ways to protect beachgoers from great white sharks. Peter Howell, a founder of the Seal Action Committee, says the Nantucket-based group wants Congress to amend the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act so that species can be removed from the law’s list of protected animals if their populations have sufficiently rebounded. “We’re not anti-seal. We’re not trying to eliminate them. We’re just trying to manage them in the interest of the larger ecosystem,” he said Wednesday as the group spoke before the Barnstable County Commissioners, which oversees Cape Cod’s regional government. The region’s seal population – estimated in the hundreds of thousands – has been blamed for drawing droves of great white sharks in recent years. Seals are the favored meal for the powerful predators.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Three historic Great Lakes lighthouses owned by the federal government are going on the auction block. They include Lake Huron’s Poe Reef Lighthouse, 6 miles east of Cheboygan, Michigan, which guides ships through a hazardous channel. The Ontonagon Breakwater Lighthouse is the westernmost lighthouse in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, perched at the entrance of the channel leading to the Ontonagon River from Lake Superior. The Superior Entry Lighthouse sits on a sandbar between Superior, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. The U.S. General Services Administration is offering the lighthouses through an online auction. Their lighting mechanisms will continue aiding navigation and will remain the U.S. Coast Guard’s property. Proceeds from public lighthouse sales help pay to preserve and maintain those that remain active.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The developers of a proposed copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters plan to use a potentially safer dry method of storing mine waste instead of the kind of wet tailings pond more common in the industry. Twin Metals Minnesota said Thursday that its underground mine near Ely would use “dry stack” storage for waste rock, calling it the most environmentally friendly approach for the site. The method contrasts with the conventional tailings basin at the planned PolyMet mine, which will be contained by an earthen dam. While environmentalists pushed for dry stack storage at PolyMet, they’re criticizing Twin Metals because the waste would sit just a couple of miles upstream from the Boundary Waters. Twin Metals plans to release its formal mine plan in the coming months, triggering a lengthy environmental review.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi is asking 16 cities to eliminate local laws that penalize panhandling. The organization says in a news release that the request is part of a national effort that includes work by the National Law Center of Homelessness & Poverty. A federal appeals court in 2015 ruled that an ordinance in Springfield, Illinois, that penalized people for begging for money in public places is unconstitutional. ACLU of Mississippi says that since last year, four cities in the state have repealed panhandling ordinances – Ridgeland, Meridian, Starkville and Southaven. It’s asking other cities to do the same – Brandon, Clarksdale, Cleveland, Clinton, Corinth, Greenville, Greenwood, Grenada, Gulfport, Horn Lake, Jackson, Long Beach, Natchez, Olive Branch, Pascagoula and Vicksburg.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The U.S. Department of Agriculture now says less than 40% of the researchers whose jobs are being transferred from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City will make the move to the Midwest. The Kansas City Star reports U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced in June that the USDA would move more than 550 jobs to Kansas City. A USDA spokesperson told The Star on Tuesday that 145 workers will follow their jobs to Kansas City, while 250 will leave the agency. Members of the Kansas and Missouri congressional delegations and the states’ governors praised the USDA’s move, saying the research agencies are a good fit for their region. But critics argued that moving them will make it harder for federal policymakers to get objective research.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Wildlife officials say evidence of an invasive clam that can out-compete native species has been found for the first time in a state water body. Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials say Asian clam shells were recently found near the boat ramp at Lake Elmo State Park in Billings. The discovery was made by participants in a training session on the detection of aquatic invasive species. No live clams were found. The quarter-sized mollusks are smaller than native clams that live in Montana. In large enough numbers, officials say they can clog screens on irrigation pumps or other water intakes. Since being discovered in Washington state’s Columbia River in 1938, Asian clams have spread to almost every state.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Plant science students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln are still taught to phenotype by hand, wading into muddy fields to record the differences in physical characteristics between varying corn hybrids with a small set of tools and a pen and notebook. But technology is on track to render that human work obsolete. A team of UNL plant scientists and biological systems engineers have built an automated system capable of detecting an individual corn leaf and grasping it with robotic precision to screen its temperature, chlorophyll and water content in less than a minute, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Building a robot to automate the processes took years, as the team had to build a system that could identify the leaf from a corn or soybean plant, then direct a robotic arm where to reach and how to grab it for a battery of measurements, says Abbas Atefi, a Ph.D. candidate in biological systems engineering.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Lake Tahoe is almost entirely full. For weeks, the roughly 1,644-foot-deep alpine lake – the second deepest in the U.S. – has been within an inch of its maximum allowed surface elevation of 6,229.1 feet above sea level. As of late last week, its surface elevation was 6,229.03 feet above sea level. For Chad Blanchard, the federal water master in Reno responsible for managing Tahoe’s waters, it’s the longest he’s ever seen the lake stay this high. “This is a rare year,” he says. “I’ve been doing this for 26 years, and we’ve had big (snow) years, but this one is unique as far as being up within an inch of being full, and it’s just hanging there ... it’s a product of still having so much snow up there.” Despite a good amount of snow still coating the peaks around Tahoe, Blanchard doesn’t expect the lake level to rise much more, with summertime surface evaporation starting to pick up.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMilan: The Nansen Ski Jump has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1938, the 65-meter ski jump was the largest in the U.S. at the time, and it retains most of its original design. Officials said Wednesday that it was placed on the register because of its architecture and its place in U.S. sports history. Over the decades, Nansen was site of National Ski Jumping Championships, Olympic Ski Jumping qualifying events and U.S. Nordic combined championships. The ski jump was part of a planned bid by New Hampshire to host the 1944 Winter Olympics with cross-country skiing in Berlin, alpine events at Cannon, figure skating in Conway and bobsledding on Mount Madison. The games were canceled due to World War II.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEast Newark: Famed restaurant Tops Diner will soon be demolished and rebuilt in the same spot, with new space three times the current size. Tops, which opened in 1942, has been approved for expansion by the Hudson County Planning Board. Owners Jimmy and John Golemis, whose father, George, bought the diner in 1972, could not be reached for comment on the expansion. Tops Diner has been named the “most iconic” restaurant in New Jersey by Thrillist; was ranked the best diner in the country by Time Out magazine; and was listed as the most famous restaurant in the state by Insider. According to reports from NJ.com and The Jersey Journal, the new space will feature 296 seats (up from 180), 160 parking spaces and outdoor seating. Tops Diner says construction will take at minimum four to six weeks, during which Tops will be closed.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Thousands of small campaign contributions have helped propel former CIA operative and author Valerie Plame to the financial lead in a crowded primary for an open congressional seat in 2020. The Democrat raised $236,000 in May and June, according to disclosure forms and a statement from the campaign. Among notable donors were actor Bryan Cranston of “Breaking Bad” and Naomi Watts, who portrayed Plame in the 2010 film about her involvement in political jousting at the start of the Iraq War under President George W. Bush. In a field of eight primary contenders, Plame is the only national figure. Her identity as a CIA operative was leaked by an official in President George W. Bush’s administration in an effort to discredit her then-husband, diplomat Joe Wilson, a critic of the war in Iraq.\n\nNew York\n\nVernon: Woodstock 50 organizers have applied again for a permit to hold their festival at an upstate horse track, a day after losing an appeal for a previous denial. Town of Vernon officials say the application was submitted Wednesday. Woodstock 50 was previously denied a permit twice last week by the town. An appeal of the denial was upheld Tuesday night by the central New York town’s planning board. The Vernon Downs racetrack and casino became a possible alternative site for Woodstock 50 after the original venue, Watkins Glen International, pulled out. Woodstock 50 did not respond to a request for comment. Oneida County Sheriff Robert Maciol warned Thursday that “there is no practical or logistical possibility that this event could occur without significant risk to public safety.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHatteras: Sea turtles have again set a record for nesting at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. A news release from the National Park Service says that with more than a month to go before the nesting season typically winds down, rangers discovered the 326th nest Monday. The previous record of 325 was set in 2016. As of Tuesday, there are 317 loggerhead nests, 11 green sea turtle nests and one Kemp’s Ridley nest. Tracy Ziegler, chief of resource management and science for National Parks of Eastern North Carolina, says it’s estimated that almost 11,000 sea turtle eggs have been deposited in beaches on Bodie, Hatteras and Ocracoke islands.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state has sued the federal government to recover the $38 million the state spent policing protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem says he filed the lawsuit Thursday against the Army Corps of Engineers. He says the agency didn’t respond to an administrative claim he filed one year ago. The agency did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Stenehjem says the Corps allowed protesters to illegally camp without a permit on federal land along the Missouri River in southern North Dakota and failed to maintain law and order. The Corps has said protesters weren’t evicted due to free speech reasons. The pipeline carries oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Republican-led Legislature has passed a measure that would allow farmers and university researchers to grow industrial hemp and would legalize sales of hemp-derived cannabidiol oil, or CBD. Federal legislation last year removed hemp from the list of federally controlled substances and now treats the low-THC version of the cannabis plant like other agricultural crops. But existing Ohio law doesn’t differentiate between marijuana and hemp. The newly passed Ohio legislation would allow for cultivation of hemp as long as it contains less than 0.3% THC, the cannabis compound that gives marijuana its high. It would be regulated by the state. The measure was sent to GOP Gov. Mike DeWine for consideration. It would take effect immediately if he signs it.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma County has joined over 50 other cities and counties in the state to prosecute drug companies for damages caused by the opioid epidemic. The Oklahoman reports that all three county commissioners voted Wednesday to approve a contract with the Fulmer Sill law firm to sue opioid manufacturers. The decision comes at the end of the state’s trial against consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson, which alleges the company and its subsidiaries created a public nuisance by aggressively promoting the highly addictive drugs. Oklahoma could receive up to $17.5 billion in abatement costs. Commissioner Kevin Calvey says the opioid crisis has increased the county’s costs in policing, jailing and providing treatment services to residents. Fulmer Sill lawyers say they expect to pursue “tens of millions of dollars” for the county.\n\nOregon\n\nKeizer: Four scorpions were brought to the Keizer Fire District after a woman found the abandoned arachnids inside a Red Vines licorice container near a playground at an area park Wednesday. A mother picked them up around noon and brought them to the fire district. Keizer Fire District Chief Jeff Cowan says the arachnids were confirmed to be Pacific Northwest forest scorpions, a species native to the Willamette Valley. The species is not aggressive. Though they can sting, they prefer to play dead when disturbed. The scorpions were then given to the Oregon Department of Agriculture, which maintains a staff of professional entomologists. Cowan says under the entomologists’ care, the scorpions will travel for outreach events such as the Oregon State Fair.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWilkes-Barre: City officials have removed a public monument that included a recently added brick sponsored by a Ku Klux Klan affiliate. The Citizens’ Voice reports the column monument in Public Square was taken down three weeks after a brick was placed on it bearing the name of the East Coast Knights, a KKK chapter that has recruited in Wilkes-Barre. Harrisburg citizen activist Gene Stilp tried to chisel it off last week, resulting in a disorderly conduct charge, which he says he plans to fight. The monument was installed in 2008. Supporters could purchase engraved bricks for $35. Wilkes-Barre Mayor Tony George tells the paper it was time to tear down the monument, which he says wouldn’t have survived ongoing renovations to Public Square.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The state’s prison population is continuing to shrink as the percentage of older inmates rises. WPRI reports a 2018 Department of Corrections Population Report indicates 1 in 4 adults in the state’s correctional institutions in 2018 was over the age of 50, with more than 7% over 60. The 2009 population report disclosed that 17% of inmates were over 50, and 5% were over 60. The department says it categorizes inmates 50 and older as geriatric. The American Civil Liberties Union is also watching the aging prison population closely. Steve Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, says everyone “should be concerned as taxpayers.” Data compiled by the nonprofit projects the number of elderly inmates to triple in the next 15 years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The Greenville County Council has moved forward on a roughly $40million plan to relocate state offices from some expensive real estate downtown to a pair of office buildings near Haywood Mall. The decision at Tuesday night’s council meeting means the county is moving forward with the $1 billion commercial and residential redevelopment of County Square that council members first approved more than a year ago. The purchase price for the buildings, formerly part of the Fluor Corp. campus, will be $33.1 million, according to council members. The county will spend an additional $5 million to $8 million up-fitting the buildings for county and state services, according to a memo circulated to council members last March.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Dozens of children up to age 5 in the Sioux Falls School District and five rural districts now have access to mental health support in a way they never did before thanks to a $2 million grant given to Southeastern Behavioral Healthcare. The five-year grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration establishes the South Dakota Early Childhood Mental Health Collaborative to help Southeast Behavioral Health therapists reach an under-served population, what some call a “mental health desert,” through a partnership with South Dakota State University and federal school readiness programs like Head Start. And it will also develop some of the state’s first fully certified specialists in play therapy to help children discover healthy social and emotional coping skills, Southeastern officials said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: If famed local dive bar Earnestine & Hazel’s didn’t have enough haunted lore swirling around it already, bones of an unknown origin tumbling out of the walls and landing at the feet of construction crews serve as one more paranormal episode the historic bar can now tout. Diversified Builders crews have resumed restoration work after a Wednesday night scare when bones fell out of a wall they were repairing. The contracting company’s vice president, Chris Tigner, says word got out quickly, and someone alerted police and inaccurately told them a body was in the bar. Police and fire crews swarmed the site about 11 p.m., Tigner says. There was no body, and no one can say with certainty what organism the bones originated from. Caitlin Chittom, owner of Earnestine & Hazel’s, says they’ve been sent away for identification.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A former judge who served on the state’s highest criminal court has denounced President Donald Trump in announcing her decision to leave the Republican Party. The Austin American-Statesman reports retired Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Elsa Alcala announced her decision on Facebook. Alcala said in the Facebook post that even accepting that Trump has had some successes, “at his core, his ideology is racism.” Alcala said she can no longer support the GOP and will be voting in the 2020 Democratic primary. She was appointed to the court by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011 and spent 20 years as a GOP judge. Alcala’s announcement follows Trump’s tweets that four Democratic freshmen should “go back” to their home countries – though all are citizens, and three were born in the United States.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Wildlife officials say reports of bears coming down from the mountains and rummaging through backyards and campgrounds throughout the state have more than doubled this year. Faith Jolley with the Division of Wildlife Resources said Wednesday that her agency has already received more than 25 reports of black bears getting into trash cans and campsites, mostly in central Utah. In 2018 the DWR recorded 27 total bear encounters. None resulted in serious injury. The sharp increase can be attributed to a larger bear population and a wet spring that kept the bears hibernating longer than usual. State biologists say these factors have made bears bolder in searching for food. Jolley says residents can “bearproof” their surroundings by regularly cleaning their trash cans and storing food in locked cars while camping.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont Mozart Festival will not have a summer concert series this year. WCAX-TV reports that the organization said in a Facebook post this week that it is “currently reviewing opportunities and evaluating all options for the future, but will not have a summer season this year.” It didn’t say why. The festival, which celebrates the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, has struggled in recent years. It shut down in 2010 due to financial troubles. Then it was revived under new leadership, with partnership with communities and including food offerings and youth sports.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A limited-edition license plate is being offered to celebrate the University of Virginia men’s basketball team’s 2019 national championship. The state Department of Motor Vehicles worked with UVA to offer a license plate featuring the national champion’s logo. The plate is now available for purchase at any DMV customer service center, mobile office or online. It costs $25 annually, plus the cost of the registration, and can be personalized for $10. UVA license plates are part of the DMV’s revenue-sharing program, with $15 of the $25 fee returned to the university to support student scholarships. UVA has received more than $1.9 million from the program since it was established in 1992. The DMV also offers license plates as ornamental souvenirs. The $10 plates cannot be used on motor vehicles.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Transportation Commission is expected to vote this year on a proposal to replace the gas tax with a pay-per-mile system. The vote will take place Dec. 17, after the commission is expected to receive a report in October from a panel that has studied the new type of tax, The Olympian reports. Any recommendation voted on by the commission will then be passed on to the Legislature to consider during its next session, which starts in January. Commission chairman Jerry Litt says he expects many state residents would pay more under a pay-per-mile tax, which the state calls a “road usage charge.” Sen. Rebecca Saldana, vice chairwoman of the Senate Transportation Committee, says the state is considering such a charge because she says more fuel-efficient vehicles have eroded the state’s ability to rely long term on the gas tax for transportation needs.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A permanent prescription drug disposal site is being placed at the Capitol so people wanting to dispose of medication can do so all year. There has already been a collection site at the Capitol for National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, but the new location is permanent. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced the plan Wednesday and said it is in collaboration with the Capitol Police. Morrisey says the use of disposal sites can affect substance abuse rates by reducing the number of available pills. This disposal site is at the Division of Protective Services Office in Building 1, Room 152-A.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has signed a bill that creates new tiers of sign language interpreters. The bill he signed Wednesday establishes criteria for new advanced and intermediate licenses for both deaf and hearing interpreters and requires the state Department of Public Safety to determine the scope of practice for each level. One of the bill’s chief Assembly sponsors, Democrat Jonathan Brostoff, refused to cut his hair for a year and a half as a stunt to pressure Republican legislative leaders to consider the proposal. His hair had ballooned into a thick, curly mop by the time the Assembly and Senate passed the proposal in June. He cut his hair days later.\n\nWyoming\n\nThermopolis: The skeleton of a nearly 3-foot-tall cousin of the velociraptor is now on display at the Wyoming Dinosaur Center. The Rock Springs Rocket-Miner reports the museum in Thermopolis opened a new permanent exhibit featuring the fossils and full-size reproduction of the dinosaur informally known as Lori. Paleontologists discovered Lori, whose scientific name is Hesperornithoides miessleri, in a formation dating to the late Jurassic period near Douglas in 2001. Center paleontologist Bill Wahl says Lori is the earliest troodontid that has been found in North America. It’s also the smallest dinosaur that has been found in Wyoming. Troodontids are bird-like predators that have sickle-like claws.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/19"}]}

For the latest updates on victim recovery efforts, please read USA TODAY's live coverage of the plane crash investigation on Friday, Jan. 31.\n\nWASHINGTON - The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed to USA TODAY on Thursday evening that investigators recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the Bombardier CRJ700 airplane that collided in midair with an Army helicopter, leaving 67 people dead near Ronald Reagan National Airport.\n\nThe agency said the recorders, a key component of determining the final moments and circumstances of air disasters, are at NTSB labs “for evaluation.”\n\nNTSB spokesperson Peter Knudson said there are no additional recorders on the airplane, and investigators are searching for one recorder from the helicopter.\n\nFederal aviation investigators vowed earlier in the day that they will find the cause of a horrific collision.\n\nNTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said at a briefing that the agency wants to assure the American public it will \"leave no stone unturned in this investigation . . . This is a whole-of-government effort.\"\n\nTodd Inman of the NTSB said it is too soon to know whether human error or other factors were at play in Wednesday night's collision, which left no survivors, but he said the agency expects to have a preliminary report within 30 days.\n\n\"A loss of life in an aviation accident is very unusual in the United States, and our heartfelt sorrow goes out to everyone who's affected,\" Inman said. \"It affects us, it affects everyone around us. There are a lot of people hurting today. We will help find out what happened, we will do it factually and we will do it accurately.''\n\nThe U.S. had not had a major commercial plane crash since 2009, when a Colgan Air wreck outside Buffalo, New York, killed 50 people, including one on the ground. The nation's deadliest previous aviation catastrophe claimed 260 lives in 2001, when an American Airlines flight went down in Queens, New York, almost exactly two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe crash occurred just before 9 p.m. Wednesday when American Airlines Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kansas, attempted to land and collided in midair with the Black Hawk helicopter. The passenger plane, with 64 people aboard, and the helicopter, carrying three soldiers, plunged into the icy Potomac River and triggered a massive recovery effort.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, John Donnelly, the chief of Washington’s fire department, said 28 bodies were pulled from the water. He added that authorities were transitioning from a rescue mission to a recovery operation.\n\nOfficials have described both the airplane and helicopter crews as \"experienced\" and noted that the helicopter and the plane were following standard flight patterns.\n\n\"Everything was standard in the lead-up to the crash,\" Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said. \"Now, obviously something happened here, but you'll get more information and more details as this investigation moves forward. We'll learn what happened.\"\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Reagan National Airport, located in Arlington, Virginia, resumed flights at 11 a.m. Thursday, officials said. As of 10:30 a.m., more than 500 flights to and from the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware.\n\n∎ Among those who died in the collision are Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won the 1994 world championships for Russia in pairs figure skating before moving to the U.S. and becoming coaches. In addition, four other members of the Skating Club of Boston, including two teenagers and their parents, were on board the flight from Wichita.\n\n∎ A Philippine National Police official was also aboard the doomed passenger plane, the agency announced Friday. A spokesperson said in a news briefing that Col. Pergentino Malabed, who served as the chief of the supply management division, was killed in the midair collision.\n\n∎ Two Chinese citizens are among the victims of the crash, Xinhua, China’s state news agency, reported. The Chinese embassy told Xinhua it has requested the U.S. to verify the information, formally inform Chinese officials and provide assistance to the victims’ families. USA TODAY has reached out to the Chinese embassy for comment.\n\nPilots of doomed flight identified\n\nThe pilots of the plane have been identified by sources close to them as captain Jonathan Campos and first officer Samuel Lilley, although the Washington medical examiner has yet to confirm the information.\n\nEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, said Campos, 34, was a 2015 graduate from the institution, which is \"deeply saddened to learn of'' his death. \"Our thoughts are with his family and the families and loved ones of all impacted by this tragic accident,'' school vice president for communications Sarah Barczyk added in a statement.\n\nLilley, 28, was also working on the flight, according to a Facebook post made by his father, Tim Lilley. The post also said the younger Lilley was engaged to be married in the fall.\n\n“I was so proud when Sam became a pilot,” the post read. “Now it hurts so bad I can’t even cry myself to sleep.”\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Lilley’s father, Tim, who said he wasn't immediately available to speak about his son. But he told the Daily Mail that his son was near becoming a captain.\n\nSam Lilley graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.

My husband was one of the pilots in the Blackhawk,” Carrie Eaves wrote. Later in the day, she posted a photo of her husband in uniform and invited others to share memories of him, and dozens shared photos of him doing community service, running in a marathon or spending time with family and friends.\n\nReports: Another jet had to abort landing day before crash\n\nA day before the horrific midair collision between an American Airlines flight and Army helicopter near the nation’s capital, a passenger airplane had to abort its first landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport after a chopper appeared in its flight path, The Washington Post and CNN reported.\n\nThe Post, citing an audio recording from air traffic control, reported that Republic Airways Flight 4514 had to \"make a second approach after a helicopter appeared near its flight path.\"\n\nThe plane, flying from Connecticut, reached an altitude of about 1,600 feet during its first descent, while the helicopter was at about 300 feet, according to CNN.\n\nThe Post first reported the Tuesday incident.\n\n— Charles Ventura\n\nMore:DC plane crash is believed to have 'no survivors': What to know about the passengers\n\nTrump speculates on cause of the collision\n\nPresident Donald Trump noted the loss of life earlier Thursday. \"Sadly, there are no survivors,\" Trump said at the White House. Trump also said the helicopter crew \"should've seen where they were going.\"\n\nTrump speculated on possible causes of the collision and leveed criticisms at previous Democratic administrations as well as policies of diversity, equity and inclusion while speaking about the crash.\n\nTrump referenced \"a confluence of bad decisions that were made,\" but at different times suggested the Federal Aviation Administration and air traffic controllers could be blamed without providing evidence.\n\nHe later admonished the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and then took aim at FAA hiring practices. \"The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website,\" he said.\n\nTrump provided no evidence backing up his claims that Biden- and Obama-era hiring practices and diversity initiatives are to blame for the crash. He did not say when the air traffic controllers involved in the crash were hired, nor did he specify their race or gender.\n\nMore:Researching Trump’s statements about DEI, past administrations after DC crash | In context\n\nGroups blast Trump's claims on DEI\n\nThe American Association of People with Disabilities posted a message on social media saying, \"FAA employees with disabilities did not cause last night's tragic plane crash. The investigation into the crash is still ongoing. It is extremely inappropriate for the President to use this tragedy to push an anti-diversity hiring agenda. Doing so makes all Americans less safe.''\n\nLeaders of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus echoed similar concerns in a statement. “As families grieve the loss of their loved ones in last night’s aviation crash, President Trump does not offer any semblance of compassion or leadership,” the group said. “Instead, he is exploiting this tragedy to advance his discriminatory agenda and further divide Americans.”\n\nRep. Yvette Clarke, a New York Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, blasted Trump and his fellow Republicans for seeking to “scapegoat and villainize” Black and minority communities for political gain.\n\n“President Trump, without evidence or regard for the gravity and solemnity of this incident in which American lives were lost, held a press conference to falsely blame the diversity initiatives of past administrations for the cause of this incident,” the caucus wrote in a statement. “Not only are the President’s claims untrue, they also speak to the Republican Party’s desire to divide us as a country.”\n\nAt Thursday's briefing, the NTSB's Homendy also responded to Trump's statements on DEI: \"As part of any investigation, we look at the human, the machine and the environment, so we will look at all the humans that were involved in this accident. Again, we will look at the aircraft, we will look at the helicopter, we will look at the environment in which they were operating in. That is standard in any part of our investigation.''\n\nMore:Advocates call out Trump for linking DEI to deadly plane crash: 'It's offensive.'\n\nExperts search for explanations on plane crash\n\nAt the news conference, Homendy asked reporters for patience in finding the cause of the accident, saying, \"We have substantial amounts of information. We need to verify information, we need to take our time to make sure it's accurate.''\n\nOthers are also searching for explanations for the rare mid-air collision that resulted in the nation's deadliest aviation disaster in more than two decades.\n\nOne of the first topics to address will be whether either the plane or helicopter was in the wrong airspace. Early signs from air traffic control audio suggest the American Airlines flight was following the designated path for landing at the airport and that the helicopter was also in an area it was generally authorized to be in, though possibly at a different altitude than the one designated for its flight path.\n\n“Even the best experts right now, who are on the front lines, have a ton of unanswered questions,'' said William J. McGee, senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project. \"They know more than we do right now, but they still don’t know everything.”\n\n− Zach Wichter\n\nTransportation secretary planning changes to FAA\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he met with families of some of the crash victims on Thursday night.\n\n“I can’t take away their pain, but I can do a very small part to help ease it by keeping my promise to get to the bottom of what happened and be 100% transparent about the results of the investigation,” he wrote on X.\n\nDuffy said he will visit the Federal Aviation Administration command center and recovery hangar on Friday, adding he is “developing an initial plan to fix” the FAA and will release details soon.\n\nHegseth says Army helicopter was doing a 'proficiency training flight'\n\nThe Army helicopter that collided with an American Airlines plane Wednesday night was on an “annual proficiency training flight” when it crashed, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in a video statement posted to X on Thursday morning.\n\nThe crew was “fairly experienced,” and was conducting a night evaluation, Hegseth said. Night goggles were on board.\n\n“There was some sort of an elevation issue\" that is being \"investigating at the DOD and Army level,\" Hegseth said without providing details.\n\nA senior-level aviation team deployed Wednesday night will look into whether the helicopter was in the right corridor and altitude when the crash occurred, Hegseth said. The Defense Department has not yet released the names of the service members on the flight and is currently notifying their families.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nVirginia schools mourn loss of students, parents\n\nSchool districts in Virginia on Thursday announced current and former students and parents died in the flight collision. In email updates, Fairfax County Pubic Schools said many on the flight were returning from a figure skating event in Wichita.\n\nThree students and six parents died in the crash, Superintendent Michelle Reid said. Two of the parents were current or former district staff members. The pre-K through-12th grade district, located just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., didn’t release the victims’ names out of respect for them and their families.\n\n“This is a time we must hold one another a bit closer,” Reid said.\n\nLoudon County Public Schools, a school district just outside Washington, also announced former students were among those who died.\n\n“This unimaginable loss has deeply affected our community, and with great sorrow, we have learned that multiple victims were former LCPS students,” Superintendent Aaron Spence said in an update.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\n6 members of Boston skating club, including 2 teens, killed in crash, CEO says\n\nSix members of the Skating Club of Boston, including two teenagers, were aboard the flight that crashed outside Washington, D.C., CEO Doug Zeghibe said at a news conference.\n\n\"This will have long, reaching impacts for our skating community,\" he said.\n\nZeghibe said the six people affiliated with his club were on board the flight after attending a national development camp for junior and novice skaters in Wichita earlier this week. The group included world champion figure skaters Naumov and Shishkova, Zeghibe confirmed.\n\nTeenage figure skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane − as well as their respective mothers, Jin and Christine − were also on the flight, Zeghibe said. Rep.

McGee, senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project, told USA TODAY.\n\nFor now, less than 24 hours after the crash, we don’t know very much for certain.\n\n\"Since we're just beginning our investigation, we don't have a great deal of information to share right now,\" Todd Inman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board said at a news conference late Thursday. \"We will keep you informed by getting regular updates as we learn more.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nLive updates:All 67 aboard plane, copter killed in tragic midair collision near DC\n\nStill, experts say, some basic facts about the accident are publicly known already.\n\n“What we know is that the CRJ aircraft was on approach to Runway 33 at Reagan and was on short final, probably at or below about 500 feet, and the helicopter was traveling. There is a helicopter route that goes down the river on the east side of the river, so those two routes, the final approach course and that helicopter route actually do intersect, but they are deconflicted by altitude typically, but not by very much, only by several hundred feet,” Jim Brauchle, an aviation attorney at Motley Rice, said in an interview.\n\nThat still leaves many unanswered questions.\n\n“Even the best experts right now, who are on the front lines, have a ton of unanswered questions. They know more than we do right now, but they still don’t know everything,” McGee said.\n\nHere’s what experts are likely going to be digging into, and what the likely investigative timeline looks like going forward.\n\nWas either aircraft out of place?\n\nOne of the first questions investigators will likely try to answer is whether either aircraft was occupying airspace it should not have been. Early signs from air traffic control audio suggest that the American Airlines flight was following the designated flight path for landing at DCA and that the helicopter was also in an area it was generally authorized to be in, though possibly at a different altitude from the one designated for its flight path.\n\n“It’s kind of a weird approach. The approach into that runway, aircraft as they’re approaching the airfield fly up the east side of the river over land, but then a mile and a half from the runway would make a big 50-degree turn to go land. When they make that turn, they’re at 490 feet, so they’ll cross over the river at or below 400 or 450 feet, but that helicopter route is at or below 200 feet,” Brauchle said “Even if they’re both where they’re supposed to be, you have only about 200 feet of separation, which is not a lot of separation at all.”\n\nDeadly mid-air collisionrenews urgent questions about US air safety, near-misses\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., in a news conference Thursday, said she requested information on the flight patterns of both the plane and helicopter. Duckworth, a ranking member of the U.S. Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, is a veteran with experience flying a Black Hawk.\n\nMcGee said he had the same initial questions.\n\n“That is some of the busiest airspace in the United States. Were they in the wrong place at the wrong time? Why was an aircraft traveling into the path of a plane that was cleared to land at a major American airport?”\n\nDid the collision avoidance system respond?\n\nAll commercial aircraft in the U.S. are required to be fitted with a warning instrument known as the traffic collision avoidance system, or TCAS. Military aircraft flying in civilian airspace may not be required to have that system installed or operating, but some do anyway.\n\nOne question investigators are likely to explore is whether or not the system was functioning properly on the American Eagle jet, and whether or not the Black Hawk was fitted with it and had it turned on at the time of the collision.\n\nBut, experts warn, it’s not a foolproof system.\n\n“When you’re that close to the runway in that kind of traffic, it might not necessarily trigger it,” Brauchle said. “That will be interesting when you get the flight data recorder to see if TCAS activated or alerted.”\n\nWho was responsible for the crash?\n\nAir disasters are almost never caused by a single factor, but the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation, will be working to understand how the collision happened.\n\nOne key question will be what the immediate cause was.\n\n“Was there more that either crew could have done? Was the military helicopter where it should have been or should not have been at that time?” McGee said. “It looks like they flew 90 degrees directly into an approach path to an active runway. That just shouldn’t be at that flight level.”\n\nDuckworth emphasized the need for prudence and to “wait for the NTSB and FAA to do their job with the accident investigation first.”\n\nStory continues below.\n\nRobert Isom, American Airlines’ CEO, also said in a letter to employees Thursday that the NTSB is the only authority for information about the crash.\n\n“While the investigation is underway – and will continue for quite some time – we will share what we can as information becomes available. It’s important to remember that the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) leads the investigation of aviation accidents. The NTSB will be the sole source of truth going forward, and accuracy is of the utmost importance,” the letter said.\n\nNight vision goggles and other factors that could have come into play\n\nThe time of day and other factors often contribute to a crash, even if they do not cause it directly.\n\n“I’ve heard reports, but I haven’t necessarily confirmed it, but (air traffic control was) talking to the helicopter, and the helicopter did say they had the aircraft in sight,” Brauchle said. “You would think it’s an aircraft, a commercial aircraft, they should be able to see that, but at night, the only thing you can see are its lights. If you’re in a helicopter only several hundred feet off the ground, that’s a very urban area and it’s very well-lit, it’s real easy to not be able to distinguish what lights you’re looking at.”\n\nThe helicopter pilots were on a night-flying training exercise and may have been using night vision goggles. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth acknowledged in a statement that night vision goggles were on board the helicopter at the time of the accident but did not say whether the pilots were using them when the crash occurred.\n\n“Where you also involve night flying by military, especially when it’s a training mission, they’re often training with night vision goggles,” Robert W. Mann Jr., a former airline executive officer and current president of R. W. Mann and Co., an independent airline consultancy, told USA TODAY. “They’re imprecise, to be honest, and they’re often subject to ground clutter (from lights) in their field of view.”\n\nIt’s also possible, McGee and Brauchle said, that the aircraft were simply in each other's blind spots.\n\nBrauchle explained that because the American jet was turning, it may have been “putting its belly toward the helicopter,” which would have kept the helicopter out of the jet pilots’ field of vision.\n\nSimilarly, he said, if the helicopter was in a certain position below the jet, it may not have seen the plane coming.\n\n“There was a helicopter accident we worked on several years ago up in the Hudson River involving a tour helicopter and an aircraft. Neither saw each other until the very last second. The NTSB did a visual study, a human factors study,” he said. “You would be blind; there are certain areas until you’re right on top of it, and most times it’s too late to react at that point.”\n\nHow the investigation will proceed\n\n“Now is not the time for speculation,” Duckworth said. “We need to get to the facts.”\n\nThis investigation will take time. McGee said he’s hopeful we’ll have some very preliminary information about what happened in the coming days, but very likely there won’t be any official reports for at least a month, and it will probably take a year or more before the NTSB issues its full, final report.\n\nInman, the NTSB member, said the agency expects to release a preliminary report in about 30 days.\n\n\"We will take the time that’s necessary,\" he said. \"If we find something that is a significant issue that warrants immediate action, we will not hesitate to make those recommendations and make them public.\"\n\nMeanwhile, McGee said, it’s important for travelers to know that flying remains safe and the industry will learn from this accident to make it safer.\n\n“We all know, it’s worth saying, and someone like me who’s been critical, it’s worth me saying once in a while: this is an extremely safe system but that doesn’t mean we don’t constantly have to have our guard up and be vigilant,” he said.\n\n(This story was updated because an earlier version included an inaccuracy.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/disaster/2025/01/30/wichita-mayor-lily-wu-addresses-deadly-american-airlines-black-hawk-crash-tragedy-watch-video/78050769007/", "title": "Wichita mayor Lily Wu addresses deadly American Airlines crash ...", "text": "Officials believe no one survived the crash involving an American Airlines passenger plane with an Army helicopter.\n\nThe plane was traveling from Wichita, Kansas, to Washington, D.C., when the crash occurred, according to American Airlines.\n\nOn Wednesday, just before 9 p.m. ET, American Airlines Flight 5342 was involved in a mid-air collision near the Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington D.C., American Airlines said in a statement.

They were scheduled to board a connecting flight from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to Boston. They were among 14 club members who attended the competition.\n\nHe described the victims, skater Spencer Lane, 16, and his mother Christine Lane. Skater Jinna Han, 15, and coaches Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov as key parts of their close-knit community.\n\n“These kids and their parents - they are here at our skating facility in Norwood six, sometimes seven days, a week,” Zeghibe said. “It is a close, tight bond, and I think for all of us, we have lost family.”\n\nHe briefly described Spencer as a “highly-talented kid,” a promising skater who was “rocketing to the top of the sport. Zeghibe gave similar praise to Jinna, “a wonderful kid, great athlete, great competitor” loved by all. The club executive said their mothers were “role-model parents,” devoted, dedicated to their children’s passion for the sport.\n\nHe praised coaches Shishkova and Naumov for bringing prominence to the club. The couple won the pairs title at the 1994 World Championships and competed in two Winter Olympics. Their son, Maxim Naumov, a competitive skater for the U.S. was not on the plane. Maxim, who is on his way to D.C. with other club members, flew back home with Zeghibe on Sunday after finishing fourth in his skating competition which ended Sunday.\n\nTheir deaths will have “long-reaching impacts for our skating community,” Zeghibe said. “They came to us in 2017 and were very much a part of our building the competitive skating program here at the skating club.”\n\nAlexandr Kirsanov, Angela Yang and Sean Kay\n\nA skating coach died along with two of his team members, the coach’s wife confirmed to the USA TODAY Network.\n\nAlexandr Kirsanov, 46, who coached Angela Yang and Sean Kay, was among those killed in the crash, his wife, Natalia Gudin told Delaware Online/The News Journal in a phone call from Washington, D.C., where she was staying as recovery efforts continued.\n\nKirsanov’s body had not been recovered as of Thursday afternoon, Gudin said, but Yang and Kay were found.\n\n“We always use American Airlines when we go to competition,” she said, crying. “This time, they go without me, and all of them are gone.”\n\nOn Jan. 21, the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club posted on its social media accounts that it was sending skaters to Wichita. “Congratulations to everyone and we wish you all the best!” the post read, with Yang, Kay and two other skaters pictured, medals around their necks.\n\nIn a November post, the club offered a glimpse of Yang in a Skater Spotlight post. She said she got into skating because of older siblings who played hockey. She, too, started playing, but “I soon discovered a passion for ice dance.” As her hockey skills were eclipsed by her dancing, she decided to focus on the latter.\n\nShe talked about how her family and her coaches were her inspiration, and, asked what she did in her time off the ice, she said she created digital art, painted and enjoyed traveling and playing video games.\n\nYang also said she had two chinchillas, Star and Space, a guinea pig named Reese’s and a parakeet named Cloudy.\n\nSamuel Lilley\n\nSamuel Lilley, 29, was the first officer on the flight, according to a Facebook post made by his father Tim Lilley.

But he told the Daily Mail that his son was near becoming a captain.\n\nLilley graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in business administration. President Kyle Marrero, in a statement to USA TODAY, said the university community “is deeply saddened by the loss of one of our outstanding alumni, Sam Lilley (‘18), who embodied the eagle spirit and soared beyond in his career.”\n\n“We will continue to keep Sam’s family and friends in our thoughts as they grieve this tragedy,” Marrero said.\n\nUnited Association announces loss of a fifth union member in plane crash\n\nThe United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 602 confirmed Thursday afternoon that another one of its members was on the plane that crashed Wednesday evening.\n\nUA general president Mark McManus and UA Plumbers and Gasfitters Local 5 business manager Terriea “T” Smalls issued a joint statement saying:\n\n“We are heartbroken to share that we have learned another one of our Brothers was among the victims of the American Airlines Flight 5342 crash yesterday,\" the statement read. \"May they all rest in peace.”\n\nEarlier Thursday, UA announced that four members from UA Steamfitters Local 602 were on the plane.\n\nThe organization said it is providing support to the families of the victims and will release more information as it becomes available.\n\nWhy were multiple figure skaters onboard the flight?\n\nThe U.S. Figure Skating Championships were being held in Wichita, where the plane took off from, from Jan. 21 to Jan. 26.\n\nNo survivors, dozens of bodies recovered\n\nAuthorities raced to find survivors in the aftermath of the crash, according to the D.C.

The second is called a Flight Data Recorder, which monitors parameters such as altitude, airspeed, and heading.\n\nThe recorders are installed to help reconstruct precisely what happened leading up to a crash.\n\nWhere is a black box found on a plane?\n\nA black box is typically found in the aircraft's rear.\n\nEach box is equipped with an Underwater Locator Beacon in the event of an overwater crash, according to NTSB. Dubbed a \"pinger\", the device is activated when the recorder is submerged in water, according to a NTSB online fact sheet. \"\n\n\"It transmits an acoustical signal on 37.5 KHz that can be detected with a special receiver,\" the sheet reads. \"The beacon can transmit from depths down to 14,000 feet.\"\n\nWhat happens when a black box is recovered from water?\n\nIf a black box is recovered from the water, it is immersed in fresh, clean water to prevent deposits such as salt or minerals from drying out within the device, said John Cox, a retired airline captain with former US Airways.\n\n\"When the technicians at the laboratory are ready to download the data, they take the recorder out of the freshwater bath, carefully open it and dry any sections that have been exposed to water,\" according to Cox, who owns the aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems. \"They then download the data into special computers that can read the information.\"\n\nHas the black box on American Airlines Flight 5342 been located\n\nYes, the NTSB said divers had located the black boxes for AA Flight 5342.\n\nContributing: Reuters, Kinsey Crowley; USA TODAY\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

The Department of Transportation said officials will reassess the restriction after the National Transportation Safety Board has completed its preliminary investigation of Wednesday’s crash.\n\n“This is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s ongoing commitment to safeguarding our nation’s skies and upholding the highest standards of air travel safety,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. \"We will continue to support President Trump’s directive to achieve uncompromised aviation safety. The American people deserve full confidence in our aviation system and today’s action is a significant step towards restoring that trust.”\n\nAir space is typically crowded around the Washington area, home to three commercial airports and multiple military bases. The Potomac corridor in particular is busy with airliners and helicopters.\n\nFAA reveals staffing of tower at Reagan National Airport\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said Reagan National Airport currently employs 25 certified professional controllers and three certified professional controllers in training.\n\nThe tower is authorized to have 28 controllers, the agency said.\n\nThose in training \"were previously fully certified at other facilities,\" according to the FAA.\n\nHegseth says it's unknown if helicopter pilots used night-vision goggles\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said investigators were working to determine who was piloting the Black Hawk helicopter at the time of the crash, whether the crew used their night-vision goggles and what, if any, \"confusion was there at the end.”\n\nThe three-person Army crew was on a \"routine\" training that was part of a continuity of government program, said Hegseth in a Friday morning appearance on \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\nHegseth said the military conducts such trainings to prepare for a national emergency in which officials would need to be quickly evacuated. He said while it's important to \"rehearse in ways that would reflect a real world scenario\" it is also important that the Army and Department of Defense mitigate risk, \"especially when it's around civilian aircraft.\"\n\nHe said the black box from the helicopter will give them “a sense of internal communications\" leading up to the collision.\n\nWhen will we know what the black boxes say?\n\nFederal investigators recovered black boxes from American Airlines flight 5342 and the Black Hawk helicopter to help determine what caused the midair collision.\n\nThe recorders were sent for evaluation to NTSB labs, where investigators began the delicate work of retrieving what's inside.\n\nA plane’s \"black boxes ,\" designed to be indestructible and usually stored in the aircraft’s tail section, collect information on communications involving pilots in cockpits and how aircraft systems perform in flight, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) .\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration requires large commercial aircraft and some smaller commercial, corporate and private planes to have two black boxes. The first is the cockpit voice recorder, containing conversations between crew members and air traffic control and even engine noises. The second is the flight data recorder, which monitors operating conditions such as altitude, airspeed and heading.NTSB declined to comment about when information it is finding from the recorders will be shared with the public.– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nScene at Washington airport two days after deadly collision\n\nTravelers are making their way through Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport as usual on Friday after the airport shut down in the wake of a deadly collision between a passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter this week.The airport reopened Thursday, but hundreds of flights were cancelled or delayed, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. On Friday, there were few signs of the chaos in the aftermath of the deadly collision except the presence of reporters and a few National Transportation Safety Board workers in both terminals.\n\nVice president and airport manager Terrence “Terry” Liercke said at a news briefing Friday afternoon that two of three runways were closed due to the proximity of the crash site where recovery operations were underway. On a typical day, Liercke said the airport operates about 800 flights on a full schedule.\n\nEarlier Friday, a temporary ground stop was issued at Reagan National Airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA said departures were “grounded due to airport volume\" until 8:45 a.m.\n\n– N'Dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nPlane forced to abort landing at DC airport the day before deadly collision\n\nJust one day before the deadly crash, a passenger jet had to abort its initial landing at Reagan National Airport after another military chopper appeared in its flight path, airline officials and radar data confirmed.\n\nFlightAware, a site that tracks flight paths, shows Republic Airways Flight 4514 − bound for the same airport − departed from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut on Thursday at 6:50 p.m. ET. The town is in Hartford County, just under 15 miles north of the state's capital.\n\nUpon its first approach, about 8 p.m. ET, the airplane can be seen on radar diverting from its scheduled course, then turning west, circling around, and landing in a second attempt. The crew \"initiated a go-around at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in response to an onboard alert that a military helicopter was nearby,\" a Federal Aviation Administration told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\n\"Air traffic controllers issued traffic advisories to both aircraft and the military helicopter crew reported they had the Republic aircraft in sight,\" an FAA spokesperson said. \"There was no loss of required separation between the aircraft.\"\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nMore:Passenger plane forced to abort landing at DC airport the day before deadly plane crash\n\nPresident Donald Trump says helicopter was ‘flying too high’\n\nPresident Donald Trump continued speculating on the cause of the crash on Friday, writing on Truth Social that the helicopter was flying “too high.”\n\n“The Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot. It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???” he said. As with his remarks on Thursday, he did not provide evidence to support his claims.\n\nThe NTSB has only recently begun an investigation into the cause of the crash. A preliminary report on the incident is expected within 30 days of the collision, officials said.\n\nFederal mortuary, mental health teams deployed after plane-helicopter crash\n\nIn the wake of the collision near Reagan National Airport, a team of federal forensic specialists and medical examiners has been deployed to help local officials as they pull bodies out the Potomac River and work to identify the remains.\n\nAt the request of the NTSB, the Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT) has begun offering services to the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, including the collection of medical records, DNA samples and fingerprints.\n\nDMORT provides medical examiners, pathologists, forensic odontologists, dental assistants, funeral directors and other experts for “technical assistance and personnel to recover and identify the remains of disaster victims,\" the Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response said in a statement.\n\nImmediately after the accident the administration deployed tactical medical providers to support emergency responders, along with experts from ASPR’s Disaster Behavioral Health Team. \"The team conducted a rapid behavioral health needs assessment which (DC) officials will use to put resources in place to support the family member’s behavioral health needs,\" ASPR said.\n\nThe agency “is honored to provide the additional hands and expertise that local, state, and federal authorities request during a tragedy like this,” said John Knox, the principal deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response.\n\nMourning in the 'air capital' of the world\n\nThe devastating plane and helicopter collision has drawn Wichita − known globally as the \"air capital of the world\" − and its aviation roots into the national spotlight.\n\nFor residents of Wichita, where American Eagle flight 5342 departed from, the ramifications of the crash run deep. Many of the city's half million residents are employed by the aviation industry, and those who aren't still feel connected through Wichita's key role in the history of aviation.\n\nDuring the '20s, the city’s 16 manufacturers built more than 120 planes on a weekly basis, according to the city’s visitor’s bureau. Currently, Textron Aviation, which manufactures Beechcraft and Cessna aircraft, is headquartered in Wichita, as is Spirit AeroSystems – the manufacturing arm of Boeing. Spirit AeroSystems and Textron Aviation are two of the city’s largest employers.\n\n\"This is a terrible tragedy that will unite those in Washington, D.C., and Wichita, Kansas, forever,\" Wichita Mayor Lily Wu said during an emotional news conference.\n\n− Alice Mannette\n\nRead the full story:'Air capital' mourns after plane crash.

The PNP is committed to providing them with all necessary support during this difficult time.”\n\nDonald Trump's comments on deadly plane-helicopter crash\n\nSpeaking from the White House, Trump on Thursday speculated on the cause of the crash, questioning the position of the helicopter and blaming the tragedy on his two Democratic predecessors and their emphasis on diversity in hiring, which he claimed had lowered standards for air traffic controllers.\n\n\"The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website,\" he said without proving evidence backing up his claims that Biden- and Obama-era hiring practices and diversity initiatives are to blame for the crash or that race/ethnicity, gender or ability was related or responsible.\n\nThe president also said the helicopter crew \"should have seen where they were going\" and asked, \"What was the helicopter doing in that track?\"\n\n\"You had a pilot problem from the standpoint of the helicopter because it was, it was a very clear night,\" Trump said. An official cause of the crash has not been identified.\n\n− Michael Collins, Bart Jansen, Joey Garrison and Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nMore:President Trump mixes sympathy and politics as consoler-in-chief\n\nAir traffic control staffing under scrutiny\n\nThe staffing at Reagan National Airport at the time of the collision is drawing intense scrutiny after multiple news outlets reported a single air traffic controller was responsible for directing helicopters and commercial airliners. The New York Times and NBC News reported that an FAA report that said those tasks are typically split between two staffers.\n\nReagan National Airport is home to the busiest runway in the country. And in recent years, shortages of air traffic controllers, near collisions and the addition of more direct flights at the airport has fueled safety concerns.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, the FAA referred questions to the NTSB, which is leading the investigation. \"We cannot comment on any aspect of open investigations,\" the FAA said in an email. \"The FAA will quickly take any actions necessary based on evidence from the investigation.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/31"}]}

With the Lunar New Year holidays just around the corner, Asian Americans in North Jersey are getting creative when it comes to celebrating safely.\n\nFrom drive-thru celebratory meals to Zoom performances, New Jerseyans are ensuring that the Year of the Ox that arrives on Friday, Feb. 12, will be one to remember.\n\n\"We want to carry on our traditions,\" said Margaret Lam of Montville, founder of the Northern New Jersey Chinese Association.\n\nStory continues below the gallery.\n\nLunar New Year, known in China as Chinese New Year or the Spring Festival, marks the first new moon of the lunar calendar followed by many East Asian cultures, including the Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai and Cambodians. It falls annually between mid-January and mid-February.\n\nFor those who celebrate, it's the biggest holiday of the year, marked by 15 days of festivities.\n\nIn New Jersey, Asian Americans account for 10% of the state's 8.9 million people. In towns such as Fort Lee and Leonia in Bergen County, their share is even higher, accounting for more than 40% of the residents.\n\nThe Korean American Association of New Jersey, based in Palisades Park, is planning a Lunar New Year celebration in a socially distant manner. Members will distribute traditional Korean rice cakes called Duk Gook, a celebratory food for the new year, in a drive-by event at St. Michael's Church at 19 E. Central Blvd. in Palisades Park. There will be 500 rice cakes with broth kits available from 3 to 5 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 11, that will serve up to 2,500 people. The kits are free to anyone on a first come, first served basis.\n\n\"We're helping to bring normal to not a normal year,\" said Yoon Kim, director of KAANJ.\n\nLunar New Year:Celebrate the Year of the Ox with these eight lucky Chinese New Year dishes\n\nSanmao:A generation of Asian women grew up reading Sanmao. Now she's having her moment in America\n\nBecause there is so much need during the pandemic, the Korean American organization is also hosting a food drive on Saturday, March. 13, at its office at 21 Grand Ave. in Palisades Park and at American Legion Post 170 at 33 W. Passaic St. in Rochelle Park. The goal is to feed 300 families in New Jersey with staples such as chicken, eggs, milk, bananas and pasta, said Michelle Song, the KAANJ organizer of the drive.\n\nOthers will celebrate at home to be safe. Lam, 80, will ring in the new year at her Montville home with her husband, David Wen. With the coronavirus still present, Lam feels it's the right thing to do instead of inviting family and friends over.\n\nFor her organization of more than 150 Chinese families, traditional performances were staged via Zoom, with children singing, playing a musical instrument or dancing. The Zoom extravaganza was held just before the Super Bowl on Sunday.\n\nWhile the celebrations will be subdued this year, there are traditions that will still be followed. Just like New Year's Day in the U.S., the celebratory period is a time to wear new clothes. Old debts are paid off to start the year fresh. Superstition also has it that you shouldn't cut your hair or sweep the floors during the beginning of the New Year season or you'll cut or sweep away your luck.\n\nGetting \"hong bao,\" a red envelope, is a tradition that children look forward to every year. Instead of presents, children, including young adults who are unmarried, receive money stuffed into these envelopes. The cash always comes in crisp new bills and in amounts that correspond to lucky numbers in Chinese culture, such as eight.\n\nThe money never comes in multiples of four; that's an unlucky number because the Chinese word for \"four\" sounds similar to that for death.\n\nThe Chinese zodiac, adopted by other Asian countries, is a 12-year cycle with different animals. In Chinese astrology, the animal signs represent what your personality may be. According to Asian folklore, people born in the Year of the Ox are strong, reliable, fair and conscientious, inspiring confidence in others. They are also said to be calm, patient, methodical and trustworthy.\n\nAlthough the pandemic is limiting celebrations this year, there are still ways to safely ring in the new year with virtual events throughout North Jersey:\n\n• Fort Lee Library online Lunar New Year. Feb. 12, noon to 2 p.m.\n\nThe library is hosting a day filled with virtual activities and performances from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. There will be cooking classes, story time and cultural performances on the library's YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTHKR2i8Uog.

The new law is expected to increase the number of detained migrants.\n\n\"Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back. So we're going to send them out to Guantanamo,\" Trump said.\n\nMore:Trump to build mass detention facility at Guantanamo Bay for 30,000 migrants\n\nTrump has pursued an aggressive crackdown on migrants during the first two weeks of his second term, ramping up detainments by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe Naval Station Guantanamo Bay is about 430 miles southeast of Miami, on the southeastern coast of Cuba. Established in 1903, it is the United States' oldest overseas military installation and the only one in a communist country, according to the DOD.\n\nGuantanamo already houses a migrant facility that is separate from the high-security facility used to house foreign terrorism suspects. It has been used over the years to house Cubans, Haitians and others, including suspects picked up at sea. Trump's memo charges his administration with expanding the migrant facility to \"full capacity\" to provide additional detention space for \"high-profile criminal aliens.\"\n\n\"Most people don't even know about it. We have 30,000 beds in Guantanamo,\" Trump said. \"This will double our capacity immediately ‒ and tough. It's a tough place to get out of.\"\n\nTrump border czar Tom Homan said ICE would manage the facility, telling reporters it will house migrants who are “significant public safety threats.”\n\nIt was not clear on Wednesday how much the facility would cost or when it could open.\n\n\"That is something that the White House is working on to use resources that we currently have there at Guantanamo Bay. So we'll go through the process. The worst of the worst is where that can be utilized. So that potential is there, we know we need the infrastructure,” said Kristi Noem, the newly minted secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nMore:Trump deputizes thousands of federal agents to arrest immigrants\n\nHow Guantanamo anticipates 'just this type of situation'\n\nAccording to the United States' lease with Cuba, the U.S. retains jurisdiction while Cuba technically maintains sovereignty over the 45-square-mile installation. Over the past century, it has served as a key operational and logistics hub, supporting various missions including maritime security, humanitarian assistance, and joint operations, the Pentagon says.\n\nCharles \"Cully\" Stimson, who helped establish the terrorist detention facility as President George W. Bush's deputy assistant secretary of defense for Detainee Affairs, said personnel at Guantanamo are ready to take in detainees on a moment’s notice.\n\n“They do training exercises routinely in anticipation of just this type of situation where the president orders detainees, migrants or whatever you want to call them brought to Guantanamo for a short or medium period of time,” Stimson told USA TODAY. “So they have supplies and stores of tents, cots, food, desalinated water at the ready, just like they had back in the day when the Clinton administration housed Haitian migrants” and Cubans there.\n\nStimson also said the troops there are trained to segregate “people who have not committed crimes besides entering the country illegally from people who've committed violent crimes. We train for that contingency.”\n\nIn the past, troops stationed at the naval base would construct an informal tent city as opposed to a large permanent structure, and it would likely be miles away from where the remaining terrorist detainees are being held, Stimson said.\n\nMore:Trump revives push to denaturalize US citizens\n\n“Back then, they put a tent city up on the old World War Two airport landing strip and on the golf course,” he said.\n\nStimson, who is now a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said he didn’t know if anyone at the conservative think tank played a role in Trump’s new plan as current and former Heritage staff have in other Trump initiatives. \"No one talked to me,” he said. “No one asked me anything.\"\n\nConcerns from civil rights advocates\n\nThe announcement sparked immediate concerns among human and civil rights advocates and some former senior U.S. officials.\n\nOne recently departed DHS official said it could confer on the immigrant detainees the same status – and lack of basic rights – as those detained as suspected terrorists after the 9/11 al-Qaida attacks in the U.S. in 2001. That official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the order, said authorities have long looked at Guantanamo as a place for use in an emergency to hold those detained in a mass maritime migration to the U.S. and stressed that there are too many potential variables to support or criticize the effort without knowing more details.\n\nOnly about 15 suspected terrorist detainees remain at the facility set up at Guantanamo Bay in the years since the 9/11 attacks, including the accused mastermind of the coordinated plane hijackings, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and several alleged accomplices.\n\nGitmo or GTMO, as it is informally known, has a documented history of human rights violations, including allegations of torture and indefinite detention without trial by United Nations officials and other legal experts who have inspected the facility.\n\nDetaining migrants at Guantanamo Bay almost certainly could lead to legal challenges regarding the rights of people sent there, both under U.S. and international law. The Department of Justice under the administration of President George W. Bush, was initially accused of using the facility's location outside of the United States to circumvent legal and constitutional protections, prompting a decades-long legal battle about due process and access to legal representation for the people detained there.\n\nPresidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden have tried to shut down the facility but have been rebuffed, mostly by Republicans in Congress.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/04/election-2024-live-updates-trump-harris/76033477007/", "title": "Election 2024 Monday recap: Trump, Harris make final push for votes", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news on the campaign trail for the 2024 election on Monday, Nov. 4.

They have to cheat. And they do it and they do it very well,\" Trump said.\n\nHe also cast doubt on the accuracy of voting machines in his speech. According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, states routinely test and certify their voting machines and conduct checks to ensure ballots are properly counted before election results are finalized.\n\nFor months, Trump and his allies have tried to sow uncertainty around the security of the 2024 race, which political science and democracy experts said would only increase the risk of political violence in the aftermath of the election.\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump tells Grand Rapids: 'We're going to blow this thing away'\n\nDonald Trump started his remarks in Grand Rapids, Michigan, by reminiscing about the city, the same place he ended both his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.\n\n“I want to say a very special hello to Grand Rapids.

Because, you know, we're leading. We're leading going in by hundreds of thousands of votes, but just pretend we're tied or losing by a little bit, because we want to put on a display tomorrow of unity and everything,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nThe final results of the 2024 race won’t be ready on election night. Some key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'You will decide the outcome,' Harris tells Pennsylvania\n\nHarris told her supporters in Philadelphia on Monday that the swing state's voters would choose the next U.S. president.\n\n\"You will decide the outcome of this election, Pennsylvania,\" she said.\n\nHarris said at the rally, the last one of her campaign: \"America is ready for a fresh start, ready for a new way forward.\"\n\nShe pledged to be a president \"for all Americans\" and told the crowd that \"one of the highest forms of patriotism\" is to fight for the ideals and promise of America.\n\n\"I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it,\" she said.\n\nHarris said she sees that same promise in the faces of her rallygoers. \"We are the promise of America,\" she declared from outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump escalates rhetoric against migrants, opponent\n\nDonald Trump suggested at his rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Monday that Penn State wrestlers should fight against migrants.\n\n“Those Penn State guys. I wanted them to wrestle the migrants . . . I told (Ultimate Fighting Championship President) Dana (White) here to set up your league of champions, unbelievable, best fighters in the world, and a migrant league. At the end, I want the migrant to go against the champion, and I think the migrant might actually win. That's how nasty some of these guys are,” Trump said.\n\nAt his previous rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested that Kamala Harris should be in the same ring as boxer Mike Tyson.\n\n“‘Put Mike in the ring with Kamala.’ That will be interesting,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nTrump has previously called his political opponents garbage, scum and enemy from within. Trump's latest comments come as both presidential campaigns have received criticism in recent days for heightened, and at times violent, political rhetoric.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and Josh Meyer\n\nJoe Rogan endorses Trump\n\nJoe Rogan, who hosts the podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” endorsed Trump in a post on X, formerly Twitter, sharing a video clip of an interview with Elon Musk as part of his announcement.\n\nMusk “makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way,” Rogan wrote on X. “For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump. Enjoy the podcast.”\n\nTrump and Rogan had previously sat down for a nearly three hour interview last month, where the two discussed topics ranging from extraterrestrial aliens to election interference.\n\n“He was great. And he's not a person that does endorsements, but he did an endorsement. So I just want to thank Joe Rogan. That's fantastic,” Trump said at his rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Monday.\n\nHarris did not appear on Rogan’s show. He wrote on X that her campaign had reached out to him and offered a date for an interview, but he ended up declining because he would have had to travel to her. “I strongly feel the best way to do it is in the studio in Austin,” he wrote.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHarris stops by Puerto Rican restaurant in Pennsylvania\n\nVice President Kamala Harris grabbed dinner at Puerto Rican restaurant Monday night after a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris’ motorcade stopped by Old San Juan Cafe in Reading, where she was greeted by the owner Diana de La Rosa. La Rosa gave the Democratic presidential nominee a tour of the small eatery and helped her place her order, which included cassava and yellow rice.\n\n“I’m very hungry,” Harris said. “I don’t get a chance to eat as often as I like.”\n\nSpotted inside the restaurant during Harris’ visit: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., and Reading Mayor Eddie Moran.\n\nHarris’ campaign has been making a push to reach Puerto Rican voters, especially after a comedian called the U.S. territory a “floating island of garbage” at a Donald Trump rally in Madison Square Garden.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nTrump: 'God saved me in order to save America'\n\nDonald Trump urged his supporters in Pittsburgh to get out and vote, referencing the July assassination attempt where he was shot in the ear by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n“Many people say that God saved me in order to save America,” Trump told the crowd, who burst into cheers.\n\n“And with your help, we will fulfill that extraordinary mission,\" Trump said. “Together, we're going to fulfill - we're going to save our country. But many, many people have said that. To every citizen across this land, I am asking for the honor of your vote.”\n\nTrump also said he would restore peace in the world and criticized his opponent’s handling of issues, including immigration.\n\n“We do not have to live this way,” he said.\n\nTrump and Harris are both deadlocked in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state. Both candidates crisscrossed through the state on Monday to court voters before Election Day.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRapper Will.i.am performs new song 'Yes She Can'\n\nRapper Will.i.am warmed up the crowd at an election-eve rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Philadelphia on Monday by performing a new song, “Yes She Can.”\n\n“What is wrong with America? Why can’t we get along in America?” the lyrics ask.\n\nThe song goes on to suggest that together Americans can break down barriers and urges them to “register and vote for your life.”\n\n“We could be better than we ever been, we about to have a woman president,” the song concludes, repeating the refrain, “Yes she can!”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nHarris knocks on doors in last-minute push in Pennsylvania\n\nSearching for any and every possible vote in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, Vice President Kamala Harris did a little door-knocking herself Monday night.\n\nHarris was joined by two campaign staff members as she briefly stopped by two homes in Reading, Pennsylvania. At one front door, Harris was greeted by a woman who immediately gave her a hug.\n\n“How are you?” Harris said as the woman introduced the vice president to her husband, Henry. “Hi, Henry. Kamala Harris,” the vice president said. “Very nice to meet you.”\n\nThe woman asked Harris how she is doing.\n\n“You know – it’s the day before the election,” Harris said. “I just wanted to come by and ask for your vote.”\n\n“Well, you got my vote already,” the woman said, adding her husband plans to vote Tuesday.\n\nAt another home, a man answered and introduced himself as Cole. “Cole, that’s our son’s name!” Harris said as she shook his hand.\n\nThe Harris campaign has boasted about dwarfing Trump in the ground game. Over the weekend, more than 90,000 Harris volunteers took part in get-out-the-vote activities, the campaign said, including knocking on more than 3 million doors across the seven battleground states.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nHarris: 'Momentum is on our side'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said momentum in her campaign will catapult her to the presidency.“Tomorrow is Election Day and the momentum is on our side,” Harris said during her rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a key swing state.Harris said that her campaign tapped into the “ambitions, the aspirations and the dreams” of the American people, adding that it’s time for a new generation of leadership in the United States.“I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States,” Harris said.But she urged those who have not voted to make sure to cast their ballots, saying “we must finish strong.”“Make no mistake, we will win,\" she said.- Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump says Jill Stein may be one of his 'favorite' politicians\n\nDonald Trump again voiced his liking for Stein, the Green Party’s presidential candidate, at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\n“I love the Green Party. Jill Stein…I never met her, but she may be one of my favorite politicians,” Trump told his supporters.\n\nHe previously said at a rally in June that he likes Stein “very much.”\n\nMany critics have said that Stein could act as a spoiler for Democrats and help Trump. In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times last month, Stein dismissed those concerns and said that “those conversations never go anywhere.”\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVance bashes Biden’s garbage comment, calls Harris ‘trash’\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance in Atlanta on Monday criticized Kamala Harris over a remark made last week by her boss, President Joe Biden. In a video call last Tuesday, Biden had referred to Trump supporters as “garbage.”\n\nThe Republican vice-presidential candidate used the moment to knock Harris.\n\n“And I want to ask us not to follow Kamala Harris’ terrible example, because I’m sure that everyone single one of us, all of us gathered here, know somebody planning to vote the wrong way tomorrow,” Vance told the crowd. “... Here in our movement, we love every citizen of this country.”\n\nVance soon followed this criticism with a bit of his own trash talk.\n\n“In two days, we are going to take out the trash in Washington, D.C., and the trash’s name is Kamala Harris,” he said.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris campaign touts ‘multiple paths’ to 270 electoral votes\n\nOn the eve of Election Day, the Harris campaign said Monday that all seven battleground states remain in play for the Democratic nominee, insisting the vice president doesn’t have to rely on the “blue wall” path for victory.\n\n“We truly believe that we have multiple paths to 270 electoral votes,” Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a call with reporters. “Sometimes when you get to this stage of the race, or even sooner, you often have to close out a pathway, or a state might not be in play. We are not seeing that at all.”\n\nAll seven of the top battlegrounds are margin-of-error races, polling has consistently showed.\n\nThe clearest path to victory for Harris has long been sweeping the three Rust Belt “blue wall” states that Biden carried in 2020: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Doing so would likely give Harris enough electoral votes to win the election even if she were to lose Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nBut if Harris loses one of the “blue wall” states, she would need to offset the loss with wins among the four Sun Belt states. And Harris would need to win two Sun Belt states if she wins Michigan and Wisconsin, but loses Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes up for grabs.\n\n“We obviously see that the’ blue wall’ has often been the most straightforward path to get to 270, but we equally see favorable results and numbers in all the Sun Belts,” said O’Malley Dillon.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nVance encourages Georgians to vote 10 times ‘the legal way’\n\nUsing one of his repeated rally lines, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance told a crowd of supporters in Atlanta on Monday evening to vote for Trump 10 times – legally.\n\n“Here is the legal way. The legal way to vote ten times is to get your friends to the polls and take yourself to the polls and get nine of your friends and family to go along with you,” Vance said.\n\nVance noted the Peach State’s tight margin of victory four years ago. In 2020, President Biden won Georgia by less than 12,000 votes. So far, the southern swing state has seen record-breaking early voting turnout.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump says Harris ‘copied’ his routine on Saturday Night Live\n\nDonald Trump claimed at a rally in Reading, Pa., on Monday that Kamala Harris ‘copied’ his routine on Saturday Night Live after she came onto the show just three days before the Nov. 5 election.\n\n“She uses everything I do. She uses…even Saturday Night Live they copied. They copied. Think of that. Saturday, oh she was great on - they copied my routine, I did it a long time ago, they copied the same routine. I think I did it better, actually. I don’t think - I think anybody could’ve done it. I think anybody could’ve done it better,” Trump said.\n\nDuring the show, comedian Maya Rudolph, who portrayed Harris, spoke to the real Harris through an empty vanity mirror. The two wore a similar suit and necklace, and Harris offered campaign advice to Rudolph.\n\nIn 2015 on “The Tonight Show,” Trump and comedian Jimmy Fallon did something similar. Fallon portrayed Trump, who spoke to the real Republican presidential candidate through a vanity mirror. Both also wore matching suits.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGeorgia Supreme Court cancels late-arriving absentee ballots for Cobb County\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court on Monday canceled any late-arriving absentee ballots that a lower-court judge had ordered be provided to 3,000 Cobb County voters who never received them.\n\nThe ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center filed the lawsuit after the county in a 2024 battleground state announced it would be mailing thousands of absentee ballots late. Superior Judge Robert Flournoy ordered the county to overnight ballots to voters and allow them to be counted as late as Friday.\n\nBut the Republican National Committee appealed the order because it opposes counting votes that arrive after Election Day. The state Supreme Court ruled that all ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day on Tuesday, as required by state law. The high court ordered county officials to hold on to the late-arriving ballots in a sealed container until further notice from the court.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nRapper Fat Joe to undecided Puerto Rican, Latino voters: ‘Where is your pride?’\n\nRapper Fat Joe, who is of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent, called on Monday for undecided Latino voters to remember the actions former President Donald Trump has taken against the community – from calling Mexicans “rapists” and “drug dealers” in 2016 to slow response to Puerto Rico after back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.\n\n“Where's your pride?” said Fat Joe, whose real name is Joseph Cartagena, during Vice President Kamala Harris’ rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania. “If you're still out there talking about ‘you might be voting for somebody or you're not decided.’ Where's your pride as a Latino?”\n\nHarris stopped in Allentown, a city in Pennsylvania that has a large Puerto Rican and Latino population, in an appeal to voters in the key swing state.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nHarris campaign bracing for Trump to again prematurely declare victory\n\nKamala Harris' president campaign on Monday warned that Republican Donald Trump might try to exploit 2024's late-counted votes to prematurely declare he won the election like he did four years ago.\n\n“We all know that it's going to take some time to get election results,” Dana Remus, the Harris campaign’s legal counsel, said in a call Monday with reporters. “We also all know that Trump will likely use this time to allege fraud, spread misinformation and claim premature victory.”\n\nPennsylvania and Wisconsin don’t allow the pre-canvassing of mail-in ballots until Election Day, meaning the process to count the ballots could drag past Tuesday in these key battleground states.\n\nJen O’Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris campaign, said it expects near-complete results from North Carolina and Georgia on election night but only partial results from Nevada, Wisconsin, Arizona and Pennsylvania. In Nevada, mail ballots are allowed to be counted if they come in by Nov. 9. And in Pennsylvania, provisional ballots aren’t counted until Nov. 8.\n\n“That's obviously not a sign of fraud. It's just the way it works,” O’Malley Dillon said. “We believe this race is going to be incredibly close. So we may not know the results of this election for several days, but we are very focused on staying calm and confident throughout this period as the process goes through.”\n\nIn the 2020 election, Trump falsely declared victory after in-person Election Day returns showed him leading in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. His leads vanished after mail-in ballots that skewed heavily toward Joe Biden were counted, propelling Biden to victory.\n\nIn a May interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a USA TODAY Network partner, Trump raised doubts about the 2024 election outcome. \"If everything's honest, I'd gladly accept the results,\" Trump said then. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nVance doubles down on anti-Harris message in last rally\n\nVance kicked off his final campaign stop Monday night by intensifying his criticism of Harris.\n\n“It’s the last day of the campaign, and I think today I’m just gonna say whatever the hell I want to,” Vance said in opening statements to a crowd of supporters in Newtown, Penn.\n\n“This is when I tell you what I really think of Kamala Harris.”\n\nThe GOP candidate called his Democratic opponent “a disaster,” adding that she should “go back to San Francisco where you belong.”\n\nVance later said he did have something nice to say about Harris: a backhanded compliment about her media appearances.\n\n“The one thing I’ll say nice about Kamala Harris is that every single time she gives an interview I think we gain about 50,000 votes,” Vance said.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nPennsylvania recount requests could prove ‘vexatious’: expert\n\nPennsylvania could be headed for a big recount. Or many little ones that a former judge says could prove “vexatious.”\n\nThe state is a key battleground where polls show a dead heat between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. State law calls for an automatic recount if the winning margin is less than 0.5%.\n\nThe state with 9.1 million voters has more than 9,000 voting precincts. Under a 1927 law, it only takes three voters in a precinct to pay $50 fee to request a recount from the county Court of Common Pleas – regardless of the margin of victory. Precincts are capped at 1,200 voters each, under state law.\n\nAfter a flurry of precinct recounts since 2020, the law was updated, according to experts at Keep Our Republic, an advocacy group in Pennsylvania. To force a broader county-level recount, the three voters requesting a recount would need to persuade a judge there was fraud or errors with computations on vote totals.\n\n“The bar is higher now if you want a broader recount. But the law itself allows for I think potentially vexatious behavior,” said John Jones, a former federal judge in Pennsylvania and a member of Keep Our Republic's advisory council in the state. “You should watch carefully in the week after the election, because there may be a number of petitions in counties and they would have to be adjudicated by the county court.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nImmigration takes center stage at Trump’s Pennsylvania rally\n\nDonald Trump continued to lean heavily into his anti-immigrant rhetoric at a rally in Reading, Pa., on the eve of Election Day, telling his supporters that Kamala Harris has “eradicated” the southern border.\n\n“They're taking over your towns, your schools, your hospitals,” Trump said, referring to migrants.\n\nHe later added that, “The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer.”\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, illegal border crossings reached record highs, averaging more than 2 million per year from 2021 to 2023, according to Customs and Border Protection. But more recently, illegal crossings – or “encounters” – at the southern border fell to the lowest total in nearly four years only months after Biden announced broad restrictions on asylum.\n\nTrump also claimed that migrant crime has been “as vicious as there's ever been.” But data analyzed between 2012 to 2022 found that undocumented immigrants have a homicide conviction rate 14% below that of native-born Americans. Immigrants have a 62% lower homicide rate and undocumented immigrants have a 41% lower total criminal conviction rate than native-born Americans.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi, Chris Mueller and Terry Collins\n\nTop US cybersecurity official: Election has 'never been more secure'\n\nTop U.S. cybersecurity director Jen Easterly said Monday that the 2024 elections are more secure than ever, and that local, state and federal election officials are on alert and ready to combat any domestic and foreign interference in the democratic process.\n\n“As we head into tomorrow, I can say with great confidence that our election infrastructure has never been more secure and that the election community has never been better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free and fair elections,” Easterly, the director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a briefing with reporters.\n\nEasterly and top election security aide Cait Conley acknowledged that there have been “small scale” disturbances, including Russian disinformation videos, severe weather, vandalism to some ballot drop boxes and other incidents that have for the most part already been made public.\n\nBut, Easterly said, “At this point, we see no evidence of activity that has the potential to materially impact the outcome of the presidential election.”\n\nCISA officials, in tandem with other officials nationwide, have been conducting hundreds of table-top exercises in recent years to prepare for any eventuality, Easterly said. She said various forms of disruptions are expected to continue on Election Day and beyond.\n\n“It's important to remember that disruptions happen in every election, which is why election officials invest so much into incident response, preparation and contingency plans,” Easterly said.\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nSpin the numbers: Trump aides express confidence\n\nElection Day is almost here - finally - so it's time for presidential campaigns to spin numbers and predict victory.\n\nThe Trump campaign put out a memo Monday claiming that, in battleground states, the women's vote and the urban vote are down (bad for Democrats) and the rural vote is up (good for Republicans).\n\nWe'll see when states start counting votes on Tuesday night.\n\nDemocrats - who say the numbers overall favor Harris - suspect that Trump is preparing to declare victory before all the key states are called, the better to sow confusion when legal challenges commence.\n\nTrump aides said a premature declaration won't be necessary - the former president is going to win it outright.\n\n\"We will declare victory when we are confident that we have the 270 electoral votes that we need,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters gathered for a Monday rally in Raleigh, N.C. \"The numbers show that President Trump is going to win this race.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nVideo: RNC official debunks myth about noncitizen voting\n\nImmigrants here illegally aren’t likely to be registered to vote in Pennsylvania because they don’t have drivers licenses or Social Security numbers, an official with the Republican National Committee said in a video first obtained by ProPublica.\n\nJoe Neild made the comments on one of the Republican Party’s election integrity calls. The party holds them often in battleground states to train poll workers and poll watchers. In the video, an unnamed participant asks Neild, “How do you know if they are illegal aliens? How can you spot that?”\n\n“If they’re illegal aliens, they’re not going to be inside the pollbook, because if they’re illegal aliens, they’re not going to be able to register to vote because they’ll need a drivers license number or a Social Security number,” Neild said. He said Pennsylvania requires proof of citizenship in order to get a drivers license.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Republican National Committee for comment. A voicemail left for Neild was not immediately returned.\n\nBrian Hughes, a senior advisor for Trump campaign, told USA TODAY that the party worker was training poll watchers appropriately about what their role is and isn’t. “One of the things you can’t do is become an enforcement mechanism in whether or not someone is a citizen to vote,” Hughes said.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\n'F around and find out': Philly DA delivers harsh warning against election interference\n\nPhiladelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner delivered a stern warning on Monday for anyone who plans to interfere or intimidate voters on Election Day after concerns of \"frivolous, bogus, challenges\" being brought to eligible voters.\n\n\"Everybody in this city is working and has been working for months to make sure that there will be nothing tough about (voting) and nothing to fear in that experience,\" he said.\n\nKrasner added: \"But I also wanna be clear, anybody who thinks it's time to play militia, F around and find out. Anybody who thinks it's time to insult, to deride, to mistreat, to threaten people, F around and find out. We do have the cuffs, we do have the jail cells, we do have the Philly juries, and we do have the state prisons. So if you're going to try and turn an election into some form of coercion, if you're going to try and bully people, bully votes or voters, try to erase votes, try any of that nonsense, we're not playing. F around and find out.\"\n\nKrasner literally said the letter \"F,\" pronounced \"eff,\" not the actual curse word.\n\nVoters are encouraged to contact the Election Protection hotline, a national, nonpartisan service should they encounter any voting irregularities: 866-OUR-VOTE.\n\nKrasner gave a final message to those intending to disrupt election proceedings: \"You can have your fun in a jail cell, because that's what's coming.\"\n\n-Sam Woodward\n\nWhen will election results be announced?\n\nDo not expect final results on Election Night.\n\nElection workers have never completed ballot counting on Election Day at any point in the country's history. This year, local and state certification deadlines range from two days to more than a month after Nov. 5.\n\nIn recent decades, news outlets have typically called the presidential race late on election night or the morning after, with two notable exceptions. In 2000, a famously close race and legal challenges dragged out the process — things likely to affect this year's cycle. In 2020, a rise in mail-in ballots during the COVID pandemic delayed results.\n\nThis year, state laws still in place in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin prohibiting election workers from counting early votes until Election Day are expected to delay results again.\n\n-Rachel Barber\n\nNorth Carolina sets record turnout in early voting despite hurricane damage\n\nNearly 4.5 million ballots in North Carolina were cast during early voting that ended Saturday, a new high-water mark above the 3.6 million cast during early voting in 2020, officials said.\n\nHurricane Helene heavily damaged 25 counties in the western part of the state. But turnout in those counties was 2 percentage points higher than in the rest of the rest, according to the state Board of Elections\n\nKaren Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state board of elections, called the workers and voters in the western counties “an inspiration to us all.”\n\nThe turnout included 4.2 million people who voted early in person and about 250,000 absentee ballots.\n\nAbout 57% of registered voters statewide have cast ballots. Up to another 1.5 million people are expected to vote on Election Day, according to Bob Phillips, the state’s executive director of Common Cause, a voting-rights advocacy group.\n\n“This has been a historic voter turnout for North Carolina,” Phillips said. “We’ve seen a lot of enthusiasm.”\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nFBI unveils election command post\n\nThe FBI has reported some foreign cyber-attacks during early voting in the 2024 election, but officials said it was not a major increase from 2020 as the agency opened its command post to respond to coordinate its response to election threats with other federal agencies, state and local authorities.\n\n“The threat reporting we’re getting in here is not a huge volume increase, but people are more aware of reporting information to the FBI,” James Barnacle, deputy assistant director of the FBI's criminal investigative division, told reporters during a tour Monday. “We have had some foreign malign influence operations and some attempted cyber attacks where adversaries are trying to hit the secretaries of state or state governments or local governments and cause issues with their infrastructure.”\n\nRussia, China and Iran are trying to influence the election, he said. For example, a video circulating in late October falsely portrayed the destruction of ballots in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which federal officials labeled a Russian hoax.\n\nThe FBI election command office has about 80 people from 12 agencies on hand at any time from agencies including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Secret Service; the postal inspection service, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department. The office opened on Friday and will remain open until at least Nov. 9.\n\n“This command post is a little more robust than it’s been in the past,” Barnacle said.\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nSecret Service prepare Washington and Florida for Election Day\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service is working to secure locations in the nation's capital and Palm Beach County, Florida, where Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will be on election night, respectively.\n\nThe agency said it is working with federal, state, and local partners to ensure heightened levels of safety. Fencing and other physical public safety measures will be installed around the White House, National Observatory, and the Palm Beach County Convention Center.\n\n\"These enhancements are not in response to any specific issue but are part of wide-ranging public safety preparations for Tuesday's election,\" a spokesperson for the U.S. Secret Service said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\n-Rachel Barber\n\nMusk Super PAC argues his $1 million giveaway not a lottery, DA says it’s illegal\n\nElon Musk's pro-Trump Super PAC picks winners of its $1 million-a-day giveaway based on who would be good spokespeople for its agenda and not registered voters at random, a lawyer for the tech billionaire said in court on Monday.\n\nChris Gober, a lawyer for Musk’s PAC political action committee made that argument in an effort to persuade a Pennsylvania judge that the giveaway was not an \"illegal lottery,\" as Philadelphia district attorney Lawrence Krasner alleges in a lawsuit seeking to block the payments ahead of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn response, Krasner took the stand to say the $1 million daily giveaways in the seven swing states expected to decide the election were indeed an illegal lottery. He also told Judge Angelo Foglietta that some Pennsylvania residents had been \"scammed for their information\" and called the giveaway a \"grift\" aimed at political marketing.\n\nIn his initial giveaways, Musk described it as a lottery-like system but changed the public messaging after legal experts – and, reportedly, the Justice Department – raised questions about its legality.\n\n\"There is no prize to be won, instead recipients must fulfill contractual obligations to serve as a spokesperson for the PAC,\" Gober said in the hearing before Foglietta.\n\nThe hearing in the key swing state comes just one day before Musk’s favored candidate Trump faces off against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in a tightly contested race.\n\n−Josh Meyer and Reuters\n\nFew problems with early voting: expert\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department election lawyer who is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said there were no significant problems with early voting such as voter intimidation or violent confrontations.\n\n“Election officials prepared for anything and everything,” Becker said. “But we saw no real issues.”\n\nWith about 80 million early votes cast, Becker said only isolated incidents were reported, such as a man with a machete was reported in Florida.\n\nMistakes that Becker described as normal included a shortage of staffers to handle mail ballots in Bucks County, Pennsylvania; an estimated 13,000 to 17,000 voters in Erie County, Pennsylvania, not receiving absentee ballots; and about 3,000 voters in Cobb County, Georgia, who didn’t get ballots. In each case, courts granted extra time for voters to receive and then return ballots.\n\n“This is normal,” Becker said. “This has been handled appropriately.”−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump jokes that Joe Biden likes him more than Kamala Harris\n\nDonald Trump at his rally in North Carolina on Monday morning said that Joe Biden said he liked Trump more than Kamala Harris. Minutes later he clarified that the comment was a joke.\n\n“Here’s news it’s breaking today. Sleepy Joe Biden has announced officially that he likes Trump more than he likes Kamala,” Trump said. The crowd roared with cheers.\n\nLater in his speech, Trump said he was “only kidding about Joe.”\n\n“He didn't officially say that,” Trump said. “When I say it's official. No, no, I'm only kidding.”\n\nBiden has made no such announcement. The president endorsed Harris after he stepped out of the 2024 race in July and has been a vocal supporter of Harris’ campaign ever since.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nNonpartisan election expert warns against Russian disinformation videos\n\nDavid Becker, director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, urged voters Monday to be skeptical of any videos that could be Russian disinformation aimed at dividing Americans in the wake of the presidential election.\n\nOne recent example is a viral video showing mail ballots destroyed in Pennsylvania, which federal investigators said was a Russian hoax.\n\n\"We're going to see a lot of that,\" Becker warned. \"Any videos you see -- vote flipping, people claiming to have committed voter fraud, people claiming that voter fraud was rampant because of what they saw someone else do. Everyone should be wary of any videos or claims made on social media, the Russians are behind a lot of this.\"\n\nThe federal government has been acting quickly to identify which videos were made by Russians to influence the election, he added.\n\n\"It's clearly designed to incite anger on the part of supporters of a losing candidate and divide us as a nation and make us hate our fellow Americans.\"\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nTrump promises new tariff, this time on Mexico\n\nDonald Trump vowed to immediately enact a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico during a rally in Raleigh, N.C. on Monday as punishment if the country doesn’t help the U.S. decrease the flow of immigration.\n\nTrump argued the proposal has an “100% chance of working” because if the 25% tariff doesn’t work, he’ll squeeze the country with a 50% or 75% tariff.\n\nIf elected, Trump has proposed enacting a variety of other tariffs, which act as taxes on imported goods, including a 60% tariff on Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on goods from around the world.\n\nThe policies are designed to bolster U.S. manufacturing, but economists have said the proposals would raise prices on U.S. consumers and reduce economic growth by leading to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nTariffs on Mexico could have a widespread impact, as Mexico is the No. 1 trading partner for the U.S.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nSenate polling roundup: Democrats retain advantage in toss-up races, though Republicans have edge on retaking chamber\n\nA wave of polling released Monday and over the weekend continue to show Republicans with an edge on retaking the U.S. Senate. Democrats retain an advantage in key battleground states.\n\nThe Cook Political Report has named Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin the four toss-up Senate races. All these seats are currently held by Democrats.\n\nFive new polls from Pennsylvania give Democratic Sen. Bob Casey a 1- to 5-point lead in the Keystone State, while one poll indicates the race is tied and one gives GOP challenger David McCormick a 1-point lead.\n\nTwo new Michigan polls found the race between former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers and Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin is tied. Four polls gave Slotkin a lead between 2 and 8 percentage points, while one gave Rogers a 1-point lead.\n\nFour new polls from Wisconsin give incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin a 1- to 6-point lead, while one poll indicates she is tied with GOP challenger Eric Hovde. One poll gives Hovde a 1-point lead.\n\nAnd in Ohio -- the toss-up state recognized as most likely to flip to Republicans -- one new poll showed Sen. Sherrod Brown's opponent, Bernie Moreno, with a 1-point lead.\n\nArizona and Nevada are expected to slightly favor Democrats, and new polls indicate that is still the case. In Nevada, three polls say Democratic incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen has a 2- to 9-point advantage over Republican candidate Sam Brown, while one has the race tied.\n\nIn Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Reuben Gallego is running against former TV anchor Kari Lake, four new polls gave Gallego a 2- to 8-point advantage.\n\nTo retake control of the chamber, Republicans only need to flip two seats. They've already got one in the bag: West Virginia, as Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin is retiring and a Republican is sure to win his spot.\n\nDemocrats are hoping they can make up for potential losses in Ohio and Montana by beating vulnerable Republicans in Florida and Texas. But two new polls from Morning Consult found voters preferred incumbent Republican Sens. Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas by 3 percentage points each.\n\nYou can read more about each of these polls in detail here.\n\n−Riley Beggin\n\nHow to follow results on election night\n\nYou can follow along with the USA TODAY Network's hub, which will show election results as they are coming in from around the country especially in critical swing states that could determine the outcome of the campaign between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nIt will also feature the dozens of House and Senate races that will also determine who controls Congress.Live results and analysis will also be featured on USATODAY.com, along with our livestream.\n\nFor the first time in its history, the Associated Press will also offer a digital livestream of Tuesday night's US presidential election results.

Although, Trump did come close to flipping the state with a libertarian reputation in 2016.\n\n“What we’re doing is expanding the map,” Vance said. “I believe in two days; we will turn New Hampshire red.”\n\nBut Trump winning New Hampshire is still a long shot. A recent Saint Anselm College survey of New Hampshire voters showed Harris leading Trump by 5 points, 51%-46%.\n\n– Margie Cullen and Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump escalates violent rhetoric toward media at Pennsylvania rally Sunday\n\nDonald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that a potential assassin would have to shoot through the news media to hit him.\n\nIn a wide-ranging speech Sunday morning in which he also repeated unfounded claims about voter fraud, Trump ramped up his rhetoric against journalists. Pointing to the protective glass surrounding him, he said, “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that.”\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said the president's comments weren't about the press, but instead about his own personal safety in light of the two assassination attempts against him earlier this year.\n\nTrump's comments come as both presidential campaigns have received criticism in recent days for heightened, and at times violent, political rhetoric. Last week, Trump suggested that rifles should be trained on former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who has endorsed Harris and become one of the former president's most vocal GOP critics.\n\n– Josh Meyer and Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen will we know the results on Election Day?\n\nDon't expect final results on election night. Local and state certification deadlines range from two days to more than a month after Nov. 5.\n\nAn increase in mail-in ballots amid the COVID pandemic delayed results in 2020. It took four days for votes to be counted and for news outlets to call the race for President Joe Biden. In 2016, the race was called for Donald Trump in the early hours of the next morning.\n\nIt is unclear how long vote counting will take this year, but legal challenges may also drag out the process of confirming a winner, as they did in the 2000 election.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhat time do the polls open and close?\n\nMost states will allow voters to cast their ballots between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Election Day.

In response, NBC provided Trump airtime Sunday, allowing him to directly address viewers during the NASCAR 2024 Cup playoff race, CNN's Brian Stelter reported.\n\nThe FCC's equal time rule requires American radio and television broadcast stations to provide equal access to competing political candidates.

However, after backlash from a Trump rally speaker’s statement against Puerto Rico and a new poll showing Harris has a chance in red Iowa, Trump is now standing at –138 and Harris at +120.\n\nOther betting odds have similarly tightened.\n\nThe betting favorite has only lost twice since 1866, according to the Conversation, a nonprofit news organization.\n\n-- James Powel and Rachel Barber\n\nLatest New York Times/Siena poll shows Trump, Harris deadlocked in key states\n\nWith just hours until Election Day, polls are continuing to show a tight presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump\n\nSwing state polls published by the New York Times and Sienna College on Sunday showed Kamala Harris narrowly ahead in Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Georgia, while Trump led in Arizona. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two pivotal blue wall states, Harris and Trump were locked in a dead heat.\n\nBut the results in every state were within the survey’s margin of error of ±3.5%, meaning the leads could be statistical errors and aren’t definite. Both candidates are counting on winning a combination of the seven swing states to get them to 270 electoral votes in the electoral college.\n\n-- Karissa Waddick\n\nAre banks open on election day?\n\nBranches of Bank of America, Truist, PNC, Capital One, Wells Fargo and other banks will be open their regular hours on Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\nOther banking services, such as ATMs and online banking, should also be available as usual on Election Day.\n\n-- Gabe Hauari\n\nIs election day a federal holiday?\n\nElection Day is not a federal holiday.\n\nSome states do, however, observe Election Day as a holiday.

But Judd said he remains excited about Trump’s calls to strengthen immigration enforcement and emphasize law and order in his second term.\n\nOne of Trump’s first acts, though, disappointed Judd. Following through on a campaign promise, Trump announced Monday night — hours after his inauguration — that he signed an order granting pardons or commutations to everyone charged with or convicted of crimes related to the U.S. Capitol attack of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump’s action has local relevance. The list of nearly 1,600 accused rioters includes eight current or former Polk County residents, including three — Jonathan Pollock, Olivia Pollock and Joseph Hutchinson III — accused of assaulting police officers outside the Capitol.\n\n“Certainly it’s within the president’s authority to do what he did,” Judd said Tuesday. “I would have much rather that he considered those cases independently, rather than blanket pardons and commutations because there is never an acceptable reason to assault, hit, attack law enforcement officers who are trying to do their job. So, I certainly, if I were president, I would not have commuted or pardoned anyone that attacked a law enforcement officer.”\n\nJudd added that he did not know the circumstances of each individual case. But many of the nearly 1,600, some of whom have already been convicted or pleaded guilty, were charged with assaulting police officers on Jan. 6.\n\nThe Pollock siblings, who lived on a family property in North Lakeland, joined friends and relatives in traveling to Washington, D.C., to attend Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally, at which he repeated his false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election and called upon Vice President Mike Pence to block certification of the results showing Biden as the winner.\n\nLike many Trump supporters, the Pollocks and Hutchinson then walked from the Ellipse to the Capitol, where members of Congress were meeting to approve the Electoral College count, according to court records.\n\nPair accused of violence\n\nArrest affidavits included photos and videos captured by officers’ body cameras, showing people identified as Jonathan Pollock and Hutchinson fighting with police outside the Capitol. Prosecutors said that Pollock, 25, wearing camouflage attire and a ballistic plate-carrier vest, yanked a plastic riot shield away from an officer and then used it as a weapon to strike other officers.\n\nAt the Upper West Terrace, Pollock grabbed an officer by the shoulders and tried to throw him over a metal railing, prosecutors alleged.\n\nPhotos and video showed a man identified as Hutchinson, 28, wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, a baseball cap and a ballistic plate-carrier vest outside the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nA court filing from April 2022 described Hutchinson’s conduct at the U.S. Capitol as “particularly egregious.” In less than 30 minutes, it said, “he participated in four separate assaults on law enforcement officers, several in close coordination with Jonathan Pollock.”\n\nOlivia Pollock, 34, faced charges of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers, as well as entering or remaining in a restricted area, an act of physical violence on the Capitol grounds and disorderly and disruptive conduct.\n\nNeither the Pollocks nor Hutchinson is accused of entering the Capitol building, but prosecutors said that Jonathan Pollock reached the mouth of a tunnel at the entrance to the Capitol.\n\nJonathan Pollock evaded arrest after his indictment in June 2021 and remained a fugitive for about 2½ years. The FBI offered a reward of up to $30,000 for information leading to his arrest.\n\nPollock faced 17 counts on such charges as civil disorder; assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers using a dangerous weapon; theft of government property; entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon; and an act of physical violence in the Capitol grounds or buildings.\n\nOlivia Pollock and Hutchinson were arrested in 2021 and released on bond. Shortly before their planned trials in 2023, both disabled their GPS monitors and became fugitives, the Department of Justice said.\n\nFBI agents captured all three on Jan. 6, 2024, at a ranch in southern Lake County. They had been held in a jail in Washington, D.C., since shortly after their arrests.\n\nFiling request for dismissal\n\nFour from Polk County have been convicted or accepted plea deals: Corinne Montoni, formerly of Lakeland; Joshua Doolin of Polk City; Thomas Osborne of Lakeland; and Christopher Madison of Winter Haven.\n\nBrian Boele of Lakeland was awaiting trial.\n\nNone of those were accused of assaulting police officers. A judge found Doolin guilty of three charges and sentenced him to 18 months in prison, though he was released early in response to a revision in sentencing guidelines.\n\nMontoni served a short sentence. Osborne and Madison were still awaiting their sentencing hearings.\n\nThe pardons would affect Doolin, whose sentence included 36 months of supervised release after the completion of his prison term.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the Department of Justice had not revealed details on the schedule for the release of the Jan. 6 defendants being held in jail. By Tuesday afternoon, lawyers for Olivia Pollock and Madison had filed motions to dismiss all charges against them, citing Trump’s executive order.\n\nU.S. Circuit Judge Amit P. Mehta of the District of Columbia issued an order Tuesday dismissing the indictment against Osborne, who had been found guilty in December on one felony count and three misdemeanors. A U.S. attorney filed a motion Tuesday to dismiss the indictment against Boele. Another filed Tuesday to dismiss all charges against Jonathan Pollock.\n\n'FOFO,' Grady Judd says\n\nAbout 140 police officers were assaulted at the Capitol, and dozens were injured, according to a police union. One officer, Brian Sicknick, died after being pepper-sprayed while defending the Capitol. A medical examiner determined that he died from a stroke. Four other officers died by suicide within months of the riot.\n\nOne of rioters, Ashli Babbitt, died after being shot by an officer as she attempted to climb through a broken window outside the House Speaker’s lobby. Another rioter died of a reported drug overdose.\n\nThe rioters caused about $2.8 million in damage to the Capitol building, according to the Department of Justice.\n\n“I will provide a word to the wise,” Judd said. “They did receive a pardon or their sentences commuted. That should not embolden them to think that they can assault or attack local law enforcement officers. Trying that here, they will be immediately arrested, and if they resist us, we’ll use whatever force is necessary to get them in custody. If it takes whipping their butt to get them in jail, we'll do that. Then that will be their choice.”\n\nJudd used the acronym “FAFO,” which he explained to mean, “fool around and find out.”\n\nDeportations?Grady Judd says Polk County deputies won't knock on doors to round up undocumented residents\n\nGabe Pollock, the brother of Jonathan and Olivia Pollock, was not present Tuesday morning at the gun store he owns in North Lakeland. An employee said Gabe was in Washington, D.C.\n\n“No trespassing” signs have been posted during the past year at the property in the Kathleen area occupied by multiple Pollock family members.\n\nThere was no answer Tuesday morning to a knock on the door of Boele’s house in Lakeland.\n\nResponses from representatives\n\nThe Pollock family lives in the district of Rep. Laurel Lee, R-Brandon. At the time of Jonathan and Olivia’s indictment, the property was in the district of Rep. Scott Franklin, R-Lakeland.\n\n“Constitutionally it’s a president’s prerogative to issue pardons,” Franklin said Tuesday in an emailed statement. “It’s clear from his actions and comments yesterday, President Trump intends to turn the page on the division of the last four years and move forward on a more positive note. Here in Congress, I’m focused on delivering the America First priorities Floridians voted for in November, securing the border, growing our economy, lowering costs, renewing President Trump’s tax cuts and restoring our energy independence.”\n\nA spokesperson said Tuesday that Lee had no comment. The Ledger received no response to a request for comment from the office of Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Clermont, whose district includes northern Polk County.\n\nRep. Darren Soto, D-Kissimmee, criticized Trump for the pardons in a post on X.\n\n“Pres Trump pardons violent Jan 6th insurrectionists,” the post said. “He sides with criminals over police officers on his first day. It’s more lawlessness by the returning President.”\n\nJohn Velebir, chair of the Polk County Republican Executive Committee, praised Trump for the pardoning of what he called “the J6 political prisoners.”\n\n“I believe the vast majority of the people arrested for the events of J6 were overcharged and maliciously prosecuted for mostly misdemeanor crimes and given extremely harsh sentences,” Velebir said by email. “Also reports coming out of the DC jail tell of deplorable conditions and treatment by staff. They were political prisoners of the Biden administration and persecuted as a warning to not speak out against the government.“\n\nVelebir said the pardons “are absolutely the right thing to do as a first step in ending the weaponization of government against political opponents.” He said that he was expressing his own and not that of the Polk County Republican Party.\n\nJohn Hill, chair of the Polk County Democratic Party, offered a contrasting view.\n\n\"January 6th, 2021 is a day that is forever associated with hatred and violence against law enforcement, elected representatives and the very physical symbols of our nation,\" Hill said by email. \"The individuals who perpetrated these crimes should be subject to our justice system. Many of them, including the leader of the Proud Boys, a group with neo-fascist beliefs that advocates hatred and violence, have already been found guilty and sentenced for the crimes they committed.\"\n\nHill continued: \"We are now faced with a President who supports these criminals and lauds their actions. The very actions that led to multiple assaults on over 150 law enforcement members. And this from a party that proclaims themselves to be the party of 'law and order.' It is unconscionable to reward these individuals who attacked the very fabric of our American democracy.\"\n\nHill added that the Democratic Party of Polk County does not view the eight local Jan. 6 defendants as patriots but as the opposite.\n\nTrump issued the blanket pardons and commutations despite statements within the previous week from Vice President J.D. Vance and Trump's nominee for Attorney General, Pam Bondi, suggesting he would not pardon anyone who committed violence at the Capitol.\n\nGary White can be reached at gary.white@theledger.com or 863-802-7518.

He called Puerto Rico an \"island of garbage\" and disparaged Black Americans, Latinos and Jewish people. Democrats and at least two Florida Republicans, including Sen. Rick Scott, swiftly condemned Hinchcliffe’s remarks about Puerto Rico.\n\n\"This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,\" Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement after the rally addressing the comedian’s comment about Puerto Rico.\n\nAt the rally, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said he presided over the securest border in American history (he didn’t), that the Federal Emergency Management Agency didn’t deliver hurricane relief because the government spent its money bringing immigrants into the country illegally (it didn’t) and that foreign nations were emptying their prisons and sending convicts to the United States (they’re not).\n\nA gaggle of speakers preceded Trump, including his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio; Trump’s sons Eric and Don Jr.; Trump’s wife, Melania; his daughter-in-law and Republican National Committee co-chair, Lara Trump; U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.; Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White; professional wrestler Hulk Hogan; entrepreneur Elon Musk; and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\nCarlson riffed about Harris’ potential victory marking \"the first Samoan, Malaysian, low-IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president.\" Harris identifies as a Black woman of multicultural descent; her mother was born in India, and her father was born in Jamaica.\n\nTrump nevertheless said the Republican Party he leads \"has really become the party of inclusion, and there’s something very nice about that.\"\n\nTrump’s choice of New York City as a rally site might have challenged political logic; New York, as a state, has voted for the Democratic candidate for president for decades, though Madison Square Garden has hosted major political events for more than a century. Appearing in New York City also placed Trump in the backyard of officials whom he frequently has criticized, including District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who obtained a 34-count felony conviction against Trump for falsifying business records.\n\nHere are several claims we fact-checked:\n\nTrump said Harris \"has imported criminal migrants from prisons and jails, insane asylums and mental institutions from all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo.\"\n\nPants on Fire! There is no evidence that countries are emptying their prisons or mental institutions and sending people to illegally migrate to the U.S.\n\nImmigration officials arrested about 108,000 noncitizens with criminal convictions (whether in the U.S. or abroad) from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, federal data shows. That accounts for people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone was let in.\n\nTrump said, \"I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\"\n\nLegal experts told PolitiFact that Trump doesn’t have the authority to use the law to carry out mass deportations and that invoking it would lead to legal challenges.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act lets a president quickly deport noncitizens without due process if they are from a country at war with the U.S.\n\nThe law has been used only three times in U.S. history, all during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was during World War II, and it was used to place noncitizens from Japan, Germany and Italy in internment camps.\n\nTrump said, \"Think of this: 325,000 children are missing, dead, sex slaves or slaves. They came through the open border, and they're gone.\"\n\nThis is a distortion of federal data about migrant children.\n\nAn August federal oversight report about unaccompanied minors released from federal government custody said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had not served a \"notice to appear\" to more than 291,000 unaccompanied minors as of May. (A notice to appear is a charging document authorities issue and file in immigration court to start removal proceedings.)\n\nThe report said that unaccompanied children \"who do not appear for court are considered at higher risk for trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor.\" The report doesn’t state how many children have actually been trafficked.\n\nThe report led Republican lawmakers and conservative news outlets to say that ICE \"lost\" the children or that they are \"missing.\" But that’s not what it said.\n\nTrump said Harris \"vowed to abolish\" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nFalse.\n\nAs a U.S. senator in 2018, Kamala Harris criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including a policy that led to family separations at the border. In that context, Harris said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s function should be reexamined and that \"we need to probably even think about starting from scratch.\" But Harris didn’t say there shouldn’t be immigration enforcement. In 2018, Harris also said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had a role and should exist.\n\nEconomy\n\nTrump said Harris \"cast the deciding vote that launched the worst inflation in the history of our country. She cost the typical American family over $3,000 in a short period, but over $30,000 over the last three years.\"\n\nMostly False. Harris cast the tiebreaking vote on the motion to proceed to a final Senate vote on the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, a coronavirus pandemic relief bill.\n\nAn ideologically diverse cross-section of economists agrees that the American Rescue Plan added a couple of percentage points to inflation but didn’t cause the wider spike. The primary causes, they say, were supply chain disruptions from the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nYear-over-year inflation peaked in 2022 at about 9%. That makes it the worst annual rate in 40 years, but not the worst in American history.\n\nThe $28,000 increase is a credible estimate of how much extra households have paid for purchases since Biden took office. But that figure ignores that wage gains have evened out much — or depending on the time frame, all — of those increased costs.\n\nLGBTQ+ issues\n\nTrump said Harris \"called for free sex change operations on illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense.\"\n\nThe statement needs clarification, so we rated it Mostly True.\n\nHarris’ history on this topic goes back to when she was California’s attorney general and represented the state’s corrections department as it sought to block a lower court order requiring the agency to provide gender-affirming surgery to a transgender inmate.\n\nDuring her run for president in the 2019 Democratic primary, Harris said she favored access to gender-affirming surgery for people in prisons and immigration detention. Harris has not campaigned on this issue in 2024, but when asked about it during a Fox News interview Oct. 16, she said, \"I will follow the law.\"\n\nFederal law requires that prisons provide necessary medical care to inmates, and several courts have ruled that gender-affirming care, including surgery, is included. Despite these court rulings, access to gender-affirming surgery in prisons is limited, and the number of transgender prisoners in federal prisons who have received it is minuscule — two.\n\nWe found no record of gender-affirming surgeries being provided in immigration detention.\n\nCrime\n\nTrump said Harris \"pledged to confiscate your guns\" and \"endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership.\"\n\nThis distorts Harris’ current stance.\n\nAs a 2019 presidential primary candidate, Harris said, \"I support a mandatory gun buyback program\" for assault weapons. She no longer supports this policy, which would not have applied to handguns, the most popular firearms.\n\nThe Harris campaign told The New York Times that she supports banning assault weapons but not a requirement to sell them to the federal government. As vice president, Harris has urged states to pass red flag laws and supported federal gun safety legislation that included funding for mental health and school security resources.\n\nThere is evidence that she supported a gun ban, but that was limited to one city nearly 20 years ago. In 2005, when Harris was the San Francisco district attorney, she supported a ballot measure that would have banned city residents from owning handguns. Voters approved the measure, but the courts struck it down.\n\nTrump said, \"Your crime is through the roof\" and that newly released statistics showed that \"crime was up 45%\" under the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nTrump may have meant to say 4.5%, a figure that has been cited in some media accounts sympathetic to Trump. But even that lower figure would be misleading.\n\nThis comment was part of a discussion by Trump of an exchange he had with ABC News’ David Muir during the Sept. 10 presidential debate in Philadelphia, in which Muir said crime had declined and Trump insisted that crime had increased.\n\nIn general, FBI annual data has shown a decline in violent crime from 2020 to 2023. Multiple nongovernmental crime statistics analyses also found violent crime declined in 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn October, it was reported that the FBI had updated its violent crime data to be more complete, a standard annual process. The updated data led some commentators to say this meant crime had increased between 2021 and 2022; rather than being down by 2.1%, some said, it was up by 4.5% between those two years, with thousands of new violent crimes.\n\nHowever, crime experts including Jeff Asher of JH Analytics said this is a statistical artifact.\n\nThat’s because the baseline for this comparison is the data for 2021, which Asher and other crime experts say is unreliable because the FBI switched crime reporting systems that year and compliance by local police departments plummeted. (The problem has been fixed in the annual data for later years.)\n\nAsher described the revisions released in October as unusually large, and for unclear reasons. But he wrote that \"the FBI’s 2023 estimates show a continued small decline in violent crime with a historically large decline in murder.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/05/state-union-read-president-donald-trumps-full-address/2781766002/", "title": "State of the Union: Read President Donald Trump's full address", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump used his State of the Union address on Tuesday to both detail his agenda and highlight his accomplishments over his first two years in office.\n\nThe speech was Trump's first before a divided government with Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives. And that division was on full display during his address as Democrats stayed seated and refrained from clapping at various points during his remarks.\n\nTrump used much of his speech to highlight his plans for immigration reform, along with boasting about the economy and low unemployment rate. He also took on the various investigations revolved around his presidency, including both the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling and the probes that Democrats have started in the House.\n\nHere's the full text of Trump's speech released from the White House:\n\nMadam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\n\n\n\nWe meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.\n\n\n\nMillions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.\n\n\n\nThe agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.\n\n\n\nMany of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first.\n\nThere is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.\n\n\n\nThis year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission, and the power of American pride.\n\n\n\nIn June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade – the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.\n\n\n\nIn the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.\n\nWe can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.\n\n\n\nBut we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution – and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.\n\n\n\nTogether, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make.\n\n\n\nWe must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.\n\n\n\nTonight, I ask you to choose greatness.\n\nOver the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.\n\n\n\nIn just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom – a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs – something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.\n\n\n\nWages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history – 157 million.\n\n\n\nWe passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.\n\n\n\nWe virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.\n\n\n\nWe eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty – and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.\n\nMy Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.\n\n\n\nWe have unleashed a revolution in American energy – the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.\n\nAfter 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone – almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States – and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.\n\n\n\nIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way!\n\n\n\nWe must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.\n\n\n\nThis new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.\n\n\n\nNow is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.\n\n\n\nIn the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.\n\n\n\nAnd just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population – and far beyond.\n\n\n\nAlice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing – and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.\n\nMore:Trump touts economy in State of the Union address, criticizes 'investigations'\n\nRelated:Here's who lawmakers are bringing to Trump's State of the Union address\n\nIn June, I commuted Alice's sentence – and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.\n\n\n\nWhen I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.\n\n\n\nInspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.\n\n\n\nWe are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.\n\n\n\nAs we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country.\n\nNow, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.\n\n\n\nThe Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.\n\n\n\nNow is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.\n\n\n\nAs we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.\n\n\n\nThis is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.\n\n\n\nTonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.\n\n\n\nNo issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration – reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.\n\n\n\nTolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate – it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.\n\n\n\nHuman traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.\n\n\n\nTens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities – including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.\n\n\n\nThe savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in.\n\nMore:Watch live as President Donald Trump gives his State of the Union address\n\nRelated:Only four of nine Supreme Court justices attend Trump's 2019 State of the Union address\n\nYear after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.\n\n\n\nI've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.\n\n\n\nHere tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.\n\n\n\nTo Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.\n\n\n\nNot one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.\n\n\n\nIn the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.\n\n\n\nWe are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: \"If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job.\" Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.\n\n\n\nSpecial Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement – and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.\n\n\n\nMy Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.\n\n\n\nIt includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall – but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built.\n\nThis is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier – not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.\n\n\n\nSan Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.\n\n\n\nThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime – one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.\n\n\n\nSimply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.\n\n\n\nAs we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.\n\n\n\nNo one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before – and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.\n\n\n\nAs part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.\n\n\n\nTo build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount – reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.\n\n\n\nWe are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.\n\n\n\nTherefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods – and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us – I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.\n\n\n\nAnother historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.\n\n\n\nI have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried – until now.\n\n\n\nOur new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement – or USMCA – will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.\n\n\n\nTonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.\n\n\n\nBoth parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure.\n\n\n\nI know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill – and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.\n\n\n\nThe next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs – and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\n\nAlready, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.\n\n\n\nBut we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.\n\n\n\nI am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.\n\n\n\nNo force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.\n\n\n\nTonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.\n\n\n\nJoining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: \"Last Day of Chemo.\" Grace – you are an inspiration to us all.\n\n\n\nMany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.\n\n\n\nTo help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave – so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.\n\n\n\nThere could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.\n\n\n\nTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.\n\n\n\nLet us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God.\n\n\n\nThe final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security.\n\n\n\nOver the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military – with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO – but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.\n\n\n\nAs part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.\n\n\n\nUnder my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests.\n\n\n\nFor example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.\n\n\n\nPerhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't – in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.\n\n\n\nAs part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.\n\n\n\nTwo weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.\n\n\n\nWe stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom – and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.\n\n\n\nHere, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence – not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\n\n\n\nOne of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nOur approach is based on principled realism – not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel – and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.\n\n\n\nOur brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nAs a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.\n\n\n\nWhen I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.\n\n\n\nNow, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.\n\n\n\nI have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor – and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.\n\n\n\nIn Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement – but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.\n\n\n\nAbove all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole – and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.\n\n\n\nWe are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.\n\nMy Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.\n\n\n\nTo ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.\n\n\n\nWe will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.\n\n\n\nJust months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery – but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.\n\n\n\nTonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall – more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: \"It's the Americans.\"\n\n\n\nA second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. \"To me,\" Joshua recalls, \"the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.\"\n\n\n\nI began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight – seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.\n\n\n\nWhen American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.\n\n\n\nThey did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.\n\n\n\nWhy did they do it? They did it for America – they did it for us.\n\n\n\nEverything that has come since – our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice – all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.\n\n\n\nThink of this Capitol – think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.\n\n\n\nHere tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.\n\n\n\nWhat will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?\n\nI ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.\n\n\n\nWe must choose whether we are defined by our differences – or whether we dare to transcend them.\n\n\n\nWe must choose whether we will squander our inheritance – or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans.

Click here for updates.\n\nSix days after President Joe Biden’s inauguration, White House counsel Dana Remus put in a call to Ketanji Brown Jackson to see if the judge might be interested in a new job: replacing Merrick Garland on a powerful federal appeals court.\n\nThe new administration was poised to prioritize judicial vacancies and planned to push through slates of nominees that would send a message about how the President viewed the courts. Stellar credentials were essential, but Biden also wanted candidates who would bring a fresh professional and demographic diversity to benches across the country dominated by White males. He sought nominees who had worked as public defenders and civil rights attorneys, for instance.\n\nJackson – then serving on a federal trial court in Washington, DC – fit the bill perfectly. She had a glittering resume that included Harvard degrees and federal clerkships, but her lived experience was rooted in public service.\n\nLooming in the future was the possibility that Justice Stephen Breyer would retire from the Supreme Court, and the federal appeals court in Washington has been a stepping stone for high court nominees.\n\nRELATED: Breyer’s role on the Supreme Court and the hole he’s leaving\n\nBiden had pledged to make history by naming a Black woman to the Supreme Court. Such an historic move would highlight a group of female potential nominees who have breached barriers to reach the top of the legal profession. Jackson, who is African American and a former Breyer clerk, would likely be a top contender for that seat. An appeals court post would serve to further season her and boost her profile.\n\nAsked about race during her confirmation hearing last year, Jackson responded carefully. She said that she didn’t think race played a role in the kind of judge that she had been or would be, but she thought her professional background, especially as a trial court judge, would bring value.\n\n“I’ve experienced life in perhaps a different way than some of my colleagues because of who I am, and that might be valuable,” she said. “I hope it would be valuable if I was confirmed to the circuit court.” Last June, the Senate confirmed Jackson by a 53-44 vote.\n\nNow, Jackson, 51, is believed to be at the top of Biden’s list of potential candidates to replace Breyer, who intends to retire at the end of the current Supreme Court term.\n\n“The bench of Black women attorneys with stellar credentials is extremely deep,” said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. But, she noted, Jackson brings more than just a distinguished judicial record.\n\nShe has “an understanding of how the law affects people based on both her professional and lived experiences, and a powerful commitment to equal justice,” Wydra said.\n\nJackson has served as an assistant federal public defender, a commissioner on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a lawyer in private practice and on two prestigious federal courts.\n\nIf elevated to the high court, she would follow in the footsteps of the likes of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who took the seats of the justices they had worked for.\n\nJackson clerked for Breyer during the 1999 term after serving as a clerk in 1997-1998 to Judge Bruce M. Selya, a federal judge in Massachusetts.\n\nRELATED: The 3 Supreme Court justices to watch after Breyer retires\n\nAt an event in 2017 sponsored by the liberal American Constitution Society, she called working for Breyer an opportunity of a lifetime “to bear witness to the workings of his brilliant legal mind.” She also joked about how the justice often biked to work and would show up in his majestic chamber wearing “full bicycle regalia.”\n\nJackson often speaks about areas of her expertise in the law, when she addresses audiences, but she also talks about diversity and work-life balance.\n\nIn a 2017 speech at the University of Georgia School of Law, she reflected on her journey as a mother and a judge, emphasizing how hard it is for mothers to serve in big law firms – something she said she had done at times to help support her family.\n\nShe noted that the hours are long and there is little control over the schedule, which is “constantly in conflict with the needs of your children and your family.” She also highlighted the traps of launching a career in the law and pointed to recent studies that show that lawyers of color – both male and female – constitute only 8% of law firm equity partners nationwide.\n\nGlittering resume\n\nJackson left law firm life behind in 2010 to become a commissioner on the US Sentencing Commission, an independent agency that establishes sentencing policies and practices for the federal courts. She has said she learned to knit during her Senate confirmation process to channel her nervous energy.\n\nRachel Barkow, now a professor of law at New York University, served with Jackson on the bipartisan commission and noted pointedly how well the members worked together despite ideological differences. Another commissioner at the time was William H. Pryor Jr., a conservative judge who sits on the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nBarkow said Jackson was an “upbeat presence” who always does “what she is supposed to do, when she says she is going to do it.”\n\nAt the time, federal prisons were over capacity, and there was widespread bipartisan acknowledgement that federal drug sentences were too long. The seven-member body unanimously decided to lower federal drug sentences. They made the reductions retroactive, Barkow said, which meant more than 30,000 federal prisoners got lower sentences.\n\nPresident Barack Obama would go on to nominate Jackson to the US District Court for the District of Columbia, which she joined in 2013. For that confirmation hearing, she was introduced by a well-known Republican, Wisconsin’s Paul Ryan, who would go on to become speaker of the House and who happened to be related to her by marriage. (Jackson’s husband’s twin brother is married to the sister of Ryan’s wife.)\n\n“I know she is clearly qualified,” Ryan said. “But it bears repeating just how qualified she is.”\n\n“Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji’s intellect, for her character, for her integrity, is unequivocal,” he added.\n\nAt each of her judicial confirmation hearings, her husband, Patrick Jackson, a DC-based surgeon, has been pictured sitting behind her. The couple share two daughters, Talia and Leila. Her mother, a former public school science teacher and principal of a public magnet school in South Florida, and her father, a public high school teacher who was later chief counsel to the Miami-Dade County school board, also have been in attendance.\n\nOne thing she did not discuss was the life sentence her uncle, Thomas Brown, Jr., received after a drug offense.\n\nIn 2008, when she was in private practice and well before she became a judge, Jackson referred her uncle’s file to WilmerHale, a law firm that handles numerous clemency petitions, according to a spokesperson for the firm.\n\nThe firm submitted the petition on Brown’s behalf on October 7, 2014, and Obama commuted his sentence on November 22, 2016. According to the firm, Jackson had “no further involvement in the matter” after making the referral. Jackson’s chambers said she would decline comment on the issue.\n\nPublic service\n\nAt her 2021 confirmation hearing for the seat on the federal appeals court, Jackson talked about her professional trajectory, peppered with stints in public service.\n\nAsked why she had chosen to go into public service earlier in her career, she said, “I remember thinking very clearly that I felt like I didn’t have enough of an idea of what really happened in criminal cases, I wanted to understand the system.”\n\n“I thought it would be an opportunity to help people as well, I come from a background of public service. My parents were in public service my brother was a police officer and in the military and being in the public defenders office felt very much like the opportunity to help with my skills and talents,” Jackson added.\n\nShe said the experience had made her a better judge because she remembered that many of her clients hadn’t really understood what had happened to them in the system. As a trial judge, Jackson said, she took extra care to communicate with the defendants who came before her. “I speak to them directly,” she said, because “I want them to know what is going on.”\n\nA.J. Kramer worked with Jackson at the Federal Public Defender’s office in DC and still keeps in touch with her. He said no current member of the Supreme Court has worked as a public defender and “seen the system from that side of the aisle”.\n\n“It’s not that you have more or less sympathy,” Kramer said in an interview, “but that you have an idea how the system actually works.”\n\nConfirmation hearing and discussion of race and being a judge\n\nAt her most recent Senate hearing, there were no real fireworks, but instead, an air of the inevitability of her confirmation. Republicans spent more time attacking the Biden administration or Democrats in general than targeting Jackson.\n\nTexas GOP Sen. John Cornyn did ask Jackson about professional diversity and race.\n\nHe said her experience as a trial judge would be a “very important qualification” and praised her “impressive” background. Cornyn added that it was important for the public to have confidence in the judiciary “and I think part of that confidence is knowing that people like them can serve on the bench and that we applaud that diversity.”\n\nBut Cornyn later said that “since our Democratic colleagues seem to be placing so much emphasis on race,” he wanted to know something else. “What role does race play, Judge Jackson, in the kind of judge you have been and the kind of judge you will be?”\n\nWithout skipping a beat, Jackson said, “I don’t think that race plays a role in the kind of judge that I have been and that I would be in the way you asked that question.”\n\n“I’m looking at the arguments, the facts and the law, I’m methodically and intentionally setting aside personal views, any other inappropriate considerations and I would think that race would be the kind of thing that would be inappropriate to inject in my evaluation of a case,” she continued.\n\n“I would say that my different professional background than many of the court of appeals judges, including my district court background,” she said, “would bring value.”\n\n“I’ve experienced life in perhaps a different way than some of my colleagues because of who I am and that might be valuable – I hope it would be valuable if I was confirmed to the circuit court, ” she added.\n\nTennessee GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn brought up early rumors about the Supreme Court.\n\n“I know you are fully aware that you are discussed regularly as a Supreme Court nominee”, Blackburn said before asking what the judge thought about recent proposals – driven by Democrats to try to dilute the conservative majority on the high court – to add more justices to the bench.\n\nJackson declined to comment.\n\nIn follow-up written questions, she was asked whether a number of Supreme Court cases, including those that concern abortion, religious liberty and the Second Amendment, were correctly decided. She said that as a federal judge all of the Supreme Court’s pronouncements would be binding and that it would be inappropriate to comment on the “merits or demerits” of particular cases. But she made exceptions, including for Brown v. Board of Education – the landmark 1954 opinion that struck down school segregation and the “separate but equal” doctrine. She said the ruling overturned the “manifest injustice” of Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\n“The underlying premise of the Brown decision – i.e. that ‘separate but equal is inherently unequal’ – is beyond dispute and judges can express their agreement with that principle without calling into question their ability to apply the law faithfully to cases raising similar issues,” Jackson said.\n\nShe was also pressed on the fact that as an assistant federal public defender she represented a detainee held at Guantanamo Bay, Khi Ali Gul. She said that as an attorney she had a duty to represent her clients zealously but also was mindful of the “tragic and deplorable circumstances” that gave rise to the U.S. government’s apprehension of persons secured at Gitmo. She noted that she was “keenly aware” of the threat the September 11, 2001, attacks posed on “foundational constitutional principles “and that her own brother at the time was enlisted as a U.S. Army infantryman deployed in Iraq.\n\nShe also provided senators a citation for an interview she gave in 2007 to The Washington Post for a story about Justice Clarence Thomas – the only African American currently on the high court.\n\nAccording to the article, she recalled sitting across from Thomas at lunch once – the date of the encounter was not revealed – with a quizzical expression on her face.\n\n“Jackson, who is black, said Thomas ‘spoke the language,’ meaning he reminded her of the black men she knew. ‘But I just sat there the whole time thinking: ‘I don’t understand you. You sound like my parents. You sound like the people I grew up with.’ But the lessons he tended to draw from the experiences of the segregated South seemed to be different than those of everybody I know,’” the article read.\n\nRepublicans who ended up voting to confirm her to the DC Circuit were Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nOpinions\n\nThrough her service on the DC district and appeals courts, Jackson has been involved in recent litigation involving former President Donald Trump and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nOn the appeals court, she voted against Trump when his lawyers sought to block records related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot from going to the House select committee investigating the attack. The Supreme Court later cleared the way for the records to be released. In August, she voted to allow Biden’s eviction moratorium – put in place during the pandemic – to remain in place. The Supreme Court later blocked it over the dissent of the court’s three liberals.\n\nWhile on the district court, Jackson penned more than 500 opinions.\n\nIn one notable case, she ruled against the Trump administration’s efforts to block then-White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying as part of Congress’ impeachment probe.\n\n“Presidents are not kings,” she said in the 2019 opinion, adding that the Trump administration’s assertion that it had “absolute testimonial immunity” protecting its senior level aides “is a proposition that cannot be squared with core constitutional values” and “cannot be sustained.”\n\nShe concluded that the “United States of America has a government of laws, not of men.”\n\nIn a separate case from 2018 brought by federal employee unions challenging executive orders issued by Trump, Jackson held that most but not all of the provisions in the orders conflicted with the collective bargaining rights of federal workers under federal law. Her judgment was vacated by the appeals court.\n\nIn Make the Road New York v. McAleenan, Jackson ruled against the Trump administration in a case brought by the ACLU and other immigrant rights groups that were challenging the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to expand the categories of non-citizens who could be subject to expedited removal procedures without being able to appear before a judge. The groups said the orders had sparked fear in immigrant communities around the county. The federal appeals court agreed that Jackson’s court had the power to rule over the case, but reversed her decision, holding that DHS had the discretion to act.\n\nShe also sentenced Edgar Maddison Welch to 48 months in prison in 2017 after he fired an assault rifle inside a Washington, DC, pizzeria. He claimed he was attempting to find and rescue child sex slaves that he believed were being held at the restaurant.\n\n“The extent of recklessness in this case is breathtaking. It is sheer luck that no one, including (Welch), was killed,” Jackson said, adding, “I’ve never seen anything like the conduct we see here today.”", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/16/retiring-year-old-mississippis-bad-dam-snowplow-strike-news-around-states/41008603/", "title": "Retiring 102-year-old, Mississippi's bad dam: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nCorrections & clarifications: A prior version of the Virginia item misstated the vote on updating the school dress code. The amendment failed 4-4.\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey is remaining uncommitted on whether the state will accept the resettlement of new refugees under a new Trump administration order that requires state consent, a spokeswoman says. Alabama is one of a handful of states that has not announced a decision after President Donald Trump said agencies must get written permission from state and local officials in jurisdictions where they want to resettle refugees beyond June 2020. “At this point, our office is still working through the executive order and consulting with the State Department and other entities involved in order to reach a decision,” Ivey Press Secretary Gina Maiola wrote in an email. Alabama has historically taken in few refugees. The state took in 46 refugees in fiscal year 2017, according to a report from the Pew Research Center.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Negotiations between the Anchorage School District and the federal government over earthquake damage relief could result in the district turning down tens of millions in funds, an official says. The negotiations over money to repair damage caused by the state’s November 2018 earthquake could take months or years, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The Federal Emergency Management Agency would require the district to carry earthquake insurance if it accepts federal reimbursement for specific repairs, District Chief Operating Officer Tom Roth says. Categories of disaster reimbursement have different sets of federal requirements, Roth says. Federal money is available for repairs and damage and debris cleanup in the immediate aftermath. For long-term repair work, FEMA requires the insurance coverage.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Teaching vacancies throughout the state have increased by more than 150 positions compared to last year, a report says. The Arizona School Personnel Administrators Association released the report last week saying a quarter of teaching positions in the state are vacant, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The report identified 1,846 vacancies out of the 209 school districts and charter schools that participated in the statewide survey. The survey found about 1,000 teachers statewide either abandoned or resigned from their teaching positions during the first half of the school year. The report found Pima County’s nine largest school districts, including Tucson Unified School District, began the school year with 19% fewer vacancies than last year, which district officials say is better but still not good. The report also found about half the teaching positions are filled by teachers who do not meet state certification requirements.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An attorney is suing local officials for denying him access to a courthouse while carrying a handgun, testing a state law meant to allow lawyers to possess firearms on court premises, according to the law’s authors. Chris Corbitt, a patent attorney from Conway, filed the complaint last Thursday against Pulaski County officials after a security guard refused to let him enter the county’s district courthouse Jan. 3 while he carried his concealed gun. Corbitt, a concealed-carry licensee with an enhanced permit, said he usually leaves his weapon in his car, but he forgot to do so before he walked into the courthouse this month. State law bans firearms from courthouses, except for bailiffs and other “officers of the court.” Corbitt argues that definition includes attorneys.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: Four homeless women who were ordered by a judge last week to leave a vacant house were evicted before dawn Tuesday by a group of heavily armed sheriff’s deputies in a case that highlighted the state’s severe housing shortage and growing numbers of homeless people. Alameda County Sheriff’s deputies escorted the women out of the home and bound their hands with plastic ties as dozens of community activists on the sidewalk chanted, “Let the moms go! Let the moms go!” and recorded the chaotic scene with their cellphones. “They came in like an Army for mothers and babies,” Dominique Walker, one of the mothers, told reporters. “We have the right to housing. This is just the beginning.” The women and their children moved into the three-bedroom house in November, partly to protest the methods of speculators who they say snap up distressed homes and leave them empty despite the housing crisis.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A park across from the Capitol where homeless people have been camping was being shut down Wednesday because officials say it has become infested with rats. More than 30 tents lined the edge of the park in the morning. Footage from KDVR-TV showed police officers going from tent to tent to let people know they need to leave and campers talking to other city officials looking to find out if they want to take advantage of social services. Hundreds of rats are currently living in Liberty Park and could spread diseases through their feces and human contact, among other ways, Tammy Vigil, a spokeswoman for the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment, told The Denver Post. “The reason the rats are so big is because of all the food that’s left there – all the food waste that’s not thrown away,” Vigil said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two University of Connecticut students arrested for shouting a racial slur outside a campus apartment complex sued the school Tuesday, citing free speech rights as they fight officials’ attempts to remove them from school housing. Jarred Karal, of Plainville, and Ryan Mucaj, of Granby, both 21, filed the lawsuit in federal court, seeing undisclosed damages and a halt to disciplinary proceedings against them. The two students say the school is violating their First Amendment rights by bringing disciplinary hearings that have included a recommendation to remove them from student housing for violating a “disruptive behavior” policy. Karal told police the group was playing a game in which they would yell an offensive word, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. The first person who refuses to say the word loses, he said. They decided to change the game to shouting the racial epithet, he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Hours before the General Assembly convened for its 2020 legislative session – and much to the surprise of lawmakers – State House staff announced plans to unionize. The organization, which calls itself the Delaware General Assembly Union, announced its intent to unionize in a tweet Tuesday morning, saying it “will be the first partisan-inclusive state legislative union in the country.” There are about 170 part-time and full-time staffers at Legislative Hall. According to the progressive nonprofit publication Prospect.org, which published an article on the news that was shared by the union’s Twitter account, the union group would include 44 of those staffers. A press release announcing the union called the effort a “historic step forward for public service workers across the country.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A photo of multiple D.C. Fire and EMS recruits apparently holding “white power” symbols is circulating across social media platforms, WUSA-TV reports. The gesture is similar to the “OK” hand sign but typically inverted. The three fingers extended are meant to represent a “W,” and the circle coming off the arm is a “P” – “WP” for “white power.” The photograph surfaced on Facebook and includes Recruit Class 387 and their instructors, D.C. Fire and EMS said. The agency said officials were made away of the picture Wednesday. The department said it believes the picture was taken in March 2019, and the recruit class graduated in April 2019. The department is now investigating the picture and is considering interviewing everyone pictured.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City Beach: Officials in this Panhandle beach town are hoping tourists want to do more than frolic in the surf and lay in the sun. They’re hoping tourists will help rebuild a neighboring beach town devastated by Hurricane Michael in 2018. Officials in Panama City Beach on Tuesday introduced a program that allows tourists during their visit to help build homes and plant sea oats in the sand dunes of neighboring Mexico Beach, which was demolished by the category 5 storm. The tourism promotion agency is offering a “Stay it Forward” package for tourists interested in helping out. Dan Rowe, CEO of Visit Panama City Beach, said tourists have been asking during their visits how they can help area residents. Compared to surrounding areas, Panama City Beach was comparatively unscathed by Hurricane Michael. “Mexico Beach has come a long way, but there is still work to do,” Rowe said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Two state lawmakers say they won’t support a bill this year that would create a new coastal city. State Sen. Ben Watson and state Rep. Jesse Petrea, both Savannah Republicans, made the announcement Tuesday regarding the proposed city of Chatham Islands. Residents of Wilmington, Whitmarsh, Talahi and Oatland islands have expressed opposition to incorporation, the lawmakers said. The movement to form what would be Chatham County’s second-largest city, with an estimated population of 26,000, began after another lawmaker sought to consolidate the Savannah city and Chatham County governments. That move sparked opposition among residents of the islands. However, city-county consolidation has stalled because of a lack of local support. A study by the University of Georgia found the islands could finance their own city government if a local option sales tax were imposed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State House and Senate leaders, with the support of Gov. David Ige, on Tuesday unveiled a long list of measures to boost housing, early childhood education and incomes, with a particular focus on alleviating the struggles of Hawaii’s working families and poor. It’s the first joint bill package from the two legislative chambers since 2004. “The House and Senate members have been working really hard over the interim to address an issue that is important to all of us – that is the cost of living in Hawaii,” House Speaker Scott Saiki said at a news conference. The proposals still need to be drafted into bills, pass committees and the full House and Senate, and then earn the governor’s signature before they can become law. The new legislative session began Wednesday. The measures include increasing the hourly minimum wage from the current $10.10 to $13 by 2024.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: New legislation introduced Tuesday would require voters who want to participate in a closed presidential primary to affiliate with that party 90 days before the primary. The House State Affairs Committee voted Tuesday to hold a hearing on the legislation. Republicans close their primaries in Idaho, while Democrats do not. Republicans are concerned some voters might affiliate with their party to throw a primary vote to a less popular candidate more likely to lose in the general election. Non-presidential, closed primaries in Idaho already have a 60-day party affiliation deadline. The deadlines are based on the last day candidates can file to run for political office. Idaho Secretary of State Lawerence Denney said the attorney general’s office in a Dec. 5 letter said it had determined closed presidential primaries in Idaho have no such deadline.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: State regulators say they are investigating apparent violations of a rule intended to prevent marijuana shops from stockpiling weed from a single cultivator while also reminding retailers that they are required by law to keep enough product on hand for medical patients. Just over a week after the state’s recreational pot sales kicked off Jan. 1, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation sent a letter to dispensaries Friday saying they were aware of violations and probing whether stores were illegally sourcing more than 40% of their product from one grower. The law is aimed at preventing pot growers from entering into exclusive agreements with specific shops and making sure all stores have a diversity of products from various sources.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A 102-year-old man who is Indiana’s oldest state employee is retiring after nearly six decades on the job, saying that “your body tells you when it’s time to go.” Bob Vollmer plans to report to work for the last time Feb. 6 as a surveyor for the Department of Natural Resources. The southern Indiana man, whose mother lived to be 108, joined the state agency in 1962. The World War II veteran still travels Indiana collecting technical field data and confirming boundary lines for DNR-managed properties, but he said his body finally is telling him it’s time to retire. Vollmer said he plans to spend his retirement devoting himself to reading and farming. He also plans to take trips to some of the South Pacific islands he was on during his wartime service with the U.S. Navy.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: A man sentenced last month to 16 years in prison after he burned a gay pride banner argued before his trial that the lawyer appointed to represent him had a conflict of interest because she is a lesbian, newly released court records show. Adolfo Martinez was arrested in June after he stole a pride banner hanging at Ames United Church of Christ and burned it outside a nearby club. Martinez admitted his actions were driven by his dislike of gay people. He unsuccessfully argued for dismissal of a charge against him of third-degree arson in violation of individual rights – hate crime, contending that his prosecution would violate his First Amendment right to free speech. In addition to the arson hate crime, he was found guilty in November of harassment and reckless use of fire or explosives.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state began issuing new personalized license plates Wednesday that emphasize the state’s growing use of renewable energy. The “Powering the Future” plates feature wind turbines profiled against a sunrise. Wind-generated power in Kansas grew sixfold from 2009 to 2018, and a report last year said the state was the nation’s top producer of wind energy, with more than 36% of total electricity coming from wind power. “I am pleased that this license plate design comes on the heels of Kansas being ranked first in the nation for percentage of electricity produced by wind,” Gov. Laura Kelly said. “At the same time, it is a display of an expanding industry that contributes so much to the economic fabric of our state.” Residents can order the plates through their county treasurer’s office for $45.50, plus normal registration fees and taxes.\n\nKentucky\n\nMammoth Cave: Mammoth Cave National Park is offering free tours Monday in honor of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The park can accommodate 70 people on each Mammoth Passage tour. The free tours Jan. 20 will depart from the visitor center at 9:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. CST. The 3/ 4 -mile, 1 1/ 4 -hour tour requires a walk down and up a steep path to the Historic Entrance and includes 160 steps. The tour explores a canyon passageway and discusses a 19th-century saltpeter mining operation and the cave’s geologic origins. Tour participants must pick up their free tickets in the visitor center before the tour.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing fees for using eight national wildlife refuges in southeast Louisiana and is also considering lottery alligator hunts on six of its refuges. The two together could raise about $120,000 for the Southeast Louisiana National Wildlife Refuges Complex, about two-thirds of the money from user permits, project leader Neil Lalonde said Monday. The user fees would be $20 for an annual permit or $5 for a one-day permit, a news release said. People age 60 and over could get a $5 annual pass, and those under age 18 would not need a permit. Two permits would be needed to get into all eight refuges administered by Southeast Louisiana National Wildlife Refuges Complex staff.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Proposed changes to a decades-old settlement between the state and American Indian tribal groups could give the tribes more authority in long-debated subjects such as gambling and fishing rights. A task force handed its recommendations to the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, which began considering them Tuesday. The recommendations include a call to affirm the tribes’ rights to regulate hunting, fishing and land use, the Portland Press Herald reports. Another recommendation is to enable tribes to operate casinos under a compact negotiated among tribal leaders, the federal government and the state. The task force spent more than six months putting together the recommendations, which would affect four federally recognized tribes in Maine. Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis said the changes have “potential for tremendous impacts on some highly disadvantaged people and some very proud governments.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan has announced the awarding of nearly $9 million in tax credits for state residents with student loan debt. The administration says 9,600 applicants were eligible for the Student Loan Debt Relief Tax Credit. That includes 6,331 who attended in-state institutions who will each get $1,000 in tax credits. There were 3,269 eligible applicants who attended out-of-state institutions who will receive $813 each in tax credits. “It is critical that we look for ways to help those in our state crippled by student loan debt,” Hogan said in a statement announcing the tax credits. “This program helps Maryland taxpayers pay off student debt, while remaining in the workforce and having a positive impact on the state economy.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A police officer was so infuriated after a confrontation with another driver on an area highway that he sent the man a fake $790 citation and a curt note that read, “Try fighting this… I dare you!” prosecutors say. Officer Christopher Curtis was released on personal recognizance after pleading not guilty Tuesday to forgery, witness intimidation and misleading an investigation. Neither he nor his attorney commented outside court. Curtis is on unpaid administrative leave, a Boston Police Department spokesman said. The other driver told investigators he was driving south on Interstate 93 north of the city March 1 when he saw a white pickup truck coming close to the back of his car. The driver, who was not identified in court records, said the pickup driver honked at him, sped toward his car, merged into the lane on his right and then veered back into the left lane, nearly forcing him into the median barrier, according to court records.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Six weeks into the recreational marijuana business in the state, sales have exceeded $10million. The high-water mark of $10,090,446 in sales also means that $1,675,014 in revenues from a 10% excise tax and 6% sales tax flowed into state coffers. Michigan marijuana enthusiasts were able to start buying legal weed Dec. 1, roughly 13 months after voters approved a ballot proposal that legalized marijuana use and possession for anyone who is at least 21. The proposal, which passed 56-44%, also allows for people to grow up to 12 plants in their home for personal use. Right now, the sales are happening at 16 marijuana retail shops that have gotten state licenses and have been able to open. There are 35 shops that have been licensed by the state, but many are waiting to open until they have enough marijuana products to meet the demand.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Union snowplow drivers went on strike in northeastern Minnesota, where a winter weather advisory was posted as snow moved into the region. Teamsters Local 320 official Brian Aldes said the strike in St. Louis County began Wednesday. Union members voted overwhelmingly Saturday to reject the county’s final contract offer, citing issues related to health care and accrued sick leave. “These hardworking employees make a daily commitment to drive into blizzard conditions when most folks avoid inclement weather,” Erik Skoog, the union’s chief negotiator, said in a Facebook post. “These employees spend nights, holidays, and weekends clearing roads in dangerous conditions and will not continue to be second class employees.” County officials have a contingency plan to keep roads plowed. Public works supervisors and staff in other departments are qualified and licensed to operate the snowplows, county spokeswoman Dana Kazel says.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: A rain-swollen lake in rural north Mississippi rose at least a foot overnight amid forecasts of additional downpours, keeping heavy pressure on a dam Wednesday that officials said was in danger of failing. An inspection of the earthen dam at Oktibbeha County on Tuesday led to warnings that it was in danger of failing and recommendations that area residents evacuate. With as much as 5 inches of rain forecast by the weekend, workers were monitoring a soggy landslide that stoked the fears. Oktibbeha County’s emergency director, Kristen Campanella, said the lake level’s rise endangered about 130 properties and nine highways downstream. Mississippi has one of the highest numbers of dams that pose dangers and are in poor or unsatisfactory condition, according to a two-year investigation by the Associated Press.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner has filed what she calls an unprecedented federal civil rights lawsuit, accusing the city, the local police union and others of a coordinated and racist conspiracy aimed at forcing her out of office. Gardner, the city’s elected prosecutor, also accused “entrenched interests” of intentionally impeding her efforts to reform racist practices that have led to a loss of trust in the criminal justice system. The lawsuit alleges civil rights violations as well as violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. Gardner is black. The named defendants are white. The lawsuit names the city of St. Louis;the St. Louis Police Officers Association; its business manager, Jeff Roorda; and Gerard Carmody, a special prosecutor who indicted an investigator hired by Gardner. It also names Carmody’s son and daughter, who helped in his investigation, and a former police officer who sued over Gardner’s use of private attorneys related to Carmody’s investigation.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State lawmakers and members of the public weighed in Tuesday on whether the Legislature should switch to annual 45-day sessions rather than meeting every other year for 90 days, as they do now. The 2019 Legislature passed a bill to study the idea of holding one session to address policy and another to set a two-year budget. Montana is one of four states without an annual legislative session. Some lawmakers suggested shorter sessions might allow young people to serve in the Legislature, saying that leaving a job for 45 days every year might be easier than missing 90 days of work every other year. State Sen. John Esp, R-Big Timber, said meeting more often might help build working relationships among the lawmakers, allowing them to better serve the people of Montana. Sen. Dee Brown, R-Hungry Horse, said she supports annual sessions but suggested limiting the number of bills that could be introduced each session.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state suffered more than $3.4 billion in losses from disastrous weather last year, according to a federal report. The bomb cyclone in March caused most of the damage, said the National Centers for Environmental Information, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The rain and snowmelt runoff led to record flooding in eastern Nebraska and in Iowa, and the storm system included a blizzard that struck most of western Nebraska. The bomb cyclone “was an unprecedented event, in scope and size and impact on the state of Nebraska,” Bryan Tuma, assistant director of the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, told the Omaha World-Herald. “I don’t think we’ve ever quite experienced anything like this before.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: MGM Resorts International is selling the real estate assets of the MGM Grand on the Las Vegas Strip to a joint venture for about $2.5 billion. The joint venture includes private-equity and real estate company Blackstone Group and MGM Growth Properties LLC. MGM Resorts anticipates cash proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion. The joint venture will be owned 50.1% by MGM Growth Properties and 49.9% by Blackstone. It will also acquire the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay from MGM Growth Properties and lease both properties to MGM Resorts for an initial rent of $292 million. The total value of the two transactions is $4.6 billion. The Mandalay Bay was the site of a 2017 shooting that left 58 people dead. It is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: An organization that welcomes troops passing through Portsmouth International Airport has announced plans to change its operations because of elevated threats at airports. The president of the Pease Greeters, Frank Lasorsa, wrote to members that because of “elevated threat levels,” greeters’ activities will change to address potential threats. Greeters will still greet troops but will no longer provide food, beverages and giveaways, and the only flight information made available to greeters will be through public websites. “Once a Greeter determines there is troop flight scheduled for arrival, Greeters may still arrive at the airport to support our brave men and women,” Lasorsa wrote. “Sharing any determined flight information on social media is strongly discouraged.” The Pease Greeters Care Package program will go on, but greeters will no longer bring any items to provide to individual service members.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Three police officers who have been credited with preventing further bloodshed during last month’s fatal attack on a kosher market are being promoted. Mayor Steven Fulop appointed officers Kendric Jackson, Mariela Fernandez and Raymond Sanchez to the rank of detective at a ceremony at City Hall on Wednesday. Sanchez and Fernandez were among the first to respond after David Anderson and Francine Graham stormed the market and killed three people in an anti-Semitic attack. Both officers suffered injuries and were treated and released from a hospital after the attacks. Anderson and Graham died after a lengthy shootout with police. Before attacking the market, they shot and killed Jersey City Police Detective Joseph Seals in what authorities have said was a chance encounter in a cemetery about a mile from the store.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest water utility has started operating its first aquifer storage well, and officials say more direct injection wells are planned within the utility’s service area through Albuquerque and Bernalillo County. Testing of the new system began this week. The well will allow excess surface water to be stored underground for later use, keeping it safe from any losses due to evaporation. Officials say the $1 million well is part of a larger water management strategy that also includes conservation and reuse. The well injects water more than 1,200 feet below the surface at a rate of 1,750 gallons per minute. The amount of water injected yearly will depend on the amount of excess surface water available from the San Juan-Chama Drinking Water Project.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The comptroller says the state once again is paying much more in federal taxes than it receives in federal spending. A report released Tuesday says New York paid $26.6 billion more in federal taxes in the fiscal year ending in 2018 than in got back in federal funds. New York has seen a gap dating back to 2013, when it totaled $19.9 billion. Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli says the balance jumped in 2018, when New Yorkers paid $4 billion more in taxes as federal spending increased by $1.5 billion. DiNapoli says the ongoing trend makes it critical that the upcoming 2020 census is accurate and maximizes the state’s population count. The comptroller’s report says New York is one of just seven states that sends more to the federal government than it receives.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A local advocacy group has started a petition to try to get Amazon to stop selling an animal trap that can injure bears. The group Help Asheville Bears is appealing directly to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and has gathered 32,000 signatures. The petition asks the company to stop selling steel-jaw, leg-hold traps. Certain foothold traps are legal in North Carolina. But they’re illegal to use on black bears. The traps are legal for animals such as foxes and coyotes. The group says the devices also catch small bears. Jody Williams, a spokesman for Help Asheville Bears, says Amazon has replied to the group about the petition. She says the company said it would forward the information to the appropriate people.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Bismarck Public Schools is believed to be the first district in the state to own an airplane. The school board has given administrators the go-ahead to buy a Cessna 150, single-engine plane for the student aviation program at the district’s Career Academy. District business manager Darin Scherr says the plane will cost between $15,000 and $30,000 depending on its condition, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Owning a plane rather than renting one will save money for the district, as well as for the families of students in the program. Using a rental plane costs families $10,850 a year and the district $6,650. Ownership will drop that by nearly half, to $5,350 a year for families and $2,963 for the district, according to Scherr. That includes yearly costs, such as insurance and hangar rental, as well as costs for engine and propeller overhauls, which occur every four years.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A union representing the white Cleveland police officer who shot and killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black child playing with a pellet gun outside a recreation center, will ask an appeals court to overturn the officer’s firing. A Cuyahoga County judge last month upheld an arbitrator’s decision that Timothy Loehmann should be fired for failing to disclose on his Cleveland job application that he had been previously dismissed from a suburban police department. Loehmann and his training officer were cleared of criminal wrongdoing in the death of Tamir in November 2014. The child was shot by Loehmann within seconds of a cruiser driven by Patrolman Frank Garmback skidding to a stop near him. “We think our appeal has merit and look forward to having a review by the Court of Appeals,” union attorney Henry Hilow told cleveland.com.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The governor wants the state’s school superintendent to be appointed rather than elected, which would give the governor more power over public education. Gov. Kevin Stitt did not specify if he wanted to appoint the position or wanted the state Board of Education to make the decision. Stitt already appoints six of the seven board members. Stitt said he’s frustrated by his limited ability to affect education policy. “When the governor’s elected by all 4 million Oklahomans, the people think that he or she’s supposed to be able to go in and make some different moves on education to get outcomes,” Stitt said. “That’s just common sense. That’s what I thought when I was sitting in Tulsa in the business world. That’s what people in Oklahoma think.” Of nearly 4 million Oklahomans, 644,579 voted for Stitt to become governor.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Widespread snowstorms have boosted the Pacific Northwest’s previously anemic snowpack to almost normal levels statewide in just two weeks. The biggest improvements in what is called “snow-water equivalent” – the amount of water contained in the snowpack – are in the Hood, Sandy and Lower Deschutes basins. Those areas were at 26% of normal Dec. 30 and are now at 90% of normal, the Capital Press reports. Last year saw something similar unfold in Oregon, when a series of storms hit in February that boosted what had been a lagging level of snow-water equivalent. This year statewide, the snow-water equivalent increased from 45% of normal to 79% of normal between Dec. 30 and Jan. 14, according to the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, which tracks the measurements. Snowpack is a crucial source of water for farms, especially in Eastern Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state House voted Tuesday to force public agencies to post agendas on their websites at least a day before the meetings at which related votes are held. State representatives unanimously approved the proposed amendments to the state Sunshine Act. The prime sponsor, Rep. Aaron Bernstine, R-Lawrence, said the bill will help ensure governments do not operate in the shadows. “When our citizens know what will be discussed at a meeting ahead of time, they can better participate in a government in a meaningful way,” Bernstine said. Officials would not be allowed to vote on anything that was not on the posted agenda, except when an emergency has arisen that threatens life or property or when the issue at hand is considered extremely minor and does not involve spending money. Items could also be added to agendas during meetings by a majority vote.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The governor has set an aggressive timeline to power the electric grid completely by renewable energy, but it’s an attainable goal, the state’s acting energy commissioner said Wednesday. Acting Commissioner Nicholas Ucci said his office will spend the rest of this year developing strategies and policies to meet the goal by 2030 and analyzing the economic, environmental and energy system impacts. In her State of the State address to lawmakers Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo announced she will sign an executive order that aims to make the state the first in the nation to be powered completely by renewable energy by the end of the decade. The remark drew a standing ovation. The state is already positioned to meet more than a third of its electricity demand with renewable energy sources by 2024, Ucci said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Supporters of a bill that would ban almost all abortions want some leaders in the state Senate to know they won’t let the proposal quietly die. Hundreds of them packed a Statehouse lobby Wednesday to call for a vote on the bill whose only likely obstacle to becoming law is passing a two-thirds procedural vote in the Senate. There are enough Democrats and Republicans from less conservative districts to keep blocking the bill. Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey has said several times before the 2020 legislative session started this week that Republicans don’t have the votes and that he sees no need to halt debate on other issues like tax reform, education or selling state-owned utility Santee Cooper for several days for a filibuster that according to his vote-counting math can’t be beat. That’s what happened in 2018 to a similar abortion ban bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council has passed an ordinance denouncing acts of hate and racism after equal rights organizations and others called on the city to do more to respond to racist incidents. Mayor Paul TenHaken brought what he called an “anti-hate” resolution to the council in order to send a message that Sioux Falls is a welcoming place for all religions, races and sexual orientations. Councilors took their turns Tuesday night voicing support. Councilor Janet Brekke said the resolution is a positive step toward driving hate out of the community but noted that it is just a starting point. In September, South Dakota Voices for Peace organized a march in the city after a black teen was subjected to racial slurs in downtown Sioux Falls. Video of what happened was posted on social media and viewed widely.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Amtrak is in discussions to bring passenger rail service back to the capital and expand routes in Memphis. Company representatives traveled to Nashville to discuss their ideas with state legislators Tuesday afternoon. Two of the proposed lines would connect Memphis to Chicago and Nashville to Atlanta with stops in Murfreesboro, Tullahoma and Chattanooga. The only Amtrak stops in Tennessee are in Memphis and Newbern-Dyersburg. Nashville service halted in 1979 when the Floridian line from Chicago to Florida was shut down to save money. But Music City’s fast-growing population has caught Amtrak’s eye again.\n\nTexas\n\nBellaire: A minor has been charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old high school student, prosecutors said. The minor and another person were arrested about 31/ 2 hours after the Tuesday afternoon shooting at a high school in Bellaire, a suburb southwest of Houston. A spokesman for the Harris County District Attorney’s Office said Wednesday that the minor could not be identified because of privacy laws and did not immediately answer other questions. Authorities also haven’t released basic non-identifying information about the alleged shooter, including the person’s age or sex. Police said they received a call about the shooting about 4 p.m., and the victim died later at a hospital. There have been conflicting media reports about whether the shooting happened inside or outside the school.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Personalized license plates that spark multiple complaints will get extra scrutiny amid questions about how a plate emblazoned with the phrase “DEPORTM” could be on the road despite strict state rules and previous objections. If more than one person reports a particular plate, it will now be flagged for extra attention and reviewed by the attorney general’s office, said Scott Smith, who oversees the motor-vehicles division as executive director of the Utah Tax Commission. “The safety net here is the general public,” Smith told lawmakers at a hearing Wednesday that came after a photo of the “deport” plate gained widespread attention online. Among other rules, Utah prohibits vanity plates that express contempt for any race, religion or political opinion. License plates don’t carry unlimited freedom of speech rights, he said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Advocates held a homelessness awareness day and memorial vigil Wednesday. Concerned citizens and homeless service providers planned to gather at the Statehouse to talk with lawmakers and “renew their commitment to end homelessness” in Vermont. According to a one-day count, 1,089 Vermonters were found to be homeless on a single night in January 2019, event organizers said. That was a 15% drop from a one-day count in 2018, but “homelessness is still a major challenge for Vermonters, especially because 23% of those counted were children,” organizers of the event said. A vigil was planned at noon on the Statehouse steps, where legislative leaders and Lt. Gov, David Zuckerman, who just announced that he’s running for governor, were expected to speak. Wednesday’s activities were sponsored by the Vermont Coalition to End Homelessness, Chittenden County Homeless Alliance and Vermont Affordable Housing Coalition.\n\nVirginia\n\nRocky Mount: A county school board has decided not to update its dress code to ban displays of the Confederate flag. The Roanoke Times reports the decision followed months of debate in Franklin County, which is outside Roanoke in western Virginia. Many school board members said such a ban could violate students’ rights to free speech and spur legal challenges. An amendment adding the ban to the dress code failed 4-4, and the vote on passing the dress code without it was 7 to 1. Penny Blue, the board’s only black member, was the sole “no” vote. She had proposed the measure last fall when the board was considering changes to its dress code. She argued the flag was a symbol of white supremacy. Other members said they personally detested the flag but raised concerns about free speech. School officials cited a 2000 court case in Kentucky that could have legal precedent in Virginia. The Kentucky school’s attempt to ban the flag failed.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: One year after Microsoft announced it was committing $500 million toward affordable housing in the area, it’s upping that by half. The additional $250 million will provide a line of credit to help the Washington State Finance Commission finance about 3,000 additional units of affordable housing, Jane Broom, the company’s senior director of philanthropies, said in a blog post Wednesday. Microsoft’s own success has helped the region boom economically, with Amazon and other tech companies expanding. But as it has, the cost of housing has skyrocketed. Homelessness is a severe concern, and even people with good middle-income jobs, such as teachers and nurses, have been priced out of the cities where they work.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The House of Delegates on Wednesday approved a bill that would penalize physicians who don’t provide medical care to a baby born after an abortion attempt. Lawmakers passed the bill 93-5 despite questions about what use it would serve, since existing laws protect newborns, and the state bans abortions after 20 weeks. “This bill does absolutely nothing,” said Del. John Doyle, a Democrat from Jefferson County. “It proposes to make something illegal that is already illegal.” Some Republicans in the GOP-controlled chamber conceded that the bill, which would subject medical professionals to discipline from their licensing board, is more about sending a political message than solving an ongoing problem.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau: City officials voted Tuesday night to change the language of the now-famed “snowball ordinance,” making it legal to throw snowballs on city property once again. It will likely take effect by the week’s end, City Council President Lisa Rasmussen said. A city ordinance that technically banned snowball fights was a small part of a larger ordinance banning people from throwing objects such as stones and arrows on city-owned property. It was originally believed to have been adopted in 1962. However, City Attorney Anne Jacobson did some more digging and said it’s been on the books since at least 1884 that you can’t throw snowballs on public property, even with slightly different language. The City Council decided to reconsider the law after some negative national headlines this past holiday season. Barstool Sports called Wausau “the worst town in America” for outlawing snowball fights.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has requested $12 million from the state to fund more than half of a renovation and expansion project for its College of Law. The law school project did not make it into the university’s formal request vetted by the State Construction Department and Republican Gov. Mark Gordon’s office last year before going to the Legislature in December, Laramie Boomerang reports. “We were designing the facility and didn’t know the cost of the facility over the summer,” Dean Klint Alexander told the Joint Appropriations Committee on Friday. The project is designed to add about 19,000 square feet and upgrade about 23,000 square feet of existing space in order to fit multiple clinics into the building, officials said. The school’s current clinics provide $3.5 million of free legal services each year, and that could increase with better facilities, Alexander said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/01/tren-de-aragua-venezuelan-gang-colorado-texas-new-york/75967948007/", "title": "Scooter robberies and Michael Jordan tattoos. Has this Venezuelan ...", "text": "EL PASO, Texas – Hector Gonzalez dreams of someday becoming a barber in New York City.\n\nThe 23-year-old Venezuelan favors black baseball caps, worn backward, and tattoos on his left forearm.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, those traits – his age, the backward cap, the tattoos – made him a target of several passing El Paso Police officers, who ordered Gonzalez and several other young Venezuelan migrants to stand and face a wall on a downtown street corner in this border city. The police, some wearing balaclavas over their faces, checked the men’s pockets and backpacks, made them lift their shirts and explain their tattoos, some which depicted a rose, dice or barbed wire.\n\nThe officers said they were searching for a suspect in a stabbing, but they were also on the lookout for members of Tren de Aragua – A dangerous Venezuelan street gang some of whose members have slipped into the United States amid thousands of other migrants in recent years. The gang has become a flashpoint in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump thrust the group and the Biden-Harris administration’s border policies into the spotlight in September when he falsely claimed during a presidential debate that members of the Venezuelan street gang Tren de Aragua had “taken over” U.S. cities, such as Aurora, Colorado.\n\nThe specter of Tren de Aragua, known to law enforcement by the shorthand “TdA,” has been repeatedly amplified across conservative talk shows and rallies, with politicos and pundits characterizing them as murderous thugs rampaging through U.S. cities. But law enforcement officials across the country describe a much different group – one trying to establish a foothold in the U.S., whose ranks are thin and whose activities pale in comparison to the violence and criminality of more established criminal organizations. Tren de Aragua is best known for petty crimes, such as retail theft, and for targeting other Venezuelan migrants.\n\nUSA TODAY spoke with local and state law enforcement in Texas, Colorado and New York as well as federal officials and found that – despite claims of “thousands” of TdA gang members – authorities have arrested fewer than 135 confirmed gang members, according to interviews and police reports.\n\nFederal authorities say that, in June, they began re-screening Venezuelan migrants who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. The reassessments turned up some 600 people with suspected ties to Tren de Aragua – a group that included victims, friends, witnesses to crimes and others. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested fewer than 30 with gang connections – two on criminal charges and the rest on immigration infractions, according to DHS. The agency has referred another 100 people to an FBI “watch list\" for further review.\n\nSeparately, according to DHS, U.S. Border Patrol apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border 27 people in fiscal 2024 and 41 people in fiscal 2023 with Tren de Aragua gang affiliation.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMore:Trump's deportation plan: A cost to taxpayers, billions for big business\n\nMore than 760,000 Venezuelans have arrived at the Southwest border seeking asylum from political repression and runaway violence in their homeland since 2021, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics.\n\nTren de Aragua is still trying to find their identity, said Jason Savino, an assistant chief in the New York Police Department's detective bureau.\n\n“They’re scattered,” he said. “They haven’t formulated. And every time they do, we’ve locked them up.”\n\nOn the El Paso street corner, police questioned Gonzalez briefly then let him go.\n\nHe watched as the officers cuffed two of the other Venezuelan men, before the police car disappeared into the distance.\n\n“You can’t relax,” Gonzalez said. “Just because you have tattoos they want to discriminate against you. They want to say you’re a criminal.”\n\nElon Musk amplifies claims of Venezuelan gangs on X\n\nIn August, tech mogul Elon Musk reposted a video on his social media site, X, to his 202 million followers, with a one-word comment: “Insane.”\n\nSix men, some wearing hoodies, others carrying pistols and another carrying what appeared to be an assault rifle, walked up the stairs of an apartment building. The original post claimed the men were Tren de Aragua gang members who had taken over the building in Aurora, a suburb of Denver.\n\nTren de Aragua grew out of the prison system in the central state of Aragua in Venezuela and became one of the most violent groups in that country, focusing on extortion, smuggling and drug trafficking, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. In July, the department sanctioned the group, labeling it a “significant transnational criminal organization.”\n\nAccording to Transparencia Venezuela, the local arm of watchdog group Transparency International, the organization boasts 4,000 members across seven countries in Central and South America. Law enforcement officials around the country have warned they’ve arrested members of Tren de Aragua in connection with crimes including brazen retail thefts, moped muggings in New York City and a jewelry heist in Denver.\n\nMore:New presidential election polls released in Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina: See results\n\nCompared to other gangs tied to migrant waves, Tren de Aragua is small. For instance, Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13, which originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s and spread through Central America, has 50,000 to 70,000 members internationally. MS-13’s highest ranking leaders have been charged with terrorism offenses in the U.S.\n\n“Nationally, you’re not looking at a gang that is on par with Mara Salvatrucha or Mexican Mafia,” said Peter Hermansen, a retired former director of Border Patrol’s Special Operations Group. “You are seeing them take on opportunistic crime, where they are trying to take over apartment complexes, collect money, creating issues in these communities.”\n\nLess than a month after the video emerged, the scene at the Edge at Lowry apartment complex in Aurora was serene. Three-story red brick buildings stand like sentries and slides and swings adorned the front yards of nearby homes. South of the complex, children played soccer on school fields while others swung on monkey bars.\n\nAurora police have arrested one man and have warrants outstanding for the other five for their role in the incident shown in the viral video. They face felony charges of first-degree burglary and menacing with a firearm. None of the men have been linked to Tren de Aragua yet, police said.\n\nOthers have. Aurora Police Chief Todd Chamberlain told USA TODAY officers have identified 10 people believed to be affiliated with Tren de Aragua, nine of which have been arrested.\n\nConfirming gang affiliation is a challenge – both for Border Patrol and local and state law enforcement – given that the U.S. suspended its diplomatic relationship with Venezuela in 2019 and the two countries don’t share information.\n\nChamberlain said the city is working with Homeland Security officials and other federal agencies to target suspected members but downplayed allegations that his city is overrun by the Tren de Aragua.\n\n“The city is not taken over by gangs,” Chamberlain said. “Like any other metropolitan area, there are gangs that are in Aurora that were here before the Venezuelans were here, and it's something that we are addressing and dealing with.”\n\nScooter robberies and Michael Jordan tattoos\n\nIn New York, detectives have recorded an alarming rise in retail thefts and “scooter robberies” – where assailants on speeding mopeds snatch cellphones and purses from unsuspecting pedestrians – that they attribute to Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe gang members began arriving two years ago, around the same time scores of Venezuelan migrants from the Texas-Mexico border aboard charter buses ordered by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, said Savino, the detective bureau’s assistant chief.\n\nThe rise in petty thefts and armed robberies in New York was so alarming that the police department deployed detectives to Colombia, which neighbors Venezuela, to learn more about the gang’s tactics, Savino said.\n\n“We have to know our enemy,” he said.\n\nThough a concerning trend, Savino said Tren de Aragua has been unable to organize enough to pose a true threat, especially compared to other gangs operating in New York. He said the group has been pinned to less than five violent crimes the past two years.\n\n“They are driving retail theft and scooter crime,” he said. “However, when it comes to violence, they pale in comparison.”\n\nIn Texas, the state Department of Public Safety has compiled a database to track suspected gang members, often identified by their tattoos or other markers, said Lt. Chris Olivarez, an agency spokesman.\n\nThis is different from the state’s Texas Gang Intelligence Database known as TxGANG, which follows similar criteria to the FBI’s gang unit.\n\nEarlier this year, Border Patrol hosted a security briefing for El Paso-area shelter directors, where intel specialists warned about Tren de Aragua’s reach in the U.S., said Michael DeBruhl, director of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church migrant shelter in El Paso and a veteran former Border Patrol agent.\n\nThe agents shared how to identify gang members – including spotting tattoos of locomotive trains or a five-point crown. Some TdA members have tattoos of Michael Jordan or the NBA legend’s #23 jersey number, supposedly for the 23 de Enero neighborhood, one of Caracas’ most dangerous slums.\n\nOlivarez said he couldn’t confirm how many Tren de Aragua members are listed in the Texas database or whether any gang members traveled from Texas to New York, Chicago or Denver amid thousands of other Venezuelan migrants aboard charter buses.\n\nAbbott’s Operation Lone Star has bused more than 119,000 migrants to cities across the country since 2022, including more than 19,000 to Denver and nearly 50,000 to New York City.\n\nMore:Harris returns to her roots and childhood haunts to make her final pitch\n\nTexas Governor: El Paso ‘ground zero’ for Venezuelan gang\n\nAs reports of Tren de Aragua activity surfaced across the country, national attention homed in on El Paso – the border city through which many law enforcement and local officials believe the group entered the U.S.\n\nIn early September, El Paso County Attorney Christina Sanchez filed a lawsuit against the owners of the Gateway Hotel in central El Paso to try to shut it down, claiming a litany of public safety concerns and other issues. The lawsuit alleged the hotel, used by low-income residents and migrants, had also drawn members of Tren de Aragua.\n\nA week later, Abbott declared the gang a “foreign terrorist organization” and ordered state law enforcement to pursue its members. At a press conference announcing the move, Abbott and Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw called El Paso “ground zero” and “infested” with criminal activity.\n\n“All you have to do is spend time with some migrant victims that are here in this country,” McCraw said. “You’ll understand the governor has not overstated the issue.”\n\nEl Paso city and county officials pushed back.\n\nSanchez also clarified her initial lawsuit: “I want to be clear that at no time did we allege in our lawsuit that the hotel was taken over by any gang or group of individuals,” she said in a statement.\n\nVanessa Tena, a spokeswoman for the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office, which runs the jail, said sheriff’s deputies hadn’t arrested anyone they believe is affiliated with the gang. She said the gang may have used El Paso to enter the U.S. but had likely moved on to other cities.\n\n“We believe that very few have stayed in El Paso, however they are very strategic in that they are not freely identifying themselves as members,” she said in a statement.”\n\nNo gang presence at migrant shelters\n\nOn a recent afternoon at the now-shuttered Sacred Heart shelter in central El Paso five blocks from the border, about 20 migrant families sat at tables inside a cavernous former basketball gym, filling out work permit forms or scrolling through phones to connect with relatives in other cities.\n\nThe scant scene was a far cry from earlier this year, when hundreds of migrants crowded every inch of the gym, said DeBruhl, the shelter’s director. Tougher enforcement by Mexico and Panama, and Biden’s order restricting access to asylum, had pushed the numbers down.\n\nFrom December 2022 to October 2024, Sacred Heart sheltered or aided more than 30,000 migrants, the vast majority of them from Venezuela, said DeBruhl, of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church. He never detected a Tren de Aragua member among them – nor have any of the migrants he serviced ever complained of being targeted by the group.\n\n“We have not had any evidence whatsoever of Tren de Aragua members in our shelter,” DeBruhl said.\n\nMembers of Tren de Aragua couldn’t easily muscle their way into cities like El Paso or Chicago that already have entrenched gangs with lucrative criminal operations, said Mike Tapia, associate professor of criminal justice at Texas A&M University-Commerce and author of “Gangs of the El Paso-Juarez Borderland: A History.\"\n\nGangs in El Paso, such as Barrio Azteca, for example, work closely with Mexican cartels across the river in Ciudad Juárez for smuggling people and drugs, he said. The sudden appearance of a Venezuelan gang trying to carve into that action would spark a bloody turf war, which hasn’t happened, Tapia said.\n\nTapia called Abbott’s warnings of the gang’s spread in Texas “hyperbolic.”\n\n“There’s just not enough of that pie to go around,” he said.\n\nDeBruhl added: “We just have to ensure – as the migrant support community or the law enforcement community or the local government – that we’re dealing with facts and not with innuendo and rumors. That’s what’s really important.”\n\n‘We’re not all the same’\n\nAcross the street from his shelter, where Hector Gonzalez got questioned, the police unit was gone and a handful of young Venezuelans stood under the shade of a skinny tree, swapping stories about their journey to the U.S.\n\nEmerson Linares, who was one of the men handcuffed by El Paso Police, driven off in a police cruiser and later released, said he realized his tattoos – including one on his face and several crawling up both arms – made him a target.\n\nAn evil-looking nun smoking a cigarette on one arm and a stoned chicken carrying a surfboard on the other were “dumb, impulsive things I did,” said the 23-year-old former graphic designer. “They don’t mean anything.”\n\nNext to him, Gonzalez said he left Venezuela in 2019 after the street violence became overwhelming. He lived in Colombia for a few years then crossed the U.S.-Mexico border five months ago and turned himself in to Border Patrol agents.\n\nHe was screened, released and given a court date in 2028.\n\nGonzalez said he’s saving up to make his way to New York. Clippers, a razor and a chair are all he needs to get going as a barber again, as he did in Venezuela.\n\nFor now, he was mired in this border town, relying on instincts to see him through. His guiding principle was summed up on a tattoo stretching across his left forearm.\n\nIn cursive writing, it said simply: \"LOVE.\"\n\nRick Jervis and Lauren Villagran reported from El Paso, Texas.

Middle school and high school students are eligible for the camp run by the university’s Office of Archaeological Research in July. The camp offers experience dusting for fingerprints, examining blood spatter and other forensic science techniques. OAR Cultural Resources Analyst Lindsey Gordon tells the Tuscaloosa News the camp is ideal for students interested in forensic science, anthropology, sociology, human biology and criminal justice. The camp will have two sessions, July 8-12 for middle school students and July 22-26 for high school students. Each session costs $275. Students must register before June 30.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: State officials are reconsidering whether special events like outdoor concerts are a responsible use of state park land. The Anchorage Daily News reports a concert in Chugach State Park was canceled following complaints about potential negative environmental impacts. The manager for folk band Blackwater Railroad Company says the proposed concert at Williwaw Lakes was intended to provide an intimate, outdoor experience encouraging conservation. He says the band expected attendance would be no more than 200 people due to the 12- to 16-mile round-trip hike to the event. More than a thousand people registered interest on social media. A park official says some outdoor enthusiasts feared the concert would damage the environment and backcountry experience at the site southeast of Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nFlorence: An outbreak of mumps among immigrants detained in federal facilities in Pinal County is fueling a statewide spike in cases. Mumps in Arizona this year has reached 42 confirmed cases – a 10-year annual high number less than halfway into 2019, state data shows. Mumps is a contagious viral disease that in most infected people will cause swelling of the salivary glands, causing puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw. The Arizona numbers likely will go up because the most recent data from the Pinal County Public Health Department indicates a higher case count than the state data reflects. As of Monday, nearly 300 immigration detainees at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Pinal County were under quarantine after being exposed to mumps, ICE officials said.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: A dapper-dressed statue of gangster Al Capone has been repaired, repainted and returned to a bar after a failed attempt to steal the welcoming figure. The Sentinel-Record reports the redone statue was returned Saturday to a seat near a bench outside The Ohio Club in Hot Springs. Its website describes the business as the oldest bar in Arkansas, established in 1905, and Capone was a known visitor. Investigators say two men in March tried to snatch the statue but dropped and broke it. Both were charged with public intoxication and criminal mischief. Club owner Mike Pettey says repairs cost $3,500. Part of Capone’s white suit has been painted black. About $2,500 generated through T-shirt sales, celebrating Capone’s return, will be donated to the Garland County Historical Society.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Alamitos: The California National Guard has announced the appointment of the first woman to lead a U.S. Army infantry division. Brig. Gen. Laura Yeager will take command of the 40th Infantry Division on June 29 at Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos. Yeager currently commands Joint Task Force North, U.S. Northern Command at Fort Bliss, Texas. Yeager was commissioned in 1986 as a second lieutenant from the Reserve Officer Training Corps at California State University, Long Beach. She served as UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot, left active duty when her son was born and continued her military career in the California Army National Guard. Yeager deployed to Iraq in 2011 as deputy commander of the Cal Guard’s 40th Combat Aviation Brigade, then served as a battalion and brigade commander.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A long-running effort by the city to reduce train horn noise downtown is switching tracks. Officials have hired a lobbying firm to help find a federal legislative path for establishing a “quiet zone” along a section of the BNSF track near the Colorado State University campus. Trains rolling through a designated quiet zone don’t have to sound their horns before crossing intersections as required by Federal Railroad Administration regulations. The city’s move shows how frustrated officials are with trying to get the FRA to do what they want: waive a quiet zone rule that requires gates, lights and bells at every intersection a train crosses within a zone. City officials have argued there is not enough room for gates in all directions at every intersection.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection commissioner will soon be soliciting bids to develop 30% of the state’s entire energy load from offshore wind sources. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation into law that gives the commissioner 14 days to begin the request for proposals process. Lamont says it will mark the largest authorization by load – up to 2,000 megawatts – by any state in the region. Democratic and Republican proponents say they hope Connecticut will become a central hub for the offshore wind industry in New England. Lamont predicts the emerging industry can lead to hundreds of jobs and drive economic growth along the shoreline.\n\nDelaware\n\nLittle Creek: Environmental officials say the state’s once-dwindling horseshoe crab population could be recovering. Data from a federal commission that studies horseshoe crabs along the East Coast shows stability in numbers and even an increase in some regions, now that some states have regulated their harvests. The paper says the crab population suffered for decades from overfishing. It’s used for fertilizer, livestock food, bait and also medicine. The crab has unique properties in its blood that make it coveted for some medical products. Some scientists say an alternative to the crab’s blood could do more to boost the population. A synthetic alternative to crab blood has existed for 15 years but has yet to be widely accepted.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district’s financial leader says he won’t certify the city’s proposed $15.5 billion budget, saying it improperly diverts money that should go toward repaying city debts for a 2003 convention center. The Washington Post reports Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S. DeWitt notified the City Council of his decision Monday. He previously warned of the rejection. The council moved ahead with it anyway. District law says DeWitt must certify the budget before it can be sent to the mayor or Congress for approval. DeWitt’s denial comes at a time when upcoming spending usually is finalized. The Post says this could lead to the loss of tens of millions of dollars meant for urgent public housing repairs. Chairman Phil Mendelson sought to fund the repairs by diverting money from other reserves.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City: It’s been eight months since Hurricane Michael ripped through the state’s Panhandle, but an effort to help victims is continuing. The News Herald reports local organizations have taken over for FEMA at the Community Recovery Center, offering medical and dental help and guiding victims of the October storm to the appropriate resources. A mobile medical truck is expected to stop at the center every Monday afternoon through the summer. Nurse practitioner Denise Miller says the offer a sliding scale base for people who don’t have insurance. Jo Shaffer, a site administrator for Doorways of Northwest Florida, says the group is in charge of data management at the center. If workers see someone needs something, they find a way to help. She says they connect with agencies like Catholic Charities.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A fundraising bash honoring the 90th birthday of philanthropist Bernie Marcus, one of Home Depot’s founders, has raised more than $117 million for Georgia charities. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Sunday’s star-studded gathering at the Atlanta Aquarium, which Marcus built, quickly raised $102 million in pledges. Arthur Blank, another founder of Home Depot and an owner of the Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United of the MLS, contributed an additional $15 million. The event drew hundreds, including Gov. Brian Kemp and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. The paper says the funds will support charities including the Grady Health System’s Marcus Stroke & Neuroscience Center and the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta. Home Depot is Georgia’s largest public company based on revenue, according to the newspaper.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state budget passed by the Legislature includes funding for repairs at Waikiki Beach, officials say. Lawmakers approved about $13 million for improvements to the crumbling Royal Hawaiian seawall and other man-made structures at the state’s most visited beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “This is the largest appropriation for beach improvements on Oahu in recent memory. It allows us to move forward on several projects that have been discussed on and off for decades,” says Dolan Eversole of the University of Hawaii. The $13 million is sufficient to shore up the Royal Hawaiian seawall between the Waikiki Sheraton and Royal Hawaiian hotels and return a seawall to Kuhio Beach – structures officials say have been failing for years. Waikiki’s overhaul is scheduled to start by early fall.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A Treasure Valley woman is offering a healing practice called forest bathing to teach people how to stop and smell the roses – and maybe taste them, too. Forest bathing aims to ground people in nature using each of their senses. Sari Telpner is the only Association of Nature and Forest Therapy-certified guide in the Boise area. She began leading immersive nature experiences in the Idaho Botanical Garden this spring. There, she helps participants connect to the roses, irises, fir trees and, most importantly, themselves. “My practice is being in nature in a really intentional way,” Telpner told the Idaho Statesman. Sometimes that means feeling the grass beneath your feet or walking at “a pace that’s so slow it’s almost painful” while inspecting the scents, sights and sounds of the garden. Each session ends with a tea ceremony, brewed from plants like lilac and catmint Telpner gathers on-site.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A federal judge in the city says he’ll dismiss a lawsuit brought by a parks advocacy group that is trying to stop former President Barack Obama’s presidential center from being built in a lakefront park. U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey said there should be no delay in building the $500 million center after hearing arguments in court Tuesday. Protect Our Parks argued the city illegally transferred land for a park to The Obama Foundation, a private entity overseeing construction of the center. City lawyers accuse the parks group of exaggerating potential environmental problems, misreading the law and misrepresenting how the approval works. The center was supposed to open in 2021, but the lawsuit and a federal review have delayed construction at Jackson Park. An attorney for the parks organization says it plans to appeal.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A new school is two years from opening and still needs a leader, a charter and even a location. Yet families are already lining up to get their kids enrolled, says its founder, Jenn Watts. The reason for the fuss? Watts is planning the area’s first all-girls STEM school, in partnership with the Girl Scouts of Central Indiana. The yet-to-be-named school is slated to open in the fall of 2021, eventually serving girls in kindergarten through eighth grade. The idea, Watts says, is to get girls into STEM before they start hearing the message that science, technology, engineering and math aren’t for them. She’s familiar with how early that messaging starts and how it creates a gap that only widens as girls turn into women and enter the workforce, where STEM jobs continue to be dominated by men. The STEM school will be a first for the Girl Scouts of Central Indiana.\n\nIowa\n\nNewton: A prison program aims to alleviate a lack of affordable housing while teaching inmates construction skills they can use when they’re released. Newton Correction Facility inmates enrolled in the Iowa Prison Industries program are currently building an office and a classroom. But they will eventually build entire homes that can be moved to rural communities to address the decline in affordable housing. Inmates can also pursue apprenticeships for jobs in demand in the state. The acting warden of the low-and-medium security prison describes the program as a “win-win.” Those who qualify for affordable housing purchase can buy homes for about $125,000. The inmates gain marketable skills for when they leave prison. Families earning below $73,100 annually would qualify to purchase a home.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Local high school students are offering to digitally restore print photographs damaged when a tornado tore through Douglas County. The large storm last month damaged trees, struck power lines and left a trail of debris on the southeastern edge of Lawrence. County officials said six people were treated for injuries at a hospital. The Lawrence Journal-World reports that graphic design students at Free State and Lawrence high schools will start restoring photographs this fall. Lawrence teacher Jennifer Dixon-Perkins says personal items such as photos are irreplaceable and can provide a sense of normalcy after a catastrophe. Free State teacher Michelle Salmans says she tries to find ways for students to apply learning to real-world scenarios. She says students will take the assignments more seriously knowing they’re helping others.\n\nKentucky\n\nTompkinsville: The second annual Writers in the Park will be held this week at Old Mulkey Meetinghouse State Historic Site in Tompkinsville. A statement from Kentucky State Parks says more than a dozen authors will participate in the event Saturday, including Kimberly Bartley and Connie Hughes Goodman. Bartley is the author of “Until Death Parts,” “Life Goes On,” “Go Forth and Multiply” and the newly released “Pickin’ Up the Pieces.” Goodman has written several fiction pieces, a biography, and numerous documentaries including “Monroe County Poor House” and “Tell Me a Tale.” The event will include different writing genres and authors from around Kentucky and elsewhere. Participating authors will discuss, sell and sign books. There will also be a workshop offered for budding writers.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: For celebrated Creole chef Leah Chase, the goodbye had all the ingredients of a typical New Orleans sendoff – warm reminiscences and mourning mixed with a Mardi Gras-style celebration of her life. Fellow chefs, musicians, family and friends were among hundreds who filed through a church Monday to pay last respects to Chase, who ran a family restaurant where civil rights strategies were discussed over gumbo and fried chicken in the 1950s and ’60s. She died June 1 at age 96. After a rosary and funeral Mass at St. Peter Claver Catholic Church featuring longtime local musician and singer Deacon John, a brass band, pallbearers, and members of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club slow-walked beside her hearse as it drove the few blocks to Dooky Chase’s restaurant – her last trip to the place where she earned renown as a chef, civil rights icon and patron of the arts.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers have passed a “Student Loan Bill of Rights” aiming to protect borrowers. The Senate unanimously enacted the legislation Monday. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has 10 days to act on the bill or let it go into law without her signature. Such legislation had failed in the last legislative session under a Republican administration. The bill creates a student loan ombudsman with responsibilities that include reviewing and possibly resolving complaints from borrowers. The ombudsman would also compile and analyze borrower data and help borrowers understand rights and responsibilities. Maine’s bill requires servicers who do business in Maine to obtain a license and undergo an investigation. The bill automatically licenses student loan servicers under contract with the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan is urging Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to reconsider delaying the redesign of the $20 bill to feature abolitionist leader Harriet Tubman. The Republican governor made the request in a letter Tuesday. Tubman was born on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. She escaped from slavery to become a leading abolitionist and helped other slaves escape through the Underground Railroad. The Tubman redesign was initially scheduled to be released next year. Andrew Jackson, the nation’s seventh president, is now on the $20 bill. Mnuchin said the delay had been prompted by the decision to redesign the $10 bill and the $50 bill first for security reasons. He has said the decision on whether to keep Tubman on the redesigned $20 will be left to whoever is treasury secretary in 2026.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Legislature may renew a long-standing debate over whether the state should move to a graduated income tax. A proposal that would allow higher levels of income to be taxed at higher rates, as more than 30 states and the federal government do, could come up Wednesday when lawmakers hold a constitutional convention to discuss the so-called millionaire tax. A graduated income tax would go further than the millionaire tax, which calls for a 4% surtax only on individuals with annual incomes above $1 million. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday that he would oppose a graduated income tax, while House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Karen Spilka, both Democrats, did not immediately offer a position.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Ignace: Plans are in the works to enhance the Father Marquette National Memorial site in the Upper Peninsula. The state Department of Natural Resources says a draft plan for the site in Straits State Park in Mackinac County will be unveiled June 18 at St. Ignace Public Library. The Straits of Mackinac Heritage Center Collaborative is hosting an open house, and the public will have opportunities to comment online as well. The Meijer Foundation and several individual donors have contributed or pledged funding that will leverage time-limited matching funds from a $500,000 National Endowment for the Humanities Challenge Grant. Those involved in the project initially committed to raise $1.5 million. The site celebrates 17th-century French missionary Father Jacques Marquette, who was among the first Europeans to explore the Great Lakes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The state’s cash assistance program for low-income families will offer a $100 boost in monthly aid starting next year. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that state lawmakers approved the Minnesota Family Investment Program’s monthly grant increase in May. The extra funding will be available beginning February 2020. It’s the first increase to the program since it began 33 years ago. Minnesota officials estimate the change will help more than 30,000 families. Toshieka Washington and her children were homeless for two years, and she’s been relying on the program to get back on track. Washington says the $100-per-month increase will help her get basic necessities she can’t afford now, such as laundry detergent and more toilet paper. Washington says $100 doesn’t seem like much, but she feels like she won the lottery.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Officials are reminding charities that hire telemarketers to seek new donors that they now have to register under the state’s no-call law. Beginning July 1, charities that use paid telephone solicitors to prospect for new donors could be fined if they don’t register in Mississippi and allow people to opt out of telemarketing calls. Until now, all charities have been exempt from the rules. Under a law passed earlier this year, though, only charities that are contacting existing donors or making phone calls with volunteers are exempt. Senate Bill 2744 also allows businesses to register for the state’s no-call list. Until now, only individuals could register. The new law makes it illegal to cause a fake number to display on caller identification, a practice known as spoofing.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A new report shows that black drivers in the state are 91% more likely than white motorists to be pulled over by police. Data released by the attorney general shows disparities are sometimes even greater when only comparing stops of local residents. The 2018 report comes nearly five years after Ferguson protesters drew national attention to long-standing concerns about police treatment of black communities. Criminologist Richard Rosenfeld cautioned that the latest data is based on population data from the 2010 census but says changes in racial demographics alone don’t explain the disparity increase. Missouri Sheriffs’ Association Executive Director Kevin Merritt says law enforcement officials have no tolerance for racial bias. But he says law enforcement want to collect more information, including whether officers knew the race of the driver before stopping them.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A man whose father signed up for cryogenic preservation after death is suing to obtain the older man’s remains. Laurence Pilgeram paid Scottsdale, Arizona-based Alcor Life Extension Foundation $120,000 to preserve his remains in a frozen state indefinitely. Pilgeram hoped if he were frozen, future technology might someday enable him to be restored to life. He died in 2015. Now, Kurt Pilgeram, of Dutton, Montana, claims in a lawsuit that Alcor severed his father’s head for freezing and sent him the cremated remains of the rest of the body. The son claims his father wanted his entire body preserved. Pilgeram seeks over $1 million in damages and the return of his father’s head. Alcor says it has honored its agreement with Laurence Pilgeram.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Game and Parks Commission has scheduled special events at four state parks and recreation areas for Father’s Day this Sunday. The commission says there will be a fishing clinic at the Danish Alps State Recreation Area near Hubbard in northeast Nebraska. The event begins at 10 a.m. Bait and equipment will be provided. Barbecued ribs will be served from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. during a buffet at Fort Robinson State Park, west of Crawford in northwest Nebraska. There will be a special Father’s Day Buffet from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Platte River State Park near Louisville in eastern Nebraska. A fish fry that includes a Dutch oven cobbler dessert is scheduled to run from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Ponca State Park, north of Ponca in northeast Nebraska. Park entry permits are required for vehicles. More information is available online.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities in the city say they’re worried about the risk of explosion in neighborhoods where gasoline thieves are storing flammable fuel. Lt. Shane Womack told reporters the concern is that flammable vapor during hot summer weather could ignite with catastrophic effect. Police are distributing a public service announcement after Womack says 25 people were arrested recently for using fake or stolen credit cards to buy large amounts of gasoline and diesel fuel with plans to resell it. He says the scheme seems to be organized, and suspects have used vans or pickup trucks modified with oversize fuel tanks to get gasoline to storage tanks in residential areas. Deputy Clark County Fire Chief Jon Wiercinski says investigators found almost no cases in which the flammable fuel was stored safely.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire has started a new center focused on the science of sound. The university currently focuses on underwater acoustics. The new Center for Acoustics Research and Education will initially focus on environmental acoustics, which takes into account sound movement through the air, on land and underwater. It will support expansion into fields like music, speech and medicine. Anthony Lyons, the center’s associate director for research, says he’s already heard from industry and government partners interested in opportunities for professional development and collaboration.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed a law requiring most of the state’s hotels to provide their workers with wearable panic buttons they can press to quickly summon help in an emergency. The Democratic governor signed the bill Tuesday. He and several nationwide unions say New Jersey is the first state to mandate the devices, although at least two others are considering similar measures. The law takes effect in January and applies to hotels with 100 or more rooms. That includes all nine Atlantic City casinos. Iris Sanchez, a room cleaner at Caesars, says she’s relieved to know she’ll be going home safely each night after working. In 2018, a room cleaner at Bally’s casino was pushed into a room by a man who then sexually assaulted her.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: Once a staple in the Four Corners region that connected Navajo weavers and artists to buyers, trading posts are facing challenges to their survival – increased competition from online retailers and large regional grocery store chains, as well as working to navigate changing demands. The Shiprock Trading Post in Farmington now focuses exclusively on Navajo rugs, jewelry, pottery and other works of art. It used to provide all sorts of goods to Navajo customers. Farmington Museum at Gateway Park director Bart Wilsey says trading posts that have survived into the 21st century have become art galleries that deal almost exclusively in Native art or become convenience stores. Wilsey says they also can become wholesalers for Navajo rugs and art in order to remain healthy.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A street in the city has been named for rapper Notorious B.I.G. Community members and elected officials gathered in a downpour Monday at the intersection of St. James Place and Fulton Street. Rapper Lil’ Kim – embracing the event’s themes of social justice and making a difference – exclaimed: “We did it, Brooklyn!” B.I.G., who was born Christopher Wallace, was shot to death in Los Angeles in 1997. He detailed street life in Brooklyn in songs and on albums that dominated the pop charts. Voletta Wallace recalled telling a friend amid her heartbreak: “My son was well loved.” But she said the street naming evoked “happy tears.” The new Christopher “Notorious B.I.G” Wallace Way is in Brooklyn’s Clinton Hill area.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House is reconstituting an oversight committee that will keep monitoring challenges state government has had in distributing federal long-term housing grants to hurricane victims in eastern North Carolina. House Speaker Tim Moore announced Tuesday that the House Select Committee on Disaster Relief has been authorized to meet again. The panel met in 2018 and scrutinized why the state was slow giving out $237 million in federal community development grant funds received after Hurricane Matthew in 2016 for housing repairs. A report by the legislature’s government watchdog agency last month quantifying that slowness again led House Republicans from eastern North Carolina to seek the committee’s reauthorization. The agency issued a follow-up report Monday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s congressional delegation is calling on President Donald Trump’s administration to address North Dakota’s year-old request for $38 million to cover the cost of policing protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The Bismarck Tribune reports that U.S. Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and U.S. Rep. Kelly Armstrong sent a letter Thursday urging Attorney General William Barr and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to settle the state’s claim. North Dakota’s attorney general filed a claim against the Army Corps of Engineers last year, accusing the agency of letting protesters illegally camp on federal land in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017. It also argued the Corps didn’t maintain law and order.\n\nOhio\n\nReynoldsburg: State officials plan to begin aerial treatments aimed at disrupting gypsy moth mating on more than 61,000 acres in 12 counties across the state. The gypsy moth is a non-native, invasive species that feeds on the leaves of more than 300 different trees and shrubs and can permanently damage or kill them. The Ohio Department of Agriculture release says the organic product used in the treatments set to begin June 12 slows the spread of the moths by confusing the males as they search for a female mate. It doesn’t kill the moths. Airplanes will apply the treatment from approximately 100 feet above treetops and buildings. Treatments are scheduled for parts of Allen, Franklin, Guernsey, Hancock, Hocking, Jackson, Licking, Morgan, Muskingum, Noble, Perry and Wyandot counties.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A judge is declining to approve the state’s proposed $85 million settlement with an opioid maker until he’s assured it complies with a new law targeting such deals. The attorney general’s office says Cleveland County Judge Thad Balkman on Monday ordered attorneys for both the state and Israeli-owned Teva Pharmaceuticals to file additional paperwork before he approves the settlement. Attorney General spokesman Alex Gerszewski says the judge wants both sides to address how distribution of the money conforms to the new law. Concerned about how the state’s $270 million settlement with Purdue Pharmaceuticals was structured, the Republican-led Legislature passed a law directing any settlement funds directly into the state treasury.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Four of the state’s public universities will defend substantial tuition increases this week in front of the Higher Education Coordinating Commission amid protests from frustrated students. The University of Oregon is proposing a 9.7% increase, the Oregon Institute of Technology seeks a 9% increase, Portland State University wants an 11% increase, and Southern Oregon University is looking at a 13.5% jump, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The commission must OK tuition hikes of more than 5%, and Portland State students have vowed to express their anger at a tuition hike approved by the school’s board at the commission meeting Thursday. Oregon State, as well as Eastern and Western Oregon universities, approved increases that are less than 5%.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDenver: A hand-painted flag carried into battle by a black Union regiment during the Civil War is going up for auction. Morphy Auctions will sell off the piece of history Thursday. Pre-bidding is underway online. It’s one of 11 such flags painted by African American artist David Bustill Bowser, the son of a fugitive slave. It’s the only known surviving flag. The auction house says seven others are known only from photographs. They were sent to the military museum at West Point in 1906 but were thrown out in the 1940s. The flag up for auction depicts a black soldier waving goodbye to Columbia, the female personification of America, beneath a banner reading, “We Will Prove Ourselves Men.” The 127th Regimental banner is expected to fetch about $250,000.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Environmental officials are asking for the public’s help in tracking the state’s wild turkey population. The Department of Environmental Management is providing a form online that can be submitted when anyone sees a wild turkey, either an adult hen or a young turkey, known as poults. DEM believes the state’s wild turkey population is growing, based on the number of young turkeys reaching maturity and an increase in harvests reported during the spring hunting season that ended last month. The 2019 spring harvest was 270 birds, an increase of 42% from the 2018 season. DEM says the increase of 80 birds is likely due to an increase in the spring season bag limit from one to two birds. DEM receives hundreds of brood reports annually that assist biologists.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFountain Inn: The owner of a miniature pony named Pikachu believes the animal was stolen from her South Carolina home. Hidden Pasture Farm owner Kate Nichols tells news outlets that the miniature palomino filly disappeared overnight last week. Nichols tells WAPT she has searched for the pony extensively, and there are also no signs that it was taken by a predator. Instead, Nichols thinks someone in the area is to blame. The station reports Pikachu was well-known in the community for making appearances at children’s parties dressed as a unicorn. Pikachu is 2 months old and weighs 60 pounds. Nichols posted on Facebook that she believes Pikachu is in danger and is offering a $1,000 reward for its return. She also wrote that “someone knows where she is.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A man has scrapped plans to open a museum honoring recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor. John L. Johnson of Rapid City had planned to open the museum Aug. 1 at the Rushmore Mall. But he told the Rapid City Journal last month that he has abandoned that plan after receiving threats. Instead, he says he plans to open an art gallery for Native American artists on that date in the same space planned for the museum. Johnson sparked controversy in an interview with the newspaper when he referred to efforts to rescind medals given to U.S. cavalry soldiers for the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre. Johnson said many of those soldiers who went on to receive the medal acted heroically.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Jack White-led rockers The Raconteurs, multiple Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile and rap legends Wu-Tang Clan lead the lineup for the 2019 Mempho Music Festival. The third edition of the annual concert fest will take place Oct. 19-20 at Shelby Farms Park. The festival made its official lineup announcement Monday during a press event at the Sam Phillips Recording Studio. Organizers confirmed most of the nearly 20 acts who will appear at the two-day weekend fest, including Americana favorite Margo Price, West Tennessee native and roots songstress Valerie June, Memphis rap great DJ Paul, New Orleans rockers the Revivalists, and California pop combo lovelytheband.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A member of the iconic rap group the Geto Boys is hoping to trade beats and rhymes for politics. Scarface, whose real name is Brad Jordan, announced over the weekend that he plans to run for a Houston City Council seat. The Office of the City Secretary confirmed Monday that Jordan had filed paperwork naming his campaign treasurer. The 48-year-old Jordan first made his announcement on Instagram on Saturday, saying, “I’m offering myself for service as the next Houston City Councilmember for District D.” Jordan, who grew up in Houston, gained fame in the late 1980s with the Geto Boys before launching a successful solo career. The announcement comes after another Geto Boys member, Bushwick Bill, died Sunday of pancreatic cancer.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: A Utah mom of two intersex children born two decades apart is rejecting the secrecy that often surrounds people born with both male and female traits. After Amie Schofield’s eldest child was injured in a violent attack, she and her husband became determined to speak out for 5-year-old Victory, who was born with ambiguous genitalia. Doctors have long performed surgery on intersex kids to make their bodies more like typical boys or girls, but families like the Schofields are refusing surgery and pushing for intersex kids to be accepted as they are born. Schofield says she’s like any other parent; she doesn’t want her daughter to think there’s anything wrong with her because she’s different.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Proponents of a bill that would have imposed a 24-hour waiting period to buy handguns say a veto Monday by the Republican governor was a political move that will cost the lives of people contemplating suicide and victims of domestic violence. Gov. Phil Scott’s veto also drew condemnation from Democratic leaders of the Vermont House and Senate, which both passed legislation last month that contained the waiting period and a change to an unintended consequence of separate gun legislation signed into law by the governor last year. While gun rights activists said they appreciate Scott’s veto, they are still upset by a series of gun control measures signed by the governor last year. Proponents say the legislation would have helped save lives of people considering taking their own lives because they won’t be able to get firearms as quickly. It was also hoped it would prevent homicides.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s tourism industry generated $26 billion in visitor spending across all communities in 2018, a 4.4% increase over 2017. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday that the tourism industry also provided $1.8 billion in state and local revenue in 2018. That’s an increase of 2.9% compared to the previous year. The slogan “Virginia is for Lovers” was developed in 1969 by Richmond-based advertising firm Martin & Woltz, now the Martin Agency. It is the longest-running state tourism slogan in the country. Destinations around the state are participating in the commemoration of “50 Years of LOVE” and celebrating the impact tourism has on Virginia’s economy and communities. The travel industry is the fifth-largest employer in Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has approved a long-delayed plan to redevelop unused Army land next to Discovery Park into about 240 affordable homes and open spaces. The Seattle Times reports the $90 million plan was updated by Mayor Jenny Durkan in February and approved Monday. It calls for the 34-acre Fort Lawton property in the Magnolia neighborhood to be replaced by 85 studio apartments for formerly homeless seniors, 100 rentals for low-income individuals and families, and up to 52 affordable homes for sale. The city would also convert land into two athletic fields, make 13 grassy acres available for picnicking and incorporate several more wooded acres into Discovery Park. Nonprofits including the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, Catholic Community Services and Habitat for Humanity would build the housing using city, state and federal funding.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: New River Gorge National River has several projects planned this summer to improve the area for visitors. The projects include replacing the Sandstone Falls boardwalk and the boardwalk at Brooks Falls, replacing roofs at the Canyon Rim Visitor Center and the Thurmond Depot Visitor Center, upgrading the Army Camp Campground, and adding two new parking areas. New River Gorge Superintendent Lizzie Watts told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that work on the Sandstone Falls boardwalk is expected to last all summer, but the park will try to keep it open on weekends. Goats will also return to the park this summer to remove kudzu and other brush and weeds from the Thurmond area.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The popular China Lights festival will return to Boerner Botanical Gardens from Sept.13 through Oct.20, according to a press release from County Executive Chris Abele. This will be the fourth year in Milwaukee for the colorful China Lights at the gardens. The festival drew more than 100,000 visitors each of the past three years. This year’s event promises new cultural gems re-created as handmade lantern displays ranging from 3 feet to three stories tall. The 2019 China Lights festival also will include an expanded interactive exhibit area, two stages for Asian folk-culture performances, a marketplace, two dining areas, and vendors offering a variety of Asian and Western menu options. More information is available online.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Overcrowding is a concern among members of the task force working on a plan to build $300 million worth of new student dormitories at the University of Wyoming. The Laramie Boomerang reports that UW Vice President for Student Affairs Sean Blackburn says large dorms only make the transition to college more difficult for freshmen coming from rural areas of the state. He noted that White Hall has a comparable population to the town of Big Piney. Blackburn is pushing for an approach with the new dorms that will create a “sense of place,” something he says Wyoming students have a particular affinity for. Blackburn is asking for freshmen to be housed in “small-scale communities of 20 to 30 aggregated into a larger building.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/958059/donald-trumps-taste-for-hyperbole", "title": "The billion-dollar boaster: Trump's taste for hyperbole | The Week", "text": "Donald Trump built his brand on shameless exaggeration – or what he prefers to call “truthful hyperbole”, said Gwenda Blair on Politico. It was a feature of his first Manhattan project in the mid-1970s, when he refurbished the Grand Hyatt Hotel. To make the hotel sound even grander, he relabelled the floor numbers (the sixth became the fourteenth) and claimed, repeatedly and falsely, that it had the biggest ballroom in the city.\n\nHe repeated the trick with Trump Tower, which rises to a 68th floor, despite only having 58, and was billed – again falsely – as the tallest concrete structure in the world. But Trump’s “superpower” could now be his undoing.\n\nLast week, New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, announced a $250m civil lawsuit against him and his company, alleging fraud on a “staggering” scale: that for years he has inflated the value of his assets by billions, in order to secure cheaper loans.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Trump claimed, for instance, that his apartment in Trump Tower spanned more than 30,000sq ft and was worth $327m, yet it was only a third of that size and worth a fraction of that. But Trump’s boastful ways were hardly a secret. If big banks gave him favourable rates on the basis of his claims, more fool them.\n\nTrump would hardly be the first business leader to engage in this sort of spin, said Andrew C. McCarthy in National Review. James is making a mountain out of a molehill. She has yet to identify any victims, and it’s unclear whether her allegations “will come to much in the way of proof or consequence”.\n\nTrump is facing two federal criminal investigations – into the storing of classified documents in Mar-a-Lago, and the efforts to overturn the 2020 election – that could result in serious charges. By comparison, this civil case is a pesky sideshow.\n\nIt’s true that the lawsuit itself won’t put Trump at risk of prison time, said Matt Ford in The New Republic. But it could do fatal damage to his company. If James’s suit prevails, it will not only lead to costly fines and penalties; it will also severely undermine The Trump Organisation, by effectively stopping it doing business in the state of New York. The fact that it is a state-level proceeding means that, even if Trump reclaims the presidency in 2024, he won’t be able to make the case go away.

Key dates for the 2025 filing season", "text": "Benjamin Franklin famously said that \"death and taxes\" are the only two certainties in this world.\n\nWell, the timing of the first certainty is unclear. But you can reliably count on tax season to roll around at the same time every year, and for taxpayers in the United States, it's about to get underway.\n\nSome Americans may be ahead of the game, having filed their returns already with the Internal Revenue Service, while many others may be looking to procrastinate it as long as possible.\n\nBut it's important to keep track of the filing deadline, including for when to request an extension. And of course, everyone wants to know when they can expect the modest windfall that could come from a refund.\n\nHere are key dates to know for the 2025 tax filing season.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nTax filing season:Is it better to pay someone to do your taxes or do them yourself?\n\nWhen does the 2025 tax season start?\n\nTax season officially starts Monday, Jan. 27.\n\nBut that does not mean you can’t get started on your tax filing now.\n\nWhile Monday is the first day the IRS will begin accepting tax returns for the 2024 tax year, Americans can file their taxes even earlier to ensure their return is in the queue and among the first to be processed by the IRS.\n\nWhen is the 2025 tax deadline?\n\nThis year's deadline will fall on the traditional date of April 15.\n\nTax Day always falls on that date, unless April 15 is a weekend or holiday. This year, it comes on a Tuesday.\n\nWhat is the deadline to file an extension?\n\nThe deadline to file for an extension is April 15, according to the IRS. That gives taxpayers until Oct. 15 to file without penalties.\n\nFor people affected by natural disasters, the extension is automatically given.\n\nExtension requests can be done through the IRS at no charge – both electronically and with a paper form 4868 – and require taxpayers to simply provide basic information like their names, home addresses, Social Security numbers and payment, if they owe anything. But because the extension only applies to filing a tax return, taxpayers must still pay any taxes owed by the April 15 deadline.\n\nWhat happens if I miss the tax deadline?\n\nFor people who forget or miss the deadline altogether, the standard penalty is 5% of the tax due for every month the return is late, up to 25% of the unpaid balance.\n\nA smaller penalty of 0.5% is added if you file a return but fail to pay any taxes you owe, or if you get an extension on your return but fail to pay your owed taxes.\n\nHow fast are refunds issued?\n\nYou can expect your tax refund in a month or less, in most cases.\n\nThe IRS says it issues most refunds within 21 calendar days. Paper returns, however, can take four weeks or more.\n\nThe Where's My Refund? tool, which is updated each night, is the simplest way to track your refund within 24 hours of e-filing. For taxpayers who filed a paper return, refund information is normally available after four weeks.\n\nHow many people file their taxes every year?\n\nMore than 163 million tax returns were received in 2024, a 0.9% increase compared to 2023, according to the IRS.\n\nThe IRS said it expects more than 140 million individual tax returns for tax year 2024 to be filed ahead of the April deadline.\n\nContributing: Medora Lee, Daniel de Visé, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/01/30/tax-season-irs-refund-delays/78059573007/", "title": "Tax season 2025: What triggers refund delays, finding lost returns", "text": "Susan Tompor\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nThe 2025 tax season officially kicked off on Monday, when the Internal Revenue Service began accepting and processing individual income tax returns at 9 a.m.\n\nThis means that you could be more likely to receive your tax refund sometime in February — if you file early. But there are plenty of reasons why many refunds won't arrive as soon as some might expect, including if you claim the earned income tax credit.\n\nNo doubt, the IRS will see its own disruptions this tax season. The White House initiated a hiring freeze at the IRS, which could be much longer than those hiring freezes facing other federal agencies. The IRS hiring freeze shall remain in effect for the IRS until the treasury secretary, in consultation with the director of Office of Management and Budget and others, \"determines that it is in the national interest to lift the freeze,\" according to a White House statement.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump told a rally in Las Vegas that he is considering sending nearly 90,000 newly hired IRS agents to guard the southern border, according to the New York Post. He also told the crowd that he could fire the IRS employees, many of whom had salaries funded under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nTrump is \"answering Americans’ fears of a supercharged Internal Revenue Service,\" according to a statement from the U.S. House Committee on Ways & Means Chairman Jason Smith.\n\nFind the loan that's right for you: Best personal loans\n\nFind tax help online:It's easier than ever. Should you file them yourself or pay a pro?\n\nThe Missouri Republican's Jan. 23 statement noted: “President Trump’s cease-and-desist order to the IRS is a crucial first step to helping middle-class Americans and small businesses living in fear of 87,000 new IRS agents targeting them with new audits.\"\n\nIRS Danny Commissioner Werfel, who arrived at the IRS two years ago, had repeatedly stated that he intended to complete his full term through 2027. But Werfel announced before Inauguration Day that he would resign.\n\n\"After significant introspection and consultation with others, I’ve determined the best way to support a successful transition is to depart the IRS on Jan. 20, 2025,\" Werfel said in his statement.\n\nNo doubt, we will hear more out of Trump's team ahead regarding taxes and the tax system.\n\nBut millions of people continue to await their much anticipated tax refunds, and plenty of tax returns have already gone directly to the IRS electronically.\n\nTens of millions of tax returns are typically filed in the first week of a tax season. Last year, more than 15.3 million federal income tax returns were received by the IRS by Feb. 2. The IRS began processing and accepting 2023 federal income tax returns on Jan. 29, 2024.\n\nThe IRS even issued 2.6 million refunds during that single week, ending Feb. 2, 2024, totaling nearly $3.65 billion.\n\nMore than 140 million individual federal income tax returns for tax year 2024 are to be filed ahead of the April 15 federal deadline for most taxpayers, according to the IRS.\n\nLess than half of individual tax filers are expected to file taxes on their own. And more than half of all tax returns are expected to be filed this year with the help of a tax professional, according to the IRS.\n\nHere are a few thoughts that earlier filers should consider:\n\nWhy you're still waiting for your refund\n\nYes, some people might actually be wondering why they didn't get their tax refund yet.\n\nAlready? Really?\n\nThe IRS began accepting e-filed returns Monday, so you cannot issue refunds until the IRS processes that return.\n\nSome people who are already done with their 2024 tax returns might not realize the exact kickoff date.\n\nMatt Hetherwick, chief program officer for the nonprofit Accounting Aid Society in Detroit, said that the free tax service began preparing tax returns the week of Jan. 20.\n\nDo-it-yourselfers who might have all their tax forms in hand were able to do their taxes using software or doing it online earlier in January.\n\nThe early returns e-filed before Monday were treated as \"pending\" by many preparers.\n\n\"Pending\" does not mean the IRS has accepted your return yet. The IRS, after all, is expected to begin to accept or reject returns via e-file on Monday.\n\nKaren Nolan, a TurboTax spokesperson, said TurboTax securely holds those early completed tax returns, and then transmits them to the IRS and individual states when they open for e-file.\n\nAnd then, she said, TurboTax \"will keep you posted on the status of your return via our tracker. The benefit of this is that your return will be one of the first that they review upon opening.\"\n\nBe realistic about when tax refunds will arrive\n\nIf you're an early filer, remember that many tax refunds are not issued as quickly as many people would like. Don't bank on getting a refund by a set date.\n\nIf you're fortunate, you might see a federal income tax refund issued sometime between eight to 15 days after a return is accepted into the IRS system. That's if you e-file your return and opt for direct deposit.\n\nIt could be longer.\n\nThe IRS says most refunds are issued in less than 21 calendar days if you e-file and opt for direct deposit.\n\nHere's one glitch: If you claim the earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit, the IRS notes that you can expect to get your refund by March 3. That's if you file your return online, opt to get your refund by direct deposit, and have no issues with your tax return.\n\nSome taxpayers, the IRS said, may receive their income tax refunds a few days earlier. The IRS \"Where's My Refund?\" tool is expected to show an updated status by Feb. 22 for most early filers who claimed the earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit.\n\nTax season opens:Do you have to file taxes? Why you may want to even if you don't.\n\nBy law, the IRS cannot issue federal income tax refunds before mid-February for returns that claim the advanced child tax credit or the earned income tax credit. The IRS must delay the entire refund, not just the amount associated with the credits. The delay is designed to give the IRS more time to detect and prevent errors and fraud.\n\nIt's a delay that applies to all federal income tax returns that claim those credits.\n\nThe earned income credit can be worth up to $7,830 for a family with three or more qualifying children in 2024 for lower-income families.\n\nDo not fill out a paper return and mail it to the IRS if you want the fastest tax refund possible. The IRS says it takes six weeks to eight weeks to receive a refund after the IRS receives your return if filing via paper.\n\nTaxpayers can use the \"Where's My Refund?\" tool on IRS.gov to track a refund. Those who e-file returns should wait 24 hours after filing before checking for refund information involving a 2024 tax return. If taxpayers file a paper return, they should wait four weeks before checking the status of their refund.\n\nWhat can trigger a delay in getting a refund?\n\nThe IRS has a long, but pretty specific, list for why a tax return can take longer to process and you could see a delay in your refund.\n\nWhile most people had no trouble at all, roughly 1.2 million taxpayers faced incredibly long waits last year for their tax refund cash after getting hit by tax-related ID theft or by claiming frivolous credits after falling for tax schemes and scams, according to a report by the National Taxpayer Advocate.\n\nIf you fall for a tax trick that you spot on social media — such as ones promoting the misuse of the fuel tax credit, the sick and family leave credit and household employment taxes — you're likely not going to get your refund quickly.\n\nAt the end of fiscal year 2024, the National Taxpayer Advocate report noted, some 739,000 taxpayers were still waiting for the IRS to unfreeze their federal income tax refund after they claimed potential frivolous credits.\n\nHere are some cases where the IRS says your tax refund can face delays:\n\nYour tax return has errors, is incomplete or affected in some way by identity theft or fraud.\n\nYou'd need to fix a problem with the child tax credit.\n\nThe return claimed an earned income tax credit, additional child tax credit, or includes a Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation. (This form is filed when the \"injured spouse\" wants to obtain their portion of a tax refund when, the IRS notes, the tax refund will automatically be used for their spouse's \"legally enforceable past-due federal tax, state income tax, state unemployment compensation debts, child support, or a federal nontax debt, such as a student loan.\")\n\nYour bank or credit union might take longer than expected to post the refund to the your account, particularly around some federal holidays.\n\nWhat mistakes should you try to avoid?\n\nRushing to do your taxes isn't a smart strategy.\n\nTax filers must make sure to have all tax documents in hand before filing a return.\n\n\"If not, they risk receiving a letter from the IRS for not properly reporting their income,\" said Hetherwick, of the Accounting Aid Society.\n\nWhat are some common things that you might forget? Maybe it's taxable lottery winnings, casino winnings in person or online. Or maybe you forgot some activity on stock trading apps, like Robinhood, Webull and Charles Schwab.\n\n\"More common situations are tax filers that have had multiple jobs in the prior year. We need to make sure they have everything from each employer,\" Hetherwick said.\n\nDo you have all of your W-2 forms for 2024? From all of your employers during the year? Did you receive any money or any sort of distribution from a retirement account? Say maybe when you switched jobs?\n\nSome online tax programs can help find that data. TurboTax, for example, notes that it partners with hundreds of payroll providers and financial institutions to enable tax filers to automatically import W-2 and 1099 information directly into a return.\n\nLisa Greene-Lewis, a TurboTax tax expert, said taxpayers should make sure they gather the correct Social Security numbers for dependents. \"Dependents are worth valuable deductions and credits but you need the correct Social Security number to claim them,\" she said.\n\nFor many families, especially those receiving the earned income tax credit, a tax refund check is often biggest check that the household will see all year.\n\nThe average federal income tax refund in 2024 was $3,138 based on IRS data through Dec. 27, down 0.9% from the same period in 2023.\n\nGiven the size of many refunds, Greene-Lewis said, it's better to go online, e-file a tax return, and opt for direct deposit to receive that money more quickly.\n\nTax refund checks do get stolen in the mail, and opting for direct deposit can avoid that risk.\n\nThe IRS data indicates that nearly 10 million paper refund checks went out in 2024 — or 9.4% of all refunds issued.\n\nLeix, at the Michigan Treasury, notes that taxpayers who submit a paper return should take extra care and time to follow the instructions carefully.\n\n\"When taxpayer rush to paper file, arithmetic mistakes can occur. This delays processing and refunds,\" Leix said.\n\nWhat can you do if you cannot find a 2023 return?\n\nAsk your tax preparer, if you had one last year, for a copy of the 2023 return.\n\nOr request a tax return transcript from the IRS by using Form 4506-T to get your hands on key personal information. For fast help, go online to www.irs.gov and click on \"Get Your Tax Record.\"\n\nIf you end up requesting a transcript by mail, it's going to take time to get it, maybe five to 10 days. And it's going to be sent to the address that the IRS has on file for you.\n\nThe transcript won't look exactly like a tax return, but it will do the job.\n\nA tax return transcript will show most line items, including adjusted gross income or AGI from your original Form 1040, along with any forms and schedules. It helps to have the 2023 information when filing a 2024 return.\n\nHow do you get your taxes done for free?\n\nMany low-income to moderate-income people also qualify for free tax preparation assistance through AARP Foundation Tax-Aide.\n\nIn 2025, people who generally make $67,000 or less qualify for these services through the IRS's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs.\n\nMany more people can use \"Free File\" at IRS.gov if they're comfortable using tax software. The IRS Free File's online guided tax software products are available to taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

You usually have until April 15 to file, unless it's a holiday or weekend, which gives you more time to submit your taxes.\n\nProfessionals, however, urge most people to prepare now and get them done as soon as possible, if for no other reason than to get their refund quicker.\n\n“Refunds were down a little last year due to waning pandemic benefits, but I think it has settled and may be up because of inflation adjustments,” said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at tax preparer Jackson Hewitt.\n\nLast year, the average tax refund by the April deadline was $2,753, down from the prior year’s $3,012, when pandemic-related benefits helped boost refunds, the IRS said.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHow does inflation affect my taxes and refund?\n\nThe IRS makes annual inflation adjustments to many tax provisions, including tax brackets, standard deductions, 401(k) and IRA contributions. Here are just a few examples of how these tweaks could help you with your taxes this year:\n\nIncome thresholds for 2023 tax brackets were adjusted up by a record 7% because of soaring inflation. So, if your taxable income stayed relatively flat, you could end up in a lower tax bracket with a lower tax rate that goes with it.\n\nSingle filers with taxable income of $41,776 to $89,075, for example, were in the 22% federal income tax bracket last year. For 2023, that bracket applies to single filers with taxable income of $44,725 to $95,375.\n\nSo, if you have $42,000 of taxable income in 2022 and 2023, you’ll move from the 22% federal tax bracket to the 12% bracket when you file your 2023 tax return.\n\nStandard deductions also were adjusted up by about 7%, meaning more of your income will escape tax. Nearly 90% of American taxpayers take the standard deduction, the IRS said.\n\nIncreased contribution limits for 401(k) and IRAs allow you to shield more income from taxes. Contributions are made with pretax money and not taxed until withdrawn unless they are added to Roth accounts. Roth accounts are funded with after-tax money and withdrawals are not taxed.\n\nMaking the rich pay more:Flush with new funding, the IRS zeroes in on the taxes of uber-wealthy Americans\n\nWhy should I file my taxes early?\n\nA refund is usually the biggest incentive to file your taxes early. Three out of 4 taxpayers will likely get a refund, and “for most Americans, it’s the single largest payday of the year,” Steber said.\n\nHowever, there are other reasons to file early too. They include:\n\nLocking down your information. Once you file and the IRS has your return, no one can steal your information and try to file a return on your behalf and steal your refund.\n\nOnce you file and the IRS has your return, no one can steal your information and try to file a return on your behalf and steal your refund.

Filing an accurate return will ensure you’ll get your refund quickly if you’re due one and cut the chances of any IRS questions or audits. Time to prepare finances in case you owe money. If you owe money, it’s better to find out sooner than later so you can come up with the money. Even if you file your taxes early, you still have until the April deadline to pay.\n\nWhen can I get started?\n\nThough you can't officially submit your taxes to the IRS until it says it's ready to accept them, you can begin to prepare them as soon as you receive all your 2023 tax information from employers, banks, and other financial institutions. You should start receiving and collecting this in January.\n\nOnce you've received everything, you can begin preparing your tax forms so they're ready to go as soon as the IRS says \"Go!\"\n\nIf you use a tax preparer, they can put them in the queue to be automatically filed as soon as the IRS opens tax season, and you can be among the first to file taxes, and hopefully, receive a refund, Steber said.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

You'll need to provide a Social Security number, ZIP code, mailing address and the exact amount of your refund.\n\nDid my tax bracket change?\n\nThe amount of tax you owe is a percentage of your income in layers called tax brackets. As your income goes up, the tax rate you can be charged by the IRS gets higher.\n\nThe IRS adjusted tax brackets last year to account for inflation. This is done annually, the IRS says, to prevent \"bracket creep,\" or when taxpayers are pushed into a higher bracket without any real change to their income or buying power due to inflation.\n\nLast year, the IRS gave a 5.4% nudge to taxpayer income to reach each new bracket.\n\nWhat's my tax bracket?\n\nThere are seven federal income tax rates as set by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act.

Season deadlines, refund timeline ...", "text": "Tax season is just over a week away.\n\nIf you’re wondering when you can file your taxes, how long it will take for your refund to be in your bank account and how to get filing help, we’ve got you covered.\n\nWhen can you file taxes during the 2024 tax season?\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service usually starts accepting federal tax returns in late January.\n\nThis year, tax season officially starts on Monday, Jan. 29, when the IRS begins accepting and processing 2023 tax returns, the agency announced.\n\nIn Delaware, the Division of Revenue will begin processing 2023 individual state income tax returns on Jan. 23, said Melissa Marlin, deputy principal assistant with the Department of Finance.\n\nWhen are 2023 taxes due?\n\nFederal 2023 tax returns are due by Monday, April 15.\n\nIf you can’t file by then, you can file for an extension by filling out Form 2868 by April 15. This gives you an additional six months, to Tuesday, Oct. 15, to complete your tax return, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nTax returns can still be filed after April 15 without filing for an extension, but you may be subject to a penalty if you owe taxes.\n\nThe filing deadline in Delaware for personal income tax returns is Tuesday, April 30.\n\nDelaware does not maintain reciprocity agreements with other states, so taxpayers who work in Delaware but are not Delaware residents need to file a Delaware tax return. Delaware residents who work out of state are required to file returns with Delaware in addition to the state where they worked, said Marlin.\n\nHow can I file my 2023 taxes?\n\nYou can file your taxes yourself or have them done for you, either by a paid preparer or from a free service provider.\n\nIf you generally make $60,000 a year or less, have a disability, have limited English skills or speak English as a second language or are 60 years of age or older, you may be eligible for in-person, full-service tax preparation for free through the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, the AARP Foundation Tax-Aide and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nIf you need a filing extension, be sure to check which filing assistance programs will remain open past the April 15 deadline.\n\nIndividuals with an income of $73,000 or less may be eligible to prepare and file federal income tax returns for free through IRS Free File, which opened on Jan. 12. Free File allows tax returns to be completed in advance and then held by participating software companies until they can be filed electronically with the IRS.\n\nBeginning on Jan. 29, Free File Fillable forms, part of the Free File efforts, will provide free electronic forms to tax filers at any income level, allowing them to fill out and e-file their taxes independently at no cost.\n\nService members may be able to prepare and file their tax returns for free through MilTax if they meet certain criteria.\n\nThe agency also announced a new pilot program, IRS Direct File, that allows taxpayers the option to file their 2023 federal tax returns for free online, directly with the IRS. It will be rolled out in phases and is expected to be widely available in mid-March.\n\nIt is available on desktop or mobile devices and walks users through step-by-step instructions to fill out their tax returns. Delaware is not currently involved with the pilot program, but many states have indicated interest to enroll in the service in the future, according to the IRS.\n\nWhen will I get my 2023 tax refund?\n\nThis year, the IRS estimates that more than 128.7 million individual tax returns will be filed by the April 15 deadline.\n\nThe IRS expects to issue most refunds via direct deposit in less than 21 days, according to the agency, but some returns may require additional review that takes longer to process.\n\nIssues that can cause your refund to be delayed according to the IRS include:\n\nIf the taxpayer is claiming certain credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit.\n\nWhether the return is e-filed or sent by mail.\n\nIf the taxpayer has existing debts to the federal government.\n\nElectronically filing your tax return and choosing direct deposit is the fastest way to get your refund. For the issuance of paper checks, the IRS estimates a four- to six-week waiting period.\n\nRemember, the wait for your tax return is based on when the IRS has received your return and entered it, which can be a few days after you submitted it electronically or a few weeks after mailing it in and the IRS has manually entered your information.\n\nFor taxpayers claiming the EITC or the ACTC on their tax returns, the IRS cannot issue refunds before mid-February. The IRS is required by law to hold the entire refund amount for dispersal, not just the portion associated with the EITC or ACTC.\n\nMost EITC- and ACTC-related refunds are expected to be available by Feb. 27 for taxpayers who chose direct deposit and submitted returns without issues, according to the IRS.\n\nDelaware taxpayers should note that refunds will not begin to be issued until Feb. 15 as a result of fraud prevention measures that protect Delaware taxpayers, said Marlin.\n\nMore tax information:Tax season 2024: When to file 2023 taxes, tax filing deadline, refund window and more info\n\nHow to check the status of your 2023 tax return\n\nWant to keep an eye on your 2023 tax return? You can check the status of your filed return, or find out why it may be delayed, by using the “Where’s My Refund?” tool on the IRS website or using the IRS2Go app.\n\nDelaware also has a state tax refund locator that can help you figure out where your money is.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

How should I pay if I owe? How big are the tax refunds this year? If you've yet to file your 2023 federal income tax return, you could easily be asking all sorts of questions as we edge closer to April 15.\n\nThe good news is that the tax season appears to be going smoothly when it comes to the IRS processing tax returns and issuing refunds, according to April Walker, lead manager for Tax Practice & Ethics with the American Institute of CPAs.\n\nIf you buckle down and file those taxes electronically, you might expect any federal income tax refund that you are owed to arrive within three weeks. If you opt for direct deposit, you could see your money a bit more quickly. You're going to wait longer if you file a paper return and opt for a check in the mail.\n\nTaxpayers are encouraged to aim to file tax returns by April 15 in most cases, Walker said, even though proposed tax changes, including a revised child tax credit, remain stalled in the Senate. We started tax season 2024 with some hope that a proposed, limited expansion of the child tax credit might have been in the works and retroactive to 2023.\n\nThe objective has been to get more money to families who receive a partial credit or none at all currently because their incomes are too low, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nEarlier this year, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said taxpayers should not wait for any potential change in tax legislation to file their returns. If Congress changes the child tax credit guidelines, an Internal Revenue Service alert issued in February stated, the IRS \"will automatically make adjustments for those who have already filed so no additional action will be needed by those eligible taxpayers.\"\n\nMore:Proposed child tax credit changes might create confusion on 2023 returns\n\nTaxpayers who have yet to file have a long list of reasons to procrastinate, of course, besides crossing their fingers for a retroactive tax break making its way through Congress.\n\nSome simply hate doing their taxes. Others are digging for lost paperwork. Some might be dragging their feet because they’re uncertain how to handle different situations, such as selling some stock for the first time. Many are running up against the deadline in light of personal challenges, maybe the birth of a baby, an illness, or a death in the family.\n\nBottom line: To get your taxes done, you must make sure you have all your paperwork. If you’re using tax software to complete the task, you must set aside a chunk of uninterrupted time to make sure you do things right.\n\nMore:Earned income tax credit: What kind of income counts, who is eligible for 2023 returns\n\n“If you’re in doubt, file an extension,” Walker said. An extension gives you up to six months to file or up to Oct. 15 in most cases.\n\nFor many taxpayers, it’s a better move to file an extension to get more time to gather their thoughts and paperwork than rush to file a return in a few days that they know will need to be amended in the future.\n\n“It’s not a red flag with the IRS to file an extension,” Walker said.\n\nHere are some other last-minute tax tips:\n\nThe tax deadline\n\nMost Michigan taxpayers are looking at an April 15 deadline for their 2023 income tax returns, which is Monday. However, some select taxpayers can delay filing returns, if needed, by another two months.\n\nMichigan taxpayers hit by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding last August can wait until June 17 to file various federal individual and business tax returns and make tax payments. But you don't have to wait, especially if you're eager for a refund and all your paperwork is in order.\n\nThe tax relief applies to any area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, including Eaton, Ingham, Ionia, Kent, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, and Wayne counties. See the disaster relief page on IRS.gov, which includes deadline extensions in other states, such as Alaska and Connecticut.\n\nThe state of Michigan income tax returns also can be delayed for those impacted by the severe storms that hit Aug. 24 through Aug. 26, 2023. Individuals unable to meet filing or payment deadlines for state returns due to this disaster should contact Michigan Department of Treasury at 517-636-4486. Businesses can call 517-636-6925.\n\n\"If a business or individual taxpayer cannot meet a tax deadline due to an extraordinary circumstance — like a natural disaster or human-caused incident — we encourage them to contact us to talk about options,\" said Ron Leix, a Michigan Treasury spokesperson. \"Treasury can waive penalty and interest due to unforeseen hardship.\"\n\nAnother different deadline\n\nAn Oct. 7 deadline can apply to federal income tax returns for \"taxpayers who live or have a business in Israel, Gaza or the West Bank, and certain other taxpayers affected by the terrorist attacks in the State of Israel,\" according to an IRS alert last year. These taxpayers are granted relief to both file and pay most taxes due. This deadline applies to both U.S. citizens and resident aliens abroad, including those with dual citizenship.\n\nMore:What should you do if you really can't find your old tax return?\n\nMore:Tax refunds from Michigan, IRS: How to check status of state, federal returns in 2024\n\nMore:IRS: 2023 income tax returns will be accepted starting Jan. 29\n\nTax refunds\n\nUnfortunately, we're still seeing the IRS issue a bit fewer refunds during the 2024 tax season, which can be attributed to a variety of reasons. Some people, for example, could be making more money working side hustle jobs and might not be withholding enough in taxes and end up owing money. Some people who might be owed refunds might be waiting longer to file their returns.\n\nThe total number of refunds issued through March 29 is down 3.3% from a similar time last year, according to IRS data. The average refund amount was $3,050 through March 29, up 4.8%.\n\nThe IRS has processed 88.8 million individual tax returns through March 29, down slightly by 1%. Overall, more than 128.7 million individual tax returns were expected to be filed this tax season by April 15, according to an earlier IRS forecast. Some 90.3 million returns already were received through March 29.\n\nMore:IRS sending LT38 collection letters again after 2-year pandemic pause: What to know\n\nHow to pay IRS\n\nThe IRS suggests that taxpayers tap into the \"speed and convenience\" of paying electronically. Options include the creating of and paying through your own IRS Online Account, using IRS Direct Pay directly through your checking or savings account, and the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System. See IRS.gov/payments for options.\n\nYes, it is possible to mail the IRS a check, money order, or cashier's check to pay your federal income taxes. But the IRS does suggest you \"consider alternative methods,\" such as electronic payments.\n\nIf you send a check, the IRS says you need to make sure you put the following information on the check:\n\nYour name and address.\n\nDaytime phone number.\n\nSocial Security number, make sure it's the Social Security number that's shown first if filing a joint return, or employer identification number.\n\nTax year.\n\nRelated tax form or notice number.\n\nTaxpayers are looking at putting a lot of personal information on those checks — which would be made out to the U.S. Treasury. And you need to ask yourself if that's the wisest move when mail is being stolen and we're dealing with an upswing in check fraud.\n\n\"Why would you want a check out there with your Social Security number on it?” Walker asked, nothing that she personally is no longer mailing any checks. You'd also want to send a check certified mail return receipt requested.\n\nThe IRS is able to use a Social Security number on a check to easily enter the payment and make sure the correct account is credited for paying taxes.\n\nMore:Should you stop writing checks? Banks wish you would to thwart fraud\n\nDIY: IRS Free tax filing software\n\nThe IRS launched a well-publicized but limited \"Direct File\" option that's only available in 2024 in 12 pilot states — including California, Florida, Arizona, New York and Wyoming — but not Michigan. It's a do-it-yourself plan for preparing and filing federal income tax returns digitally for free through an IRS-run system.\n\nIn the three weeks since the \"Direct File\" launch, a Treasury official noted, California, Texas, Florida, and New York have the highest number of accepted returns to date. Treasury said taxpayers using Direct File have claimed more than $30 million in income tax refunds thus far.\n\nMany Michigan taxpayers, though, can still consider using the \"Free File\" system at IRS.gov. The free software is available to those with an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less. You'd need to find a software partner that will work with you, and the IRS has a simple tool online at IRS.gov that helps you with that process.\n\nHow to file a tax extension\n\nNo matter your income, you can file an extension with free software offered through a \"Free File\" partner. Filing an extension gives you extra time to e-file the return. If you owe taxes, you must still estimate what you owe and need to pay it by April 15. You do not need to mail in a Form 4868 if you file a request electronically.\n\nMatt Hetherwick, chief program officer for the nonprofit Accounting Aid Society in Detroit, stressed that taxpayers should pay the full amount that they owe by April 15 or they will be subject to penalties and interest. If unable to pay the full amount, he said, pay as much as you can afford to reduce the amount of the penalties and interest.\n\nFor state income tax returns, Michigan taxpayers would need to file Form 4, which is an application for extension, or submit a copy of the U.S. Form 4868 to the state. Michigan will accept a federal extension and then grant a state extension. But the state doesn't use an automated system to handle it and you must take action to request a state extension.

Tax Day always falls on that date, unless April 15 falls on a weekend or holiday. Next year, it comes on that darkest of days, a Monday.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhen does tax season start?\n\nLate January. In 2023, the IRS set Jan. 23 as the official start of tax season, marking the date the agency began accepting 2022 tax returns.\n\nHow early can I file my 2023 taxes?\n\nAgain, late January. The IRS has not yet set the date it will begin accepting 2023 returns.\n\nWhat are the new income tax brackets?\n\nIncome tax brackets jumped by 7% for 2023. Income tax is progressive: the more you earn, the more you pay as a percentage of your earnings. Each bracket represents a range of incomes subject to a particular income tax rate. Tax brackets will rise again in 2024.\n\nHere are the 2023 tax brackets:\n\nFor individual filers:\n\n◾ 37% for incomes over $578,125.\n\n◾ 35% for incomes over $231,250.\n\n◾ 32% for incomes over $182,100.\n\n◾ 24% for incomes over $95,375.\n\n◾ 22% for incomes over $44,725.\n\n◾ 12% for incomes over $11,000.\n\n◾ 10% for income below $11,000.\n\nFor married couples filing jointly:\n\n◾ 37% for income greater than $693,750.\n\n◾ 35% for incomes over $462,500.\n\n◾ 32% for incomes over $364,200.\n\n◾ 24% for incomes over $190,750.\n\n◾ 22% for incomes over $89,450.\n\n◾ 12% for incomes over $22,000.\n\n◾ 10% for income below $22,000.\n\nWhat is the new standard deduction?\n\nThe standard deduction for 2023 also increased by about 7%, to $13,850 for individuals and $27,700 for married couples filing jointly.\n\nWhat is the standard deduction for seniors?\n\nPeople over 65 qualify for an additional standard deduction. For 2023, it’s $1,850 if you are single or filing as a head of household, and $1,500 for married taxpayers. Both figures increased by $100 over 2022.\n\nHave itemized deductions changed?\n\nItemized deductions “mostly remain the same” in 2023, according to Charles Schwab. A few specifics:\n\n◾ State and local taxes: Taxpayers who itemize may deduct up to $10,000 in property, sales, or income taxes they have already paid to local or state governments.\n\n◾ Mortgage interest: You can generally deduct interest paid on the first $750,000 of mortgage debt, according to NerdWallet. People who bought a house before Dec. 16, 2017, may deduct interest on the first $1 million.\n\n◾ Medical expenses: You may deduct only medical and dental expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income.\n\nWhat are the new IRA and 401(k) contribution limits?\n\nEmployees who participate in company retirement plans could generally contribute $22,500 to their 401(k) this year, up from $20,500 in 2022. Those who didn’t participate in an employer-sponsored plan could contribute $6,500 to an individual retirement account (IRA). People 50 and older have higher limits.\n\nFor 2024, the limits rise to $23,000 and $7,000.\n\nWhat is the new health savings account (HSA) contribution limit?\n\nHSA contribution limits were $3,850 for individual coverage and $7,750 for family coverage in 2023, according to Fidelity. In 2024, they rise to $4,150 and $8,300.\n\nWhat is the income limit for child tax credits?\n\nThe 2023 child tax credit is worth up to $2,000 per qualifying dependent under age 17, according to NerdWallet. The credit decreases if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000, or $400,000 for a married couple filing jointly.\n\nWhat’s the difference between filing as single or head of household?\n\nYou can claim “Head of Household” status if you are single or unmarried and maintain a household that includes a child or relative. The status provides for a larger standard deduction and more generous tax rates, according to H&R Block.\n\nEarly birds:Your single largest payday may be a 2023 tax filing away.

After the wild card round, eight teams remain, with four games spread out over two days in the NFL playoffs' divisional round.\n\nThe four games feature three rematches from the regular season. The first game of the weekend is in the AFC with the top-seeded Baltimore Ravens taking on the No. 4 seed Houston Texans. The two teams met in the season opener with the Ravens winning 25-9 behind a trio of rushing touchdowns.\n\nNFL quarterback confidence ranking:Any playoff passers to trust beyond Patrick Mahomes?\n\nA lot has changed since then with Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud emerging as the Offensive Rookie of the Year favorite and the Texans rallying to a division title. Baltimore's stayed roughly as dominant as shown in Week 1 with an NFL-best 13 wins in the regular season behind the top scoring defense and MVP favorite Lamar Jackson at quarterback.\n\nExpert NFL playoff picks: Unique data and betting insights only at USA TODAY\n\nOnce that game wraps up, the most storied rivalry in NFL playoff history adds a new chapter: the NFC's top-seeded San Francisco 49ers host the No. 7-seeded Green Bay Packers. This is the 10th time the two teams will meet in the playoffs, more than any other matchup in NFL history. San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan gave Packers coach Matt LaFleur his first NFL coaching job in Houston 15 years ago. Now, the two will face off in the playoffs for the third time in the last five seasons.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the Texans-Ravens and Packers-49ers games on Saturday.\n\nHow to watch Saturday's games\n\nThe Texans and Ravens kick off at 4:30 p.m. ET on ESPN and ABC. The game will also be streaming on ESPN+ and NFL+. Green Bay kicks off against San Francisco at 8:15 p.m. ET on FOX and streaming on the Fox Sports app as well as NFL+.\n\nHow to watch:Catch NFL playoff action with an ESPN+ subscription\n\nHouston made the playoffs this season for the first time since 2019 but were dominant in the wild card round. Cleveland managed a 14-10 lead early in the second quarter but Stroud and the Texans scored 35 unanswered points to put the game away convincingly. Two passing touchdowns, a rushing touchdown, and a pair of pick-sixes sealed the win. Stroud became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff game in the 45-14 rout.\n\nWhen these two teams met in Week 1, it was more of a defensive struggle than the 25-9 final score may convey. Jackson had just 207 total yards and lost a fumble. The defenses combined for nine total sacks and three takeaways.\n\nMany of Baltimore's starters rested in Week 18 so they're coming into Saturday's matchup with two weeks of rest. Former All-Pro tight end Mark Andrews could return to make the Ravens' fourth-ranked scoring offense even more dangerous at home.\n\nStatus quo in Dallas:Cowboys' decision to keep Mike McCarthy all comes down to Dak Prescott\n\nThis is the only game of the weekend that isn't a rematch from the regular season but there's still plenty of intrigue.\n\nThese teams most recently met in the divisional round of the 2021 NFL playoffs. San Francisco won that snow-filled game 13-10 on a last-second field goal to take down the top-seeded Packers. Two years earlier, the 49ers ran over Green Bay 37-20 to win the NFC championship game.\n\nGreen Bay dominated the Dallas Cowboys in the wild card round to hand the Cowboys their first home loss of the season. Quarterback Jordan Love and the offense are playing their best football of the season with three consecutive 400-yard performances. The defense scored twice last week and tallied four sacks.\n\nSan Francisco hasn't had a bye week in the playoffs since that Super Bowl run in 2019. Like the Ravens, many of their starters have had two weeks off thanks to resting in Week 18. The 49ers are the only team remaining in the NFL playoffs to boast both a top-three scoring offense and scoring defense from the regular season.\n\nNFL playoff format:How many teams make it, how many rounds are there and more\n\nHow to watch Sunday's games\n\nThe NFC kicks off Sunday's action with the Buccaneers and Lions starting at 3:00 p.m. ET on NBC and streaming on Peacock and NFL+. The Bills and Chiefs game finishes off the divisional round with kick off set for 6:30 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ and NFL+.\n\nHow to watch:Catch the NFL playoffs with a Fubo subscription\n\nTampa Bay was in control for most of the wild card round finale last Monday night. The Buccaneers' 32-9 win over the Philadelphia Eagles was quarterback Baker Mayfield's second-best game of the season. Mayfield completed 22 of 36 passes for 337 yards and three touchdowns. The defense held Philadelphia scoreless in the second half and 0-for-9 on third down in the win.\n\nDetroit's win over Los Angeles in the wild card round marked the franchise's first postseason win since 1991. After scoring 21 points in the first half, the Lions' field goal with 8:41 left in the third quarter was all they needed to win. Quarterback Jared Goff had a season-best completion percentage (81.5%) as the Lions offense picked up key first downs to secure the win.\n\nThese two teams met in Week 6 of the regular season and Detroit controlled the contest en route to a 20-6 win. Tampa Bay's offense struggled but has improved since that Oct. 15 matchup.\n\n'It's close to my heart':KC Chiefs running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire in nursing school\n\nAnother year, another Chiefs-Bills playoff matchup. These two teams met in the 2020 and 2021 playoffs in the conference championship and divisional rounds, respectively. The latter of which led to changes in the NFL's playoff overtime rules.\n\nKansas City is playing a road playoff game for the first time in two-time MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes' career. The offense had its best game since mid-October in the wild card round win over the Miami Dolphins. Kansas City's defense, one of the best in the NFL this season, stepped up as well in the subzero temperatures to hold Miami's offense to just 264 yards and seven points.\n\nBuffalo continued its winning streak with its sixth victory in a row last week against the Steelers. The Bills raced to a 21-0 lead halfway through the second quarter and held on from there. They are dealing with lots of injuries, though, including multiple starters on defense. After last week's game was delayed due to snow, current forecasts show no signs of major snow but cold temperatures once again.\n\nThese teams played in Kansas City in Week 14. The Bills won that game 20-17 to start their current winning streak and set up another playoff matchup.\n\nPatrick Mahomes vs. Josh Allen:History of the NFL's new quarterback rivalry", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2024/01/09/2024-super-bowl-date-time-channel/72159410007/", "title": "When is Super Bowl 2024?

Instead of a static bracket, which is standard in most other sports' postseasons, pro football doesn't have a tournament with predetermined sets of matchups.\n\nIn the NFL's playoff format, the No. 1 seed in each conference is guaranteed a bye through the wild-card round, but their divisional round matchup is not a guaranteed meeting with the winner of a specific first-round game. Instead, the top seeds in each both face whichever seed is the lowest remaining after wild-card weekend.\n\nSo, if the No. 7 seed upsets the No. 2 seed in the wild-card round, the No. 7-seeded team would travel to face the No. 1 seed on the road. But if the No. 2 seed wins, then the No. 2 seed would play the second-lowest seed remaining instead while the No. 1 seed plays the lowest remaining seed.\n\nWith just eight teams left – four in each conference – in the divisional round, there's no additional room for the bracket's dynamic nature.

It was reported with Germany’s Der Spiegel, Paper Trail Media, Chinese-language Initium Media and Austria's Der Standard, and supported in part by a grant from the Pulitzer Center.\n\nChongqing, a booming municipality of 32 million people, was set to join a short list of major Chinese cities that have banned indoor smoking in public.\n\nBut in August 2020, Zhang Jianmin, head of the state-run monopoly China National Tobacco Corp., paid a visit to local leaders — including the mayor and the powerful head of Chongqing’s branch of the Communist Party.\n\nWhen Chongqing’s new smoking law was adopted the next month, it included a significant carve-out long sought by the company: Restaurants, hotels and “entertainment venues” such as bars and karaoke clubs could allow smoking in designated areas.\n\nIt was another demonstration of strength by China National Tobacco Corp., the largest tobacco company in the world — and one more missed opportunity by China to live up to a key commitment it had made in signing a major international tobacco control treaty 20 years ago this November.\n\nUnder that treaty, the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, China pledged to enact a national indoor smoking ban, a measure that researchers say both protects people from second-hand smoke, and makes smoking less socially acceptable. But in China, the national law never happened, and efforts by municipalities to implement their own bans have been challenged at every turn by the tobacco monopoly, commonly known as China Tobacco.\n\nOther important elements of the WHO treaty also have yet to manifest. China has not banned the marketing of low-tar cigarettes as safer than other products (they aren’t), and has failed to require that tobacco manufacturers disclose many of the cancer-causing toxins in their products.\n\nChina’s failure to deliver on its promises, including blunting the influence of its own tobacco monopoly, as also required by the treaty, is hardly happenstance. Operating from deep within China’s own political establishment, China Tobacco has engineered a spectacularly successful campaign to stall, derail and influence key aspects of how the treaty has been implemented, a joint investigation by The Examination and media partners in collaboration with USA Today has found.\n\nChina Tobacco leveraged its economic might and status as a government agency to undercut China’s public health officials, while influencing both national policy and local officials like those in Chongqing, the investigation found.\n\nThe company has even countered the power of others within China’s ruling class. In a 2013 report obtained by the reporting team, the influential Central Party School in Beijing identified tobacco as a “poisonous product” and the country’s “No. 1 killer” — and called on the government to break up the tobacco monopoly.\n\nStudy:Chinese men smoke one third of world's cigarettes\n\nIn its battle against anti-smoking efforts, China Tobacco enjoys a profound advantage, said Ray Yip, an epidemiologist who previously led the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s operations in China. “It’s like a soccer game where they are both a player and the referee,” Yip said. “Guess whose side is going to win?”\n\nEven as China’s economy has undergone a remarkable transformation, China’s tobacco addiction has continued unabated: No country on the planet burns through more cigarettes than China. In excess of 2.4 trillion cigarettes are sold there each year, about 46% of the global total, and more than the next 67 countries combined.\n\nSmoking rates have barely budged, even as they have plunged in many comparable countries — and as the country has undergone a remarkable economic transformation.\n\nThe result of China’s failure to curb its smoking epidemic is a growing health crisis that is projected to grow far worse in years to come, as many of the country’s 300 million smokers contract lung cancer, heart disease and a host of other illnesses associated with tobacco use. China doesn’t keep precise data on tobacco deaths, but health experts agree that at least one million a year die there of smoking-related diseases.\n\nHad the country’s tobacco use rate, which includes smoking, simply declined at the same rate as the rest of the world from 2005 to 2020, about 80 million fewer people in the country would be hooked on nicotine today.\n\nThis story is based on newly-revealed documents from China Tobacco; translations of little-noticed company and government reports; a book authored by China Tobacco executives — and dozens of interviews with current and former public health officials, activists and researchers.\n\nChina Tobacco and the Chinese government did not respond to questions for this story.\n\nThe warship builder\n\nStress from a new job caused Wei, who asked that his full name be withheld out of fear of repercussions for talking to foreign media, to start smoking shortly after leaving graduate school in 2006. Wary of addiction, he switched cigarette brands regularly in hopes that this strategy would keep him from getting hooked, he said.\n\nIt didn’t work: Wei, who lives in the eastern city of Hangzhou, eventually smoked as many as three packs a day. By 2012, he was regularly coughing up phlegm.\n\nQuitting was hard. A major obstacle was the social component: he feared losing the friends with whom he regularly smoked.\n\nAfter convincing himself that a nonsmoker could have a good social life, he finally managed to quit. In 2018, he started his own business helping others to kick the habit. “Chinese smokers don’t see tobacco addiction as a disease that requires medical treatment,” he said in a recent interview.\n\nExperts say that social norms play a big role in smoking culture, and in China, as in other East Asian nations, smoking is largely a male habit. Nearly half of adult men in the country use tobacco, compared with less than 2% of women, according to the World Bank.\n\nOne recent study found that more than a third of the country’s male emergency room doctors smoke, a statistic no doubt boosted by the common practice of bribing physicians at the most sought-after hospitals with cartons of premium cigarettes.\n\nAlmost every cigarette smoked in China is made by China Tobacco. Under the name of its regulatory alter ego, the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, China Tobacco governs the entire tobacco supply chain. It sets the price of tobacco leaf, controls which truckers haul its products and licenses the stores that sell them.\n\nIts regional tobacco subsidiaries control 96% of the market and sell more cigarettes annually than the global output of the world’s next 13 largest tobacco companies combined.\n\nChina Tobacco’s sprawling business interests include stakes in pharmaceutical companies, luxury hotels and four of the 10 largest Chinese banks.\n\nIt is also a spectacular money machine. In 2022, profits and taxes from the company generated $213 billion for China’s central government. That figure is about 7% of government revenue, and nearly equivalent to China’s defense budget. It's a comparison that leads some in China to joke that they are “helping the government build warships” when they light up.\n\nChina is hardly the only country to struggle to reconcile the economic might of its tobacco industry with the public health harms of cigarettes. In the United States, the political clout of Big Tobacco stalled reforms for decades. Several other countries in Asia and the Middle East, including Indonesia and Turkey, are faring as poorly or worse than China when it comes to kicking the habit.\n\n‘Dirty ashtray’ award\n\nChina Tobacco’s efforts to derail the most significant global tobacco control treaty ever signed began well before it was even ratified. These were detailed in a celebratory book the company published after the fact in China called “Research on Counterprosals to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and Countermeasures to Address Its Impacts on the Chinese Tobacco Industry.”\n\nAs the book details, tobacco executives were official members of the Chinese diplomatic delegation to the WHO meetings in Geneva and actively participated in the negotiations, in some cases sitting side-by-side with the leader of the Chinese delegation.\n\nChina Tobacco proposed dozens of changes to the treaty in progress: China’s government adopted 51 of them as part of its negotiating position. At least two of these points are reflected in the treaty’s final language, including the company’s elimination of language restricting some outdoor smoking and its insistence that the tobacco industry need not disclose its advertising spending to the public.\n\nChina wasn’t alone in seeking to weaken the treaty: Japan, the United States and Germany were viewed as protective of their domestic tobacco industries. The U.S., while initially enthusiastic about a treaty during the Clinton administration, changed course during the presidency of George W. Bush, and is one of just a handful of countries that participated in the talks but failed to ratify it. All four countries would receive a “Dirty Ashtray award” from an alliance of anti-tobacco groups for their efforts to undermine the pact.\n\nThe final text of the treaty was agreed to in May 2003. Its core provisions include a laundry list of proven tactics for reducing smoking: it requires standardized health warnings, national smoke-free laws, a comprehensive ban on advertising and the elimination of misleading marketing around supposedly “healthier” cigarettes.\n\nIn the months that followed, China Tobacco staff helped “proofread” the document, as part of its translation from English into Chinese. They made dozens of changes to the proposed official Chinese version translation, including substituting words for “shall,” “should,” and “comprehensive” with weaker Chinese terms, according to the book authored by the company.\n\nFor example, where the English-language version of the treaty says unequivocally that “each party shall” pass laws banning indoor smoking in public places, the Chinese version says merely “each party should” take such an action.\n\n“The difference of one word produces a strikingly different effect,” the authors note, in their passage taking credit for the translation changes.\n\nAn outside translation service commissioned by the reporting team verified the book’s account. The analysis identified 68 instances in which the English word “shall” was replaced in the Chinese version with the character for “should.” In other places, “should” was replaced with a Chinese character meaning “is desirable” or “is recommendable.” The altered language remains in the Chinese version of the treaty on the website of the United Nations to this day.\n\nIn response to questions about the altered translation, the body that administers the treaty – the Geneva-based Secretariat of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control – said that the translations happened before the Secretariat was created. We are “unable to state with certainty whether a past staff member was made aware of the possible issue,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe spokesperson also referred to language in international law noting that both the English and Chinese-language versions of the treaty are “equally authoritative.”\n\nIn November 2003, China signed the treaty. China Tobacco’s focus turned from influencing the treaty’s language to influencing its implementation.\n\nDespite the treaty’s exhortation to protect tobacco control policies from the tobacco industry, China Tobacco gained a seat on the government commission that would implement the tobacco pact, as did its parent ministry, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. That committee would become the government’s top tobacco control policy organ.\n\nThe health ministry was awarded just one seat.\n\n‘Civilized smoking’\n\nChina’s tobacco control track record in the decade that followed was decidedly mixed. Cigarette production continued to increase and few of the WHO treaty’s major provisions were implemented.\n\nBut then came the Communist Party School report that called tobacco China’s number one killer. The report was commissioned while the body was led by Xi Jinping. It was released in 2013, a few months after he became China’s president.\n\nThe report, from a team of senior researchers, chronicled numerous failures by China to abide by the WHO treaty, advocated for a national smoke-free law and called for major reforms to the tobacco industry. It recommended separating the company’s commercial arm from its regulatory role and ending the state monopoly.\n\n“The huge tobacco tax revenue makes it difficult for the government to let go,” said the report. “This is the fundamental reason why the government has dragged its feet in tobacco control.”\n\nOver the next few years China enacted a litany of directives aimed at lowering smoking rates, including forbidding cigarette ads and tobacco sales in government offices; banning smoking in schools and requiring basic, text-only warning labels on cigarette packs.\n\nBeijing outlawed smoking in restaurants, hotels, railway stations, hospitals and other public places, and was one of the first jurisdictions in the country to impose smoking restrictions that complied with the tobacco treaty. To enforce it, the city hired 1,100 red armband-wearing “anti-smoking inspectors.” Shanghai, Shenzhen and several other cities followed.\n\nSignificantly, the government raised cigarette taxes, effectively increasing retail prices by an average of 11% – the first meaningful increase since the tobacco treaty took effect. Cigarette sales dipped nearly 8%.\n\nBut what would have been the most significant reform never happened. In 2014, China’s State Council released a draft of a national smoke-free law that would ban indoor smoking in public places and require large, graphic warnings on cigarette packages. The WHO called the proposal a “quantum leap forward” that, if adopted in full, would “save many millions of lives.”\n\nPassage required all government ministries to sign off. China Tobacco and its parent ministry refused, effectively vetoing it.\n\nAs the proposal languished, anti-smoking activists focused on winning smoke-free laws at the local level. The city-by-city approach coincided with Xi’s Healthy China 2030 Action Plan, which laid out specific public health goals. One goal was to have 30% of the population covered by comprehensive smoking bans by 2022, and 80% covered by 2030.\n\nYet setting that goal was also an acknowledgement that a national smoke-free law, which would cover 100% of the population as required by the tobacco treaty, and was arguably its most important component, was dead.\n\nThe city-by-city approach has also languished.\n\nIn late 2020, Xining, a provincial capital in western China, succeeded in passing a comprehensive smoke-free law. China Tobacco responded by firing its top local executive in the city as an example to company officials elsewhere, according to two sources in China’s public health community.\n\nNo other local legislature has passed a smoking control law since, though several local governments have used administrative tactics to enact weaker bans.\n\nIn June of this year China Tobacco sent a memo to officials in the eastern city of Jieshou, another municipality considering an indoor smoking ban, warning that while “control of smoking” is an acceptable goal, a “ban on smoking” is not.\n\nIt also warned the city government about using the WHO treaty to justify a ban. “It is not appropriate…[to] directly apply international conventions,” the company wrote. It warned that banning smoking in workplaces was “not conducive to the current construction of the local business environment.”\n\nThe law remains under consideration.\n\nTo institutionalize smoking in public places, China Tobacco has stepped up to fund the construction of thousands of smoking areas in government buildings, shopping malls, parks and other locations.\n\nToday, just 16% of China’s population now lives in a place covered by treaty-compliant smoke-free laws, according to an analysis by China University of Political Science and Law — far below Xi’s target of 30% by 2022.\n\nMore than 700 million nonsmokers in China, including 180 million children, are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke, according to the WHO.\n\nThe only voice that really matters\n\nPerhaps the most significant way China has violated its commitments under the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control: failing to abide by the treaty’s admonition that parties protect their tobacco policies “from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry.”\n\nThe WHO treaty requires members to prohibit the sale of tobacco to minors, another policy that China semi-adopted, but then outsourced to China Tobacco to enforce. A 2019 survey of 4,900 middle school smokers in China found that more than three-quarters of those in seventh to ninth grade had been able to purchase cigarettes in the previous month.\n\nThe company markets numerous cigarette brands attractive to young smokers, including mango, mocha and orange-flavored cigarettes. China Tobacco knows well the attractiveness of such flavors to youth. In 2021, it gained regulatory authority over e-cigarettes, a market dominated in China by private companies. The following year, it banned the sale of fruit-flavored vape products, even as fruit-flavored cigarettes remain on the market.\n\nAs for warning labels on cigarette packs, China Tobacco retains the authority to set its own standards. Unsurprisingly, it has selected only vague warnings, such as “Smoking is Harmful to Health,” and on many brands, the color schemes allow the warnings to blend into the background of the packaging.\n\nDespite the WHO treaty’s recommendation that tobacco taxes be used to limit consumption, China has some of the world’s least-expensive cigarettes, with some brands selling for as little as 3 yuan per pack, or about 42 cents — prices set by China Tobacco.\n\nIn addition, the WHO treaty explicitly requires governments to end the misleading marketing of so-called “low- tar” and “reduced harm” tobacco products — a response to Big Tobacco’s marketing of cigarettes branded as “light” or “mild” beginning in the 1960s that were later shown to be just as harmful as other cigarettes.\n\nChina Tobacco has made the sale of “less harmful, low-tar” cigarettes a core business. It prominently displays the tar content on cigarette packs and even markets brands infused with Chinese medicinal herbs such as ginseng and osmanthus flower.\n\nOne important reason that China Tobacco has retained an upper hand is that China’s authoritarian shift since 2017 has sharply curtailed public discussion on a range of issues – including tobacco control — that had previously been considered relatively uncontroversial.\n\nIn fact, the treaty’s provision barring tobacco industry influence has been inverted. It is public health advocates that are losing influence.\n\n“The government is becoming a more authoritarian state [and], there is less role for civil society,” said one public health advocate. “Because of that, there is an opportunity for [China Tobacco] … we don’t see that things will change in the next few years unless there is a shift in the general political climate.”\n\nEven so, China’s public health community continues to push for more indoor smoking bans, but is frustrated by the slow progress, and by concerning signals from the marketplace. Cigarette sales in the country have increased each year since 2019, and the market research firm Euromonitor International forecasts continued growth through at least 2027, despite China’s shrinking population.\n\nAs with so much else in China these days, how much influence China Tobacco wields is really up to just one person.\n\n“Xi is the only one who can temper their momentum,” said Yip, the former head of the Gates Foundation’s China programs. “In the current environment, no one else could tell them to step back.”\n\nJason McLure and Manyun Zou are correspondents for The Examination.

Athletes from around the world, including Team USA flag bearers LeBron James and Coco Gauff, floated on boats for the six-kilometer route that traveled east to west across Paris from the Pont d’Austerlitz to the Trocadero.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports brought you live updates from Paris, highlights and more throughout the opening ceremony. (Follow NBC's replay of the opening ceremony in prime time.)\n\nWho lit the Olympic Cauldron?\n\nThe Olympic Cauldron was lit by Teddy Riner, a three-time Olympic champion in judo, and Marie-Jose Perec, a three-time Olympic champion in track and field.\n\nRafael Nadal, Serena Williams carried Olympic torch\n\nIn an Olympics opening ceremony surprise, Rafael Nadal carried the Olympic torch once it reached the Eiffel Tower. Nadal might as well have honorary French residency after winning a record 14 French Opens. He won four in a row from 2005-2008, five in a row from 2010-2014, another four in a row from 2017-2020 and his final one in 2022. He is 112-4 all-time at Roland Garros. A statue of him was erected outside the stadium in 2021. Nadal has 22 Grand Slams total.\n\nNadal then passed the torch to fellow tennis legend Serena Williams. Three of her 23 Grand Slam titles came at the French Open. Carl Lewis, a four-time Olympic champion at the 1984 Games, and Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, who scored the first perfect 10 in Olympic history at the 1976 Games, also were part of the torch’s final journey. — Nancy Armour\n\nAmelie Mauresmo passed Olympic torch to Tony Parker\n\nThe tennis theme in the Olympic torch relay continued when Amelie Mauresmo, the only French player to be No. 1 in the Open era, took the torch after it arrived off the boat. Tony Parker, who paved the way for French players in the NBA and won four titles with the San Antonio Spurs, took the handoff from Mauresmo. Parker and Carter continued running with the torch after they passed it over to a trio of French athletes. — Nancy Armour\n\nCeline Dion at opening ceremony dazzled\n\nThe legendary singer Celine Dion performed at the opening ceremony after the Olympic Cauldron was lit.

Flagbearers held their country’s flags aloft as the team boats floated down the Seine while other athletes waved smaller flags. But Gauff and James also took time to pose for photos with others on the boat – including the captain – and take in the sights of Paris.\n\n“Seeing a lot of water, first off,” Gauff said. “But also some amazing people, a lot of amazing athletes and we’re all excited to represent Team USA.”\n\nAsked if the steady rain put a damper on their special moment, James said no.\n\n“The rain can’t stop us,” he said. — Nancy Armour\n\nAxelle Saint-Cirel performs French national anthem on Grand Palais roof\n\nOn the roof of the Grand-Palais and wearing colors of the French flag, Axelle Saint-Cirel, the Choeur and the Maîtrise de Radio France performed the French national anthem, called The Marseillaise. It was composed in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle, who was an officer for the French Engineers. It was declared the national anthem in 1795. As the national anthem was performed, the Republic Guard raised the flag at the Trocadéro. Composer Victor le Masne musically rearranged the national anthem for the opening ceremony.\n\nSteph Curry, A'ja Wilson at Olympics opening ceremony\n\nWomen's basketball forward A'Ja Wilson looks to have added an extra piece of fashion to her Team USA Ralph Lauren outfit — thanks to the help of Steph Curry. The Golden State Warriors guard — who is making his Olympic debut with USA Basketball in Paris — gifted Wilson Olympics-themed sunglasses for Friday's opening ceremony.\n\nWhich country will host the 2028 Olympics?\n\nThe 2028 Summer Olympics will be in Los Angeles. The city has hosted twice before: 1932 and 1984.\n\nNoah Lyles, Sha'Carri Richardson show off nails at opening ceremony\n\nHere's a look the nails of Noah Lyles, who is the fastest man in the world so far this year.\n\nAnd here are Sha'Carri Richardson's nails from the opening ceremony.\n\nWhat country has the most athletes in the Olympics?\n\nThere are 10,714 athletes from 206 different countries scheduled to take part in this year's Olympic Games. The United States will have the largest national delegation at the Summer Games in Paris with 593 athletes. Host nation France is second with 573, followed by Australia (460), Germany (427), Japan (404), Italy (403), China (388), Spain (382), Great Britain (327) and Canada (318) rounding out the top 10.\n\nWhy was Australia after Zambia and Zimbabwe at opening ceremony?\n\nThe sight of the Australian team coming after Zambia and Zimbabwe might have taken those who know their alphabet by surprise. But there was a reason for the Aussies being so far out of alphabetical order. Countries that are hosting upcoming Olympics come at the end of the Parade of Nations. Brisbane is hosting the 2032 Summer Games, so Australia was the third-to-last team. The United States was second-to-last, with the Olympics returning to Los Angeles in four years. And France, the host of these Paris Olympics, was the last country in the 85-boat flotilla. — Nancy Armour\n\nOlympics opening ceremony order of countries\n\nThe order of the parade of nations is determined by the French spelling of their country names. Germany is Allemagne in French, for example, so it goes with the As, not the Gs. The only exceptions are the United States, which is Etats-Unis in French but goes second-to-last because it is hosting the next Summer Games, and France, because it’s the host country.\n\nMetal band at Paris Olympics: Who is Gojira?\n\nThe metal band Gojira, who performed at the Olympics opening ceremony, is made up of Joe Duplantier, Mario Duplantier, Christian Andreu and Jean-Michel La- badie. They performed at the Conciergerie, which was the residence of French kings in medieval times. It became a prison during the French revolution and Marie-Antoinette was one of its most famous prisoners. Gojira performed alongside singer Marina Viotti.\n\nAya Nakamura Olympics opening ceremony performance\n\nAya Nakamura is one of France’s most famous pop stars, performing performed \"Pookie, Djadja\" and \"For me formidable, La Bohéme\" at the opening ceremony alongside 60 musicians from the Republican Guard and 36 choristers of the French Army. Nakamura mixes elements of R&B, Afropop and Parisian street slang, and her most famous song is “Djadja.” She’s been compared to Rihanna and Cardi B.\n\nWhy Russia, Belarus are banned from 2024 Olympics\n\nOnce again, Russia is technically banned from appearing at the Olympic Games. Yet once again, Russian athletes will compete under a different name − a handful of them, at least.\n\nAt the 2024 Paris Olympics, which begin this week, 15 athletes from Russia − and 18 from neighboring Belarus − are slated to compete as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" or AINs for short, according to the most recent statistics released by the International Olympic Committee on Saturday. The AIN classification means that Russian and Belarusian flags, national anthems and uniforms will be absent from the Paris Games. This punishment was levied by the International Olympic Committee following its invasion of Ukraine. — Tom Schad\n\nHow many athletes are on Team USA?\n\nThere are 593 American Olympians at the Paris Games. Meet Team USA.\n\nHow many countries participate in the 2024 Olympics?\n\nMore than 200 countries are competing in the 2024 Olympics, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe.\n\nMinions at Olympics opening ceremony\n\nMinions — of the \"Despicable Me\" franchise and its spinoff movie, \"Minions\" — made a digital appearance at the opening ceremony. In a video with the \"unknown\" athlete running with the Olympic torch, the Minions are seen acting out a scene in a submarine submerged in the Seine.\n\nLady Gaga at Olympics opening ceremony gave stunning performance\n\nLady Gaga returned to music at the 2024 Paris Olympics during a performance at the opening ceremony and lit up the City of Lights. Alongside a fleet of dancers, the Grammy favorite performed a French-inspired set alongside the Seine river with a tribute to Zizi Jeanmaire's presentation of \"Mon Truc En Plumes,\" translated to “My Thing with Feathers.” — Jay Stahl\n\nOlympic opening ceremony performers\n\nLady Gaga, metal band Gojira and French pop star Aya Nakamura were among those who have performed at the opening ceremony.\n\nWho made medals for the Paris Olympics?\n\nThe Monnaie de Paris, which has been minting France’s coins since 864. The company also made the medals for the Athens Olympics in 1896, the first modern Olympic Games, and the two previous Summer Games in Paris, in 1900 and 1924.\n\nHow many medals were made for the Paris Olympics?\n\n5,084.\n\nWhy does Greece go first in the Olympics?\n\nGreece goes first at the opening ceremony every Olympics because it is the birthplace of the Olympic Games.\n\nWhy is Peyton Manning wearing an arm band?\n\nNBC opening ceremony co-host Peyton Manning sported an arm band on his right forearm during the opening ceremony broadcast, much like he did during his playing days as an NFL quarterback. He joked he was wearing it because he had notes on all 200-plus countries in the opening ceremomny.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo on being Greece's flag bearer\n\n“That is an honor,” he said. “If I am the flag bearer, great. If I am not, OK. I am just happy that I have a good coaching staff and a good team, I am in the Olympics.\"\n\nWho designed the Olympics flag?\n\nPierre de Coubertin, who is considered the founder of the modern Olympics, designed the rings in July 1913. The Olympics logo was first used on a flag in 1914. That original flag is now at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. The IOC officially adopted the rings logo and flag in 1914.\n\nAmericans in Paris\n\nRachael Raskovich, Amanda Mason-Sekula and Kelly Holmes arrived at the opening ceremony wearing American flag themed hats, red white and blue glasses and sequin USA jackets with \"Proud American\" stitched on the back.\n\n\"Amazon,\" Raskovich said with a smile when asked about the gear.\n\nThe trio of friends met in law school and said they will spend the next week or so hopping around to events around the city. They have tickets to beach volleyball and equestrian, Raskovich said, among other sports. Their group was just one of the many clad in red, white and blue that lined the southern banks of the Seine River on Friday night. Doris Ng of Chicago was among the U.S. spectators who were still searching for a good spot from which to view the ceremony in the hour before it began.\n\n\"We thought we were going to be on time,\" she said. \"I think everybody else beat us to the punch already.\"\n\nFortunately, she also has tickets to the closing ceremony, she said. — Tom Schad\n\nNot every local was in a festive mood\n\nOne man saw my media credential and wanted to make sure — despite barely speaking English — that he was upset over a rumor Celine Dion had been paid 2 million Euros to perform one song at the opening ceremony. Another woman, an American who has lived in Paris for 15 years, said property taxes went up and yet Parisians were not given much access to events or even public spaces to watch the festivities despite the financial and social burden being put on them.\n\nBut even when the rain began falling, people did not scatter to look for shelter. Instead they powered through, trying to get a better look at the bleu, blanc and rouge streaks being left in the sky by an airplane flyover.\n\nRestaurants, which don’t have televisions here, were generally not busy. If you were going out to eat Friday night, it’s because you didn’t care to watch the show live. But inside one of them in a residential area near the Eiffel Tower, you could hear the singing of La Marseillaise, the French National Anthem. For a few minutes, the din of conversation went completely silent. — Dan Wolken\n\nTeam USA opening ceremony outfit\n\nTeam USA’s opening ceremony outfit is a modern take on a tailored look. On top, a tailored single-breasted wool blazer with red and white tipping is worn over a striped oxford shirt. The bottom is a more casual tapered jean and classic suede buck shoe fit.\n\nRalph Lauren works closely with Team USA and the goal, as always, is to “do something graphic and uniquely American,” chief brand and innovation officer David Lauren said.\n\nTo account for the heat, the company constantly looks at different fabrics and layering systems to keep the athlete’s body temperature in check, Lauren said. All items in both the opening and closing ceremony outfits are manufactured in the United States.\n\nCoco Gauff opens up on being U.S. flag bearer, making Olympic debut\n\nCoco Gauff is making her Olympic debut in Paris and she is one of two U.S. flag bearers. “(Competing) in the Olympics has always been up there with winning a Grand Slam, like top goals,” Gauff told USA TODAY Sports this summer. Read our full feature on Gauff.\n\nOn the opening ceremony red carpet, Serena Williams was asked about Gauff being the flag bearer. \"Isn't that great. I'm so excited to see her tonight. I'm just so happy for her,\" the tennis legend said.\n\nUSA flag bearers 2024\n\nBasketball superstar LeBron James and tennis star Coco Gauff are the flag bearers for the Americans.

The rapper, who will carry the torch ahead of the opening ceremony, is primed for a bigger role three years after his reactions to the dressage competition with Kevin Hart went viral at the Tokyo Games.\n\nSnoop will appear regularly on “Primetime in Paris,” serving as a “special correspondent” for NBC. During parts of the primetime show, Snoop Dogg will interact with Team USA athletes, their families, or explore Paris and share his experiences and insights with the night's audience. He's also carrying the Olympic torch.\n\nParis Olympics closing ceremony date\n\nThe 2024 Summer Games will hold the closing ceremony on Aug. 11\n\nHow many times has Paris hosted the Olympics?\n\nParis has hosted the Summer Olympics three times: 1900, 1924 and 2024.\n\nAre any U.S. athletes skipping the opening ceremony?\n\nAbout 350 of Team USA’s 592 athletes will march – or rather, float – in today's opening ceremony, according to Nicole Deal, who oversees the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s security operations.\n\nThat means about 40% of the U.S. delegation will be absent, though that is not exactly unusual.\n\nMany athletes and teams – especially those competing early in the Games – choose to pass on the opening ceremony because it often runs late into the night and requires them to spend several hours on their feet. U.S. gymnasts and swimmers, for example, regularly skip the ceremony to rest up for their competitions – which, in some cases, begin the next morning.\n\nU.S. swimming star Katie Ledecky said earlier this week that she never planned on going to the Paris opening ceremony for this very reason. She swims the 400-meter freestyle Saturday morning. — Tom Schad\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

While vapes were initially marketed to people who wished to stop smoking, that has now changed entirely: shops selling the devices seem to have cropped up on most high streets, and vapes are now available in an amazing variety of shapes, sizes, colours and flavours, from “lemon tart” to “green gummy bear”.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a growing chorus of alarm over the potential impact of vaping on public health. Of particular concern is the fact that increasing numbers of children are using e-cigarettes, thereby placing them at risk of becoming addicted to nicotine: some experts have even warned of a vaping “epidemic” among teenagers.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

His device, patented in 2003, contained a liquid form of nicotine that was heated into vapour and inhaled. It was his company, later bought by a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco, that kickstarted the vaping revolution. Today, e-cigarettes still work in much the same way: battery-powered devices heat a solution of nicotine, propylene glycol or glycerine, and flavourings, to produce a vapour. But they now come in many forms: some devices are refillable; many others are disposable, offering up to 600 puffs before they run out. Some two million single-use vapes are thrown away a week in the UK, and there are now hundreds of different companies offering vapes. The leading brand in the UK is Chinese-owned Elf Bar, which makes disposable e-cigs that are popular among British teenagers; industry giants such as British American Tobacco have also launched their own brands.\n\nIs vaping dangerous?\n\nIn a landmark report in 2015, Public Health England concluded that vaping was 95% healthier than smoking, and put it at the forefront of its plans to reduce smoking. This is chiefly because e-cigarettes do not contain cancer-causing tar or carbon monoxide, as cigarettes do. But the claim has proved controversial. Researchers in other countries – particularly America, where vaping has been treated as a serious public health threat – have raised concerns that it can cause lung disease and asthma. Studies in the US have also found that some flavoured e-liquids have been shown to contain carcinogens such as pulegone and formaldehyde. And nicotine is a toxic substance, albeit a mild one, which can cause cardiac problems. The concerns have led about 40 countries – including India, Japan, Singapore, Argentina and Uruguay – to ban the sale of e-cigarettes altogether. But the biggest alarm has been over the rise of vaping among children.\n\nHow big is that problem?\n\nE-cigarette use among 11- 17-year-olds has risen dramatically in the UK in recent years. According to the campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), 20.5% of children aged 11-17 had tried vaping – up from 13.9% in 2020. About 7.6% of them regularly or occasionally use e-cigarettes. Schools report that vaping is increasingly prevalent among pupils; videos of people discussing vaping techniques on TikTok are hugely popular. Many vapes circulating in British schools were found to be illegal and untested, with some containing high levels of nickel, chromium and lead, which can affect the central nervous system and brain development. All this has raised concerns that companies seem to be marketing vapes to teenagers (who cannot legally buy them until they are 18), and that children are getting hooked on the nicotine contained in e-liquids, potentially storing up health problems and acting as a gateway to smoking.\n\nIs the market regulated?\n\nThe UK has a pretty laissez-faire regulatory framework for vaping compared with countries such as the US, but there are some restrictions in place. The sale of e-cigarettes to under-18s has been banned since 2015; and since 2016, they’ve been subject to strict limits on advertising. Nicotine levels in vapes are limited to 20mg/ml; some flavourings and ingredients, such as caffeine, are banned; and licensed disposable vapes are limited to 600 puffs. But many regulations go unenforced, and there is a thriving black market for stronger, longer-lasting vapes, particularly the disposable variety. Now there are growing calls for tougher regulation. Proposals currently being considered by ministers include tighter rules on packaging, marketing and flavourings to try to make vapes less appealing to children. A ban on disposable vapes is currently being considered in Scotland, but is not thought to be favoured by Downing Street.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhy the lack of concern?\n\nSmoking is the leading cause of preventable illness and death in the UK. And vaping has been a “phenomenally successful” tool for helping smokers quit, says Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh. Some 6.6 million people in Britain still smoke (13.3% of the population). But that’s much lower than it was a decade ago (20.2% of us smoked in 2011); and it’s also one of the lowest rates in Europe. Vaping, many public health experts say, has helped us reach this level (some point out that countries where smoking remains more prevalent, such as Spain, have lower levels of vaping). Bauld argues that other health challenges, such as childhood obesity, demand more attention. Nevertheless, while thelong-term effects of vaping are not yet clear, many urge caution. Besides, vaping is certainly an environmental issue: 138 million single-use vapes were sold in the UK last year, each containing a small lithium battery.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Uk", "Theunis Bates", "Harold Maass", "Mark Gimein"], "publish_date": "2023/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2024/02/05/marijuana-laws-texas-2024-legal-weed-medical-thc-cannabis-delta-8-delta-9/72436842007/", "title": "Marijuana in Texas: What you need to know about weed laws in 2024", "text": "In late January, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued to block the ordinances of five cities decriminalizing low-level marijuana possession. Those cities — Austin, Denton, Kellen, San Marcos and Elgin — each had voters approve policies that would end arrests and citations for possession of less than four ounces of marijuana.\n\nThere is often confusion about what the state laws say about marijuana and what laws are being argued. As we approach the unofficial stoner holiday 4/20, let's break it all down.\n\nCan marijuana be used recreationally in Texas?\n\nIn Texas and federal law, recreational use of marijuana is still illegal. Depending on how much a person is in possession of, the consequences vary.\n\nThe Texas Health and Safety Code states that possession of marijuana two ounces or less is considered a Class B misdemeanor.\n\nWill marijuana be legal in Texas in 2024?\n\nFor now, it’s unlikely. However, recent laws have taken place to decriminalize marijuana laws in the state.\n\nIn 2019, Gov. Greg Abbott signed House Bill 1325 into law. The law allows the production, manufacture, retail sale, and inspection of industrial hemp crops and products in Texas granted that they stay at 0.3% or less delta-9 THC level. This also includes products for consumable hemp products that contain cannabidiol (CBD), as well as other edible parts of the hemp plant.\n\nWhat’s the difference between THC and CBD?\n\nCannabidiol (CBD) is a substance derived from the cannabis plant that does not have the psychoactive properties that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) does. In other words, THC is what someone consumes to get “high” or intoxicated, while CBD does not possess the same chemicals.\n\nWhat is hemp?\n\nThe Texas Agriculture Code defines \"hemp\" as \"the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds of the plant and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of less than 0.3% on a dry weight basis.\"\n\nDelta-9 is a type of cannabis. It gets its name from the fact that it has 9 THC molecules. Delta-8 THC and delta-9 THC come from the cannabis sativa plant. Unlike CBD, delta-9 THC is psychoactive, which means it can make you feel high or intoxicated.\n\nDelta-8 carries a low amount of hemp (0.3%) and, therefore, is permitted under Chapter 443 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. According to the FDA, delta-8 has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; however, it is generally less potent than delta-9. Delta-8 was considered a scheduled one controlled substance but a temporary injunction filed in Travis County has removed the status.\n\nIs Delta-8 legal in Texas?For now — but confusion, frustration over state's 'clarification' abounds\n\nIs medical marijuana legal in Texas?\n\nKind of. Don’t think you’re about to be Willie Nelson, though.\n\nIn 2015, Texas passed the Compassionate-Use Act, which allowed the first legal use of low-THC cannabis products in the state for patients with intractable epilepsy. It was expanded in 2019 and 2021 to include other conditions.\n\nChapter 169 of the Texas Occupations Code states that patients suffering from the following are allowed to use low-THC cannabis products:\n\nepilepsy\n\nseizure disorders\n\nmultiple sclerosis\n\nspasticity\n\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\nautism\n\ncancer\n\npost-traumatic stress disorder\n\nan incurable neurodegenerative disease\n\nMedical marijuana is legal in Texas:Here’s how to get it", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/17/stevie-wonder-pet-cemetery-songwriter-jamboree-news-around-states/39487727/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A group of historic treasures has a new home, with five pieces by African American artists from the state joining the permanent collection of the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts. The works now on display in the gallery were acquired through a partnership with the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, a group dedicated to documenting, preserving and promoting African American artists of the South. One of the largest of the works is “Lost Americans,” a 2008 mixed media work by the late Thornton Dial Sr. of Emmelle. Dial’s works used many found objects, which he often found beside train tracks. Another new earthy piece is “Wheel at the Fairground,” from 1988 by the late Jimmy Lee Sudduth of Fayette. The artist came up with his own medium by combining clay and sugar and using that to paint pieces of plywood. The three other new pieces are quilts by the famous Gee’s Bend quilt makers of Wilcox County.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: Residents who burn wood, coal and oil for heat are facing new air pollution control measures. Draft rules made public by the state Tuesday are expected to result in additional bans on burning wood and coal in Fairbanks North Star Borough, as well as higher fuel oil and electric bills, The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports. New rules are required under the federal Clean Air Act. The deadline is the end of December, officials said. The Fairbanks area each winter is regularly out of compliance for fine particulate, a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets that can be inhaled deep in the lungs. Wood smoke contributes up to 80% of Fairbanks’ fine particle pollution. Residents burn wood as a cheaper alternative to fuel oil. The goal is to reduce smoke pollution in Fairbanks and North Pole by 5% annually with attainment expected in 10 years, officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The U.S. government plans on replacing barriers through 100 miles of the southern border in California and Arizona, including through a national monument and a wildlife refuge, according to documents and environmental advocates. The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday again waived environmental and dozens of other laws to build more barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. Barriers will go up at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a vast park named after the unique cactus breed that decorates it, and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, which is largely a designed wilderness home to 275 wildlife species. The government will also build new roads and lighting in those areas in Arizona. Environmental advocates who have sued to stop the construction of the wall say this latest plan will be detrimental to the wildlife and habitat in those areas.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Less than a week after the state’s first medical marijuana dispensaries officially opened their doors, patients who would rather eat their pot than smoke it will soon have their chance. Robert Lercher, a spokesman for BOLD Team, says the cultivator intends to have gummy chews, concentrates and vape cartridges available with the next harvest, with products hitting dispensary shelves by the end of next week. Voters approved a medical marijuana amendment in 2016. Only two dispensaries, both in Hot Springs, are licensed, and only one cultivator has harvested a crop, though two others expect to harvest their own this summer. As of Tuesday night, the two dispensaries, Doctor’s Orders RX and Green Springs Medical, had sold more than 26 pounds of the drug in its flower form and totaled sales of about $177,000.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A cafe is brewing up what it calls the world’s most expensive coffee – at $75 a cup. Klatch Coffee is serving the exclusive brew, the Elida Natural Geisha 803, at its branches in Southern California and San Francisco. The 803 in the coffee’s name refers to the record-breaking $803 per pound for which the organic beans sold at a recent auction after winning the Best of Panama coffee competition, says Bo Thiara, co-owner of the Klatch branch in San Francisco. He calls the annual competition the coffee world’s equivalent of the Oscars. Only 100 pounds of the beans were available for purchase, and most went to Japan, China and Taiwan, Thiara says. Klatch secured 10 pounds and is the only chain in North America to have it. Klatch describes the coffee as a rare variety of Arabica from Panama that has a floral, tea-like flavor with hints of jasmine and berries.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Officials say this year’s snowpack could recover the state’s hydrological system following last year’s drought. The Gazette reports federal data shows the snowpack in the state’s southwest corner at 19.5 inches, 220% of the median snowpack Tuesday. Colorado Climate Center climatologist Becky Bolinger says the state’s soil, reservoirs, rivers and streams could likely see recovery following the snow and cold that arrived in February and March. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hydrologist Greg Smith says the Upper Colorado River Basin is seeing encouraging conditions, and the Upper San Juan River Basin experienced its third wettest March on record this year. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about 15% of the state is abnormally dry, and less than 1% is in moderate drought.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The West Hartford Libraries has launched its year of happiness, offering a full year’s worth of special programming centered around the things that make people happy – like music, meditation, food, games and even homebrewed beer. “We wanted something that’s positive and all inclusive of ages,” says Carol Waxman, the children’s librarian at the Noah Webster Library, who will offer special programming like chocolate making to children. Also part of the year of happiness is the bolstering of a program called “Hunger Doesn’t Take a Vacation.” Through the summer program, in partnership with the Fern Street Food Ministry at the Universalist Church of West Hartford, the library offers backpacks full of food to children who during the school year would receive free lunches. The full list of happiness events can be found online.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Environmental groups are asking federal officials to take emergency action to protect a species of firefly unique to southern Delaware. In an emergency petition filed Wednesday with the Department of the Interior, environmentalists claim the Bethany Beach firefly is at immediate risk of extinction because of imminent destruction of a significant portion of its habitat. The filing comes partly in response to a planned residential development that would be accessible by a unique wooden cul-de-sac that has been built on pilings over one of the freshwater marshes where the firefly lives. Environmentalists say threats to the bug also include sea level rise, climate change and mosquito-control pesticides. The petition was filed by the Center for Biological Diversity and the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city is set to get its first official pet cemetery. News outlets report that people will be able to secure final resting places for their beloved pets at the historic Congressional Cemetery, where officials plan to open the Kingdom of Animals section next month. Cemetery President Paul Williams says the section will span about third of an acre at the 35-acre cemetery and will accept all pets, ranging from birds to alligators. The cemetery calls this an extension of its popular members-only dog walking group, whose volunteers have revived the grounds over the past two decades. The group costs about $235 per year and $50 per dog to join. Burial prices will range from $500 to $1,500.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: An audience member called 911 on an Egyptian-American comedian who made a joke about being of Middle Eastern descent. The complainant called police Sunday, one day after Ahmed Ahmed performed at the Off The Hook Comedy Club in Naples. Ahmed says he asked if anyone of Middle Eastern descent was in the audience. After a few people clapped, Ahmed replied, “Hey, it only takes one of us” followed by a pause and then “to tell a joke.” He added, “Seriously, lock the doors.” The caller told the 911 dispatcher that after audience members acknowledged being from the Middle East, Ahmed said, “That’s great. We could organize our own little terrorist organization.” He said that bothered him. Ahmed says he never said that. The club has rebooked Ahmed for next week.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Former President Jimmy Carter plans to teach Sunday school this weekend just days after undergoing surgery for a broken hip, a spokeswoman says. Carter, 94, was released from the hospital Thursday morning after getting a hip replacement. He plans to continue recuperating at his home in rural Plains, said a statement from Carter spokeswoman Deanna Congileo. Carter’s wife, Rosalynn Carter, went home with her husband after she was admitted to the hospital Wednesday for observation and testing after she “felt faint,” Congileo said. “Both President and Mrs. Carter extend their thanks to the many people who sent well wishes the past few days,” Congileo’s statement said. She said Carter plans to teach his regular Sunday school class this weekend at Marantha Baptist Church in Plains.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: An airport has opened a $340 million facility for car rental companies. The Kahului Airport Consolidated Rent-A-Car facility is the largest single public works project on Maui, The Maui News reports. The facility that opened Wednesday houses all major rental car companies in one spot and connects passengers with the airport via electric tram. The project took three years to complete, was environmentally friendly and created hundreds of local jobs, officials say. The project will help save energy costs, reduce waste and increase indoor air quality, the state Department of Transportation said. Democratic Gov. David Ige visited the site Tuesday and said the project was “funded with no taxpayer dollars involved.” Funding came from a state facility charge and a daily $4.50 payment by rental car customers, officials say.\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: A man has been ordered to pay $2,000 in restitution after damaging an archaeological site in Challis. U.S. Attorney Bart Davis announced this week that 38-year-old Alan Thorkelson of Challis pleaded guilty last month to digging at a Shoshone-Bannock tribal cultural site without authorization. The Devil Canyon Archaeological Site was being monitored because of previous issues with graffiti; court records say Thorkelson was caught digging at the site in October of 2017. U.S. District Judge David Nye ordered Thorkelson to pay the restitution during a sentencing hearing late last month. Mary D’Aversa with the Bureau of Land Management says looting archaeological sites like the one in Challis is especially harmful because they are significant to tribal communities.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new plan has been introduced that aims to end HIV in the state by the year 2030. Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the Illinois and Chicago public health departments, and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago introduced the Getting to Zero Illinois plan this week. It’s the results of nearly two years of planning that included town hall meetings, surveys, focus groups and community feedback from across the state. State officials say nearly 40,000 people were living with HIV in Illinois in 2017. The plan focuses on efforts including increasing HIV treatment access, allocating resources to communities with the greatest disparities and measuring progress through surveillance. The city of Chicago is providing $40 million toward the effort to 40 organizations, and the state is providing almost $26 million to 62 agencies.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library has reached its goal of raising $1.5million to acquire and begin renovations on a building to serve as its permanent home. The museum announced Wednesday that it met a deadline for the fundraising effort. The museum’s founder and CEO, Julia Whitehead, says it’s “a wonderful step forward,” and people “are recognizing that we have something very special here.” Whitehead said in March that the museum signed a purchase agreement for a building to display a new exhibition about Vonnegut’s book “Slaughterhouse-Five.” It will also display other exhibitions and the organization’s large collection of Vonnegut artifacts and memorabilia. The museum has been operating for eight years but is currently closed to the public. Vonnegut was born in Indianapolis. He died in 2007 at age 84.\n\nIowa\n\nOkoboji: This lake town now has a vodka named for it. Foundry Distilling Co. is launching the first brand in its Heritage Collection of spirits: Okoboji Vodka. It’s made from 100% corn with the majority grown in Iowa and will be available at retailers in the Lake Okoboji region this summer. “This is special for me as my dad grew up about 10 miles away from Okoboji in Lake Park,” says Scott Bush, founder of Foundry Distilling Co. “We used to go up to Okoboji as kids to see Grandpa and Grandma Bush, and those are memories I will always cherish.” Bush hopes Okoboji Vodka will strike a chord with others who have strong sentimental ties to that region of Iowa. Foundry Distilling Co. was founded in 2018 and has developed two unique offerings: the Private Barrel Program and the Brewer/Distiller Alliance.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Despite an increase in state funding for higher education, four of the state’s six major universities are asking for tuition increases for next year. During a meeting Wednesday, some members of the Kansas Board of Regents expressed frustration with the university administrators for seeking increases. The Wichita Eagle reports the board will vote on the proposals in June, and it is unclear if there are enough votes to approve them. University officials said the proposed increases would be the smallest in decades. The University of Kansas and Wichita State are asking for a 1% increase for Kansas residents. Emporia State requested a 2.5% increase, and Kansas State is seeking a 3.1% hike. Pittsburg State and Fort Hays State did not ask for higher tuition.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city is suspending paper recycling due to “changes in the global marketplace” for recycled materials. City officials say there is an overabundance of material in domestic markets, and Lexington’s recycling center cannot store the paper long term. Residents are being told to put office paper, newspaper, magazines, cereal boxes, paper towel rolls and similar products in the trash. Residents can continue to recycle corrugated cardboard, like moving and shipping boxes. Nancy Albright, Lexington’s Commissioner of Environmental Quality and Public Works, says the city is seeking new recycling outlets for paper. She says at least three new nearby mills are expected to begin receiving materials by late fall. A city news release says recycling markets across the country are under strain due to increased standards in China.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: The city’s downtown will be alive Memorial Day weekend with South Louisiana Songwriters Festival, the only songwriter jamboree in the United States. The SOLO event is a seminar and presentation mash-up May 21-26. Songwriters collaborate in small groups for four days, starting Tuesday. Nick Lowe, known for the pop hit “Cruel to Be Kind,” will kick off the festivities Wednesday night with a show at Warehouse 535. On Thursday kids from local schools, who have been participating in their own version of the workshop, will perform Songs Over Style and the School Program Showcase. By Friday evening the top 12 workshop songs are presented at the Methodist Church downtown. Saturday and Sunday are the true festival days, with five stages total between Blue Moon Saloon and Warehouse 535.\n\nMaine\n\nYork: It was the vision and legacy of the late art patron Mary Leigh Smart and artist Beverly Hallam to create an artist’s residency at their 44-acre oceanfront property. Today that vision is ever closer to reality, with interviews underway for the inaugural residents who will arrive in York this fall. The Surf Point Foundation was created by Smart and Hallam in 1988 so that upon their deaths their duplex home, a second house called Wild Knoll where author and poet May Sarton once lived, and the surrounding property would be transformed into a residency for artists, art historians, architects, critics and designers. For the residents, Executive Director Yael Reinharz says that “special attention will be given to women and people of color. And we also want to place a priority on people who have a connection to Maine.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island: The island has a new member in its wild horse herd, officials announced Wednesday. Mother N2BHS-A, also known as “Gokey GoGo Bones,” gave birth to a chestnut filly Saturday morning, according to a news release from the National Park Service. The new foal, N2BHS-AR, and band live most of the year in the very busy developed area and campgrounds. For this reason, the National Park Service expressly reminds visitors that it is essential to remain a minimum of a bus length, or about 40 feet, away from the wild horses at all times, officials said. “Everything is new to a foal,” the park service said in a release. “N2BHS-AR will learn how to interact with the environment from her mother and other members of her band.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNewburyport: A 71-year-old man has embarked on a 3,600-mile, coast-to-coast walk to draw attention to the plight of military veterans. William Shuttleworth departed his hometown of Newburyport on Wednesday for what he estimates will be a 7 1/ 2 -month trek to Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc, California. He plans to talk to veterans along the way and raise public awareness about the health care, housing and economic issues that many face. The Air Force veteran tells The Daily News of Newburyport he was inspired while working last year at a California park where many veterans were camping because they were homeless and struggling with addiction. He has mapped his route and plans to walk about 25 miles per day. He intends to camp because he hasn’t reserved overnight accommodations.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A massive portrait of Stevie Wonder will be the latest addition to the downtown skyline. Measuring roughly 100 feet tall, the new mural of the iconic Motown singer is being painted by London-based artist Richard Wilson, who was busy this week finishing details of Wonder’s face and neck. The musician turned 69 on Monday. The portrait on the side of the Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts spans roughly 8,000 square feet and is large enough to be seen by an airplane passing overhead. “For me, he’s the greatest living singer, songwriter and musician,” Wilson says. “In 300 years, I’m sure he’ll be looked (at) as a Beethoven, Mozart, Bach – that kind of epic influence on humanity.” Wilson flew himself to Detroit earlier this month to start the project on his own dime. He conservatively estimates the entire mural will cost “at least $10,000” and take another two weeks or so to complete.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The federal Bureau of Land Management on Wednesday renewed mineral rights leases for a proposed Twin Metals copper-nickel mine in the state’s northeast, a project that environmentalists fear would spoil the pristine Boundary Waters Canoe Area. The leases cover land in the Superior National Forest that encompasses vast reserves of copper, nickel and precious metals. According to Twin Metals Minnesota, the renewed leases add new conditions, including higher annual royalty payments, project milestones and additional environmental requirements. Environmental groups are fighting the project, fearing effects on the nearby Boundary Waters Canoe Area, the country’s most-visited wilderness. Nine area companies who contend the project would hurt their business are suing in federal court to block the leases.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A new local law will ban the state’s largest city from asking people about their salary history when they apply for municipal government jobs. The Jackson City Council approved the ordinance Tuesday, and it takes effect June 14. Council members and Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba say the law is intended to alleviate the problem of women being paid less than men for the same jobs. It applies only to city government jobs, not to jobs in the private sector. The National Conference of State Legislatures says Mississippi and Alabama are the only states without laws requiring equal pay for equal work, though one is working its way through the Alabama Legislature. Councilman De’Keither Stamps wrote the Jackson law and says he hopes other cities, counties and school districts in Mississippi will adopt similar ones.\n\nMissouri\n\nEugene: The first section of a new biking and hiking trail created on an abandoned rail line has opened in the Kansas City area. A ribbon-cutting ceremony that’s planned for June 1 for the Rock Island Trail will make it official. The 6.4-mile section of trail stretches from southern Kansas City to the nearby suburb of Lee’s Summit. Advocates say that when another stretch is completed, it will attract thousands of hikers and cyclists and spur new development. Eventually, the county hopes to connect the trail to the 240-mile Katy Trial. Highlights of the new stretch of trail include a section that passes through the 453-foot-long Vale Tunnel, which was completed in 1904. Trains stopped using the rail line in the early 1980s.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Missoula City-County Health Department officials say the number of cases of whooping cough in the area has topped 100, including many people who have been vaccinated. Department Director Ellen Leahy says protection from the vaccine wanes over time. Vaccines against whooping cough, or pertussis, are given as a series between 2 months and 18 months of age and another around age 5. A booster is given to preteens. The Centers for Disease Control says women should get a booster during the third trimester of each pregnancy. Missoula County had confirmed 103 cases of whooping cough through Tuesday and was hiring more nurses to help with testing. Leahy told KGVO-AM that 975 tests have been submitted, and another 58 were pending at the state lab.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State lawmakers have kicked off a debate on a proposal to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes as activists push a much broader ballot measure that would place the issue before voters next year. Supporters argued Wednesday that the legislative bill is narrowly tailored, with restrictions on how much users can possess and a ban on marijuana smoking. Senators who oppose the measure say the drug is still illegal at the federal level and argue that its benefits and dangers haven’t been fully studied. The sponsor, Sen. Anna Wishart, of Lincoln, says the bill is intended to address the concerns of many groups. Legalization supporters are circulating petitions to place the issue before voters on the November 2020 ballot, where it’s likely to pass.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The governor has signed a bill that prevents insurers from denying coverage to patients due to a pre-existing condition. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said at a bill signing Wednesday that the measure ensures that health care protection even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down at the federal level. He also signed a bill to address “surprise” medical billing and said the practice can saddle a patient with a five-figure bill. He said the legislation aims to prevent an out-of-network provider who gives emergency medical care from overcharging a person. Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson praised the bill and said the measure makes sure that patients are cared for.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nCanaan: A school cafeteria worker says she lost her job after giving a student lunch for free. Bonnie Kimball tells the Valley News she was fired March 28 by her employer, a vendor that supplies food to the Mascoma Valley Regional High School in Canaan. She told the student she followed what a boss had told her. She says she told the student quietly, “Tell (your) mom you need money.” A day later, she says, she was terminated. A spokeswoman for Manchester-based Cafe Services said in a statement Thursday that it “would never authorize an employee to not feed a student or staff member a meal.” But the spokeswoman said Cafe Services can’t discuss confidential details regarding a worker’s employment or termination. The district school board voted Tuesday to continue using the company.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The fear of poachers stealing oysters from polluted waters and making consumers sick has long thwarted efforts to grow the shellfish in dirty water in the state, despite the potential to help improve water quality. But a proposed remedy could actually make matters worse by removing state oversight, possibly causing the very illnesses state regulators have long feared. A bill pending in the Legislature would allow oyster colonies to be planted in polluted waters for research, water quality improvement or shoreline stabilization purposes. But it also would block the state Department of Environmental Protection from regulating the patches, which even the most ardent supporters in the environmental community agree would be going too far. Lawmakers agreed Thursday to send the bill back for amendments.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Now in its third year, the Las Cruces UkeFest is bringing top-notch instructors and performers to town this weekend, as well as ukulele players from across the country. This year’s festival, running Friday through Sunday, features well-known performers Victoria Vox, Kevin Carroll, Abe Lagrimas, Jr. and The Quiet American, Aaron and Nicole Keim. The festival kicks off with a concert at the New Mexico State University Atkinson Recital Hall at 7 p.m. Friday. The concert will begin with a couple of songs performed by the host club, the Las Cruces Ukes, and then the professionals will take the stage. For non-players, concert tickets are available separately for only $10, with children ages 12 and under admitted free with a paying adult. Events Saturday and Sunday include workshops, a prize drawing and an evening jam session. Registration for the full festival is $135, or $75 for full-time students with ID.\n\nNew York\n\nBeacon: The sloop Clearwater is celebrating 50 years of sailing on the Hudson River. Clearwater’s founders and crew members will gather with public officials along the Hudson in Beacon on Friday to mark the anniversary of the sloop’s launch May 17, 1969. They will hold an on-board christening ceremony. Folk singer Pete Seeger and like-minded environmentalists wanted the ship to be a symbol of the river and a sort of floating classroom. It was built to look like the Dutch sloops that used to carry food and other supplies up and down the Hudson River.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: The police department has honored a college student who was killed when a gunman opened fire inside a classroom. News outlets report the family of UNC Charlotte student Riley Howell was awarded the Civilian Medal of Valor posthumously Wednesday from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. Howell’s parents, siblings and girlfriend accepted the award on his behalf and received a standing ovation. Howell, 21, was shot while tackling the shooter who is accused of killing him. Howell’s move is credited with saving lives. Also killed in the April 30 attack was 19-year-old student Ellis R. Parlier. Four other students were wounded. Police charged Trystan Andrew Terrell, 22, with two counts of first-degree murder, four counts of first-degree attempted murder and other offenses in the shooting.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Regulators say the state’s oil production remained at a near-record level in March. The Department of Mineral Resources says the state produced an average of 1.39 million barrels of oil daily in March. That was down from a record 1.4 million barrels a day from the record set in January. North Dakota also produced a record 2.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day in March, up from 2.6 billion cubic feet in February. There were 15,353 wells producing in March. That’s down 56 wells from the record set in January. The March tallies are the latest figures available. There were 65 drill rigs operating in North Dakota on Wednesday, down one from the March average.\n\nOhio\n\nNewark: A country club plans to appeal an order that it sell back a lease to the state historical agency to provide public access to ancient burial mounds. Licking County Judge David Branstool recently ruled that the Ohio History Connection can reclaim the 2,000-year-old Octagon Mounds from Moundbuilders Country Club if it can afford to pay the price a jury will set in September. The agency sued the club last year to buy back its lease with Moundbuilders. The U.S. Interior Department has said it won’t nominate Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, which includes Octagon Mounds, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site unless the course is removed. The president of the club’s trustee board says the club is willing to move elsewhere if it’s paid fairly.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Authorities say falling debris is still a danger after a skyscraper was damaged when it was battered by a dangling scaffold holding two men. Police blocked some roads and a park to most vehicle and pedestrian traffic Thursday, a day after two window washers were rescued from the scaffold above the nearly 850-foot Devon Tower. Both men refused treatment after they were brought to safety. It’s unclear what caused the scaffold to hit the building, shattering windows and dropping glass. The cause of the accident is under investigation. Firefighters secured the scaffold with ropes as it hung from a crane 20 to 30 feet above the roof. The tower houses corporate offices for Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corp.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Lawmakers have approved the largest statewide expansion of the federal free lunch program, ensuring all students living up to three times above the poverty line will have access to free meals. It’s the first time a state has offered to completely take on school meal costs, which can often run tens of thousands of dollars for individual school districts. The move is expected to provide hundreds of thousands of students with free breakfast and lunch. About 1 in 7 Oregon households is “food insecure,” according to the Oregon Center for Public Policy, meaning that families have trouble putting food on the table and often don’t know where they’ll get their next meal. At least 174,000 children have limited access to food, more than the population of Oregon’s second-largest city, Eugene.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrison City: A school district is defending itself after video surfaced of a safety drill that had a teacher posing as a shooter and donning what appeared to be a Middle Eastern headdress. The video appears to show the actor wearing a kaffiyeh. The Penn-Trafford School District says organizers didn’t intend to portray the shooter as Arab or Muslim at the January training. The district says volunteers were provided costumes by a consultant group, and there was no intent to represent any particular culture or religion. The statement said the person portraying the shooter also wore a long blond wig and a paintball mask. The Islamic Center of Pittsburgh says that “to stereotype the shooter is appalling given the data on active shooters and the recent shootings at the Tree of Life and Christ Church.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Despite millions in overspending by some agencies, the state is projected to end the budget year with a $24 million surplus, according to a report issued Wednesday by state budget officer Tom Mullaney. The fiscal year ends June 30. WPRI-TV reports Mullaney predicted last fall that the state was headed for a $42 million deficit. State agencies are still overspending, but numbers have improved. Mullaney says agencies are on track to overspend by about $16 million, down from $51 million last fall. Most of the agency deficits are in social services. Top Democrats in the state House are currently in negotiations over the next budget. Legislators have been holding hearings on Gov. Gina Raimondo’s nearly $10 billion budget proposal since it was introduced in January.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nRock Hill: The Catawba Indian Nation is bringing back the Yap Ye Iswa, or Day of the Catawba, festival after a 12-year hiatus. The free festival is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at the Catawba Cultural Center. The festival dates back to 1990 as a way to connect the tribal and non-tribal communities with the Catawba Indian Nation. Festivalgoers will get a taste of the tribe’s culture through performances by drummers and dancers to authentic Catawba songs. There also will be traditional art by Catawba artisans, pottery and beadwork demonstrations, and traditional Native American food. The Herald reports the Catawba Indian Nation is the only federally recognized tribe in South Carolina. Its reservation sits on about 700 acres east of Rock Hill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Attorneys for oil pipeline opponents are fighting an attempt by a sheriff to be dismissed from a lawsuit challenging new state laws that aim to prevent disruptive demonstrations against the Keystone XL pipeline. They say in a Tuesday court filing that Pennington County Sheriff Kevin Thom should remain a defendant in the suit spearheaded by the American Civil Liberties Union because he’ll be enforcing law that amounts to an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. Thom’s attorneys say he must enforce state laws but isn’t responsible for defending them. Plaintiffs’ attorneys counter that Thom must use personal discretion in enforcing the laws, effectively making him a policymaker.\n\nTennessee\n\nMurfreesboro: An elementary school will no longer have a student portray Adolf Hitler in its living history exhibit after a group of students began giving Nazi salutes. James Evans, a spokesman for the Rutherford County school district, said in an email that the student portraying Hitler was supposed to give a speech and a Nazi salute. Evans said other students started giving the salute as well, both in and out of rehearsals. The issue became public when Middle Tennessee State University professor Keith Gamble tweeted that his daughter was sent to the principal’s office for yelling at the other children to stop. Evans said the girl was taken to the office because she would not calm down. He said the district does not condone “hate-filled or insensitive” actions or symbols.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The ex-owner of a tiger rescued from a filthy cage in an abandoned house has been charged with animal cruelty. Houston police arrested 24-year-old Brittany Garza on Wednesday on the misdemeanor count involving a non-livestock animal. She’s free on $100 bond. An attorney for Garza, Jay Cohen, declined comment Thursday. The Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch in Murchison has cared for the 350-pound tiger since it was found in February by people entering the house to smoke marijuana. A judge ruled in April that the sanctuary, 70 miles southeast of Dallas, can keep the tiger and that Garza must pay nearly $12,000 for the animal’s care. The shelter is doing an online poll to name the tiger. The choices are Ezekiel, George, Loki or Navi.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: Wildlife officials have released into a northern Utah reservoir thousands of tiger muskie fish, a hybrid predator that’s popular with anglers and helps keep other species in check. The Standard Examiner reports the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources recently released 28,000 of the fish at Pineview Reservoir. Assistant aquatic program manager Cody Edwards says less than 10% of the fish will make it to adulthood. The fish are released when they’re 2 inches long, but they can grow over 30 inches in length. A cross between a northern pike and muskellunge, tiger muskies have been stocked there since at least the 1990s. They’re sterile fish introduced as a top-level predator to keep the population of other species in check and prevent big booms and busts in the ecosystem.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: At least three people have been arrested after a group of climate protesters disrupted a session of the state House of Representatives. The House was in session Thursday when protesters began to shout climate slogans and throw leaflets onto the floor from the visitors’ gallery. Democratic House speaker Mitzi Johnson tried to restore the session but adjourned and closed the House chamber after the protesters refused to be silenced. The protesters say they wanted the Legislature to do more to combat climate change. After most of the protesters had left, three people remained. They were arrested and escorted from the chamber after they refused repeated orders from capital police to leave.\n\nVirginia\n\nArlington: A state panel has unanimously approved a request from Arlington County to rename a highway that currently honors Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The Commonwealth Transportation Board voted unanimously Wednesday to change the name of U.S. Route 1 in northern Virginia from Jefferson Davis Highway to Richmond Highway. Arlington County requested the change last month, and Gov. Ralph Northam supported the change. The road is already called Richmond Highway in Fairfax County and Alexandria. The county estimates it will have to spend $17,000 to pay for new street signs. County officials say the changes will be implemented by Oct. 1. The board meeting Wednesday took place at a hotel located on Jefferson Davis Highway.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A trio of Seattle companies, including two of the city’s hospitals, have announced $15 million in donations for projects aimed at the homeless. The money will help fund three projects geared toward helping the chronically homeless, who experts say make up a limited proportion of the homeless overall but can be among the most difficult to reach. The funds will pay for a relatively small portion of three buildings slated to create about 290 units of housing that include on-site staffing to help residents stay connected to services. Swedish Health Services, Providence St. Joseph Health and Premera Blue Cross each donated $5 million. Representatives of Plymouth Housing, the group behind the projects, did not make a total budget available for the projects but said the first of the three is slated to cost about $34 million.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State health officials and Boy Scout leaders say they’re preparing for the possibility that some children may bring measles to the World Scout Jamboree this summer. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports officials are encouraging measles vaccinations for the 45,000 Scouts and leaders expected to travel across the world and country to attend. The state hasn’t had a confirmed measles case since 2009. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 23 states had 839 total confirmed measles cases as of May 10. The preventable disease was declared eliminated in 2000. The CDC says this is the greatest number of measles cases the country has seen since 1994. Scout leaders say seemingly sick individuals will be examined before event admittance, and an outbreak would lead to a quarantine.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: “Evicted,” an immersive exhibit based on Matthew Desmond’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book about low-income evictions in the city, is coming to the near west side in June. It will be on view June 21 through Sept. 30 at the Mobile Design Box. Admission will be free. Milwaukee will be the first stop on a national tour for the traveling version of the “Evicted” exhibit, which the National Building Museum in Washington created and has been showing for more than a year. Bringing “Evicted” here highlights an issue that affects not just cities but suburban and rural areas, too, said Keith Stanley, executive director of Near West Side Partners, a nonprofit organization that’s hosting the exhibit. Desmond studied the relationship between eviction and poverty in Milwaukee for nearly a decade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Filters installed on storm drains in the state’s largest city will attempt to keep trash out of a creek. Crews have installed 12 water filtration units called “Gutter Bins” on storm drains in downtown Cheyenne. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports the Laramie County Conservation District, local Rotary clubs and Casper-based Frog Creek Partners took part in the project. Brian Deurloo with environmental technology company Frog Creek Partners estimates 40 million cigarette butts litter Cheyenne annually. He estimates about a million pounds of pollution wash into Crow Creek each year. Each filtration unit costs about $700. Conservation district staff and Rotary volunteers will maintain the bins for the first couple of years.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/06/29/cigarettes-spark-taiwan-fire/29453331/", "title": "Cigarettes or spark suspected in Taiwan water park fire", "text": "Ralph Jennings\n\nAssociated Press\n\nTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Investigators in Taiwan were focusing Monday on the possibility that a cigarette butt or spark caused the blaze that burned more than 500 people at a weekend water park party when colored powder sprayed from the stage caught fire.\n\nMore than 400 people remained hospitalized, 200 in serious condition, city officials said. Taiwan's Central News Agency reported one death: a 20-year-old with burns to 90 percent of her body who was taken off life support with her family's consent.\n\nPolice recommended criminal charges against the organizer of Saturday's party, as well as two technicians, at the Formosa Fun Coast theme park in suburban Taipei.\n\n\"It's still not clear what happened, but there were a number of people smoking and the weather was warm,\" New Taipei City news department head Lin Chieh-yu said. Temperatures around greater Taipei topped 36 degrees Celsius (96.8F) before the party.\n\nThe three tons of colored starch-based powder bought by the organizers from Tai Won, a seller in the island's southern county of Yunlin, were flammable, said Chou Hui-fang, a representative of the seller. She said the buyer was informed about the risk of fire.\n\n\"Whether it's corn starch or flour starch, this kind of stuff, no matter how long it's been around, if it's in dense quantities and if it's hot, it can catch fire,\" Chou said. She said her 4-year-old company has been questioned by police and health officials but was not considered at fault.\n\n\"We didn't know what the buyers were going to do with it or how much they would use,\" she said. \"It might have been supplies for a whole year.\"\n\nTaiwan Premier Mao Chi-kuo on Sunday banned use of the powder at future private events. Colored powder is often thrown on revelers during the annual Holi celebrations in India and Nepal, a Hindu festival. The powder at Saturday's party was made in Taiwan, Chou said.\n\nThe water park was ordered to close after the fire.\n\nTaiwan police recommended charges of professional neglect and public endangerment for party organizer Lu Chung-chi, who was arrested but released on bail of 1 million Taiwan dollars (US$32,000) bail and restricted from leaving the island, a New Taipei City police spokesman said.\n\nLocal media photos showed Lu kneeling on the ground to apologize, pledging to take full responsibility.\n\nPolice also recommended charges for the stage hardware technician and the person responsible for shooting off the powder. Each was given bail of 300,000 Taiwan dollars. Officers questioned another two involved in the event but did not recommend charges, said Yan Bo-jen, news liaison with the Luzhou Precinct of New Taipei City Police Department.\n\nProsecutors have also seized the assets of the water park and of the party organizers, the city news official said.\n\nThe powder ignited along the ground, mainly burning people's lower bodies, said Wang Wei-sheng, a liaison with the New Taipei City fire department command center.\n\nTaiwan university student Liang Sheng-kai said flaming powder hit his legs, apparently catching fire after it was sprayed from a concert stage into the front row where he was standing.\n\nWith the park's water features several hundred meters (yards) away, too far to douse the fire or ease burns, people screamed and panicked to find exits as balls of fire surged from the ground, he said.

In addition to more than a hundred trailers currently on base, Maxwell also received helicopters from Naval Air Station Jacksonville that evacuated in advance of the storm. Maxwell has provided a staging location for supplies and response teams during Hurricanes Irma, Florence and Michael in 2017 and 2018.\n\nAlaska\n\nKvwethluk: The community is partnering with an electric utility to build a battery storage system to be utilized during power outages. Alaska’s Energy Desk reported Tuesday that the project involving Kwethluk and the Nuvista Light and Electric Cooperative could help end the small city’s reliance on diesel fuel. Officials said Kwethluk and the electric cooperative received $477,050 from the U.S. Department of Energy to build a 675 kilowatt-hour, lithium-ion battery. Officials said Kwethluk was required to match 50% of the funds. Officials said a battery of that size could light every home for an hour during peak demand or maintain crucial buildings for more than two hours. Kwethluk is a largely Yupik community with more than 700 residents who live a subsistence lifestyle east of Bethel on the Kwethluk River.\n\nArizona\n\nTonopah: Authorities said strong winds during a rainstorm blew over six big rigs on Interstate 10 in southwestern Arizona, killing one driver and injuring another. Officials said the wrecks involving tractors pulling box trailers occurred Wednesday and that traffic soon was able to get around the wrecks by driving on the shoulder or an unaffected traffic lane. The state Department of Public Safety said the wrecks occurred on both sides of the freeway about 60 miles west of Phoenix and that all affected lanes were cleared by 5 a.m. Thursday. The DPS said the driver who was killed was 69-year-old Ronald Dale Huff of Salem, Oregon. The National Weather Service said preliminary data indicated that winds in the area were in the range of 30 to 40 mph.\n\nArkansas\n\nJonesboro: A parent-led booster club supporting an Arkansas school district that was the site of a 1998 shooting is drawing criticism for its plans to auction off an AR-15 rifle. The fundraiser is to help the Westside High School band can go to Florida for a performance. In 1998, four students and one teacher were killed when two students, then ages 11 and 13, opened fire at Westside Middle School near Jonesboro. One shooter, Andrew Golden, changed his name to Drew Grant and died in a car crash earlier this summer. Booster club president, Stacy Walz told The Jonesboro Sun that she understands the criticism but said the district is filled with gun enthusiasts who support the fundraiser. The district’s superintendent said the auction is not a school-sponsored fundraiser.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California on Wednesday became the first state to ban commercial fur trapping, ending the practice nearly 200 years after animals like beavers and otters introduced the American West to international trade. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said he signed a bill into law making it illegal to trap animals for the purposes of recreation or to sell their fur. It is still legal to trap animals for other purposes, including pest control and public health. California licenses for fur trappers have declined considerably. In 2018, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said it sold 133 licenses, leading to the harvest of 1,568 animals and the sale of 1,241 pelts. A legislative analysis of the bill noted most furs are sold outside of California, with data suggesting there have been no fur sales in the state for the past three years. Meanwhile, the state has issued about 500 trapping licenses a year for pest control and other uses. People who trap animals for those purposes are not required to report how many animals they capture.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The firing of a doctor who wanted to prescribe life-ending drugs to a man suffering from incurable cancer has touched off a legal fight testing the state’s medically assisted suicide law. Centura Health, a Christian-affiliated health system in Colorado and Kansas, fired Dr. Barbara Morris last week after she and her patient, 64-year-old Neil Mahoney, tried to get a state court to weigh in on whether the organization could stop her from helping Mahoney. Centura then had the case moved to federal court, where it is challenging whether Colorado’s law violates its religious freedom and its right to discipline employees on religious grounds. Colorado is one of nine states that will allow terminally ill patients to seek life-ending drugs by the end of the year. Colorado’s law, passed by voters in 2016, allows people with a prognosis of six months or less to live to request the drugs from their doctor to administer to themselves when and if they chose. Doctors can choose whether to participate. Centura and other hospitals have said they can opt out of the law, too.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Ten states and nearly two dozen members of Congress are joining the National Rifle Association in supporting gun-maker Remington Arms as it fights a Connecticut court ruling involving the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Officials in the 10 conservative states, 22 House Republicans and the NRA are among groups that filed briefs with the U.S. Supreme Court this week asking justices to overturn the ruling. Remington, based in Madison, North Carolina, made the Bushmaster rifle that was used to kill 20 first-graders and six educators at the school in 2012. The state Supreme Court ruled in March that a survivor and relatives of nine victims could sue Remington over how it marketed the rifle. Remington and its supporters said the lawsuit is barred by a 2005 law that shields gun-makers from liability.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark:A man who said he was called slurs and beaten at a University of Delaware fraternity party is suing four men and two fraternities. The Delaware News Journal reported Wednesday that Rancel Valdez filed a personal injury lawsuit against Adam Taylor, Nicholas Poluch, Matthew Vincenti and Daniel Weimar, along with two fraternity chapters that reportedly hosted the event. Valdez said the men used derogatory remarks referring to his sexuality and told him to leave their outdoor party in 2018. The suit also accused the men of putting him into a headlock and beating him, leaving him with broken bones. The newspaper reported the men have pleaded guilty to third-degree assault. It’s unclear if they have attorneys who can comment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Officials said city public safety agencies will be updating policies regarding building code violations after a fire at an unlicensed rental that killed two tenants, including a 9-year-old. Police Chief Peter Newsham issued an executive order Tuesday that said the agencies and Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs are developing new protocols for reporting and responding to potential fire code violations. In the interim, news outlets report the executive order requires officers to immediately notify a supervisor, who must then respond to the scene and notify the fire department. The officer must then report the possible violations to the regulatory agency. An officer previously warned the city about the unlicensed row house that caught fire last month, but authorities didn’t fully investigate the officer’s complaint.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: Hurricane Dorian’s pounding of Florida’s eastern seashore has eroded beaches and exposed clusters of sea turtle eggs. But not to worry, said the Sea Turtle Preservation Society. Beachgoers who come across turtle eggs should not be too concerned by the exposed eggs. In fact, the group told Florida Today that it’s a “banner year” for turtle nests. The group’s chairman, Roger Pszonowsky, said there’s not much to be done because it’s all part of nature’s cycle. Pszonowsky also said there haven’t been widespread reports of sargassum seaweed on beaches. That’s a good sign because too much of the seaweed after a storm isn’t good for baby turtles. The tiny turtles that manage to make it out to see sometimes get swept back onto beaches by clinging onto the seaweed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: The dog area of an animal shelter is under quarantine after three puppies tested positive for the highly contagious canine parvovirus. News outlets reported Athens-Clarke County Animal Shelter announced Wednesday that the area will be quarantined until Sept. 16. The shelter said several seemingly healthy puppies arrived last week, but by Saturday, one of the puppies became seriously ill and the other two appeared ill. They said the puppies tested positive for parvo and were euthanized after their illness worsened. The shelter said the remaining dogs were vaccinated and are at low risk of infection. The cat area briefly closed in July after some kittens were infected by panleukopenia, which is deadly to unvaccinated felines. Workers euthanized 31 cats. A subsequent test showed negative results for one kitten.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Firefighters and lifeguards were required to assist more than 350 swimmers because of strong currents at an annual event. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday that 29 firefighters assisted swimmers in distress during the 50th annual Waikiki Roughwater Swim. No fatalities or injuries were reported. A Honolulu Emergency Services Department spokesman said a change in tide caused the trouble in the event. Officials said the race started with about 1,000 swimmers before large numbers required assistance returning to shore. Many participants were plucked from the water behind the point where the race started. The fire department’s helicopter conducted searches for swimmers in distress. Ocean safety personnel used two personal watercraft vehicles to bring swimmers to shore. Lifeguards hired by race organizers and others also assisted distressed swimmers.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: Wildlife officials said the number of sockeye salmon returning to Idaho this year is extremely low. Nampa television station KIVI reported the Idaho Department of Fish and Game has only captured 17 sockeye in their trap near Stanley in central Idaho, and only 81 sockeye have made it past the Lower Granite Dam on their migration to Idaho. The critically endangered fish travel to the Pacific Ocean before returning to the Redfish Lake region to spawn. This year’s sockeye return was hit especially hard because of a low survival rate of the hatchery fish released in 2017. Those sockeye were raised in the hard water of an eastern Idaho hatchery, and when they were released into the soft water of central Idaho, more than 80% perished. Now biologists are holding juvenile sockeye in the medium-hard water at Sawtooth Hatchery before releasing them into the wild.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Schools in Illinois are receiving emergency materials to stop victim bleeding in case of serious accident or incident. The Illinois Terrorism Task Force announced Wednesday that it distributed more than 7,000 Stop the Bleed kits after a recommendation from the School Safety Working Group. Stop the Bleed is a national campaign by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to train and equip bystanders to control severe bleeding before professional responders arrive. Alicia Tate-Nadeau, director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, said government’s top priority is preventing violence but “we must also be prepared for worst-case scenarios.” Each kit contains a professional tourniquet, gauze and dressing, nitrile gloves, shears and more. School districts have been asked to train five adults in bleeding control.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette:Police are investigating after two headstones were apparently removed from a rural cemetery. Sand Ridge Cemetery’s caretaker reported the missing headstones Tuesday, telling Tippecanoe County Sheriff’s deputies the stones had been removed from their concrete bases. The Journal & Courier reported that the caretaker told deputies he last mowed the graveyard just southwest of West Lafayette about three weeks ago and didn’t recall anything out of place at that time. Both of the missing headstones were engraved with the same family name. Deputies said the cemetery’s trustee would be contacting that family to alert them that their deceased relatives’ headstones are missing.\n\nIowa\n\nGreenfield:Authorities said a pilot suffered minor injuries when his airplane crashed in a cornfield. The Adair County Sheriff’s Office said a 911 caller reported around 7:10 a.m. Wednesday that a man had walked to the caller’s home and said the small plane he had been flying had gone down nearby. First responders found the single-engine plane lying on its top in the field about a mile northwest of Greenfield. The pilot was taken to a hospital and soon released. He has been identified as 59-year-old Eric Chrystal, of Jefferson. The crash cause is being investigated.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Hundreds of superstar hopefuls have auditioned in Wichita to appear on the television show “American Idol.” The Wichita Eagle reported that the stop Wednesday in Wichita was the show’s first scouting visit to the city since it started 17 years ago. Among those in line were hopefuls such as Zephaniah Moore, an aspiring R&B singer who polled friends and family on Facebook about whether he should audition for “Idol.” They said he should. Also in line was Sharane Calister, a 26-year-old singer from Des Moines, Iowa, who in the spring of 2018 placed 11th on another singing competition, NBC’s “The Voice.” Those given the green light in Wichita will have to overcome several more rounds before they get a chance to sing in front of the celebrity judges.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:African elephant Mikki, 33, debuted her bull calf to the community Wednesday morning at the Louisville Zoo after weeks of off-exhibit bonding. The calf doesn’t yet have a name, but the zoo officials said a naming contest will be announced soon and the public will be able to help give the 300-pound infant his identity. Mikki’s baby is only the second elephant baby born at the Louisville Zoo in its 50 years and his birthmarks a considerable contribution to his species’ gene pool. Mikki gave birth on Aug 2 after a 22-month gestation period. The zoo first announced her pregnancy, which was achieved through artificial insemination, in March 2018. The baby is the Louisville Zoo’s third elephant, joining mom Mikki and Asian elephant, Punch, 49, who is not reproductive. Mikki’s first baby, Scotty, was born in March 2007 and died from complications of colic, a common ailment for elephants and horses. Mikki, who lost around 1,000 pounds when she gave birth, is working her way back up to 9,000 pounds by eating lots of hay. The bull calf is nursing a lot, Taylor said, and sometimes drinks between two and three gallons at a time.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards has been discharged from the hospital after an overnight stay. A spokesman for Edwards, 92, said he was discharged Wednesday night from Our Lady of the Lake Medical Center in Baton Rouge. Edwards was hospitalized Tuesday. His daughter said he had suffered a drop in blood sugar after becoming dehydrated. Spokesman Leo Honeycutt said “all tests and vital signs are good” for the former governor. Edwards was elected governor four times, serving in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. He was convicted of corruption after his final term. Released from prison in 2011, he soon married his third wife, Trina, then 32. They have a son, born in 2013. Trina Edwards thanked well-wishers on social media Wednesday as the former governor prepared to go home.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Deer hunters will learn this week if they’ve been selected for a permit that allows them greater ability to hunt the animals. Maine manages its large deer population with “any deer” permits that allow hunters to hunt antlerless deer and bucks that have antlers less than 3 inches in length. Hunters without such a permit can only take longer-antlered bucks. The any-deer permit lottery is scheduled for Friday. The results will be posted online at noon that day. The state intends to issue a little more than 68,000 any-deer permits this year. That represents a reduction of about 20% from the previous deer season. Hunters harvested more deer than the state’s objective last year. The firearms season for deer takes place in November.\n\nMaryland\n\nLanham: The first section of track for Maryland’s $5.6 billion Purple Line was being installed Thursday. The 16.2-mile light rail line will run between New Carrollton in Prince George’s County and Bethesda in Montgomery County in the suburbs of the nation’s capital. There are 21 stations planned for the Purple Line. It will connect MARC, Amtrak and local bus service.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: About 75 workers at a Boston hotel have walked off the job to protest what a union called an unfair contract proposal. Housekeepers, cooks, bellmen, banquet servers, and front desk agents at the Battery Wharf Hotel went on strike Thursday morning. Unite Here Local 26 said hotel management wants to freeze wages, do away with pensions and union health insurance, get rid of provisions protecting job security and eliminate the right to a fair schedule. The union told The Boston Globe the hotel also intends to end its participation in an African-American hiring initiative. The hotel in a statement said it appreciates its employees and is grateful for their patience during the bargaining process. The hotel sid it’s “striving to reach a fair agreement for all involved.”\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A woman who authored a book chronicling her efforts that helped save hundreds of Jews in the Netherlands during the Nazi Occupation of World War II has died. Diet Eman died Tuesday in Grand Rapids at age 99, according to Seymour Christian Reformed Church in Grand Rapids. A Celebration of Life service is scheduled at 2 p.m. Sunday at the church. Eman was born in the Netherlands and was part of an underground resistance following Nazi Germany’s 1940 invasion of the northern European nation. Her 1994 memoirs, “Things We Couldn’t Say,” detailed how Eman provided forged identification cards and shelter for Jews, and how she helped allied pilots shot down by the German military. During a 2015 visit to Grand Rapids, Dutch King Willem-Alexander called Eman one of his country’s “national heroes,” according to MLive.com. Eman immigrated to the United States and moved to Grand Rapids.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Wildlife managers said late-season snowstorms and heavy spring rains have taken a toll on the state’s pheasant population. The Department of Natural Resources’ annual roadside survey indicated that Minnesota’s pheasant numbers are down 17% from 2018. The index is 11% below the 10-year average and 60% below the long-term average. DNR upland game research scientist Tim Lyons said there’s still reason for hunters to be optimistic. He said birds are still abundant in some areas, but hunters might need to be choosier about where they go. The survey indicated that pheasant numbers grew in south-central and east-central Minnesota, and the highest numbers are in west-central and south-central Minnesota. Weather and habitat are the main drivers of Minnesota’s pheasant population trends. Minnesota’s pheasant season runs from Oct. 12 to Jan. 1.\n\nMississippi\n\nBraxton: The remains of a World War II soldier have been returned home to Mississippi nearly 77 years after he died as a prisoner of war. Army Pfc. Harvey Andrew Nichols was a native of Braxton, near Jackson. He was taken prisoner in the Philippines when the Japanese invaded in December 1941. The Mississippi National Guard said Nichols survived the Bataan Death March as he and others walked to a prison camp. According to camp records, Nichols died of malaria and malnutrition on Nov. 19, 1942. He was 27. His remains were identified by DNA testing, and they were returned to Mississippi on Thursday. A funeral is scheduled for Saturday in Braxton. Nichols was one of 16 children. Ten of them served in the military during World War II.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A paddleboat race on the Missouri River that that was postponed in July because of high water has been rescheduled for October. Organizers of the Missouri American Water MR340 said the event will be held Oct. 15-18. The Missouri 340 is an endurance race across the state. Paddlers begin in Kansas City and end in St. Charles. The annual race was scheduled for July 16-19 but was called off because flooding made the river too dangerous. The Jefferson City News-Tribune reported everyone on the current roster will be able to choose whether to participate in October or defer to next year. New paddlers are welcome.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Wildlife managers have killed a black bear that had been running around residential areas on the south side of Billings. The Billings Gazette reported that the bear was on the run for a little over an hour after the Billings Police Department was first called about it at around 4 a.m. Thursday. Police received multiple calls about the bear’s activity. No injuries to people or pets were reported. Billings police Sgt. Glenn Gunther said there were concerns from Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks about problems the animal could create in a residential area in daylight. So the decision was made to shoot the bear, which occurred about 5:10 a.m. There have been multiple other black bear sightings this summer in and around Billings.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium has announced the birth of an endangered rhinoceros species. The zoo said Wednesday that an Indian rhinoceros calf was born Friday. It’s the first rhinoceros born in the Omaha zoo’s 120-year history. Zoo Director Dennis Pate called he birth one of the most important for the zoo in recent history, saying “it counts when it comes to sustaining this species in zoos; it counts as a backup to vulnerable wild populations.” The calf’s parents are Hellary and Jontu, both 11 years old and housed at the zoo’s Asian Highlands. Both parents weigh about 4,200 pounds. The 140-pound calf is believed to be male and is with its mother in a private area. The calf will be named at a Sept. 13 fundraiser.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Police at the University of Nevada, Reno have opened an investigation into the discovery of a swastika in the stairwell of a dormitory that opened last month in a downtown hotel-casino tower. School spokeswoman Nichole Shearer said the swastika that was a few inches big and was found Aug. 23 in the 17th-floor stairwell of Wolf Pack Tower at Circus Circus. Shearer said university police are not 100% certain the swastika wasn’t there before the dorm was opened. She said the stairwell was not frequently accessed before students moved in. Police are working with casino security to review surveillance video around the area. About 1,300 students are living in the tower this year after a natural gas explosion in July forced the closure of the university’s two largest residence halls.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nChester: Gov. Chris Sununu was scheduled to pick the ceremonial first apple of the fall season Thursday at Hazelton Orchards in Chester. Tourism officials also were set to release visitation and spending projections for the fall, as well. They also were set to present the fall tourism marketing campaign. The season represents about 25% of New Hampshire’s total annual visitation, the second-largest number of visitors in the state.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPemberton Township: A newborn two-headed timber rattlesnake has been found the Pine Barrens. Herpetological Associates of Burlington County CEO Bob Zappalorti said the snake has two brains and each head acts independently of the other. Two employees at the organization spotted the reptile in a nest where a timber rattlesnake was giving birth late last month. Zappalorti told NJ Advance Media it’s the only two-headed timber rattlesnake ever found in New Jersey. He said it likely wouldn’t be able to survive in the wild because its heads could get snagged on something. Herpetological Associates will care for the snake.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad:Concho Resources of Midland, Texas, announced Tuesday that it would sell its New Mexico assets in the Permian Basin for $925million to Houston-based Spur Energy Partners, according to a Concho news release. The sale included about 100,000 acres in the company’s New Mexico Shelf, which produce about 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The company also planned to start a repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion in of the Concho’s shares of common stock, the release read. Concho Chief Executive Officer Tim Leach said the move would allow the company to leverage itself into newer assets in the booming Permian Basin, while also protecting shareholders’ bottom lines.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The University at Albany is becoming the latest college to open an on-campus food pantry. The university is opening the pantry for students, faculty and staff on Wednesday at its campus center. Food pantries are becoming more common on campuses. Advocates said many students have trouble getting enough to eat, threatening their academic success. University at Albany officials said almost a third of the 1,800 students they surveyed said they were regularly skipping meals to stretch their food budget. The school has more than 2,000 students coming from homes living on less than $25,000 a year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: An assessment team is taking a look at the Nantahala River to see if boaters, rafters and fishermen can use it again. The Asheville Citizen-Times reported a technical team launched boats on the river on Tuesday to assess potential hazards and to lessen risks associated with landslides. A week ago, the U.S. Forest Service closed an 8-mile section of the river to boating because of debris. David Uchiyama, a N.C. Department of Transportation spokesman, said four landslides on Aug. 25 brought down 5,000 cubic yards of debris onto U.S. 19/74 in the Nantahala Gorge. Although the road was cleared on Aug. 26, tons of other debris in the river created potentially hazardous conditions for those who would usually be on the river for Labor Day weekend.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A 2015 pipeline spill of natural gas liquids initially reported as just 10 gallons could top 1 million gallons, a state regulator said Wednesday. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality reported Tuesday that about 837,000 gallons of natural gas liquids has been recovered from Oneok Partners’ Garden Creek gas plant in western North Dakota. Water Quality Division Director Karl Rockeman said about 90,000 gallons of contaminated groundwater also has been recovered at the plant near Watford City in the past four years. Regulators never updated the public on the size of the spill, even as the Oklahoma-based company updated the state on cleanup. Last year, the company told the state it had recovered 240,000 gallons of the natural gas liquids.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Health officials said they’re investigating 11 additional reports of Ohioans who vape who experienced severe breathing illnesses. The Ohio Department of Health on Wednesday also said three previous illnesses under investigation were likely caused by vaping. The agency said those three involved two women and a man from Lucas, Richland and Union counties. All required hospitalization. The state has asked health care providers to report all suspected cases of serious pulmonary illness where the cause is unclear and the patients have a history of vaping or using e-cigarettes. Symptoms have included coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue. Federal health officials said they are looking into more than 200 possible cases in 25 states.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group seeking to stop a new law that would allow people in Oklahoma to openly carry firearms without training or a background check is acknowledging they fell short of the number of signatures needed for a statewide vote on the issue. In a court filing on Thursday, an attorney for the group estimates they gathered between 30,000 and 50,000 signatures. They would have needed nearly 60,000 signatures from registered voters to qualify the question the ballot. Attorney Brian Ted Jones said one reason for the uncertainty is because supporters were dropping off signatures right up until Monday’s 5 p.m. deadline. Led by Democratic state Rep. Jason Lowe and the gun safety group Moms Demand Action, supporters said they were prompted to act after two mass shootings last month.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: An underwater earthquake with an initial 5.9 magnitude has struck off the southern Oregon coast. The U.S. Geological Survey said Thursday that no tsunami was expected from the quake, which happened about 180 miles from land at a depth of 7 miles. There were no reports of damage or injuries. The larger quake happened around 8 a.m. in the same area where a 6.3-magnitude temblor struck on Aug. 29, less than a week ago. The larger quake Thursday was preceded by one with an initial 3.8 magnitude. The earthquakes off the coast of Coos Bay are being caused by slipping along an offshore fault that has nothing to do with the more well-known Cascadia fault, which is believed to be overdue for a major Pacific Northwest earthquake.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has donated the monetary award for its Pulitzer Prize to help repair the synagogue where 11 people died in a massacre last year. Staffers won the award on April 15 for their coverage of the October shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. Along with one of the highest honors for journalistic achievement, the newsroom was awarded $15,000. The Post-Gazette reported that publisher John Robinson Block suggested donating the money to the congregation to help repair their bullet-riddled temple. Keith Burris, the newspaper’s executive editor, presented the check to Rabbi Jeffrey Myers and the president of the congregation, Samuel Schachner, on Aug. 29. The synagogue thanked the newspaper in a Facebook post, writing “Pittsburgh is truly home to some amazing neighbors!”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Federal funding has been awarded to renovate the railroad station in Providence. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, announced a $12.5 million grant from the Federal Railroad Administration, which will be matched by $7.25 million from Amtrak and $5.25 million from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. Reed said the improvements will help ensure Providence Station provides a safe, convenient and reliable service to travelers for decades. He said the station will be overhauled, with interior renovations to expand and repurpose existing space, major roof repairs and improved connectivity to Providence. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said convenient, reliable rail service is crucial for economic growth. The transportation department expects construction to be ongoing through the summer of 2022, but parts of the project might be done sooner.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreer: A Taylors man was close to running out of gas when he stopped at a store and decided to buy a lottery ticket, which turned out to be a $1million winner. The man bought the ticket for his wife, who he said never remembers to put gas in the car, according to a release from the South Carolina Education Lottery. The unnamed couple won $1 million off the ticket purchased at a Corner Mart store. The couple won the first $1 million prize in the $10 Millionaire Series game, according to lottery officials. Two more million-dollar prizes remain. The couple is planning a trip to Disney World to celebrate. The store where the ticket was sold will receive a commission of $10,000.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBurke: Students are finally returning to school in a town that was torn apart by a tornado early last month. The Burke School District welcomed students back Wednesday after delaying the start of classes by two weeks as it dealt with heavy damage to part of its campus. The elementary side of the school building fared pretty well, but some of the middle and high school rooms were destroyed when winds of up to 100 mph 160 kph) blew through the town where a lumberyard was destroyed, a civic center was mangled and two people were injured on Aug. 6. For now, band and music classes will be held at the town’s churches. Administrative offices have been moved to a local hospital. And volleyball players will use the courts at a school district 30 minutes away, according to the Argus Leader. The district will be back in its building completely by next school year, Person said. In the meantime, the district has enough resources to get the year going, and Person isn’t yet sure what other support is needed.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: A woman has died about a week after she was mauled by a pack of dogs. News outlets reported 19-year-old Adrieanna O’Shea succumbed to her injuries last Friday. The Knox County sheriff’s statement said a woman called 911 saying O’Shea was being attacked by her neighbors’ five dogs. O’Shea had been walking up to the caller’s home when she suddenly screamed “Help Me!” and was dragged off by a mastiff, a Rottweiler-lab mix, two mastiff-lab mixes and a pit bull. Deputies found her unconscious, with her clothes ripped off, and covered in wounds. Deputies shot one of the dogs. The owners said the others were euthanized. The report said one of the owners said the dogs were “just doing their job.” Authorities haven’t said if criminal charges will be filed.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A special election to fill a presumed vacancy left by City Rep. Cassandra Hernandez was approved by the Council – but just barely. The Council voted 4-3 in favor of calling a special election in November to fill the presumed vacancy on the District 3 seat. The vote also approved City Attorney Karla Nieman to retain the legal services of Lowell F. Denton of the San Antonio-based Denton Navarro Rocha Bernal & Zech law firm. City Reps. Cissy Lizarraga, Sam Morgan, Mayor Pro Tempore Claudia Ordaz Perez and Henry Rivera voted in favor of calling the special election. The Council has not specifically voted on an item confirming whether Hernandez has automatically resigned from her position. Cassandra Hernandez, who is the District 3 representative, was not allowed to vote on the item. At issue is a Facebook page post that appeared briefly Aug. 19 included image showing Hernandez posing with San Jacinto Plaza in the background and read “Cassandra Hernandez for Mayor of El Paso, Texas.” The post was quickly removed and is no longer online. It is not clear yet whether the post can be considered a formal announcement of candidacy because Hernandez said she did not post it. The Texas Constitution has a provision that calls for automatic resignations, also known as resign-to-run laws, when an officeholder announces candidacy for another office.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The University of Utah has announced a hard enforcement of their campus-wide tobacco-free policy, including public events and football games. The Deseret News reported the rule, which banned smoking for anyone on campus in May 2018, will be fully enforced at university-owned properties like hospitals and parking lots. Football fans attending games at Rice-Eccles Stadium will not be permitted re-entry if they leave. There will be no designated smoking area at the stadium. A student-led initiative helped craft the current policy that encourages people not to use smoking products like electronic cigarettes and vape pens on school property. The university joins more than 1,800 colleges and universities throughout the country that have also adopted “no smoking” policies. University officials have said the policy is intended to promote healthy lifestyles.\n\nVermont\n\nHartford: A golf course has put off a hunt for Canada geese after an outcry from some landowners and area residents. Quechee Club’s property manager Ken Lallier said Tuesday’s hunt was postponed and a variety of options are being considered again to control the birds. The Valley News reported that the club received emails, calls and social media appeals urging it to try other approaches. Those included harassing the birds with herding dogs and letting grass grow higher around ponds and the river to dissuade the birds from straying onto greens and fairways. State wildlife officials said the planned hunt was part of the resident goose hunting season and was a sound management practice done at other golf courses in Vermont.\n\nVirginia\n\nArlington: A northern Virginia county is taking down highway signs honoring the president of the Confederacy. In May, a state panel approved Arlington County’s request to change the name of U.S. Route 1 in the county from Jefferson Davis Highway to Richmond Highway. County workers were beginning to swap out the signs on Thursday, at a cost of $17,000. The city of Alexandria made a similar change at the start of the year. The highway had carried the Jefferson Davis name since 1922.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Federal scientists said they are monitoring a new ocean heat wave off the West Coast. Researchers with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday the expanse of unusually warm water stretches from Alaska to California, and it resembles a similar heat wave that disrupted marine life five years ago. It remains to be seen whether this heat wave dissipates more quickly than the last one. NOAA Fisheries said the water has reached temperatures more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit above average. Scientists dubbed the last West Coast heat wave “the blob.” Its effects included poorer survival rates for young salmon, more humpback whales becoming entangled in fishing gear as they hunt closer to shore and an algae bloom that shut down crabbing and clamming.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The fall rafting season on West Virginia’s Gauley River is getting set to start. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will begin lowering Summersville Lake to its winter level through releases at the Summersville Dam starting Friday. The weekly releases will continue through Oct. 20. The releases form more than 100 rapids on the Gauley, which drops more than 650 feet along its 24-mile route in southern West Virginia. Chief executive officer Roger Wilson of whitewater outfitter Adventures on the Gorge said Gauley season is “as good as it gets anywhere in the world.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nFond Du Lac: Students and staff at Fond du Lac High School are a bit on edge as the search continues for a missing python. The 3-foot long snake escaped from its cage at the high school sometime over the Labor Day weekend. Principal Matt Steinbarth said there’s some evidence the snake entered the ventilation system at some point. Steinbarth said the snake, called Kai, is nocturnal, so it’s unlikely it would come out of hiding during the day. The school said the snake belongs to an instructor and has no history of harming anyone or striking out. The school has set some traps to lure the snake back into captivity. Voicemails and emails were sent to parents of the school’s 2,000 students earlier this week about the snake’s escape and assuring them Kai does not pose a threat.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: A spreading forest fire east of Yellowstone National Park in northwest Wyoming has forced evacuations of some rural cabins and a Boy Scout camp. The Cody Enterprise reported that Park County Homeland Security Coordinator Jack Tatum said only one person from the evacuated area had checked in Wednesday night. Tatum said that person was from the Boy Scout summer camp and said no one was camping there. The fire began in the Washakie Wilderness last weekend and has burned about 16 square miles. More firefighters are arriving on the scene, which is west of Cody and south of U.S. 14/16/20, which connects Cody to Yellowstone National Park. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/16/spaceport-america-police-cat-superdome-plan-news-around-states/39968663/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: The city is looking for a new slogan, and it won’t be “A little different.” The north Alabama community of 55,000 people is trying to come up with a new branding tagline, and a Birmingham-based consulting firm suggested it use “A little different.” City leaders liked the idea. Council member Kristi Hill says it seemed modern. But the Decatur Daily reports the public reaction was so negative that leaders voted this week for the company to try again. Hill says the town isn’t ready for something as edgy as “A little different.” Decatur is on the Tennessee River, and it has long been called the “River City.” Council member Chuck Ard says residents need to speak up if they don’t want to lose that identity.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Country musician Zac Brown has lost a bid to limit snoopers on his private property in the state, the latest case in which the desires of the wealthy or celebrity for privacy have been at odds with public access. The lead singer for the multi-platinum, Grammy-winning Southern rock group that bears his name had sought to remove easements allowing access along his property, but the bid was rejected by a planning commission on the Kenai Peninsula, south of Anchorage, KSRM-AM reports. “I’m not interested in the public coming up to my home, people snooping, walking up to my windows,” Brown told the commission. “I’ve had to sell property for this reason.” Brown’s log home in Homer overlooks scenic Kachemak Bay. Homer, with a population of about 5,600, is frequented by fishermen and free spirits and bills itself as the “Halibut Capital of the World.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A court has scheduled arguments Oct. 23 in former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s appeal of a ruling that refused to erase his criminal record after he was pardoned by President Donald Trump. Arpaio was convicted of misdemeanor contempt of court for disobeying a court order to stop his immigration patrols. A judge who had refused to expunge the conviction says that pardons don’t erase convictions or the facts of cases and that Arpaio’s clemency only mooted his possible punishments. Arpaio’s lawyers argued their client was deprived of his opportunity to appeal his conviction because the pardon came before he was sentenced and final judgment was entered, so the conviction must be erased. A special prosecutor says Arpaio relinquished his right to appeal his conviction when he accepted the pardon.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A plant-based food producer has asked a federal court to temporarily stop the state from enforcing a law that bans labeling vegetarian and vegan products as meat and advertising them as such while litigation is underway. Hood River, Oregon-based Tofurky Co. told courts Wednesday that complying with the law would have a “severe detrimental impact” because of the cost to change marketing and packaging. It’s not clear if the law has been enforced since taking effect three weeks ago. The law’s authors say it’s designed to protect consumers. Tofurky claims the lawsuit restricts commercial speech protected by the First Amendment. A spokeswoman says Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge is reviewing the motion to determine next steps.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 500 animals including lions, tigers, alligators and wolves will get new homes after officials announced a long-struggling Southern California sanctuary is shutting down. The Los Angeles Times reports the board of directors of the Wildlife Waystation in the Angeles National Forest voted this week to close after 43 years. The Department of Fish and Wildlife says it’s collaborating with the facility and animal welfare organizations across the country to relocate 470 exotic animals, including 42 chimpanzees. Officials with the 160-acre Wildlife Waystation were unavailable for comment. But a Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman said the sanctuary suffered extensive damage in a 2017 wildfire and during severe flooding earlier this year. The Times says for two decades, authorities have been scrutinizing the waystation for alleged environmental and animal-safety violations.\n\nColorado\n\nBethune: The state has set a new hail record, though the exact size of the hail that fell near the Kansas border is still being determined. Officials with the National Weather Service and the Colorado State University Climate Center measured a hail stone that fell at a home north of Bethune on Tuesday and was preserved in a freezer at 4.8 inches in diameter. That’s about the size of a softball, although it’s more oblong. Measurements taken by the family that recovered the hail stone after it was safe to go outside show it was initially a little bigger. The Climate Center says it will consider all information to determine a final measurement. The previous hail record for Colorado is 4.5 inches. The national record is 8 inches – the size of a volleyball – set in 2010 in South Dakota.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A pilot program in several cities aims to divert people accused of low-level offenses and who are homeless or have mental illness from the criminal justice system and get them treatment instead. The Early Screening and Intervention Initiative asks specially trained prosecutors to screen for low-level offenses – such as fourth-degree larceny or second-degree assault – and work with counselors in the courthouse to get the defendants treatment. If the person completes treatment, prosecutors then can decide not to pursue the case. The Division of Criminal Justice says the goal is to reduce the burden on the courts and find more appropriate, and often cheaper, outcomes for people struggling with addiction or other mental health issues in a state where police often file charges directly rather than working through prosecutors.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Big Brother wants to keep a closer eye on big rigs in the state. Gov. John Carney was expected to sign legislation Thursday that authorizes state and local governments to install vehicle height monitoring systems. The systems use camera technology to record images of motor vehicles whose heights exceed specified size limits. The legislation is aimed at making sure tractor-trailer drivers aren’t using roads on which trucks are prohibited. State transportation officials will have one year from enactment of the legislation to identify roads as potential candidates for the monitoring systems and conduct an analysis to determine the appropriateness of each location. State officials could then install monitoring systems on state-maintained roads, and local governments could adopt ordinances authorizing monitoring systems on locally maintained roads after notifying the public.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has defended its plan to house unaccompanied migrant children in the city. The Washington Post reports DHHS says unaccompanied minors were apprehended alone, unlike migrant children separated from their families. It says its wards have beds and access to meals, legal services, games and classes. It says it awarded Dynamic Service Solutions a $20.5 million contract this month to operate a 200-bed D.C. facility for kids ages 12 to 17. The Maryland-based contractor has applied for a permit to open the shelter and posted jobs for people to work with “unaccompanied alien” children there. City officials have denounced the shelter, and Councilwoman Brianne K. Nadeau may propose emergency legislation to limit the number of youths allowed at shelters.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The federal government is proposing to strip the tiny Key deer of its endangered species status despite what environmentalists say are continuing threats to the animal due to development in the Florida Keys, its only known habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says its studies show there is no more significant threat to the deer and has set a public forum Aug. 22 in the Keys on removing the deer from the Endangered Species List. Environmental groups say stripping the deer of endangered status would leave it at the mercy of further development. The deer, which grows to about 30 inches at the shoulder, have become a tourist attraction. Its numbers are estimated at about 600, up from as low as a couple dozen in the 1950s.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge overseeing a challenge to the state’s outdated voting system said that after years of inaction in the face of warnings about vulnerabilities, state officials have finally taken a solid step in the right direction. But she foreshadowed a looming fight over the state’s new system, writing that “it may be ‘like ‘deja vu all over again.’ ” U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg’s order Thursday prohibits the state from using its antiquated paperless touchscreen machines and election management system beyond this year. She also said the state must be ready to use hand-marked paper ballots if its new system isn’t in place for the March 24 presidential primary election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: University of Hawaii students protesting the construction of a $1.4 billion telescope are expected to have class options allowing them to remain on the mountain, a report says. The plan to start construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on the Big Island has been thwarted for weeks by a group of Native Hawaiian activists who say the construction will further desecrate a mountain that already has more than a dozen observatories. A list of more than 200 courses students can take either online or via distance learning has become available, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The majority of the remote classes for student demonstrators are offered through UH-Manoa, while others are offered by the UH-Hilo and Hawaii Community College. Course topics include Hawaiian religion, mythology, culture and language, Pacific Island literature, business, creative writing, and philosophy.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials are looking into how the Trump administration’s move to weaken how it applies the Endangered Species Act could affect federally protected species in the Gem State. Scott Pugrud, Idaho Office of Species Conservation administrator, says his office is reviewing the regulatory changes. “We’ve got all our staff kind of digging in and seeing what they are and what the impacts will be on Idaho,” Pugrud told the Idaho Press. Idaho is home to six endangered and 13 threatened species, including sockeye salmon and Kootenai River white sturgeon. Threatened species include Canada lynx and grizzly bears. Idaho’s Office of Species Conservation was established in 2000, one year after the peregrine falcon was removed from the endangered species list. The bird bounced back with a successful captive-breeding effort led by the Peregrine Fund, now based in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to the Illinois State Fair can see a plot of newly legalized industrial hemp growing. The Illinois Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday that 100 industrial hemp and eight CBD plants were planted next to the U of I Master Gardner’s land on 8th Street. Hemp production was legalized last summer, and officials in April made applications available to would-be growers. Agriculture Director John Sullivan says the two varieties of the cash crop are easy to differentiate. CBD plants need to branch out to produce buds for oils. Industrial strains are planted close together so they will grow tall with long, straight stems for production of fiber or hurd – dense, absorbent material. An agriculture official will be giving presentations at the hemp plot daily from 1 to 3 p.m.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The cemetery where 1930s gangster John Dillinger is buried is objecting to his body’s planned exhumation as part of a television documentary. Crown Hill Cemetery said in a statement Wednesday that it objects to the exhumation in part because it’s concerned that “the complex and commercial nature of this exhumation could cause disruption to the peaceful tranquility of the Cemetery” and people visiting loved ones’ graves. Dillinger was fatally shot by FBI agents in Chicago in 1934. WXIN-TV reports that Dillinger’s nephew, Michael C. Thompson, sued the cemetery Wednesday, arguing it should allow him and his family to exhume Dillinger’s remains for a forensic examination to determine if it’s in fact Dillinger’s body. That exhumation would be part of a Dillinger documentary for The History Channel.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A full weekend of international food and music is in store next month, with the 15th annual World Food & Music Festival set to be held at Western Gateway Park in downtown Des Moines on Sept.20-22. More than 50 food vendors representing more than 25 countries and culinary regions will be featured at one of the city’s premier food and music events. The festival will be open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Admission is free. The band Vertical Horizon, which had a No. 1 Billboard spot in 2000 for “Everything You Want,” will headline the festival Saturday.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas City, Kansas, improperly listened to recorded communications between inmates and their defense attorneys and willfully violated court orders during an independent investigation of the systemic practice, a judge said in a ruling that could upend hundreds of federal convictions and sentences. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson in a 188-page decision handed down late Tuesday also held the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas in contempt of court, saying she would impose monetary sanctions against the government as punishment for violating orders to preserve evidence and turn over documents to the court-appointed special master investigating prosecutors’ use of video and phone recordings at the privately run Corrections Corporation of America detention center in Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new state law requires public schools to display the motto “In God We Trust,” and one school district has responded with framed copies of a $1 bill. Fayette Superintendent Manny Caulk told the Lexington Herald-Leader on Wednesday that all schools in the district have been provided the framed copy to display. Parent Brittany Pike posted a message on Facebook saying she was pleased to see the back of the dollar bill framed at an elementary school last week and said her children “don’t feel awkward or excluded for not believing in any God.” Republican state Rep. Brandon Reed of Hodgenville filed the legislation that created the new law. He says he’s disappointed to see schools “spend time searching for silly loopholes,” noting the law passed with broad support.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The iconic Superdome, home to the Saints football team and a symbol of the city’s revival after Hurricane Katrina, will undergo a $450 million facelift, under a financing plan approved Thursday that is aimed at keeping the NFL team in Louisiana for decades. The 44-year-old domed stadium, which has hosted seven Super Bowls, will see its ramp system removed and replaced with elevators and escalators, club and suite levels expanded, new entry gates erected, concession stands added and access for people with disabilities improved. Construction is expected to take four years, working around football and other event schedules, but will be completed before the Superdome hosts its next Super Bowl in 2024, says Doug Thornton, a New Orleans-based executive for SMG, which manages the facility.\n\nMaine\n\nRockland: Pop artist Robert Indiana had $13 million in the bank even as his house sank into disrepair before his death, with pigeons living in the roof, water damaging books, rotting wood and the stench of cat urine, according to court documents filed Wednesday. Documents filed by Indiana’s estate allege that aide Jamie Thomas was not a selfless caregiver, contending he “improperly lined his pockets,” claimed as gifts more than 100 of Indiana’s works, and allowed Indiana to live in “squalor and filth.” Indiana, whose “LOVE” series is instantly recognizable worldwide, died at his home on Vinalhaven Island on May 19, 2018. He was 89. The documents, filed in Superior Court, accuse Thomas of violating his duties to Indiana. In the end, it took more than 1,000 hours of cleanup and the disposal of 8.6 tons of ruined, waterlogged paper to get the home in order, the documents say.\n\nMaryland\n\nOwings Mills: An African American school principal says he was degraded by a white Baltimore County police officer while he and his son watched an arrest. The Baltimore Sun reports police are investigating the claim made by Patterson High School Principal Vance Benton, who says he and his 15-year-old son were observing an arrest last month when the officer began “baiting” him, making belittling comments, such as asking Benton if he could read and insinuating that Benton’s son would be arrested someday. His letter to county officials says he’d never experienced such “degradation, disrespect and humiliation.” He wrote that innocent lives are in jeopardy from this kind of racial bias. Police Chief Melissa Hyatt says they’re taking the complaint seriously. The department denied the paper’s request for the officer’s body camera recording.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: An increase in the number of great white sharks around Cape Cod has forced a longtime charity swim race to be rerouted. The Cape Cod Times reports that Cape Cod National Seashore officials have denied a permit for the 32nd annual Swim for Life & Paddler Flotilla. The race was originally slated to start off Long Point Beach in Provincetown Harbor. Agency superintendent Brian Carlstrom says starting the race there isn’t in line with the organization’s “shark-smart” principles. Carlstrom says the agency made the decision out of an abundance of caution. The rerouted Sept. 7 race will be closer to shore. The state’s first fatal shark attack in 80 years occurred last September off Cape Cod. Another man was seriously injured in an attack last August.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: More than half of the state’s inmates who are eligible for resentencing following a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on so-called juvenile lifers still are waiting to learn their fate. An analysis found nearly 200 inmates, or about 55% of those eligible, haven’t gotten new sentencing hearings. As of early July, 86 of the state’s 354 juvenile lifers have been released. “We are not resolving cases at the rate that you would hope, given that the United States Supreme Court said these sentences should be rare,” says Tina Olson, an attorney with the Michigan State Appellate Defender Office. Her office is representing roughly two-thirds of the state’s cases. Prosecutors defend the process and say they’re thoughtfully weighing each case.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A conservative law center is suing state Attorney General Keith Ellison, alleging that a lawyer working in his office on climate issues is an improper political plant. Attorney Pete Surdo is working for Ellison under a fellowship with the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University’s School of Law. Minnesota Public Radio reports the center was funded by billionaire donor Michael Bloomberg to address climate issues. Doug Seaton of the Upper Midwest Law Center says the connection is improper and unethical. He also says the arrangement violates a state law requiring all lawyers in the attorney general’s office to be state-paid. But Ellison says the arrangement is legal. He says Minnesotans expect an attorney general who enforces environmental law, and he’s happy to accept the help.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s largest city will stop curbside recycling collections by month’s end. Public Works Director Bob Miller says the program is indefinitely suspended, in part because China’s demand for recycled materials has fallen. Officials say more than 300 cities nationwide have stopped curbside collections. Jackson is referring residents to private collectors and says it’s seeking drop-off alternatives. Residents will get at least one more curbside collection before Sept. 1. Miller says while the city has been spending $1.15 million annually for curbside pickup, less than a third of residents participate. He says Jackson will consider restarting curbside recycling when the marketplace “reorganizes itself.” Waste Management, which collects Jackson’s garbage and recycling, argues the city can’t cut recycling from its contract. Jackson officials disagree and haven’t paid for months.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state Department of Natural Resources and Missouri Central Railroad have more time to negotiate over a proposed 144-mile bike trail that would stretch across the state. Missouri State Parks said Wednesday that the U.S. Surface Transportation Board approved a request for another 133 days to negotiate an agreement for the Rock Island Trail, which would run from Windsor in western Missouri to Beaufort in eastern Missouri. The trail would run along a former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad path. The Jefferson City News-Tribune reports Mike Sunderland, of the Missouri State Parks, says the extension will allow the Missouri State Park Foundation to develop potential partnerships to support the project.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A federal land agency has purchased a large area of land from a state conservation organization, increasing the amount of public ownership in the region. The Missoulian reports the Bureau of Land Management signed paperwork this week to purchase 20 square miles in the Lower Blackfoot River corridor just east of Missoula. Federal officials say money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund was used to purchase the land, with future plans to acquire additional areas by the end of 2020. Officials say the goal is to reach 94 square miles in the Blackfoot drainage and return formerly public lands that were given away decades ago. Officials say any additional purchases will have to go through a federal review process.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials say hunters may begin donating deer to the Hunters Helping the Hungry program beginning Sept. 1 at 11 processor locations around the state. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says two more will accept deer for the program starting Nov. 1 and Nov. 16. Hunters pay no processing costs for the processing. The program is funded solely by tax-deductible contributions. Ground venison is distributed by charitable organizations to Nebraskans in need. Processors accept only whole deer in good condition to ensure a good yield of pure ground venison. Learn more about the program and how to support it at the commission website, or contact program coordinator Teresa Lombard at 402 471-5430 or teresa.lombard@nebraska.gov.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: The Federal Highway Administration has issued an environmental excellence award to state wildlife and transportation officials for creating wildlife safety crossings on special highway overpasses in northeast Nevada. The award recognizes nine safety crossings installed on Interstate 80 in Elko County between Wendover and Wells and U.S. Highway 93 north of Wells to reduce potentially dangerous vehicle-animal collisions. The overpasses are covered with native soil and vegetation to replicate the natural environment and encourage crossing by mule deer, elk and other animals. Nevada’s departments of transportation and wildlife worked together to identify the most critical deer migration and roadway-crossing points, including GPS collars to track the migratory movements of hundreds of deer.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The police department says it will install surveillance cameras despite a judge’s warning they could violate privacy laws. New Hampshire Public Radio reports the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire sued the city of Manchester over the cameras in June. A judge’s preliminary order Tuesday said reviewing the footage and using it to identify someone is illegal, though installing the cameras isn’t. Manchester police want to install the three cameras near City Hall because of complaints about crime, panhandling and loitering. A live feed would be transmitted to the dispatch office. While not intended for traffic, the cameras on Elm Street could capture a driver’s identifying information, such as their face or license plate, which the ACLU says is against the law.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge has put a temporary hold on a new state law allowing terminally ill patients to seek life-ending drugs. Judge Paul Innes of Superior Court in Mercer County signed the temporary order Wednesday blocking the law and set a hearing for October. Brought by Dr. Yosef Glassman, the suit seeking to block the law argues it violates constitutional rights as well as common law barring suicide. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the bill in April, making New Jersey the seventh state allowing the practice. Maine enacted a similar law in June, becoming the eighth. New Jersey’s law went into effect this month. Murphy said at an unrelated event Thursday that he will fight the suit, and the attorney general will put out guidance.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nUpham: Virgin Galactic has unveiled its digs at Spaceport America. The once-empty hangar in a remote spot in the New Mexico desert that anchors the taxpayer-financed launch and landing facility has been transformed into a custom-tailored headquarters where Virgin Galactic will run its commercial flight operations. Two levels within the spaceport include mission control, a preparation area for pilots, and a lounge for paying customers and their friends and families, with each element of the fit and finish paying homage to either the desert landscape that surrounds the futuristic outpost or the promise of traveling to the edge of space. Billionaire Richard Branson, who is behind Virgin Galactic, and former Gov. Bill Richardson first pitched the plan for the spaceport nearly 15 years ago, but there were plenty of construction delays and cost overruns.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: Visitors may now get a look at two rare leopard cubs at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo. Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon announced that the little Amur leopards made their public debut Wednesday at the Syracuse zoo. The male and female cubs gradually ventured out from private quarters into their exhibit. It’s a temporary one while the zoo works toward a new, more complex $400,000 outdoor space for the leopard family. The cubs were born June 19 to parents Tria and Rafferty. The cubs don’t yet have names. The zoo plans a vote soon. Amur leopards are considered critically endangered. They are found in far eastern Russia, where an estimated 84 remain in the wild, up from about 30 in 2012. About 250 Amur leopards live under human care.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMocksville: The police department is evicting its pet cat named Sgt. Butters, and some residents are mounting a campaign to bring him back. The Winston-Salem Journal reports the Mocksville Police Department’s resident feline needed a new home after concerns were raised about a pregnant woman who worked in the building and said she couldn’t be around cats. Officers had rescued the cat last year after it was seen hanging around the department. A Save Sarge Butters petition on Change.org was nearing its goal late Thursday. Sgt. Butters has been credited with helping to restore the department’s tarnished image after a jury awarded $4.1 million in damages to three former officers who said two town officials fired them in 2011 for reporting allegations of corruptions to state officials.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: North Dakota State Fair officials have decided against holding a tobacco-free day at next year’s event. The state Health Department and Bismarck tobacco prevention coalition had asked the fair board to designate Family-Military Day as smoke-free at the 2020 event. Fair Board President Gary Knell says it would be difficult to make a fairgrounds ban work. The board decided to continue following state guidelines regarding tobacco in public places. State law prohibits smoking in enclosed public spaces oe within 20 feet of doors, windows or ventilation systems of public buildings. The Minot Daily News reports Knell says even though the board denied a tobacco-free day, advocacy groups could set up booths at the fair to encourage people to go tobacco-free on the grounds.\n\nOhio\n\nPortsmouth: A man is crediting his dog for saving him after the man suffered a bad fall. WSAZ-TV reports Jimmy Hale fell off a flood wall in Portsmouth last week while walking Taco. Hale ended up passing out after falling 15 feet and didn’t wake up until the next day. Hale says he screamed for help, but no one answered. That’s when Hale says he heard a lawnmower and then footsteps. Portsmouth city worker Mark Puckett says he only noticed Hale because of Taco, who stayed on the wall until someone showed up. Hale was flown to St. Mary’s Medical Center, where he was still recovering Wednesday from pelvic and wrist injuries. Hale was reunited with Taco in the hospital Wednesday, and the two had an emotional reunion.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin has agreed to provide access to propriety research and other data to researchers at Oklahoma State University to help them find causes and treatments for drug addiction. Purdue Pharma announced the agreement Thursday in a joint statement with OSU. Purdue said it will provide OSU’s new National Center for Wellness & Recovery access to “research molecules and certain associated data” that will help with research into addiction. The company and its controlling family, the Sacklers, agreed earlier this year to pay Oklahoma $270 million to settle allegations they helped create the nation’s deadly opioid crisis with their aggressive marketing campaign. That money is being used to establish the research center at OSU.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The governor has signed a bill requiring eggs produced by commercial farms to eventually be cage-free. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Gov. Kate Brown approved the new law mandating all eggs produced or sold in Oregon must come from cage-free hens by 2024. The measure signed Monday applies to commercial farms with 3,000 or more chickens. The state requirements will give about 4 million birds added space and perches. The Humane Society of the United States called the law a “monumental win for hens confined in tiny cages in the egg industry.” Oregon joins a handful of other states with similar laws including California, Washington and Massachusetts. The newspaper cites reports that say cage-free laws provide an improvement for chickens, but most remain held in small spaces and cages.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMechanicsburg: A man is accused of putting people at risk by placing unidentified substances into consumer product packaging and returning the items to retail stores. Police on Wednesday charged 58-year-old Robert Keith Burns of Mechanicsburg with reckless endangerment, theft by deception and criminal mischief through tampering. The arrest affidavit says Burns wouldn’t tell investigators what materials were put inside of packaging for beauty aids and medication returned to stores or recovered from his home. He’s in jail, unable to post $50,000 bail. Burns doesn’t have a lawyer listed in court records. Authorities seized packaging, glue, jars and white cream from a search of Burns’ home last week. Police have said they are trying to determine what substances were used and haven’t fielded any reports of people being sickened.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: The state’s attorney general and state police launched investigations Thursday after a truck drove through a group protesting federal immigration policies at a detention center, which has since placed an employee on leave. At least two people were injured, one seriously, Wednesday night outside the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, according to the Jewish youth movement Never Again Action. The center is used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A video posted by the group on social media shows a black pickup that protesters say was operated by a uniformed corrections officer driving up to an entrance blocked by demonstrators. The vehicle stops before again moving forward. Protesters surround the truck, screaming and chanting: “The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBeaufort: A former commercial helicopter pilot has become the first female Marine to pilot the F-35, a next-generation joint strike fighter aircraft. The Island Packet reports Capt. Anneliese Satz completed her fighter jet training this summer at the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort. Satz trained in Mississippi, Florida and Texas over the past four years before arriving in Beaufort last summer to train in the F-35B Lightning II. A station statement says Satz’s aircraft is a supersonic stealth vessel designed to operate from short-field bases and near front-line combat zones. The statement says the 29-year-old Satz credits her history as a commercial helicopter pilot as what prepared her for a career in military aviation. She’s now headed to Iwakuni, Japan, to join a unit called the Green Knights.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBrandon: The state Department of Health and city officials are trying to assure residents the quality of the city’s drinking water is just fine. Concerns were raised after a doctored water quality report surfaced online that indicated unsafe radium levels. The report had redacted information about the company that conducted the testing, as well as the identity of the customer who hired the water quality assessment done. The state and city investigated and found the report posted online July 28 had been altered. The city of Brandon held a press conference Wednesday afternoon to address the issue and assure residents Brandon’s drinking water meets Environmental Protection Agency safety standards.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A local startup aims to use honey to help heal wounds, and Regional One Health is putting its unique product to the test. Apis is a dissolvable patch made of manuka honey from New Zealand and the structural protein collagen that protects wounds during the healing process. It’s the first product by SweetBio, a company with four full-time employees based out of the University of Memphis’ CommuniTech Research Park. SweetBio wants to figure out where exactly its product fits in the health care industry, a question Regional One’s health system is suited to answer thanks to the variety of patient scenarios it encounters. Regional Medical Center in Memphis, an acute-care hospital, is in that system. The partnership is the next step in Apis’ journey to becoming a commercial product, following its FDA clearance for wound management in May.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Area voters will be asked this fall to approve up to $3.5 billion in bonds to expand public transportation that supporters say could benefit more than a dozen communities. Metropolitan Transit Authority board members on Tuesday agreed to place the issue on the Nov. 5 ballot. The bonds would be repaid by future sales tax revenues. Federal money will also be sought for the anticipated $7.5 billion in projects that could extend three light rail lines, expand use of bus rapid transit in dedicated lanes and create high-occupancy vehicle lanes along most of Houston’s freeways. Houston-area voters in 1978 created METRO and approved a one-cent sales tax to support operations.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The University of Utah plans to spend about $925,000 to improve safety following the killing of a student track athlete on the Salt Lake City campus. University President Ruth Watkins had called for a task force to evaluate safety after 21-year-old Lauren McCluskey was gunned down in October by a man she briefly dated. The task force made two dozen recommendations, including improving building alarms, adding police patrol outside of night classes and hiring a chief security officer. The university is also rolling out a campus ride-hailing service. Students hired to be drivers will transport students and staff across campus. The university plans to have most of the security measures in place before classes start next week.\n\nVermont\n\nWilmington: A nonprofit created in response to Tropical Storm Irene is dissolving and donating its funds for local trail upgrades. The Wilmington Selectboard voted this week to accept more than $176,000 of remaining assets from the Wilmington Fund to be used for renovations of the Valley Trail system. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the money is meant to be used to enhance, upgrade and build the trail system with “family friendly” biking and hiking. The designated area spans about 5.6 miles between Wilmington and Dover. Town Manager Scott Tucker says the board’s next step is to plan the design for the trail system. He did not give a cost or exact time estimate for the project. Tucker says they hope to begin construction by next spring.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The widows of two state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while monitoring a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville are suing the state and others, blaming their husbands’ deaths on a “maintenance nightmare.” Amanda Bates and Karen Cullen filed wrongful death lawsuits Monday against Virginia, the Secretariat of Public Safety and Homeland Security and state police. Berke M.M. Bates and H. Jay Cullen had been monitoring the “Unite the Right” rally Aug. 12, 2017, before their helicopter crashed. The lawsuits say the helicopter was a “maintenance nightmare” with a history of malfunctions. Federal transportation safety investigators expect to issue a final report on the crash next year. A preliminary report did not offer a likely cause. Spokeswomen for the defendants said they couldn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Newly leaked emails show conservative state Rep. Matt Shea has had close ties with a group in the state that trained children and young men for religious combat. The Spokesman-Review reports the emails were first revealed in The Guardian on Wednesday, while Shea’s ties with Team Rugged also showed up in a video on Shea’s public Facebook page. “The entire purpose behind Team Rugged is to provide patriotic and biblical training on war for young men,” a man identified as the group’s leader, Patrick Caughran, wrote in a 2016 email to Shea, R-Spokane Valley. “Everything about it is both politically incorrect and what would be considered shocking truth to most modern christians,” Caughran wrote. “There will be scenarios where every participant will have to fight against one of the most barbaric enemies that are invading our country, Muslims terrorists.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFort Gay: The town has received a grant that’s expected to help transform a lock house into a community historical site. The Herald-Dispatch reports the FOCUS WV Brownfields Grant check was presented last week to leaders in Fort Gay. The $5,000 grant will allow the town to get an environmental assessment, which is the first step in transforming the Lock Masters House at the Big Sandy Lock and Dam #3. The town hopes to turn the lock house into a welcome center and community museum. Leaders also want to add a public river walk. Construction of the dam was completed in 1897 but abandoned in 1925. Currently, the locks are mainly used by a few fishers, but Mayor Joetta Hatfield says she hopes the site attracts more anglers in the future.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos accused a paralyzed Democratic lawmaker of trying to sabotage a new national role for the Republican legislative leader by publicly seeking accommodations for his disability. This “does not seem like an accident to me,” Vos told a conservative radio show host Thursday. “Everything they do is political and trying to make the other side look bad.” Vos earlier this year rejected Rep. Jimmy Anderson’s request to be able to call into meetings he cannot attend because of his disability and to bar overnight floor sessions. Vos told WISN’s Jay Weber he believes the timing of Anderson’s public appeal was meant to undermine the announcement of Vos taking over as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. But Democratic leaders made the request in February, and Anderson reached out to a reporter in May. Vos took over the new role 10 days after the story was published.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A new state park at a former launch command center for one of the world’s most powerful nuclear missiles has opened to the public this week. KGAB-AM reports the Quebec 1 Wyoming Historic Site north of Cheyenne opened for tours Tuesday. An official grand opening is set for this weekend. The former Peacekeeper missile site is located off Interstate 25 about 25 miles north of Cheyenne. Tourists will be able to go underground to the steel-reinforced concrete capsule. The site also features a museum. It’s estimated that the site will attract 50,000-60,000 visitors a year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/10/smithsonian-exhibit-summer-camp-boom-turn-lights-news-around-states/115544416/", "title": "Smithsonian exhibit, summer camp boom: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The city’s schools will continue their Monday-through-Thursday schedule of in-person classes for the rest of the 2020-21 school year, according to Superintendent Mike Daria. He said Tuscaloosa City Schools will resume five days of face-to-face instruction next fall for the 2021-22 school year. “As we’ve worked to make the decision for the last part of the school year, we’ve looked at everything from our employee vaccinations, the needs of our virtual students, balancing the needs of educators and the needs of our students,” Daria said. “We want to make sure the instruction is robust and strong.” Keeping the status quo will help virtual students and provide TCS the opportunity to continue meal distribution for families on Fridays, according to a news release from the school system. About one-third of TCS students take virtual classes full time, many instructed by educators who are teaching face-to-face classes during the week as well. “Our virtual students’ schedules are important,” Daria said. “It’s important that they have access to their instructors at the times they have access to (them) now, and that includes time on Friday.” Keeping classrooms empty on Fridays also allows for deeper cleaning of school facilities. And TCS has plans for a Monday-Friday summer learning program.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Gov. Mike Dunleavy has said he’s feeling better after contracting the coronavirus last month. Dunleavy said Friday that while his voice still gets slightly hoarse if he talks for too long, his other symptoms are now mild. He said he had a bad headache, fever, chills and body aches for several days. Dunleavy was scheduled to finish his isolation period last Saturday. There have been more than 56,000 coronavirus cases and 301 virus-related deaths in Alaska as of Friday, according to data from the state Department of Health and Social Services. Dunleavy, a Republican, said his experience with the virus has not changed much about how he thinks the state should respond to the pandemic. He encouraged people without allergies to receive vaccines to mitigate the spread of the virus, KTOO-FM reports. “If you get the virus, you’re out of commission for 14 days,” Dunleavy said. “You don’t want to spread this to others – you don’t want to be part of that. If you get the vaccination – after your first shot, you’ve got a pretty good dose of immunity for the most part, if everything works out. And then you don’t have to end up under house arrest.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Restaurant workers may have to wait a little longer for their chance to sign up for COVID-19 vaccines, despite the fact that their jobs often require interaction with customers. The Arizona Department of Health Services classifies restaurants as “essential services.” This previously meant restaurant workers would be able to sign up for vaccines once their county reached Phase 1B of distribution. But the state switched away from its phase-based distribution plan Monday and started an age-based plan for access to shots. State-run vaccination sites are now welcoming anyone 55 and up. The next age bracket includes those 45 and older. The new plan, however, isn’t uniform across the state. Individual counties are each developing their own plans, merging aspects of the original and the new to form hybrid plans. These plans allow counties to prioritize essential workers as they choose. Holly Poynter, public information officer for the Arizona Department of Health Services, said while the state receives federal recommendations on who should be prioritized, “local allocators may further subprioritize populations in each phase based on vaccine supply.” Restaurant owners can help employees get vaccinated by submitting a Phase 1B Employer Vaccine Request Form, available through ADHS.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Monday expanded eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines to another 180,000 people, including manufacturing workers and essential government employees. Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced Arkansas would fully open up access to the remainder of the 1B category under the state’s vaccination plan. The move also opens up the vaccine to those working in public transportation and grocery stores, as well as people with developmental and intellectual disabilities. Arkansas had previously made the vaccine available to those at least 65 years old, teachers, health care workers, law enforcement, and workers at poultry plants and other food manufacturing facilities. Hutchinson said demand was less than expected when the state held vaccination clinics over the weekend. He also announced Arkansas was setting up a statewide vaccination scheduling system. Up to 30 employees will be staffing a call center to help residents make appointments, the governor said. The expanded eligibility does not include food service workers, despite the state last month lifting most of its restrictions including capacity limits on restaurants and bars. They are currently in the 1C category, which Hutchinson said he hoped to make eligible by next month.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Jose: Santa Clara County will not participate in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to have Blue Shield control COVID-19 vaccine distribution, a newspaper reports. County Executive Jeff Smith said late Monday that the county will not sign a contract with the health insurance company because it would not improve speed or efficiency, The Mercury News reports. The state’s switch to a vaccine appointment and delivery system administered by Blue Shield was expected to be completed by March 31. Skepticism, however, has surfaced among the state’s 58 counties. So far, Kern County is the only county to sign a contract with Blue Shield. But 41 federally qualified health centers, 28 hospitals, four large medical groups, three pharmacies and three tribal clinics have signed on, according to the company. In Santa Clara County, Smith characterized Blue Shield’s role as “adding bureaucracies.” The state turned to Blue Shield to create uniform rules and increase the rate of vaccinations, with the state’s My Turn system serving as the central portal for getting appointments. Blue Shield is also tasked with improving targeting of hard-hit communities.\n\nColorado\n\nBuena Vista: Three cases of the coronavirus variant originating in South Africa have been reported at a correctional facility in the town, officials said. The Colorado State Public Health Laboratory said two employees and one inmate tested positive after being randomly selected for tests intended to detect potential variants, KDVR-TV reports. They are now in isolation. The state lab is expected to check all confirmed coronavirus-positive results for the variant. People who test negative are expected to receive vaccinations, including family members and those who have been in close contact with workers at the facility. The vaccinations at the facility are part of a health department policy that has prioritized people “for emerging risk of rapid spread of COVID-19,” health officials said. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is investigating an outbreak that began in October at the Buena Vista Correctional Complex, a state prison for men about 100 miles west of Colorado Springs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the virus variant from South Africa spreads quickly and is more contagious.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is on track to receive more than $10 billion in federal COVID-19 funding in the Democratic coronavirus relief legislation before Congress, including $4 billion worth of stimulus payments, members of the state’s all-Democratic House delegation said Tuesday. Eligible residents among an estimated 1.5 million Connecticut households are set to receive up to $1,400 in direct payments under the massive 628-page bill, which is now awaiting final approval in the House of Representatives. “That relief is going to be seen at the dinner table and assisting in terms of the day-to-day, ongoing efforts, on behalf of our citizens to make ends meet,” said U.S. Rep. John Larson, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District. The federal lawmakers said Connecticut is set to receive funds for a variety of COVID-19-related needs. Those include expanded food assistance, rental and mortgage assistance, statewide and community-based vaccination clinics and outreach, health insurance subsidies, school safety improvements, child care tax credits, and an estimated $276 million in direct aid to financially struggling child care providers.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state says it’s reviewing new federal guidance that eases restrictions for those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The Delaware Division of Public Health told the Delaware State News on Monday that it will determine how to incorporate the federal updates into the state’s guidance for residents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says people who are fully vaccinated can gather indoors with others who’ve been fully vaccinated without wearing a mask or social distancing. Vaccinated people can also come together in a single household with people who are considered at low risk for severe disease. For instance, fully vaccinated grandparents could visit healthy children and grandchildren. A person is considered fully inoculated two weeks after receiving the last required dose of the vaccine. However, the CDC is continuing to recommend that fully vaccinated people wear masks and maintain social distancing when in public.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History has acquired the vial that contained the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine administered in the United States as part of its plans to document the global pandemic and “this extraordinary period we were going through.” The acquisition, along with other materials related to that first vaccine dose, was announced by the museum Tuesday to mark the upcoming one-year anniversary of the pandemic. Associated Press journalists were given an exclusive backstage look at the newly obtained materials, which include vials, special shipping equipment, and the medical scrubs and ID badge of the New York City nurse who was America’s first COVID-19 vaccine recipient. “We wanted objects that would tell the full story,” said Anthea M. Hartig, the museum’s director. “Everything from the scrubs to the freezer unit that shipped the vaccines.” Although there are a host of coronavirus-related anniversaries taking place, the museum is choosing to mark Thursday – March 11, the day last year that the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic. That’s also the week that much of American life shut down as the coronavirus made inroads into offices, homes and sporting events.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: Local faith leaders and the fire department have joined resources to expedite vaccination of older adults starting with the homebound and those in low-income housing. Through late February the initiative was responsible for delivering 5,466 shots in the city, where a relatively high 17% of its 92,000 residents are 65 and over, including hundreds of Holocaust survivors. “We’re not responding with lights and sirens, but we are responding to a need in the community,” Miami Beach Fire Chief Virgil Fernandez said. Firefighters already have an “evacuation list” of people they need to get to safety during hurricanes. To go beyond that, they turned to temples and churches that minister to and are familiar with many of the neediest in the community. Rabbi Mendy Levy of the Chabad Hasidic movement helps train health care providers who treat Holocaust survivors, some of whom can be retraumatized by triggers such as injections and white coats after being subjected to experiments carried out by doctors in concentration camps. It’s crucial that firefighters and nurses take the vaccines to a welcoming setting, such as a synagogue or a patient’s home, and visit with them and their families. “Though it’s a trigger, so in general they are afraid, they recognize this is a God-given gift,” Levy said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Every hospital or nursing home patient could designate at least one person who would have at least one hour of access each day under a bill approved by the state House on Monday. The legislation – a response to hospitals, nursing homes and other care facilities banning visitors for months at a time during the coronavirus pandemic – now moves to the Senate for more debate. Gov. Brian Kemp implemented a ban on visitors at long-term care facilities in April by executive order. In September, Kemp eased those restrictions by putting in place a phased approach to allowing visitors based on the severity of a COVID-19 outbreak in a particular area. House lawmakers held multiple hearings during which they heard emotional testimony saying people were suffering because of loneliness and avoiding medical care to avoid being cut off from loved ones. “People have things they need to say,” said Rep. Bonnie Rich, R-Suwanee, who recounted her own severe illness in the hospital with her husband by her side. “What kind of society denies this? How many people have died in the last year with things they needed to say to loved ones? Is there anything really more important?” Hospital representatives raised concerns that the measure could heighten the risk of the virus spreading among vulnerable populations.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Health has launched a mental health crisis counseling hotline to provide residents support amid the coronavirus pandemic. The new program, called “Ku Makani – The Hawaii Resiliency Project,” offers counseling, education and information for people experiencing mental health crises during the pandemic, Hawaii News Now reports. The program has trained counselors on each island and serves people who speak multiple language, with staff fluent in Ilokano, Spanish, Hawaiian, Tongan, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Japanese, Palauan and Samoan. The state Department of Health received a $2.1 million grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to create the program. Residents can access it by calling Hawaii CARES 1-800-753-6879 and selecting option No. 1. Calls can be made between 4 and 9 p.m. on weekdays and state holidays and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. The service is available for children, teenagers and adults.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state House panel on Tuesday approved legislation banning anyone under 21 from buying cigarettes or electronic smoking products. The House Health and Welfare Committee on Tuesday approved the measure that will bring Idaho in line with the federal smoking age. Former President Donald Trump signed a law last year that bars tobacco sales to anyone under 21. Supporters said Idaho stores are already abiding by federal law, but state law needs to be changed to avoid confusion and confrontations in stores. Opponents said the law will limit local governments in prohibiting specific types of smoking products. Opponents also said young people ages 18 to 20 who can legally do such things as join the military or buy a house should be able to buy cigarettes or vaping products. There was concern among some lawmakers that the legislation could prevent local leaders from banning smoking in parks. But backers of the legislation said the ability for cities and towns to do that is found in other areas of Idaho law. “We are not trying to stop anyone from saying where you can and can’t smoke,” Pam Eaton, of the Idaho Retailers Association, told lawmakers. “We’re just trying to make uniform the laws retailers have to follow.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Monday said the mass vaccination site at Chicago’s United Center will be limited to city residents because the federal government wants to ensure people most in need are being vaccinated. According to officials, more than 40,000 people 65 and older booked appointments at the United Center since registration began Thursday, but fewer than 40% were Chicago residents. Lightfoot said Monday that the disparity prompted discussions about ensuring the appointments were open to more Black and Latino city dwellers. Pritzker said as a result of weekend negotiations with the Federal Emergency Management Agency over the United Center vaccination policy, the state is securing additional doses on top of its usual allotment to be used at federally run mobile vaccination sites outside Chicago. Those who made their appointments prior to Sunday’s eligibility change can keep their appointments, Pritzker said. A second website is being established so suburban Cook County residents can eventually sign up for vaccine appointments at the United Center. Chicago public health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said the site may eventually be open to all Illinois residents.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: While customers of 317 Burger are devouring truffle fries and burgers ordered through a delivery app, the locally owned restaurant is eating a chunk of the cost. Delivery services are both a blessing and a curse for the local restaurant industry, which has been relying on providers such as Uber Eats, Grubhub and DoorDash to stay afloat during the coronavirus pandemic. “Takeout works if you are at full capacity, and you couldn’t fit another person in the restaurant, but you still have a person making food and whatnot,” said 317 Burger owner Bill Ficca. “But if you’re only allowed to operate at a fraction of your capacity, and then you pay someone 30% of your retail price or your menu price, you lose money.” A new proposal making its way through the Indianapolis City-County Council would temporarily limit the fees that third-party food delivery services charge to restaurants, an attempt to protect a local food industry already struggling to stay afloat. The ordinance, which is up for a council vote March 15, would restrict fees to 15% of the pretax cost of the meal for delivery services and 5% for other services such as credit card processing or online pickup fees. The restrictions would sunset 90 days after Marion County eliminates restrictions for indoor dining, which is now limited to 75% capacity.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Des Moines Public Schools is giving middle and high school students who might otherwise have received failing grades this school year the chance to raise their grades this summer or next school year. “It felt like an F wasn’t necessarily representative of students necessarily not learning,” said Sarah Dougherty, Des Moines schools director of secondary teaching and learning. “It could represent a whole lot of things, a whole lot of hardships on our community and our families and our students during the pandemic.” The solution is to give students incompletes and the chance to either make up the classes this summer or retake them during the 2021-22 school year. The move, described as for one year only, was prompted by the learning disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. School officials opted to start the 2020-21 school year completely online despite a state mandate that districts offer at least 50% in-person instruction, and the district continued instruction online in November through January after receiving a waiver from the state due to the high number of coronavirus cases in Polk County. As of Feb. 12, 15.3% of middle schoolers and 59.1% of high schoolers in the district had a D or F in at least one course.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Middle and high school school students in the state’s largest school district will be able to return in person five days a week after spring break as more staff members are vaccinated and coronavirus numbers improve. The Wichita Eagle reports the Board of Education in the 47,000-student district voted 6-0 Monday to make the change, which will take effect starting March 29, though the district will continue to offer a virtual learning option. Elementary students already had been learning in person five days a week. But older students are attending classes in a hybrid mode in which they learn at home part of the time and and in person the rest of the time. School data on COVID-19 cases and quarantines has been improving. As of Friday, the district reported 307 employees were in active quarantines, down from 622 as of Jan. 8. The district has administered 4,590 first doses of a vaccine to school staff as of Sunday. Meanwhile, the community has begun vaccinating more essential workers. About 30,000 workers in the aviation supply chain, 3,500 public safety officials, 1,700 licensed child care providers and 1,100 meatpacking workers may begin scheduling appointments through the county’s website Tuesday, Sedgwick County Manager Tom Stolz said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: About a quarter of the state’s adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Monday, and he expects that number to rise as more vaccination sites open and supplies increase. “This is, in many ways, a race against time against the variants,” Beshear said at a virtual news briefing. “If we can continue that downward trajectory while increasing the number of people vaccinated, then we can hopefully get to the end of this thing sooner rather than later.” Kentucky reported 331 new confirmed coronavirus cases, the lowest number of new cases since Sept. 14. Beshear also announced 10 coronavirus-related deaths. Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky’s public health commissioner, advised that fully vaccinated Kentuckians should continue wearing face coverings and follow social distancing guidelines in public. The state’s test positivity rate is 4.06%. The positivity rate is an indicator of the extent of the spread of the virus, according to the World Health Organization. If the rate is less than 5% for two weeks, and testing is widespread, the virus is considered under control. Fifteen of Kentucky’s 120 counties are reported to be in the red zone – the most serious category for COVID-19 incidence rates.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: On the one-year anniversary of its first confirmed COVID-19 case, the state widened COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to anyone 16 and older who has among two dozen high-risk medical conditions, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Tuesday. The broader eligibility sweeps hundreds of thousands of additional people onto the access list starting immediately. The Democratic governor’s decision adds anyone with hypertension asthma, cancer, diabetes, sickle cell disease, chronic kidney or liver disease, chronic pulmonary disease, Down syndrome, heart conditions, a weakened immune system or one of several other preexisting conditions. Smokers and people who are overweight also are eligible. In addition, people who work at homeless shelters, jails and group homes now have access. Those who are 16 or 17 will have access to the Pfizer vaccine because it is the only vaccine currently authorized for younger people. The hopeful news about broadened vaccine access fell on the same day Louisiana marked a more somber benchmark. Exactly a year prior, the state received confirmation of its first coronavirus case in the New Orleans area. Since then, 9,044 deaths from COVID-19 have been confirmed across the state, and hundreds of additional deaths are suspected.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: There are going to be more happy campers this summer as more camps choose to reopen despite the pandemic, providing millions more kids an opportunity to gather around a campfire. Most camp directors sat out last summer as the coronavirus raged across the country, either because of state restrictions or because of concerns about keeping kids healthy. But with cases declining and more people vaccinated each day, many are feeling more confident about reopening this season. Parents are scrambling to get their kids signed up before slots are filled in Maine, where at least 100 overnight camps will be open. “Given all that kids have gone through, it’s an amazing opportunity for them that gives them a glimpse of normal life in a world that’s far from normal,” said Elisabeth Mischel, of Short Hills, New Jersey, who’s sending her two boys, 11 and 13, to camp in Maine. At Camp Winnebago, owner Andy Lilienthal said camp directors know how to keep kids safe – there were no infections at his camp last summer – and they’ll make adjustments needed to carry on. His biggest concern at this point is that there’s so much demand amid worries about the emotional toll the pandemic is taking on kids. “It makes me sad to turn people away,” he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan is proposing a $1,000 bonus for state employees. The Republican governor submitted a $74 million supplemental budget Monday to provide for the bonuses. The governor’s office said the bonuses are made possible in part by the early and aggressive budget actions taken last year in response to projected revenue impacts from COVID-19. Hogan said the bonuses recognize the hard work of state employees, who have overcome significant challenges to deliver essential services to Marylanders during this public health emergency. The supplemental budget for the bonuses will need approval by the General Assembly. If they are approved, they would take effect April 14 for most employees and April 21 for University System of Maryland employees.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Unions representing teachers and firefighters have proposed having firefighters administer COVID-19 vaccines to educators, who become eligible to sign up for their shots later this week. Union leaders are scheduled to meet Wednesday with the state’s health and human services secretary to discuss the plan, which they say would make the process of inoculating teachers faster and more convenient. “Our educators are working during the day, and the majority of them are already in schools … and they can’t be at a computer all day hitting ‘refresh’ trying to get an appointment,” Beth Kontos, president of the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts, told The Boston Globe. “It would be much better if we could deliver our vaccine to school sites.” Unions have already met four times with Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders about the proposal, she said. About 400,000 teachers, school staff and day care workers are eligible to sign up for vaccinations starting Thursday. The proposal is based on the process that was used to vaccinate first responders, many of whom got shots in their workplaces. Kate Reilly, a state COVID-19 Response Command Center spokesperson, said in a statement that Sudders “has recurring meetings” with education officials and unions.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is asking Michiganders to turn on the lights outside their homes for an hour to remember thousands of people who have died from COVID-19. The remembrance will occur from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesday, one year after the state first confirmed coronavirus cases. Michigan has seen more than 16,600 confirmed or probable deaths tied to the disease and more than 658,000 infections, spurred by surges last spring and in the fall and winter. Whitmer said Monday that turning on porch lights will “remember those we’ve lost and remind ourselves that even in times of darkness, we’re in this together. As we mark this occasion, we also look towards the light at the end of the tunnel.” The authorization of three vaccines will protect people from COVID-19 and help the country and economy return to normal, she said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state is expanding eligibility for vaccines after reaching its goal of inoculating at least 70% of people ages 65 and older, Gov. Tim Walz announced Tuesday. The state will expand eligibility to the next two phases at once starting Wednesday to include people with underlying health conditions and those at a risk of workplace exposure, including about 45,000 people who work at food processing plants. Walz said the state expects to have 70% of seniors vaccinated by Wednesday, weeks before an earlier projection of the end of March. The governor said he feels a “real sense of urgency” to ramp up vaccination efforts to diminish the impact of coronavirus variants spreading across Minnesota. The next two phases include about 1.8 million people. Providers are encouraged to prioritize vaccinating individuals with underlying health conditions who would be most at risk of hospitalization or death due to the virus. They include Minnesotans with sickle cell disease or Down syndrome, those in cancer treatment or who are immunocompromised from organ transplant, and those who have oxygen-dependent chronic lung and heart conditions. Front-line workers in food service, food retail, food production, manufacturing, agriculture and public transit, among others sectors, are also eligible.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s top public health official is urging people to continue wearing masks in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus, even after Republican Gov. Tate Reeves lifted a mask mandate. Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer, said during a news conference Monday that Mississippi has seen a significant decrease in hospitalizations from COVID-19 in recent weeks, but “we’re not done with the COVID pandemic.” “Just like in a baseball game, if you’re up a run or two in the sixth or seventh inning, you don’t just lay down and let the other team just go at it on offense,” Dobbs said. “It’s time to continue with some of the safety measures we have in place. Continue to mask in public. Continue to avoid indoor social gatherings. And get vaccinated when it’s your turn.” The Health Department said Monday that more than 488,000 people in the state of 3 million have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and nearly 276,000 are fully vaccinated. Dobbs said Mississippi is closing the gap on racial disparities in vaccinations. Black people, who comprise 38% of the population, now represent 25% of those who have received at least one dose, up from about 17% in early February.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A year after the state confirmed its first COVID-19 infection, local governments on Monday continued to relax coronavirus restrictions as the number of cases in the state declines and vaccinations efforts expand. Gov. Mike Parson and St. Louis County Executive Sam Page announced the state’s first case March 7, 2020 – a woman from the county who had recently returned after studying in Italy. “Since COVID-19 struck Missouri one year ago, we have worked nonstop to take a balanced approach, fight the virus, and keep Missourians as safe as possible,” Parson said in a statement Monday. “A tremendous amount of work has been accomplished over the past 12 months, and I could not be more proud of Missourians for their efforts.” Page announced Monday that several health orders prompted by COVID-19 will be eased, effective immediately. Those include increasing public gathering limits from 10 to 20 people and allowing businesses to stay open until midnight. Also Monday, the Cape Girardeau County Commission voted unanimously to rescind the county’s mask mandate, effective immediately, and replace it with a statement saying wearing masks is “highly recommended” to help control the spread of COVID-19.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill approved by the U.S. Senate over the weekend includes funding for Amtrak’s Empire Builder route, which runs through northern Montana. Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester proposed the legislation to provide up to $166 million to reinstate furloughed Amtrak employees and restore daily service on the carrier’s routes, the Daily Inter Lake reports. The bill now moves to the House, where it is expected to be approved before heading to the desk of President Joe Biden to sign. The Empire Builder and other long-distance routes were cut because of a massive decline in passengers as a result of the pandemic. The company furloughed about 1,250 employees nationwide. The Empire Builder route was reduced to operating three days a week between Chicago and Seattle and Portland, Oregon. It services a dozen communities in Montana, including Whitefish, where more than 55,000 passengers board or disembark annually. “Folks on the Hi-Line depend on Amtrak to stay connected, and its full return will boost the economy and create good-paying jobs across the region,” Tester said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials may start using mobile sites to help expand the number of places where residents can get a COVID-19 vaccine as available doses increase, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Monday. His comments came as the number of new vaccinations administered continues to trend upward, with dips on weekends. “Certainly, that may be one thing we do,” Ricketts said at a coronavirus news conference. Health officials inoculated a new one-day high of 20,949 people Thursday. Statewide, 12% of Nebraska residents who are at least 16 years old have been fully vaccinated, according to the state’s online tracking portal. Nebraska hospitals that are working through the state’s vaccination program have received 502,470 doses so far. The state has also received 109,735 through the federal government’s retail pharmacy program, which distributes vaccines to local pharmacies. Ricketts said the state has seen success with mass vaccination sites, such as the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department’s location at Pinnacle Bank Arena in downtown Lincoln. Nebraska officials are still giving top priority for vaccinations to residents who are at least 65 years old, a group that accounts for a large majority of the state’s coronavirus deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials reported Monday that about 1 in 6 people statewide has received at least a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine since shots became available in mid-December. “I do think progress is starting to finally click and continue to increase,” said James English, COVID-19 response operations chief in Washoe County, where state statistics show 16.8% of residents have received their first shot, and 9.8% have been fully vaccinated. In Clark County, home to Las Vegas, the first-dose figure was about 16.2%, with the Las Vegas area nearing 200,000 people fully vaccinated – almost 8.5% of the area population, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. Statewide, the number of first doses was nearly 16.5%, and full vaccinations reached almost 9%. English said he expected vaccinations to “ramp up” during the next couple of weeks. Washoe County health officials said they have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and plan to begin administering it for the first time this week. Some area pharmacies and other providers in Reno and Sparks received the single-shot vaccine last week. A first shipment of about 15,000 Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses also arrived in Las Vegas last week.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Looking beyond the pending coronavirus relief package, some town managers in the state worry about the future of small businesses, infrastructure projects and caring for older adults. “Businesses are trying to reopen, they’re trying to have some normalcy, but if they don’t survive, we’re going to have a lot of empty storefronts” and concern about a property tax base loss, said Steve Fournier, Newmarket town manager, during a call hosted Monday by U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. Shaheen said there is some funding in the pending $1.9 trillion package for small businesses. Some managers are hoping for money for infrastructure projects. A fund in the package is included to help state and local governments with them. Butch Burbank, town manager in Lincoln, said the town is planning for the expansion of water storage facilities for fire protection. He also expressed concern about retaining workers in service industries, and Shaheen said the relief package contains funding for job retraining and the restaurant industry. In Sunapee, Town Manager Donna Nashawaty said more broadband expansion funds would be welcome and expressed concern that some seniors are still isolated. Shaheen there is funding in the bill for services for seniors, including mental health programs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMiddletown: With the state’s commercial fishing industry about to receive a second round of federal coronavirus aid, boat owners and those who run fishing-related businesses say the extra money is helping to keep them afloat amid a sea of red ink. New Jersey’s fishing industry received $11 million last March under congressional pandemic relief. And it should get roughly the same amount under a second bill passed by Congress in December, U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. said Monday. Pallone, D-N.J., held a news conference at the Belford Seafood Cooperative in Middletown with boat owners and those who run related businesses. Many said the extra money could make the difference between working and not working this spring and summer. “In the fishing industry, we’re no strangers to uncertainty. We have overcome many challenges, but nothing prepared us for 2020,” said Jung Kim, owner of a bait and tackle shop in South Amboy. He estimated his store lost up to 65% of its business over the past year, including a sharp dip in wholesale supply distribution. The charter fishing industry also sustained deep losses last year as normally packed boats were subjected to capacity limitations in the name of slowing the coronavirus’ spread. Many customers simply stayed away.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state House of Representatives endorsed a tax increase Monday that would boost subsidies for insurance coverage on the state health insurance exchange. The bill, which moves to the Senate for consideration, has the support of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. A similar proposal to broadly increase the surtax on insurance premiums won House approval and stalled in the Senate last year, as the federal government repealed its health care provider fee that helped support state insurance markets established under the Affordable Care Act. About 45,000 residents of New Mexico rely on the insurance exchange for health care. At the same time, separate enrollment has swelled during the coronavirus pandemic in Medicaid insurance for people living in poverty or on the cusp as the federal government pours extra money into the program. As the economy recovers and Medicaid enrollment unwinds, state insurance regulators hope to lower costs for many consumers of marketplace insurance policies and broaden the enrollment pool to make the exchange more useful and sustainable. House Republicans stood in unified opposition to the surtax increase. GOP House minority caucus chair Rebecca Dow of Truth or Consequences described the bill as an affront to small business amid the economic fallout from the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: The state will lower COVID-19 vaccine eligibility from age 65 to 60 this week and will soon loosen restrictions on vaccination sites that local officials have criticized, under a plan Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday. Cuomo said anyone who qualifies will be able to be vaccinated starting Wednesday. Eligibility is also open to people with certain health conditions and to certain essential workers including teachers, health care providers and police officers. The Democratic governor said promises of more vaccine shipments have made him comfortable with increasing eligibility, even with overall supplies still too low to vaccinate everyone eligible in New York. His office had previously estimated 7 million New Yorkers were eligible before the list grew to include millions more with underlying medical conditions. “But the supply is increasing,” said Cuomo, who spoke at a vaccination site in Syracuse. Cuomo said New York will allow additional essential workers to receive the vaccine starting March 17: public and certain nonprofit employees who interact with the public, public works employees, child service case workers, sanitation workers and building service workers. “These are the people who are the everyday heroes,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNags Head: Officials with the Cape Hatteras National Seashore say its beaches on North Carolina’s Outer Banks recently saw a record-breaking surge in visitors. The Virginian-Pilot reports the national seashore recorded nearly 87,000 visitors in January. The park said in a news release that the number breaks the record for January 2020 by 5,000. The Cape Hatteras National Seashore has 67 miles of shoreline from Oregon Inlet to Ocracoke. People visit in the winter months for walks on the beach, shell collecting and reeling in fish. Dave Hallac, superintendent of the National Parks of Eastern North Carolina, said the desire for escape from coronavirus-related isolation helped fuel the increase in visitors. “More people are seeing the beauty of the seashore during the winter,” he said Friday. “You can pretty much drive from anywhere on the East Coast to the Outer Banks in a day.” The park saw 2.6 million visitors during 2020 despite the fact that Dare and Hyde counties had blocked access to the beaches from March to May because of the pandemic. The number was the still highest in 17 years.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Republican-led Legislature has relaxed a requirement for lawmakers to wear masks in House and Senate chambers. The Senate on Monday endorsed the rule change with the needed two-thirds vote. The House met the two-thirds threshold Friday, before sending the change over to the other chamber. Most Democrats opposed the change, along with only a handful of GOP lawmakers. Only a couple of lawmakers have announced publicly that they have been infected with the coronavirus since the session began Jan. 5. Democratic House Minority Leader Josh Boschee said the mask mandate in the chambers should “absolutely not” go away. “It’s worked,” he said. Lawmakers decided ahead of the session that convened in January to require masks at the state Capitol to help protect lawmakers and the public, despite opposition by ultraconservative members of the Republican-controlled Legislature. No one has been sanctioned under the rule, despite a relatively lax attitude toward wearing face coverings by many members. The amended rule only allows lawmakers to be maskless on chamber floors. The public and media still must wear a face covering.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Dancing is again allowed at weddings, proms and banquet hall events, state health officials clarified this week. A March 2 health order lifted the 300-person capacity limit for banquet halls and catering facilities. The order didn’t explicitly mention dancing, but an Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman confirmed the order replaced a November health order temporarily banning socializing in congregate areas and dancing. Gov. Mike DeWine put that ban in place as cases and hospitalizations were rising statewide. The new order applies to “wedding receptions, funeral repasts, proms and other events, whether or not food is served, at banquet facilities.” Facilities must adhere to the business safety guidelines issued in orders Sept. 23 and July 23. That includes face coverings for everyone except when eating or drinking, which must be done while seated. “In short, dancing is permitted by both the Sept. 23 order, and for those specific types of events mentioned in the recently amended mass gathering order,” Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman Alicia Shoults wrote in an email.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials plan to start offering COVID-19 vaccines Tuesday to workers in a wide range of essential industries, a move that will immediately make a vast majority of Oklahomans eligible. Also on the list for the vaccine beginning Tuesday will be child care workers and students and employees at colleges, universities and vocational schools. “This is a big step,” Oklahoma Deputy Health Commissioner Keith Reed said. “By the time we roll this group in, we’ve practically covered everyone in the state.” Reed said the latest expansion should include all but about 500,000 Oklahomans. Oklahoma’s list of essential industries includes a wide range of jobs, including manufacturing, construction, communications, energy, finance, state and federal government, transportation and retail. Oklahoma currently ranks tenth in the nation with 20.9% of its population having received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That compares to a national average of 18.1%. Meanwhile, Oklahoma’s seven-day rolling averages of coronavirus test positivity rate, daily new cases and daily deaths have all declined over the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state’s housing problem was further exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic and wildfires. Lawmakers are considering options that include building more shelters, extending the grace period by which tenants must pay back their rent, increasing homeownership access to low-income individuals, and an effort to reduce housing disparities for communities of color. The housing bills being considered in Salem were outlined by House Speaker Tina Kotek alongside housing committee chairs Sen. Kayse Jama, D-Portland, and Rep. Julie Fahey, D-Eugene. “Oregon had a housing crisis before the pandemic dramatically worsened income inequality and wildfires devastated the housing supply in vulnerable communities,” Kotek said Monday. “The Legislature has worked hard in recent sessions to turn the tide, and this moment demands that we keep pushing forward.” The 17 bills lawmakers presented include $535 million in new state investments for increasing affordable housing, addressing homelessness and supporting homeownership. Lawmakers say they are also “expecting significant federal support” from the federal government.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State, county and city governments in Pennsylvania will receive about $13 billion from the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 rescue package making its way through Congress – a huge sum of money at a time when the state is projecting a multibillion-dollar deficit. The state’s share of that will be about $7.3 billion, while the other $5.7 billion will go to local governments, officials with the Independent Fiscal Office told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Monday. Governments can use the money to pay for costs associated with responding to the pandemic or to backfill revenue losses inflicted by the pandemic’s effects, they said. It cannot finance tax cuts, they said. The Independent Fiscal Office has projected a roughly $2.5 billion deficit for state government next year, with much of the rising costs being driven by long-term nursing care for a growing number of elderly residents. Pennsylvania’s tax collections this year through February, the eighth month of the fiscal year, were slightly behind last year’s collections when adjusting for $1.8 billion that the Department of Revenue said was collected in this fiscal year because of delayed tax-filing deadlines last year.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state plans to get all K-12 teachers, school support staffers and workers at state licensed child care facilities their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of March, Gov. Daniel McKee said Tuesday. The shots will be administered starting as early as this week at the 30 local vaccination clinics already established around the state, the Democrat said during a news conference at a Pawtucket vaccination site. Staffers at public, private and parochial schools will be eligible. Support staff including paraprofessionals, clerical staff, custodial staff, bus drivers and others are included in the plan, he said. “Getting our teachers, school staff and child care workers vaccinated is one of the best things we can do right now to support students, families, schools and our economy,” McKee said Tuesday. The only exception will be in Providence, where a clinic exclusively for school and day care workers will be set up to administer the shots, state Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green said. To reach the state’s goals, about 18,500 teachers, school staffers and child care workers need to be vaccinated, said Tom McCarthy, director of the state Department of Health’s COVID-19 unit. People will be vaccinated based on where they work, not where they live, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Sales of lottery tickets have soared during the coronavirus pandemic. Experts attribute the trend to a lack of other entertainment options, federal stimulus payments that left players flush with cash and two big jackpots earlier this year. Slightly more than $2 billion was spent on lottery tickets in South Carolina between mid-April 2020 and the end of last month, an increase of more than $300 million, or almost 19%, compared to the same period in the prior year. “This has been a very unusual and in many ways unprecedented year,” South Carolina Education Lottery spokesperson Holli Armstrong said in an email. The increase in sales of lottery tickets has led to a corresponding boost in the amount of scholarship money that the state has for students attending its technical colleges and universities. Projections of lottery revenues available for funding scholarships have increased by nearly 20% in recent months. The proposed state budget prepared last week by a state House committee includes $575 million in lottery revenues, nearly $52 million more than Gov. Henry McMaster put in his spending plan in January. On the flip side, another likely result of the increase in lottery ticket sales is that some players spent more than they could afford without winning.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state Department of Corrections won’t say how many of its staff or those in their care are receiving COVID-19 vaccines. Almost a third of the state’s adults have been vaccinated. And though staff and those incarcerated have been offered shots, officials with the department have refused on multiple occasions to say how many have opted to receive one. The corrections department started releasing daily updates on inmate and staff COVID-19 case numbers in late April 2020 after news outlets reported the department wouldn’t publicly share case numbers, as routinely done in other states. But there’s been no sign the department would make a similar move when it came to vaccines. About 2,300 people in the state’s prison population have contracted the coronavirus, according to the department, giving the state prison system the third-highest infection rate in the nation based on a state-by-state prison COVID-19 tracker from the Marshall Project and the Associated Press. Seven incarcerated men have died with COVID-19. As of Tuesday, one person in prison had COVID-19. A few cases have popped up in the past few weeks after the department reported in late January that all inmates had recovered from the disease.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The city intends to vaccinate 10,000 residents in one day at a drive-thru event at Nissan Stadium on March 20 – the largest mass vaccination drive announced in Tennessee so far. The event will exclusively use the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, so participants won’t be required to seek a second dose elsewhere, according to the Nashville Metro Public Health Department. The event will last from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. in stadium parking lots A through D, according to a news release. Registration begins 10 a.m. Wednesday at covid19.nashville.gov. Eligibility is limited to people age 65 or above in or vaccination phases 1A, 1B or 1C, according to a news release announcing the event. There is no sign-up process available by phone. To keep lines as short as possible, those who sign up for the Nissan Stadium event are encouraged to come to the event with multiple registrants in a single car but not more people than the number of doors on the vehicle. Nashville officials expect the stadium event to be the first of several “large-scale drive-thru events” in the coming weeks, and state health officials have considered similar events at Dollywood in Pigeon Forge and Nashville Superspeedway in Lebanon.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Despite Gov. Greg Abbott’s statewide mask mandate ending Wednesday, the Austin area’s top public health official said he wanted to hold off on relaxing pandemic rules because of an uptick in hospitalizations over the weekend. Dr. Mark Escott, interim Austin-Travis County health authority, told members of the City Council and the County Commissioners Court that he recommended keeping the area in Stage 4 of Austin Public Health’s risk-based guidelines until at least the end of the week. Austin and Travis County businesses must still require customers to wear masks as part of a local ordinance passed in July, city and county officials said Tuesday. Those rules are set expire next month, but Austin and Travis County leaders said they will stay in place until then. Under the city and county rules, people can face criminal charges if they walk into a business without a mask and refuse to leave if asked by the business. It’s still unclear whether Abbott will challenge the local decision on masks. Past pandemic policies have been superseded by the governor’s pandemic-related executive orders. However, the rules in July were set in place by Escott as the area’s health authority, not Mayor Steve Adler or Travis County Judge Andy Brown.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The popular outdoor sculpture gallery Art Around the Corner makes its return this month, with a full collection of pieces set for installation ahead of the scheduled St. George Art Festival, which starts April 2. The popular open-air gallery was most recently updated in 2019, with the COVID-19 pandemic delaying any 2020 updates, but residents can expect to start seeing new pieces of work move into place along the city’s downtown streets in the coming weeks. The new collection is expected to draw works from artists across the U.S., in addition to sculptures from well-known local artists like Matt Clark, Marcia Robinson-Rouse and Cheryl Collins. Other familiar names include northern Utah sculptors Deveren Farley, Dana Kuglin, Gary Lee Price and Dan Toone. “Art Around the Corner’s 2021-2022 Outdoor Sculpture Gallery will be the perfect celebration of a community reconnecting after a very challenging year,” said Marianne Hamilton, the chair of the board that organizes the event. “The new show includes a very diverse range of styles and materials, from traditional bronze sculptures to pieces crafted from recycled and reclaimed metal components, and will feature everything from a winged angel to a revered historical figure to a heavy-metal rocker.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The number of new coronavirus cases in the state is increasing, but cases among older Vermonters and deaths continue to decline, officials said Tuesday. Statistics also show the vaccination campaign that focused on older Vermonters first is producing results, with fewer cases in long-term care facilities, fewer hospitalizations, fewer patients in intensive care and fewer deaths. Despite the recent increase in cases, officials expect the number positive tests reported in the state to hold steady over the next several weeks and then decline as the vaccination program continues. The state is estimating there will be seven to 15 deaths in March, down from 71 in December, 34 in January and 25 in February. “We are concerned, but it seems to be at least steady and level, and we do feel that our strategy as we continue to vaccinate those by age-band after we get through this high-risk category will be beneficial to the state,” Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday during the twice-weekly virus briefing. The statistics were released as state officials said they were moving to Thursday when people ages 16-54 with high-risk medical conditions will be able to register for vaccinations. The plan had been for that group to begin registering March 15, but fewer people in the 55-64 category were registering than expected.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said Tuesday that he hopes the state has reached the final stage of the coronavirus pandemic as the vaccination rate grows and the number of new COVID-19 cases goes down. The Democratic governor said Virginia has already reached a goal of administering an average of 50,000 vaccine shots a day. And he said 1.5 million residents – or 18% of Virginians – have received at least one dose. The state also reported more than 1,500 new coronavirus cases Monday. That number is far below the nearly 10,000 new cases that were reported in mid-January as cases surged following the holidays. But Northam, who is a physician, cautioned that a return to normal won’t happen until the state has reached “herd immunity.” That is when the virus can longer find the human hosts it needs to survive and mutate. “The vaccines are a light at the end of a long tunnel, and that light gets brighter every day,” Northam said at a news conference. “For now, we need to keep doing the things that we know work. Wash your hands. Wear your mask. Keep your distance. But there is every reason to be hopeful that things are getting better for all.” Northam urged people to answer their phones to make sure they receive calls from health officials who are scheduling vaccine appointments.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Local officials say the start of in-person classes for some special education students and preschoolers has been pushed back to March 29. Seattle Public Schools had hoped to resume classroom learning for some students this week. The new target date was announced Tuesday by the district and the teachers union. The Seattle Times reports the announcement comes after intense opposition from the union to the district’s move to summon 700 educators back to buildings this week to teach students ahead of an agreement on expanding in-person instruction. Those educators were supposed to report to their buildings Monday to ready their classrooms for learning, but a campaign by the Seattle Education Association asked them to stay remote. A safety check of some district buildings by union and district officials, an independent HVAC system contractor and the state Labor & Industries department found no major issues. The two parties are still working on an agreement to offer in-person services to about 10,000 students, including kindergartners and first graders. The timeline is the first jointly released by management and labor for any type of in-person instruction since the pandemic began. Seattle Public Schools is the state’s largest district, with about 50,000 students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia University will get a $307,000 grant to study best practices for online tutoring in science, technology, engineering and math fields for undergraduate students in response to learning loss during the pandemic. U.S. Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin announced the funding for the West Virginia University Research Corporation through the National Science Foundation. “The COVID-19 pandemic created major challenges for all of our educational institutions, forcing students to adapt to new methods of learning,” Capito said in a news release. Manchin praised the National Science Foundation for continuing to be a “great partner for West Virginia and our universities.” “I look forward to seeing the benefits of this research for students in West Virginia and across the nation,” Manchin said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: About 2 million more residents, including those with certain preexisting conditions, will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines in the next round to be announced later this week, the state’s deputy health secretary said Monday. That would be the single largest expansion of vaccine-eligible people in Wisconsin since the first doses began trickling into the state in mid-December. Those were targeted to front-line health care workers, then expanded to those over age 65, and this month a group of 700,000 people, including all teachers, was made eligible. Health officials have been under pressure to broaden those eligible to people with underlying health conditions that could put them more at risk of serious illness should they get COVID-19. State health officials have been working to determine which conditions will qualify and are expected to announce the next group Thursday, said Julie Willems Van Dijk, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. It didn’t make sense to allow such a large group of people to become eligible earlier when vaccine supply was limit to only 70,000 doses a week, Willems Van Dijk said. Expanding too fast and creating a hope that vaccine is available even though supply already can’t meet demand remains a concern, she said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Teton County health officials have detected the coronavirus variant that originated in South Africa. The Teton County Health Department said Monday that a sample from a resident who tested positive for the virus in January revealed the variant, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Health officials said the person did not travel prior to becoming infected. The state Department of Health has not announced any other cases of the variant. County Health Officer Dr. Travis Riddell has encouraged residents to get tested for the coronavirus if they have symptoms or come in contact with someone who tested positive. “Testing is still our best mechanism to identify people who test positive for COVID-19 and to quickly work to determine their close contracts so that we can reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our community,” Riddell said. Health officials have advised that residents should continue to follow safety guidelines such as mask-wearing and social distancing.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/07/31/nyc-taxis-fisher-cats-casinos-news-around-states/112618944/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey extended a state order requiring face coverings in public for another month and expanded it to include students in grade 2 and above in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19 as schools reopen. Ivey’s action, announced during a Capitol news conference Wednesday, added more than four weeks to an earlier order that had been set to expire Friday. The mask order will now last through Aug. 31. Hospital officials had pushed for an extension, saying the state’s intensive care units are nearly full. “Y’all, we just must remain vigilant if we are going to get our kids back in school and keep our economy open. Wearing a mask can’t hurt, but it sure can help,” Ivey said. The Republican governor, in a nod to the opposition some conservatives have to the mask orders, said her job is “to do the right thing, not necessarily the most popular thing.” State Health Officer Scott Harris said the extension was the right thing to do, particularly as students head back to school beginning next week.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Nonresident travelers to Alaska will need to show they tested negative for COVID-19 shortly before arriving as part of an effort aimed at minimizing cases and preserving testing supplies and protective gear, Gov. Mike Dunleavy said. “We’re not trying to make this difficult for folks to come here,” Dunleavy said during a Tuesday evening news conference. “We just want to make sure that we are taking care of Alaskans first.” The changes take effect Aug. 11 and will require nonresidents arrive with negative results from a test taken 72 hours before arrival. Dunleavy said enforcement details are being worked out. Currently, travelers have several testing options, including taking a test within three to five days of leaving for Alaska and being tested at an airport location when they arrive in Alaska. Those opting not to test can quarantine for 14 days. Under quarantine, one is to leave their location only for medical emergencies or necessary medical care. Dunleavy indicated quarantine would no longer be an option for nonresident travelers under the new protocols. “We feel it’s best to just go straight to a testing approach that requires folks coming in to have a negative,” he said. “So, if you come to Alaska, you should have a negative.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Navajo Nation leaders on Thursday will continue discussions about proposed expenditure plans for the tribe's remaining federal COVID-19 aid, which could include allocating more than $20 million to its four casinos following mass layoffs. This week, the Navajo Nation Gaming Enterprise, which oversees the tribe's casinos, laid off about 900 of its more than 1,000 employees, according to the enterprise's Interim Chief Executive Officer Brian Parrish. He said another 140 employees could face layoffs early next week as the enterprise was running low on cash reserves because of casino closures during the pandemic. The 24th Navajo Nation Council during a special session on Tuesday discussed legislation that proposed expenditures from the tribe's remaining $652 million in federal COVID-19 aid. The Council voted in favor of including an amendment in the bill that would allocate $24.6 million to the enterprise. Tribes across the country have until the end of the year to spend all federal COVID-19 aid and complete whichever projects the funds were allocated toward, according to officials. U.S. Rep. Tom O'Halleran, D-Ariz., earlier this month introduced legislation to extend the deadline to tribal governments to Dec. 30, 2022.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday said he wants to hear “dissenting voices” after the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported the state’s interim health secretary in June voiced concerns about the consequences of further lifting restrictions that had been placed on businesses because of the coronavirus. “I am concerned that pushing on to Phase 2 for the entire state will lead (to) significant increases in COVID cases that will overwhelm our healthcare systems,” Dr. Jose Romero wrote in a June 9 email to Dr. Nate Smith, then the state’s health secretary that the newspaper obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request. “The public seems not to have taken seriously recommendations for social distancing and masks.” Hutchinson on June 10 announced the state would move into Phase 2 of reopening, a move that eased capacity limits on bars, restaurants and other businesses. Romero on Tuesday said he didn’t believe Hutchinson made a mistake by moving into Phase 2. He said his comments were based on the data at the time and noted Hutchinson has since signed a statewide order requiring mask s in public. Romero’s email was in response to a list of options for reopening strategies Smith sent to a medical advisory panel for the governor. Hutchinson, a Republican, said he wants to hear all voices from his advisory panel but said he went with the option that had the most consensus. “I want to know dissenting voices,” Hutchinson said. “I want to know broadly what the thinking of our medical advisory group is.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Ana: Education officials in Orange County are planning to sue Gov. Gavin Newsom and state health officials over rules barring most schools from reopening classrooms when the academic year starts because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Orange County Register reported that the county’s Board of Education voted 4-0 on Tuesday to file the lawsuit. The board majority said in a statement the state hasn’t addressed how high-risk students will navigate distance learning and that the rules violate students’ constitutional rights. The board approves the budget for the county’s education department but doesn’t make decisions for local school districts. Previously, the board stoked controversy by recommending schools reopen without requiring social distancing measures or masks. Al Mijares, the county’s superintendent, said Wednesday he was disappointed by the decision to sue and that the board has diverted time and energy from students and programs to satisfy “ideological interests.” Newsom has said public and private schools in counties that are on a state monitoring list for rising coronavirus infections can’t hold in-person classes and the counties will need to meet strict criteria for schools to reopen. Orange County is one of more than 30 counties on that list following a rise in virus cases and hospitalizations. A conservative legal organization filed a federal lawsuit last week alleging the state doesn’t have the right to shutter schools.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A rodeo and concert ended without official intervention after the landowner learned of the event’s unexpectedly large size, a police official said. The event held in Weld County was criticized for its large crowds heeding little-to-no virus safety measures, The Denver Post reported. Some 2,000 people attended the gathering north of Lochbuie on Sunday night. Authorities were alerted around 5 p.m. to the new location by callers concerned about traffic, noise and a lack of masks and social distancing by attendees, Weld County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Joe Moylan said. The crowds were mostly gone around 9 p.m., Moylan said. The sheriff’s office previously stopped the event at another location. The landowner at the second location had not realized the scale of the event to be held on his property, Moylan said. “The organizers said it would be a small get together,” Moylan said. “And when he realized he had over 2,000 people on his property he went a little ballistic. He was like, ‘I didn’t approve of this, I didn’t sign off on this.’ And it kind of dispersed on its own.” The landowner could not immediately be reached for comment. The event organizer did not return requests for comment.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Former Waterbury Mayor Philip A. Giordano, who is serving a 37-year sentence in a South Carolina prison for child sexual abuse, is asking to be released early because of the health risks he faces from the COVID-19 pandemic. Giordano, a former attorney and Republican U.S. Senate candidate, filed a handwritten petition in federal court asking for “compassionate release,” as well as the appointment of an attorney, the Hartford Courant reported on Tuesday. Giordano is not set to be released until 2033. Giordano, 57, wrote that he has “extraordinary and compelling” reasons to be released, citing the spread of COVID-19 in the federal prison system and at the medium security facility where he’s being confined in Bennettsville, S.C. Giordano said eight inmates in his unit have been infected and he claimed the prison ventilation system created a “petri dish effect” for his unit. On Wednesday, however, the Federal Bureau of Prisons website listed no current, positive COVID-19 cases among the 1,229 inmates at the facility. It reported that seven inmates have recovered and none has died. Among staff, seven are listed as having tested positive, five have recovered and none has died. Giordano, who also said he suffers from chronic spinal pain, was convicted in 2003 of sexually abusing the 9- and 11-year-old daughter and niece of a prostitute girlfriend, who was addicted to drugs, in his office at City Hall. He was charged after FBI agents overheard the assaults while conducting surveillance for a separate corruption investigation.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Delaware’s beach towns are open to the public, but government and public health officials warn that everyone’s help is needed to curb the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing is encouraged in all public spaces, and people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance from those who are not members of their immediate household. As for face masks, they are required to be worn in public spaces where social distancing is difficult, and inside businesses that are open. Face masks are recommended, but not required, on most beaches, but social distancing is a must. Masks must be worn on the streets, sidewalks, boardwalk and inside businesses in Rehoboth Beach city limits. Lewes also requires masks to be worn outdoors in the city’s downtown area, public beach parking lots and while crossing the Savannah Road drawbridge between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. There are similar rules in Bethany Beach, where people in violation of mask rules can face up to a $100 fine. Swimming is permitted at all beaches unless dangerous weather conditions arise. Make sure to check in with the local lifeguards before you dive in to learn about any potential hazards in the water or on the sand. At beaches within the Delaware State Parks system, like Cape Henlopen State Park, Fenwick Island State Park and Delaware Seashore State Park near the Indian River Inlet, there are limits on how many people will be admitted. The number of vehicles allowed in will be capped at 60% of parking capacity, according to parks officials. Masks or face coverings are required in bathhouse and concession areas at all three parks and strongly encouraged on the beach as well.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:D.C. Public Schools will move to virtual and distancing learning for the start of the 2020-21 academic year from Aug. 31 to Nov. 6, Mayor Muriel Bowser said Thursday, WUSA-TV reported. The decision to move to a virtual learning scenario came after District leaders in conjunction with D.C. Health Department analyzed recent COVID-19 data that suggested that it was the best decision to keep students safe during the pandemic. The school system asked families and staff members to fill out a survey and received about 17,000 responses regarding the reopening of schools. Education officials said they designed virtual and online schedules depending on ages and grade levels. The majority of independent learning time will be on Wednesdays and virtual learning will be live lessons online during the week. Teachers will be conducting learning checks to monitor and understand gaps in learning. Attendance will also be tracked and taken during this learning scenario, officials said. Students will also have access to mental health support and social-emotional learning activities to get them through the virtual learning process, officials said. Officials said they will continue to monitor data and decide what the future of schools will be like for Term 2 on Nov. 9.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach:Child care assistance is available for children of first responders and other essential workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic – but time to apply is running out. The deadline to sign up for an Early Learning Coalition of Palm Beach County scholarship is Friday, the agency said. More than 2,000 children of first responders, health care employees and other workers considered “essential” – including grocery store, food, gas station and sanitation workers – have been helped by the program. It was launched earlier this year as the pandemic gripped the country, throwing families in need of child care into chaos as numerous facilities closed. “We are proud of that and want to serve more while we can,” Early Learning Coalition CEO Warren Eldridge said. Eligible families could receive financial help for 60 or 90 days, or more, the coalition reported. The program is for workers with children ages 6 weeks to 12 years. To apply, call 561-514-3300. In addition to helping these families pay for child care, the coalition said it also can help locate facilities that are open and accepting new students. Placement help is available for all Palm Beach County residents.

The email highlights things students should know about attending on-campus classes while maintaining social distancing, such as face-covering enforcement, the health center reopening and notice of no tuition changes. “If you are an undergraduate student and you change your class to an online class, your tuition also will not change as Georgia Southern has eliminated differential tuition for online classes at the undergraduate level,” the email read. “However, if you change a graduate-level class from an in-person class to one that is scheduled completely online, there may be a change in tuition charges as some graduate classes still have different costs if delivered online.” Another point in the email is the announcement that GS’ CARES Center has opened, which is a tool to help students report and track COVID-19 cases. The online resource provides answers for COVID related questions, self-reporting instructions and more on academic needs. Classes are scheduled to begin Aug. 17 on all campuses.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii was listed among 12 countries and regions the Japanese government considers safe international travel destinations for its citizens during the coronavirus pandemic. The announcement could provide a boost to Hawaii’s tourism industry, which is vital to the state economy and has been devastated since the virus put the brakes on global travel. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi announced the new Japan-Hawaii safe travel program, which will be tightly regulated to protect the health of travelers and prevent the additional spread of COVID-19. The program is expected to require negative coronavirus tests for tourists before they travel and include screening of travelers entering Japan. Hawaii, like Japan, has low numbers of coronavirus cases and is the only U.S. state under consideration for Japan’s program. Others destinations on the list include China, South Korea, Taiwan and nations in Europe. The program likely would benefit Oahu disproportionately as Hawaii is expected to limit the relaxed entry program to Oahu, which usually receives the majority of visitors to the state from Japan. Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said the announcement is good news for the Big Island and the state. Kim favors allowing travel to and from Japan without quarantines if testing protocols are established.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers on Thursday voted for proposed legislation creating a liability shield for protection against lawsuits during declared emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic, and are asking Republican Gov. Brad Little to call the Legislature back into session to pass it. A majority of House and Senate lawmakers on the Judiciary and Rules Working Group said such a law is needed to protect government entities and private businesses. Some lawmakers opposed to the legislation said a liability shield will remove incentives for businesses and government to take precautions. Little is the only one who can call the part-time Legislature back into session, which otherwise wouldn’t meet until early January. Lawmakers in favor of the legislation say current law leaves businesses and schools open to lawsuits during an emergency. As an example, one lawmaker noted that a family could sue if a child got the coronavirus at school, passed it on to a grandparent who died as a result. Businesses could also be sued if someone believes they became infected while at the business, lawmakers said.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: A dozen Bradley University students, including some who attended a social gathering after leading freshmen orientation programs this month, have tested positive for COVID-19, the school said. After the Peoria school learned of the new cases on July 23, it determined after testing and contact tracing that the outbreak apparently stemmed from a small off-campus gathering in which attendees didn’t wear masks or practice social distancing, Bradley spokeswoman Renee Charles said. Officials said they don’t believe it was connected to the orientation sessions that preceded the party. “This event highlights the importance of remaining vigilant about engaging in behaviors proven to slow the spread of the virus,” Bradley President Stephen Standifird said in a message Monday. “Face masks, physical distancing and frequent hand washing matter. This case also highlights the importance of an aggressive testing and contact tracing routine.” Some of the students became infected after attending outdoor and indoor orientation activities on July 20 and July 21 at the 5,000-student campus. Attendees who were determined to have spent more than 15 minutes with one of the infected students were notified by a phone call or text message, but school officials said they don’t think the risk of transmission was high during the sessions because attendees had to wear masks and adhere to social distancing. The school said it plans to resume in-person classes in late August, but that it is monitoring a recent increase in the number of cases and emergency room visits for COVID-19 symptoms in the Peoria area.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana will keep its coronavirus restrictions in place for at least most of August, with Gov. Eric Holcomb choosing to encourage compliance with safety measures amid continued concerns about recent growth in the state’s COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Holcomb announced that statewide limits including crowd sizes for restaurants, bars and public events would remain in effect until Aug. 27. The Republican governor lifted the state’s stay-at-home order and began easing business restrictions in early May, but he has delayed the final lifting of crowd limits for the past month. Holcomb is leaving it up to city and county officials to take any more aggressive measures, such as closing bars, which have been linked to a rise in cases among young adults across the country. That’s despite fears among federal officials that Indiana and other Midwestern states could see a significant jump in COVID-19 infections. Although Indianapolis officials have ordered bars in the city to shut down, Holcomb emphasized that steps as wearing face masks as required under a new state mandate and proper distancing should be followed to slow the virus’ spread.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:A person who played in a league July 22 at the Greater Des Moines Softball Complex has tested positive for COVID-19, according to a news release. The infected person played in the 7:30 p.m. league, the release said. Upon learning of the case on Wednesday, the city notified other players, staff and umpires who were present, the announcement said. High-traffic areas at the adult softball complex, located at 4980 N.E. 46th St., are disinfected multiple times daily, according to the city. Officials advised people who believe they might have been exposed to monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19 and follow guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The city prohibits patrons who were exposed from returning to the facilities until they complete a home isolation period per CDC recommendations, the news release said.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The Kansas State High School Activities Association is allowing all fall high school sport competitions in Kansas to move forward as scheduled despite the coronavirus pandemic. Its executive board narrowly defeated a motion that would have delayed the start of fall competitions, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. The decision means fall sports and activities programs can start practices on Aug. 17 and competitions can move forward as scheduled. However, local school boards will still be able to change sports schedules within their districts.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The Old Lou Brew Craft Beer Festival planned for Aug. 29 has been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The event will next be held in 2021. “Old Lou Brew is becoming one of the city’s favorite beer festivals just because it’s so relaxed and fun in Old Louisville’s beautiful Central Park. We will be back better than ever, as soon as it’s safe, hopefully next summer,\" Old Louisville Neighborhood Council director Shawn Williams said. The event typically features Kentucky's finest independent brewers and a half-dozen food trucks and acts as a fundraiser for the Old Louisville Neighborhood Council.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Eleven Louisiana bar owners filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Gov. John Bel Edwards, arguing his coronavirus rules limiting bars to takeout and delivery unlawfully target one business sector and impose overly harsh restrictions. The lawsuit names the Democratic governor and Fire Marshal Butch Browning, the chief enforcement officer of the virus regulations for Edwards, as defendants. It was filed in Lafayette federal court by bars located across Acadiana, including in New Iberia, Morgan City, Youngsville and Lafayette. The bars argue Edwards cannot show a “real or substantial relation” between the closure of bars to onsite drinking and the public health crisis. They say only a small number of known COVID-19 cases have been traced to bars by the state, and they say none of those cases were tracked to their businesses. Attorney Jimmy Faircloth, representing the bar owners, said Edwards’ coronavirus restrictions “may have warranted the benefit of the doubt” in the early days of the outbreak of COVID-19. But he said more scientific data is available, and he argued that data undermines Edwards’ decision. The Louisiana Department of Health said it traced 464 confirmed coronavirus infections to 41 bars, among the largest number of cases tracked to a specific type of business. Edwards banned onsite consumption at bars earlier this month after previously allowing bars to reopen with restaurants and other businesses. But the governor and his health advisers said bars have shown to be specifically problematic because people tend to huddle closely together inside without masks while drinking and lapse in their virus precautions the more alcohol they consume.\n\nMaine\n\nEastport: A cruise ship that tied up in Eastport during the coronavirus pandemic is ready to set sail. The Oceania Riviera will depart this weekend for Europe. The 785-foot ship arrived in Eastport on June 14 with no passengers and has been waiting for the green light for cruise ships to resume operations. Oceania Cruises, which owns and operates Riviera, declined to comment on why the ship is moving. But a local official told the Bangor Daily News that the ship is sailing to Europe so it can switch out the crew members who live on the ship and maintain the vessel. Cruise lines stopped sailing in mid-March after several outbreaks of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, in ships at sea. The Riviera was big enough to hold Eastport’s entire population of 1,300, and it dominated the community’s harbor.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan issued a travel advisory urging residents to avoid visiting some states with rapidly increasing cases of coronavirus and expanded mask-wearing requirements. Anyone older than age 5 will be required to wear a face covering starting at 5 p.m. Friday in all indoor public areas of businesses and buildings, including churches, offices and restaurants. Hogan’s order also expands the requirement to outdoor spaces when it is not possible to maintain social distance. “This expansion of the masking order is an action that is both fact-based, apolitical and solidly grounded in science,” Hogan said. “While it can be an inconvenience, especially in the heat, wearing a mask is the single best mitigation strategy that we have to fight the virus.” The travel advisory applies to states with positive test rates of or higher than 10%. As of Wednesday, that would include Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and Texas. Hogan said if people must visit those states, they should immediately be tested upon returning to Maryland and quarantine themselves until learning the results.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAndover: An executive at a Massachusetts facility helping create a potential vaccine for the coronavirus said Thursday that the company hopes to have the treatment ready by the end of the year. “We have the potential, subject to technical success and regulatory authorization, to manufacture up to 100 million vaccine doses by the end of this year and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021,” said Meg Ruesch, research and development leader at Pfizer Inc.’s Andover facility. The vaccine candidate, a collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech, “introduces into the body the genetic instructions for the cell to make a specific protein – in this case a SARS-CoV-2 protein – which is intended to stimulate an immune response,” she said. The data on the trials has been encouraging, she said at a news conference with Gov. Charlie Baker. She also put to rest concerns that the vaccine process is being rushed. “We don’t cut any quality corners,” she said. The Trump administration last week announced that it would pay Pfizer nearly $2 billion for December delivery of 100 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine under development. Pfizer earlier this week announced it had started a study of its vaccine candidate in the U.S. and elsewhere. That study aimed to recruit 30,000 people.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:Gov. Gretchen Whitmer tightened pandemic restrictions in northern Michigan while letting Detroit’s three casinos reopen at limited capacity after four-plus months of being closed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The new limits covering 32 northern counties match ones already in place in the rest of the state. Indoor gatherings in the Traverse City and Upper Peninsula regions – where the rate of new COVID-19 cases is lower – will be capped at 10 starting at 12:01 a.m. Friday, down from 50. Bars must close for indoor service if more than 70% of their gross receipts are from alcohol sales. The three casinos in Detroit can open Aug. 5. They will have to ban smoking and limit capacity to 15%. Tribal casinos, which are not regulated by the state, have reopened and have been operating safely, Whitmer said. Indoor theaters, gyms, bowling alleys and places like outdoor concert venues can remain open in the Upper Peninsula and much of the northern Lower Peninsula, subject to capacity caps and distancing requirements.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis:Mayor Jacob Frey ordered that indoor bar areas be closed in the state’s largest city as coronavirus cases have surged among young adults. At least nine bars have been tied to virus outbreaks, with at least seven customers testing positive. The city said more than half of its new cases are in people younger than 35 who report increased exposure in bars and at gatherings of family and friends. “A night out at the bar is too often leading to nights in the hospital for family, for friends and for neighbors,” Frey said. “By focusing on bar areas, which are proven to be hotbeds for congregation and community spread, we can help keep both Minneapolis and Minnesotans safe and can help keep trends stable.” The regulation, which goes into effect on Saturday, includes bars, nightclubs, distilleries, tap rooms and bar areas inside restaurants. Patrons can still go to these establishments but must be seated and served from socially distanced tables. City Health Commissioner Gretchen Musicant said cases have steadily increased citywide since June 21, roughly two weeks after Gov. Tim Walz issued reopening guidelines. The city is reporting a rate of 18 new cases per 100,000 people per day, significantly higher than the state’s roughly 11 per day.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: School districts have just days to submit plans for this academic year to the state, but as the deadline nears and new cases of the coronavirus continue to rise, those plans keep changing. Jackson Public Schools came out with a detailed plan in mid-July for how it was going to return students to in-person classroom instruction at the start of the school year. Children were to undergo temperature checks before getting on the bus or entering school buildings in the morning. Hand-washing and sanitization breaks were built into the school day. All students would wear masks on campus. Families had the option of keeping children at home and doing online learning with district-issued laptops, something educators said would allow for more social distancing in the classroom. The program was created after dozens of surveys, constituent feedback and hours of strategic planning among staff. But last Friday, just over a week after releasing its plan, Superintendent Errick L. Greene announced Jackson schools officials made the difficult decision to change course and educate students entirely online, at least for the fall. He said he was proud of the work that went into creating a plan to enable kids to return to the classroom but rising cases of coronavirus in the state were a undeniable concern. School districts are due to submit their plans to the Mississippi Department of Education by Friday, but there’s still uncertainty about what schooling during the pandemic will look like, just weeks from the start of the academic year. Districts have been reframing plans almost weekly as they receive updates from the state department of health.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: With coronavirus cases surging, several St. Louis-area school districts have decided to start the school year with online-only learning, while the state’s largest school district is limiting the number of days each student will attend in-person. Springfield Public Schools plan to reopen with each student attending classes for two days, and learning virtually otherwise. Republican Gov. Mike Parson was in Springfield on Wednesday and said he supported the plan, the Springfield News-Leader reported. Parson said after meeting with local educators that he understood the frustration of many parents who want their kids back in the classroom full-time. “But when you look at a Springfield school district, I would look at how big that is, and ask ‘How do you do that?’ and ‘How do you do that safely?’ ” Parson said. Meanwhile, a growing list of St. Louis-area districts will start the year with virtual instruction only. The Clayton, Parkway, Pattonville and Webster Groves districts were among those to announce their plans Wednesday. St. Louis County has no authority to mandate what schools do, but County Executive Sam Page has urged parents to opt for virtual learning.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The Montana Department of Commerce’s Office of Tourism and Business Development has launched a campaign to promote coronavirus-related safety precautions among travelers in the state. Officials announced the $5 million “Montana Aware” campaign aims to use fliers, posters and social media messages to inform the public about steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing. The state’s mask mandate is in effect for 25 counties.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Nebraska’s meatpacking plants won’t have to worry about any new safety restrictions this year, despite outbreaks of the coronavirus among their workers, after a state lawmaker on Wednesday could not secure enough support for the idea. Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha fell two votes short of the 30 he needed to introduce a bill in the waning days of the 2020 session. The Legislature’s rules only allow new bills to be introduced during the first 10 days of each session, unless a super majority of lawmakers agrees to suspend the rule. Wednesday was the 51st day of this year’s 60-day session. Lawmakers voted 28-10 to allow the new proposal. Many of Nebraska’s meatpacking plants were forced to temporarily shutter their operations earlier this year after they became among the nation’s largest coronavirus hot spots. In May, state officials acknowledged that nearly one in six coronavirus cases in Nebraska had been linked to a meatpacking plant. Conservative lawmakers argued that a new bill wasn’t necessary because Nebraska’s plants have since taken steps to protect their workers, seeking guidance from infectious disease experts at the University of Nebraska Medical Center on how to safely operate. The companies said they have introduced measures such as social-distancing and plastic barriers that separate employees who work close together.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: State casino regulators are seeking fines against two casinos and a bowling alley in rural Nevada, alleging that employees and patrons failed to comply with requirements including a mandate for people to wear face coverings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Nevada Gaming Control Board spokesman Michael Lawton said Wednesday that confidentiality rules prevent the agency from making public details of 156 open investigations or names of entities unless formal complaints are filed with the state Gaming Commission. Records showed that complaints were filed since last Friday against C.O.D. Casino in Minden and the Hotel Nevada & Gambling Hall in Ely. Representatives of each property declined telephone requests Wednesday for comment. The complaints in each case allege that during repeat visits held several days apart, state inspectors saw employees and patrons without face coverings or wearing them improperly. At the Hotel Nevada, a regulator noted that casino employees approached customers while an agent was taking photos and appeared to tell them to don face coverings. A third complaint filed Tuesday named Bowl Incline on the Lake Tahoe shoreline, where owner Curt Wegener said he was unaware until a gaming control agent visited his bowling alley bar on July 11 that Gov. Steve Sisolak had rolled back permission for bar areas to be open, effective midnight July 10.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Faced with an empty minor-league baseball stadium for the summer, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats are seeking $1 million to pay their bills during the coronavirus pandemic.The team is facing a $5.5 million loss in revenue, officials told lawmakers advising the Governor’s Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery. It leases the stadium from the city of Manchester, which would face its own budget difficulties if payments aren’t made, said Mayor Joyce Craig. “They’ve been a very significant player in the city of Manchester’s economic viability,” said state Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, D-Manchester. The team did receive $350,000 in federal funding – the maximum amount available – from the state’s Main Street relief fund. It also has applied for funding from a General Assistance and Preservation Fund for businesses and nonprofits that haven’t been able to otherwise get support. The deadline for those applications is Aug. 4. So far, the state has allocated $1 billion of the $1.25 billion in received in federal coronavirus relief aid.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New Jersey’s Labor Department said unemployment claims jumped nearly 9% last week from the previous week. New Jersey’s job market, like the country’s, continues to feel effects from the COVID-19 outbreak with more than 28,000 people seeking jobless benefits last week, up from nearly 26,000. Labor officials said there have been more than 1.4 million claims in the state since the virus first broke out here in March. So far, state officials said they have paid out $12.4 billion in state and federal benefits over 19 weeks. Last week also marked the end of the federal weekly $600 supplemental payment. About 840,000 people claimed the benefit last week, the department said. The state labor figures came out the same day a federal report indicated the nation’s economy shrank by 32.9% in the last quarter. New Jersey has among the highest unemployment rates in the country at 16.6%, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces:TriCore Reference Laboratories is establishing a branch lab on New Mexico State University’s campus to boost clinical laboratory testing capacity for the novel coronavirus in southern New Mexico. The New Mexico Department of Health will provide the university with funding to support the lab, according to a news release from the university Tuesday. The lab will begin functioning later this month. NMDOH Secretary Kathy Kunkel said in a statement the lab will increase the state’s overall testing capacity. Testing in this case does not refer to the process by which a sample is collected from somebody for a possible coronavirus diagnosis, such as a nasal swab. Testing refers to the processing of those samples to see if someone is positive or negative for the virus. Samples have often needed to be sent north to be tested. When the lab begins operating, the university release said it hopes to \"provide much-needed testing capability in the Paso del Norte region.\"\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Demand for rides from taxis and app-based services plummeted in New York City during the height of the pandemic, and only slowly started to climb back as the city re-opened, according to a report released Wednesday. New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission said trips started declining in mid-March and continued into April, falling as much as 84% from the previrus days at their lowest point. Since then, there was a gradual increase through the period until the end of June. The city data showed yellow taxis had just over 18,000 daily trips at the end of June, compared with more than 200,000 before the shutdown. The high-volume for-hire services, which includes apps like Uber and Lyft, were at more than 251,000 daily trips, down from almost 750,000 in February. The pandemic also took drivers off the road. In February, there were just under 115,000 drivers making trips, but by April, that had fallen to fewer than 29,000. At the end of June, the number of drivers had risen slightly, to 30,675.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Raleigh on Wednesday in a push to encourage more K-12 schools to reopen with entirely in-person instruction. Air Force Two landed around noon Wednesday at Raleigh-Durham International Airport ahead of planned stops at a private school and a company working on coronavirus vaccine trials. Pence disembarked the plane wearing a dark face mask. He was greeted by a small group and waved at onlookers before getting in a black SUV. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced in July that public schools can offer a mix of online and in-person instruction, though districts can choose to offer fully remote learning.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The pronounced rise of confirmed coronavirus infections around North Dakota’s capital city likely stems from multiple Fourth of July gatherings and citizens’ failure to take precautions to minimize the risk of spreading the disease, a local health official said Wednesday. Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health Director Renae Moch said there appears to be a lax attitude toward the virus and a belief that precautions such as wearing a mask don’t help. “Masks in other part of the nation are the norm, but if you’re doing it out here, you’re the minority,” Moch said. Cases in Burleigh County and neighboring Morton County have tripled this month and account for about a third of the 1,038 confirmed active cases reported Wednesday. The two counties added 36 new positive cases on Wednesday, the Department of Health reported. Burleigh and Morton counties continue to post the highest percentage of positive tests in the state at an average positive rate of 4.2% for the last 14 days, significantly higher than the statewide rate of 2.79% and Cass County’s 2.72 %, the Health Department reported. Cass County, which contains the Fargo metropolitan area, reported 10 of the 89 new positive cases Wednesday. Burleigh and Cass counties each reported one new death linked to the virus, raising the statewide death toll to 102.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio pharmacy board reversed course Thursday and tossed a rule that would have prohibited use of a malaria drug for patients with COVID-19. The decision followed public feedback and a request by Gov. Mike DeWine to ditch the rule. At issue was the prescribing of the drug hydroxychloroquine, whose effectiveness for the coronavirus has been widely questioned. On Wednesday, the pharmacy board banned its use as a coronavirus treatment, noting that the Food and Drug Administration previously revoked the emergency use of the drug. The FDA “made this determination based on recent results from a large, randomized clinical trial in hospitalized patients that found these medicines showed no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery,” the state pharmacy board said. But on Thursday, FDA Commissioner Dr. Steven Hahn said on NBC’s “Today” show that the drug’s use should be between doctor and patient. DeWine said he agreed with that assessment. “The Board of Pharmacy and the State Medical Board of Ohio should revisit the issue, listen to the best medical science, and open the process up for comment and testimony from experts,” DeWine said. The board said it decided to roll back the rule as “a result of the feedback received by the medical and patient community and at the request of Governor DeWine.” It plans to reexamine the issue along with the state medical board.\n\nOklahoma\n\nMacomb:To ensure Macomb Public Schools provide the best instruction and safety measures against COVID-19, the district has decided to push the first day of school to Aug. 19. According to Superintendent Matt Riggs, students were originally scheduled to return to school Aug. 5. “As we get closer to the start date, I just don’t feel we will be ready to provide the type of instruction we want to provide by Aug. 5,” Riggs said. Like other districts, Riggs said Macomb will offer students the opportunity to continue distance learning and in-person instruction. Riggs said although distance learning will be offered to all, details will vary for each grade. In addition to distance learning, Riggs said the district has developed policies and procedures to keep staff and students safe during in-person instruction. “We are keeping students and staff in one room and delivering meals to the classrooms to decrease the opportunities for large group gatherings,” Riggs said. “Teachers will be spacing students in their classrooms to the best of their ability.” The administrator said one of the biggest challenges the district will face is physical distancing as buildings on campus have limited space.\n\nOregon\n\nSilverton:The annual summertime festivals in Silverton might have been canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but not the Davenport International Cartoon Contest. The contest for political or editorial cartoons on any topic – as long as they’re not libelous, slanderous, racist, sexist or salacious – has been staged since 1984 in honor of Homer Davenport, Silverton’s famous political cartoonist. Entries must be original and unpublished, and the entry fee is $25 per cartoon. The deadline to enter is 5 p.m Friday. Cash prizes are $750 for grand prize, $500 for first, $300 for second and $200 for third. The work will be judged on artistic skill, clearly implied message and the cartoon’s overall appeal. Judging the contest will be state Sen. Lew Frederick, D-Portland; Dr. David Lewis, cultural anthropologist from Salem; and Oregon State Rep. Rick Lewis, R-Silverton.

Tom Wolf to provide evidence and criticizing the Democratic governor over pandemic restrictions they said will drive many of them out of business. Wolf cited rising infection rates in some hot spots when he imposed a new round of restrictions on bars and restaurants two weeks ago. Occupancy was reduced from 50% to 25% capacity, and alcohol can only be served with meals. Riki Tanaka, who owns three restaurants in lightly impacted McKean County, in the rural northwest, told a state House panel it makes no sense and “flat out isn’t fair” to lump eateries in his region with those in virus hot spots like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. He said no restaurant can survive under the limitations imposed by Wolf, noting he had to furlough dozens of workers. “Give us a fighting chance,” he said. “Let me operate my business.” Tanaka and other restaurant owners and industry officials testified at a hearing arranged by House Republicans.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lt. Gov. Dan McKee is urging owners of small businesses struggling because of the coronavirus pandemic to apply for a grant to help them recover. Applications for the Restore RI program will be available starting Monday, McKee said in a statement Thursday. The $50 million program will provide grants of up to $15,000 based on whether the business is in a severely impacted industry, the number of full-time employees, and the degree of revenue loss. Businesses will need to demonstrate at least 30% revenue loss if they are in a severely impacted industry or at least 50% revenue loss for other eligible industries. Businesses with between one and 20 employees are eligible to apply, with the exception of restaurants and caterers, which are not subject to an employee cap. Sole proprietors are eligible for the program as long as they have at least one employee in addition to the owner. Applicants must have a physical presence in Rhode Island and must be open or plan to be open within 60 days.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville:State health officials said that a child under the age of 5 died of COVID-19 in Greenville County earlier this month, marking the state's second pediatric coronavirus death reported during July. The child's death happened on July 8 and was disclosed Tuesday by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. Citing privacy concerns, a spokesperson for the agency did not provide the child's age or gender. The spokesperson also would not provide details about when the child tested positive for COVID-19, whether the child had underlying health issues or where the child was hospitalized. Asked why almost three weeks passed before the child's death was reported, the spokesperson responded in an email, \"A delay in the reporting of an individual’s death during this pandemic is most often the result of ensuring the death is accurately classified. DHEC crosschecks the initial information reported to us when a COVID-19 death occurs with the information listed on the official death certificate when that document is submitted to the agency.\" On July 11, DHEC reported that a child under the age of 5 from Chester County died of COVID-19. DHEC said at the time that it was the first COVID-19 death of a child in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Top South Dakota Republican lawmakers said they would rather wait until the legislative session in January to decide how to use most of the federal coronavirus aid the state has received. Following a conference call with Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday night, Republican legislative leaders said they were following the current negotiations in Congress over the new coronavirus aid package and hoping that Congress would extend the deadline beyond the end of the year to allocate most of the $1.25 billion the state has received. If that happens, there might not be a special session this fall, said House Majority Leader Lee Qualm, a Platte Republican. Qualm cautioned that it might be a couple of weeks before Congress completes the rules for spending the aid, saying, “There’s still some things up in the air.” The state has spent about $75 million of the aid, with most of that going toward unemployment benefits. As leaders figure out what to do with roughly a billion dollars of what’s left, the governor told lawmakers that if Congress extends the deadline, there would likely be no need for a special session, according to state Sen. Lee Schoenbeck, a Watertown Republican. Republicans said the Legislature needs time to make sure the money has the most impact. It would allow legislative committees to vet the allocations, rather than deciding in a rushed special session. Senate Majority Leader Kris Langer, a Republican from Dell Rapids, said she is hoping Congress also allows state governments to put some of the federal funding towards covering losses in revenue. But Democrats, who hold a minority in the Legislature, argued that waiting to spend the money until next year would be too late for people and businesses struggling from the pandemic. Senate Minority Leader Troy Heinert, a Democrat from Mission, called for legislators to convene as early as September, creating a task force of convening committees.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Supreme Court heard oral arguments Thursday over whether to keep absentee voting open to all eligible voters for the November election becauser of the coronavirus pandemic. The hearing came on the last day to request absentee ballots for the Aug. 6 primary election. Last month, a state court judge ordered the absentee expansion during the pandemic, and the Supreme Court decided against blocking it for the primary. The first day to request absentee ballots for the general election is Aug. 5, likely requiring the court to rule quickly. Tennessee election officials have opposed the expansion of absentee eligibility, arguing it is unfeasible for the 2020 elections and citing some issues experienced in other states. The groups that sued, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have argued that without the expansion, Tennessee would make many voters choose between risking their health at the polls or forgoing their constitutional right to vote.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, said he will take hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, a day after testing positive for the virus at the White House. “My doctor and I are all in,” he told Sean Hannity on Wednesday night on Fox News, adding that he will start the regimen in the “next day or two.” Hydroxychloroquine, a drug typically used to prevent and treat malaria and certain autoimmune conditions, has been touted by President Donald Trump as a possible cure for COVID-19, despite research that has shown that the drug is not effective in treating the virus. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration withdrew its emergency-use authorization for the drug, warning against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial because of the risk of heart rhythm problems. The agency also has listed other safety issues associated with the drugs, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries and liver problems and failure. Gohmert was scheduled to fly to Texas on Wednesday morning with President Donald Trump, but tested positive at the White House and did not go on the trip. He said he does not have any COVID-19 symptoms but will self-quarantine for 10 days.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The Washington County School Board voted unanimously to enact the official plan for students to return to school, just as Utah's largest union of teachers announced opposition to reopening on the regular schedule this fall. Board Superintendent Larry Bergeson said students will be required to wear masks, but that the situation is fluid and might be subject to change. Schools are set to reopen Aug. 13 for in-person school on a traditional schedule from Monday through Friday. Friday will be an early release day for all K-12 students for deep cleaning and staff training. On Fridays, intermediate schools will dismiss at 11:45 a.m., middle and high school will dismiss at 12:30 p.m. and elementary schools will dismiss at 1:15 p.m. Face coverings are required for all staff and students, with the exception of those that have qualifying health conditions. Parents and students will have options for in-person or virtual at-home learning and there is a \"blended in-person/virtual combination\" option where students can do both depending on qualifying health conditions. On buses to and from school, students and all bus drivers must be wearing face coverings. In the classrooms, teachers are also required to wear face coverings and sanitize or wash their hands frequently.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state reported its first new death from the coronavirus in 43 days on Thursday, bringing the state’s total number of deaths since the pandemic began to 57. “We have been uniquely fortunate to have been spared such a loss for many weeks,” said Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine in a written statement. The state also reported one new case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. The state is maintaining a relatively low rate of new positive cases because of “the cooperation and sacrifices Vermonters,” he said. “However, while we are hopeful that together, our efforts will keep us from experiencing more illness and deaths in the future, we must be prepared for the fact that the virus is not going away anytime soon,” Levine said. “I ask everyone in Vermont to join me in honoring this latest loss by recommitting to doing everything we can to keep each other safe and prevent further spread of this virus.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: Busch Gardens Williamsburg said it plans to reopen in early August. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Wednesday that the park’s parent company did not provide details on when the reopening would be. The park is owned by SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. “The company expects its Busch Gardens theme park in Virginia to commence a phased reopening in early August 2020,” the company said in a news release. The announcement did not say whether the Water Country USA park would reopen, as well. Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Water County USA have been closed since March. Busch Gardens Williamsburg is one of the state’s biggest tourist attractions and economic boosters. Another popular park, Kings Dominion in Hanover County, remains closed.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: As a $600 weekly bonus to those seeking unemployment benefits in Washington expired, the state saw a slight dip in new weekly claims, which remained at high levels as the coronavirus pandemic continues to affect the state’s economic recovery. More than 1.2 million people have filed claims for unemployment since early March when the pandemic job losses began, and more than 966,000 people who filed initial claims have been paid. To date, the state has paid more than $8.7 billion in benefits, two-thirds of which is federal money that is providing the unemployed with an additional $600 a week on top of the state’s weekly maximum benefit of up to $790 per week. That $600 weekly bonus is technically set to expire Friday, but the cutoff was effectively June 25, owing to how states process payments. Congress has not been able to reach agreement on an extension. The number of new claims for unemployment benefits in Washington last week – 28,840 – was down 1.7% from the previous week.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University will move more fall semester courses to a remote format than originally planned because of the coronavirus pandemic. “This transition will allow us to continue to monitor the status of the pandemic in our community, further reduce density inside our classroom facilities, and preserve, as much as possible, the important on-campus experience for our freshmen,” Marshall President Jerome Gilbert said in a statement. Gilbert said most sophomores, juniors and seniors will attend classes online that are broadcast live and recorded. He said freshmen, some graduate students and most professional students can expect a combination of online and face-to-face instruction. Marshall’s fall semester is set to begin on Aug. 24. Students can move into residence halls starting Aug. 15. In Morgantown, West Virginia University has pushed back the start of its semester by one week to Aug. 26 and also is switching some courses to online instruction.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Rural counties in northern Wisconsin that had largely been immune from the coronavirus pandemic are now seeing a surge in cases, with Iron County now having the state’s highest rate of active confirmed COVID-19 infections. The number of confirmed infections in Iron County was in the single digits for four months before spiking in July, with 75 total cases. Of those, 68 are of residents and seven are of nonresidents. The cases are spread throughout the county. Thirty-eight people have recovered, three have been hospitalized and one has died, Wisconsin Public Radio reported Thursday. Zona Wick, the former county health officer who has been rehired as a public health nurse during the crisis, said the spike is a result of “quarantine fatigue.” That led to people casting aside social distancing for graduation parties, Fourth of July gatherings and other social events where the disease spread, Wick said. The low numbers “lulled people into complacency, into saying, ‘Hey, things are safe here. It’s just our family. It’s just our friends. It’s just people we know.’ … And the virus doesn’t care,” Wick said. Only four of Wisconsin’s 72 counties showed more active cases than recovered ones, according to the state Department of Health Services. Those were Iron, Juneau, Langlade and Menominee counties. Two others, Taylor and Washburn counties, had the same number of active and recovered cases. All six are rural counties. On Wednesday, Trempealeau County public health nurse Kaila Baer said in a statement that the western Wisconsin county was “on the edge of moving to severe risk.” It had the seventh-highest case rate in Wisconsin per 100,000 people, Baer said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The coronavirus pandemic has prompted cancellation of a charity antelope hunt that has drawn teams of famous, powerful men to central Wyoming for more than 75 years and now faces growing criticism that ceremonies tied to the event crudely and inaccurately appropriate Native American culture. The Lander One Shot Antelope Hunt has been held every year since 1944. Participants have included Roy Rogers, Peter Fonda, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, Vice President Dick Cheney, 16 astronauts and the governors of 30 states. Wyoming’s governors have participated in all but two hunts since 1954. This year, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon was planning to invite Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, a fellow Republican, to be on his team, according to Gordon’s office. The mid-September hunt has raised millions of dollars for conservation-oriented causes but lately has faced criticism for associated ceremonies in which politicians, including former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat now running for U.S. Senate, have worn indigenous women’s headscarves designating them as “losers” of the event. Hickenlooper in 2018 wore a native headdress designating him a “winner” of the hunt, Wyoming Public Radio reported recently. Although the hunt takes place on the high plains – prime territory for social distancing – and rural Wyoming has escaped the worst of the virus outbreaks, banquets associated with the event draw hundreds of people. Meanwhile, several of this year's eight, three-man teams dropped out amid concern about traveling during the pandemic, said Vickie Hutchinson, a hunt organizer and executive director of the Water for Wildlife Foundation. The hunt is the latest major outdoor event in Wyoming to fall victim to COVID-19. Cheyenne Frontier Days, a two-week rodeo and Western culture festival that would have wrapped up last weekend, also was called off at a cost of millions of dollars to the state capital economy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/31"}]}

But the U.S. Department of the Interior order signed by Obama noted McKinley had never been there and has no \"significant historical connection to the mountain or to Alaska.\"\n\nTrump reverted the name back to Mount McKinley on Monday, Jan. 20 in a order that partially reads:\n\n\"President William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States, heroically led our Nation to victory in the Spanish-American War. Under his leadership, the United States enjoyed rapid economic growth and prosperity, including an expansion of territorial gains for the Nation. President McKinley championed tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing, boost domestic production, and drive U.S. industrialization and global reach to new heights. He was tragically assassinated in an attack on our Nation’s values and our success, and he should be honored for his steadfast commitment to American greatness.\"\n\nAccording to the McKinley Presidential Library and Museum, assassin Leon Czolgosz \"was an anarchist who believed the centralized powers of the presidency were too great for one man.\" McKinley was shot on Sept. 5, 1901 and died on Sept. 14.\n\nThe order says Obama renaming the peak in 2015 was \"an affront to President McKinley’s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice.\"\n\nA president can change the name of landmarks within the U.S., but there's no promise the world will follow the change on the Gulf.\n\nRead this:Will Mississippi have daylight saving time this year?

Mexican states border the Gulf, including: Campeche, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Yucatan. Cuba also has some coastline facing the Gulf.\n\nWhy is the Gulf named for Mexico?\n\nAccording to the Texas State Historical Association, the area spanning from the west side of Florida to skirt the southern coast of the modern U.S. and along a large portion of Mexico was considered Spanish waters for about 150 years after the area was discovered by Europeans.\n\nThe bay was most often called Seno Mexicano, meaning gulf or bay, but it was also sometimes referred to as Golfo de Nueva España and Golfo de México.\n\nThe area was mapped by the Spanish starting around the 1540s.\n\nHas it ever been called the Gulf of America before?\n\nThough the title of the order refers to restoring names, it does not reference any time the body of water was called the Gulf of America in the past.\n\nMore:Biden pre-emptively pardons Mississippi's Bennie Thompson of House Jan. 6 panel\n\nWhy is the Gulf so important to the United States?\n\nThe Gulf region accounts for about 14% of crude oil production in the country.

Service was swiftly restored to the popular short-form video app Sunday, although Apple and Google haven't returned it to their app stores for downloading.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Sunday that he would issue the order on his first day as a second-term president \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\n\"The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\" Trump promised.\n\nWhether Trump's executive order can truly halt the law temporarily isn't clear.

Ezell further directed agencies to submit plans by Jan. 31 to permanently fire the employees.\n\nThe memorandum includes a template email to the federal workforce urging them to report any effort to “disguise” diversity programs “by using coded or imprecise language.” The message threatens “adverse consequences” for employees who don’t report such practices.\n\nEzell’s memo also orders agencies to “cancel any DEIA-related trainings.”\n\n- Davis Winkie\n\nU.S. Coast Guard announces \"surge\" in capabilities in response to Trump’s executive orders\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard announced Tuesday that in response to Trump's executive orders, it will immediately surge capabilities to counter illegal immigration. The surge would include more boats, cutters, aircraft, and specialized forces to increase Coast Guard presence in six locations including the southeast border around Florida. The Coast Guard said it was to prevent mass illegal migration from Haiti and Cuba. Another area would be the southwest border between the U.S. and Mexico in the Pacific.\n\n“Together, in coordination with our Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense teammates, we will detect, deter and interdict illegal migration, drug smuggling and other terrorist or hostile activity before it reaches our border,” said Adm. Kevin Lunday, the Coast Guard’s acting commandant.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump revokes Secret Service protection for John Bolton\n\nOn his first day in office, President Trump not only revoked the security clearance of his former National Security Adviser John Bolton but also his U.S. Secret Service protection.\n\nThis was not the first time Trump had stripped the advisor turned critic of the Secret Service detail. In September 2019, after Trump ousted Bolton from his position, he suspended the protection within hours. Bolton was subsequently granted security by former President Joe Biden.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Bolton said he was “disappointed but not surprised” that Trump had decided to terminate the protection.\n\n--Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump defends Jan. 6 pardons, release of Proud Boys, Oath Keepers leaders\n\nPresident Donald Trump defended his sweeping pardons for violent offenders from the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack – and commuting the sentences of Proud Boys and Oath Keepers members – arguing they’ve been treated more unfairly than murderers.\n\n\"Murderers today are not even charged,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “You have murderers that aren't charged all over. You take a look at what's gone on in Philadelphia, take a look at what's gone off in L.A.”\n\nTrump’s claim that people are not charged with homicide in major U.S. cities is false.\n\nTrump added that the Jan. 6 defendants “have already served years in prison,” even though many were only recently sentenced. “And they’ve served them viciously. It's a disgusting prison. It's been horrible. It's inhumane. It's been a terrible, terrible thing.”\n\nAsked about commutations he gave to leaders of the far-right groups Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, Trump said: “I thought their sentences were ridiculous and excessive.”\n\nTrump pardoned more than 1,500 people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack and commuted sentences of 14 others, all members of either the far-right group Proud Boys or Oath Keepers.\n\nThat includes Stewart Rhodes, the former leader of the Oath Keepers, who had received the second-longest sentence of 18 years for his role in the riot. Rhodes left a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, early Tuesday.\n\nRelatives of Enrique Tarrio, former leader of the Proud Boys who received the longest sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy, said they expected his release on Tuesday.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nTrump open to Musk buying TikTok\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he is open to Elon Musk buying TikTok one day after the president issued an executive order that halts enforcement of a ban on the mega-popular video app for 75 days.\n\n“I would be, if he wanted to buy,” Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nMusk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, emerged as a potential buyer days before the application was set to shut down.\n\nThe president said he’s also open to another tech giant to acquire TikTok: Larry Ellison, the chief technology officer of Oracle. Ellison was present at the White House with Trump.\n\n“I have the right to make a deal. So the deal I'm thinking about Larry, let's negotiate in front of the media,” Trump said, adding that he met with the wonders of TikTok and said that the company should sell to someone in the United States and give half to the U.S. government.\n\n“They'll have something that's actually more valuable because they have the ultimate partner, and the United States will make it very worthwhile for them in terms of the permits and everything else,” Trump said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump meets with Republicans at the White House, set to make announcement about infrastructure\n\nDonald Trump is meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune. While the meeting is private, the GOP officials are expected to discuss Trump's top GOP priorities, including implementing mass deportations, hitting foreign countries with tariffs and more.\n\nTrump will speak momentarily about a new infrastructure investment, a bipartisan priority across Washington.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhere's Reagan? White House says website will bring back bios soon.\n\nWhen Donald Trump's team took over the White House website this week, it made quick work of taking down web pages espousing the views of the previous administration.\n\nA silhouette of Trump and a bold-faced \"AMERICA IS BACK\" message appeared on the homepage. New links to presidential statements and remarks appeared along with the text of a mountain of newly signed executive orders.\n\nBut what was missing from the revamped White House website was nearly as noticeable to frequent visitors: pages promoting tourism, equity, internships, and information about former American presidents of both political parties. Bio pages for former U.S. presidents including Republican stalwarts Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan turned up error messages along with those of Democrats Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama, and Bill Clinton.\n\nThe White House indicated the errors were unintended and temporary. \"It's day two. We are in the process of developing, editing and tweaking the White House website. As part of this ongoing work, some of the archived content on the website went dormant. We are committed to reloading that content in a short timeline,\" said principal White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields.\n\n– Francesca Chambers and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMexican president says country will allow 'Remain in Mexico' policy\n\nMexico’s president suggested her country will let migrants wait for asylum hearings in Mexican territory after Donald Trump said he’d reinstate a program known as the “Migrant Protection Protocols.”\n\nOn Tuesday, President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo said Trump’s day-one declaration mimics his 2018 order, with which Mexico complied. The country allowed thousands of asylum-seekers to wait in cities along its northern border for immigration court hearings in the U.S.\n\n“We have our own migration policies,” she said during a news conference. “But we’re also a humanitarian government.”\n\nMexico will consider repatriating some foreign nationals, she said. The program, also called “Remain in Mexico,” was used during the first Trump administration to return nearly 70,000 people to Mexico to await court hearings, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\nSheinbaum Pardo also noted that few migrants are reaching Mexico’s northern border with the U.S. as a result of Mexico’s own immigration enforcement.\n\n– Lauren Villagran\n\nTrump executive order restricts birthright citizenship; states sue\n\nDonald Trump issued an executive order Monday that will end automatic citizenship for children whose parents are foreign nationals, whether they're here legally or not.\n\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of 18 states sued Trump and federal agencies in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, claiming the order violates the Constitution. The ACLU filed a separate legal challenge in New Hampshire on behalf of immigrant advocacy organizations on similar grounds.\n\nIt would, they said, upend a foundational aspect of the United States of America: that anyone born here is from here.\n\nThe executive order, called \"Protecting the Value and Meaning of American Citizenship, would prevent federal agencies from issuing Social Security cards, passports or welfare benefits to U.S.-born children in a sweeping reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States.\n\n– Lauren Villagran\n\n'I got to use it': Donald Trump's evolution from TikTok foe to a fan\n\nDonald Trump says he wants to \"save TikTok.\" But during the final months of his first term as president in 2020, he tried to shut down the wildly popular social media video app.\n\nIt marks a dramatic evolution as Trump begins his second term. His previous administration raised concerns about TikTok sharing personal data with the Chinese government.\n\nBut Trump is now shrugging off the same risks as he's getting hailed as TikTok's savior after seeing its benefits help him connect with young voters en route to winning back the White House.\n\n\"Because I got to use it,\" Trump told reporters Monday during a wide-ranging Oval Office media session when asked why he changed his mind about TikTok. \"And remember, TikTok is largely about kids, young kids. If China is going to get information about young kids, I don't know. To be honest with you, I think we have bigger problems than that.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump says he fired Biden appointees; chef Jose Andres says he resigned\n\nDonald Trump on Tuesday said he plans to remove over 1,000 appointees from the administration of former President Joe Biden and that he had fired four individuals immediately, including celebrity chef Jose Andres and former top general Mark Milley.\n\nHowever, Andres said on social media that his two-year term on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition was already over. The Spanish chef, whose World Central Kitchen food aid program feeds people impacted by disasters, said he submitted his resignation last week.\n\n\"My Presidential Personnel Office is actively in the process of identifying and removing over a thousand Presidential Appointees from the previous Administration, who are not aligned with our vision to Make America Great Again,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social overnight.\n\n\"Let this serve as a notice of dismissal,\" Trump wrote and named Milley, Andres, his former Iran envoy Brian Hook and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who Biden appointed to an export council. \"YOU'RE FIRED!\", he wrote.\n\n– Reuters\n\nElise Stefanik and Democratic senator clash over Israel\n\nAt her confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Elise Stefanik clashed with Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAsked by Van Hollen if she subscribed to Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich's view that Israel has a \"biblical right to the entire West Bank,\" Stefanik said she did.\n\n\"Peace and stability\" in the region would be \"very difficult to achieve...if you continue to hold the view that you just expressed,\" Van Hollen shot back.\n\nPressed by Van Hollen on whether she believes Palestinians have a right to self-determination, Stefanik responded \"I believe the Palestinian people deserve so much better than the failures that they've had.\"\n\nShe added, \"I want to ensure that, number one, we bring the hostages home.\"\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBishop directly asks Trump to have 'mercy' for LGBTQ children, immigrants unlawfully in US\n\nBishop Mariann Edgar Budde directly addressed Donald Trump during a sermon on Tuesday, telling the president sitting in the audience at a prayer service at the National Cathedral \"In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy on people in our country who are scared.\"\n\n\"There are gay, lesbian, transgender children in Democratic, Republican, independent families, some who fear for their lives,\" Budde said. She also reflected on working-class immigrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying: \"They may not be citizens or have proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals.\"\n\n\"I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away, and that you help those who are fleeing war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome here,\" said Budde, who has previously criticized the president.\n\nTrump during all three of his presidential campaigns called for mass deportations and other immigration crackdowns, often using dehumanizing language about immigrants.\n\nHe also often insulted transgender people on the campaign trail, and one of his first orders in office on Monday was that the federal government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, that are not changeable.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nElise Stefanik pushed on Elon Musk's gesture that drew online comparison to Nazi salute\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., pressed Elise Stefanik on a gesture Elon Musk made at a speech on Monday after Donald Trump's inauguration that drew accusations of being a Nazi salute. But Stefanik, who has said combatting antisemitism would be one of her main objectives as U.S. ambassador to the UN, said the gesture was nothing of the kind.\n\n\"No, Elon Musk did not do those salutes,\" she said. \"The American people are smart and they see through it. They support Elon Musk.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League later said the gesture was not a sieg heil, calling it an \"awkward\" move during a \"delicate moment\" in a statement met with some disagreement.\n\nMurphy read several comments from Christian nationalist and white supremacist groups, including the Proud Boys, praising Musk's gesture.\n\n\"I simply don't believe that if a member of the squad made that same gesture last night, that there wouldn't be commentary from you and others,\" he said, referring to the \"squad\" of Progressive Democratic congressmembers.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nElise Stefanik calls UN resolutions aimed at Israel 'antisemitic rot'\n\nElise Stefanik, Donald Trump's pick to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, promised at her confirmation hearing to \"stand with Israel\" and called United Nations resolutions aimed at Israel are \"antisemitic rot.\"\n\n\"I was interested in this position because, if you look at the antisemitic rot within the UN, there are more resolutions targeting Israel than any other country, any other crisis combined,\" she told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The UN has accused Israel of \"extermination\" and possible war crimes in Gaza.\n\nStefanik also touted that she voted to defund UNRWA, the U.N. refugee agency for Palestinians. The agency was the largest humanitarian organization still working in Gaza, until its operational ability in the enclave was hit when Israel banned it in October after around a dozen of its members were found to be on Hamas' payroll or involved in its Oct. 7 attack.\n\nShe praised then-U.S. ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan for opposing a UN resolution passed 50 years ago that classified Zionism as \"a form of racism and racial discrimination\" and said she would hope to embody \"that type of leadership\" in the position.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat's on Trump's schedule today?\n\nTrump is attending a service of prayer for the nation on Tuesday at Washington's National Cathedral, joined by Vice President JD Vance and other dignitaries.\n\nAfterward, he'll meet with congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, before delivering remarks on American infrastructure.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump, Vance attend national prayer service in Washington\n\nDonald Trump and Vice President JD Vance are attending a prayer service at the National Cathedral, alongside their spouses, first lady Melania Trump and second lady Usha Vance.\n\nThe cathedral calls the gathering a \"service for the nation, not any politician or political party.\"\n\n\"This service was designed to pray for unity, reconciliation and bridge-building in our divided nation,\" the cathedral says on its website.\n\nBishop Mariann Edgar Budde is preaching at the service, but it will also feature worship rooted in Jewish, Muslim and other faith traditions.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho is Usha Vance? Here's what to know about the second lady\n\nUsha Vance, 38, is the nation's new second lady, but she's been out of the spotlight more than the first couple or her husband, Vice President JD Vance.\n\nChilukuri, 38, was born and raised in San Diego as a child of Hindu Indian immigrants. She met her husband at Yale Law School when they were assigned as partners for their first major writing assignment.\n\nBefore Usha Vance hit the campaign trail with her husband, she worked at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a law firm that specializes in litigation, corporate, professional liability, employment, financial restructuring, tax and executive compensation. She left the firm when JD Vance secured the vice-presidential nomination.\n\n– Amaris Encinas\n\nTrump's Treasury pick clears critical hurdle\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday gave their stamp of approval to Scott Bessent, Trump's nominee to lead the Treasury Department.\n\nTwo Democrats, Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, joined their Republican colleagues in voting for Bessent.\n\nIf Bessent is confirmed by the entire Senate, he'll be the first openly gay Treasury secretary in U.S. history, as well as the highest-ranking LGBTQ official.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nThe world's richest people attended Trump's inauguration. Here are their net worths\n\nSome of the richest people in the world were among the guests invited to witness President Donald Trump take the oath of office for the second time on Monday.\n\nAs some of Trump's top allies, the tech billionaires were given VIP seating next to top U.S. officials and his family for the swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol rotunda. Seated in front of Trump's incoming Cabinet were Amazon Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos and his fiancee Lauren Sanchez, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.\n\nTheir presence in Trump's orbit underscores not only the incoming administration's pro-business agenda, but the likely influence the world's wealthiest tech leaders could have on U.S. policy.\n\nRead more: Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg attended Trump's inauguration: What are their net worths?\n\n– Kathleen Wong\n\nTrump talks Greenland, tariffs in Oval Office press conference\n\nDonald Trump turned an executive order signing ceremony into an impromptu press conference Monday, answering dozens of questions from reporters.\n\nTrump talked about imposing 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, mulled sending military special forces into Mexico to fight drug cartels, and said he’s not confident a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas will hold. He also reiterated his desire to acquire Greenland from Denmark.\n\nThe press conference came after a long day of events that saw Trump sworn into office at the U.S. Capitol, where his inauguration ceremony was moved because of frigid temperatures.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nElise Stefanik to face questions at UN ambassador confirmation hearing\n\nElise Stefanik, Donald Trump's pick as the U.S. ambassador at the United Nations, will face senators on Tuesday morning at her confirmation hearing begins.\n\nStefanik, a Republican lawmaker from New York and top Trump ally, has served five terms in Congress. Her close relationship with Trump briefly stirred speculation that he was considering her for vice president.\n\nStefanik garnered praise in conservative circles for now-viral questions she posed to the heads of three Ivy League schools at a congressional hearing on campus antisemitism, as protests against Israel's actions in Gaza rocked colleges nationwide.\n\nAfter Stefanik asked the three presidents – of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania–- whether calling for the genocide of Jews called for disciplinary action, they waffled and gave indirect answers. Two of the three later resigned.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBiden leaves letter for Trump\n\nDonald Trump discovered a personal letter Monday in the Oval Office from former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe letter-writing tradition from outgoing to incoming presidents dates back to 1989 when Ronald Reagan left a brief letter for George H.W. Bush.\n\nTrump declined to reveal the contents of Biden’s letter Monday.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nStewart Rhodes, former Oath Keepers leader, free after Trump pardon\n\nPeople convicted in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, began to be released from prison overnight after President Donald Trump approved pardons Monday for nearly 1,600 people charged in the riot.\n\nTrump commuted the sentences for 14 defendants, including Stewart Rhodes, the former leader of the Oath Keepers militia who received the second-longest sentence of 18 years. Rhodes left a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, early Tuesday.\n\nRelatives of Enrique Tarrio, former leader of the Proud Boys who received the longest sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy, said they expected his release on Tuesday.\n\nNeither Rhodes nor Tarrio entered the Capitol, but they were convicted of seditious conspiracy for helping plan the attack.\n\n--Bart Jansen and Reuters\n\nTrump pardons nearly 1,600 people charged in Jan. 6 attack on U.S. Capitol\n\nPresident Donald Trump pardoned nearly all the 1,600 people charged in the Capitol attack Jan. 6, 2021, fulfilling a campaign pledge critics said would \"endorse attacks on democracy.\"\n\nThe total includes hundreds of people convicted of felonies for attacking police and temporarily interrupting Congress from certifying the 2020 election victory of former President Joe Biden.\n\n\"These are the hostages,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"Full pardon. This is a big one. We hope they come out tonight.”\n\nAbout 1,270 have been convicted and 1,100 have been sentenced in the riot, according to the Justice Department. About 600 people were charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding law enforcement.\n\nThe list of those receiving clemency included 14 people receiving commutations to end their sentences, including top members of two militia groups, the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. Stewart Rhodes, who was leader of the Oath Keepers, had been sentenced to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy.\n\n\"We're excited about it,\" Ed Tarpley, a Rhodes lawyer, told USA TODAY. “This is an answered prayer and we're all very happy.\"\n\nNayib Hassan, a lawyer for Enrique Tarrio, who received the longest sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy as a leader of the far-right Proud Boys gang, said he wasn't sure if Tarrio got a pardon or commutation.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nCarrie Underwood sang 'America the Beautiful' after technical difficulties\n\nCountry music star Carrie Underwood took the stage during Trump's inauguration to sing \"America the Beautiful,\" but she paused as there appeared to be a technical glitch. She proceeded to sing the song without instrumentation before shaking Trump's hand.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat balls did President Trump and Melania Trump attend?\n\nPresident Trump sported a tuxedo and bowtie and first lady Melania Trump wore a black and white dress as they concluded Inauguration Day at a trio of balls in downtown Washington, D.C.\n\nJust before 10:30 p.m. Monday, the first couple shared their first dance to an Elvis-style rendition of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" at the Commander in Chief Ball. Vice President JD Vance, also in a tuxedo, and second lady Usha Vance, in a sparkly blue dress, joined the president and first lady for a spin on stage.\n\nTrump later made an appearance at the Liberty Ball and ended his night at the Starlight Ball at Union Station. In one of his final dances of the evening, the president took to the floor alongside his family members and the Vances to Frank Sinatra’s “I Did It My Way.”\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nWhat executive orders did Trump sign on Monday?\n\nPresident Trump began signing his first wave of executive orders around 7 p.m. Monday, after his swearing-in ceremony and a parade, and just before the evening's inaugural balls that stretched well past midnight.\n\nHe started by rescinding 78 executive orders approved by his predecessor Joe Biden, including efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, protect federal lands from oil drilling and reduce the cost of prescription medications.\n\nTrump also declared a national border emergency and ordered the U.S. armed forces to repel \"forms of invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border, including illegal migration and drug trafficking. The new president's moves also include halting enforcement of a ban on TikTok in the U.S. for 75 days, mandating how the U.S. government recognizes gender on federal documents, and changing the official names of Mount Denali in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n- Laura Villagran and Bart Jansen\n\nWhat did Trump say during his inauguration speech?\n\nTrump said during his inauguration ceremony in the Capitol rotunda that he believes \"a tide of change is sweeping the country.\"\n\n\"I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success,\" he said.\n\nBut the president also laid out a list of conservative priorities and campaign promises, including declaring an emergency on the southern border, rolling back climate change priorities and more. He also hit Panama's management of the Panama Canal and vowed to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nIn swearing-in ceremony, President Trump's hand wasn't on his Bible. Does it matter?\n\nDonald Trump had his left hand down at his side – and not on one of the two Bibles his wife Melania held up for him – during his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nDoes it matter? Not according to the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the incoming president must swear an oath of office, saying: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nBut the Constitution also protects religious freedom and holds that \"no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\"\n\n− Josh Meyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/20/immigration-gender-energy-trump-executive-orders/77836651007/", "title": "Immigration, gender, energy: Trump executive orders to remake ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump signed dozens of executive actions Monday, including a massive pardon of almost everyone convicted in the Jan. 6 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and a measure to stave off the shutdown of TikTok.\n\nTrump's orders also encompassed sweeping moves to reimagine the country's relationship with immigration, its economy, global health, the environment and even gender roles.\n\nHe began signing the executive orders around 7 p.m. Monday, after his swearing-in ceremony and a parade, and just before the evening's inaugural balls were slated to begin.\n\nHe started by rescinding 78 executive orders approved by his predecessor Joe Biden, including efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, protect federal lands from oil drilling and reduce the cost of prescription medications.\n\nTrump's new orders also include mandates for how the U.S. government recognizes gender on federal documents and change official names of Mount Denali in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. And they could grant the second Trump administration expansive authority to enforce border security and immigration laws.\n\nMore:Donald Trump sworn in as 47th president, declares 'golden age of America begins right now'\n\nUnder the national border emergency declaration, the Trump administration intends to use the U.S. military to crack down on illegal immigration, combat transnational gangs and drug trafficking and execute his promised mass deportations of undocumented migrants.\n\nOfficials said Trump will also declare a \"national energy emergency\" to end the so-called \"electric vehicle mandate,\" Trump's phrase for an Environmental Protection Agency rule requiring automakers cut greenhouse gas emissions in some new vehicles.\n\nUnder the national energy emergency declaration, Trump will also prioritize oil drilling, officials said, and the administration will immediately begin the process of pulling out of the World Health Organization, which it has been a part of since 1948.\n\nMore:Donald Trump to rename Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America' and change Denali to McKinley\n\nDonald Trump issues executive order to halt TikTok ban – but is it legal?\n\nAs one of his first moves following his inauguration, President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday aiming to halt enforcement of a ban on TikTok in the U.S. for 75 days.\n\nThe order comes after TikTok abruptly shut down in the U.S. over the weekend, only to say it was working to restore service based on assurances from Trump. Service was swiftly restored to the popular short-form video app Sunday, although Apple and Google haven't returned it to their app stores for downloading.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Sunday that he would issue the order on his first day as a second-term president \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\n\"The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\" Trump promised.\n\nWhether Trump's executive order can truly halt the law temporarily isn't clear. The law works by imposing a $5,000 fine on companies for each user who accesses TikTok through their services. That includes companies like Apple and Google that provide platforms to download and update apps and companies like Oracle that provide internet hosting services.\n\nTrump pardons 1,500 defendants charged in Jan. 6 attack\n\nPresident Donald Trump pardoned about 1,500 people Monday charged in the Capitol attack Jan. 6, 2021 , fulfilling a campaign pledge critics said would \"endorse attacks on democracy.\"\n\nThat figure would represent almost all of the nearly 1,600 people who were charged in the riot by the fourth anniversary Jan. 6, according to the Justice Department .\n\nAbout 1,270 people have been convicted from charges associated with the riot. More than 1,000 pleaded guilty and 260 were convicted at trials. The guilty pleas included 327 people admitting felonies and 682 people admitting misdemeanors.\n\n\"These are the hostages, approximately 1,500 for a pardon.

We hope they come out tonight.”\n\nTrump to declare 'border emergency,' send troops to the border\n\nTrump is expected to sign nearly a dozen executive orders on border security and immigration under the auspices of a national border emergency.\n\nIncoming White House officials said early Monday that the president will order U.S. armed forces to \"repel forms of invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border, including illegal migration and drug trafficking.\n\nMore:Donald Trump to declare federal government recognizes two sexes — male and female\n\nThe administration is expected to suspend refugee resettlement, finish building the border wall, suspend entry of nationals from \"countries of concern\" and attempt to end the constitutionally guaranteed right to citizenship for children born in the U.S. to some foreign nationals.\n\nTrump also plans to use the military to target drug cartels as \"global terrorists\" and use the military to combat them, though officials declined to provide details on the rules of engagement.\n\nDeclaring a ‘national energy emergency’\n\nTrump on Monday said he would declare a “national energy emergency,” though what exactly that entails is not clear.\n\nTypically, when a president declares a national emergency, certain statutory powers become available that were not before, according to research by the Brennan Center. Previous presidential emergencies have included natural disasters, maritime issues, security concerns and public health emergencies.\n\nNo national energy emergency has previously been declared, but during in 1977 energy crisis, President Jimmy Carter let states declare their own energy emergencies, which allowed them to suspend certain environmental regulations.\n\nBy calling a national emergency on energy, Trump said he plans to prioritize domestic oil and gas production – even as U.S. crude oil production hit an all-time high over the past year.\n\nTrump on Monday also revoked a non-legally binding executive order by Biden in 2021 setting a target of making 50% of all new vehicles sold in the United States by 2032 electric.\n\nUS to leave Paris climate agreement for second time\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order that begins the process of withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, which he also did during his first term in office. In addition. the White House sent a letter to the United Nations, informing the international body of the decision.\n\nThe historic 2015 deal includes almost 200 nations in a single agreement to combat global warming by lowering emissions of greenhouse gasses from fossil fuels.\n\nIn 2017 Trump said he would remove the U.S. from the agreement. Due to the agreement's terms, the withdrawal did not go into effect until November 20 of 2020.\n\nThis time around the withdrawal could take less time as the new administration is no longer bound by the original three-year commitment, according to Reuters.\n\nJust as Trump signed an order to remove the U.S. from the Pais agreement on the first day of this term, President Joe Biden signed an Executive Order to rejoin the agreement on Jan. 20, 2021, the first day of his presidency.\n\nThe U.S. formally rejoined on Feb. 19, 2021. Under Biden, in November 2021, the U.S. helped lead negotiations that set new emission reduction standards as part of the agreement.\n\nUS to pull out of World Health Organization\n\nTrump's day-one executive order to pull out of the WHO fulfills a campaign promise to reject global institutions. Health experts worry it isolates the U.S. with consequences for pandemic and disease response and diplomatic relations worldwide.\n\nHe began the process of pulling out from WHO back in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Biden ended that effort and recommitted to the organization, which prioritizes addressing infectious diseases and providing basic health infrastructure, especially in low- and moderate-income countries.\n\nThe executive order said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO \"due to the organization’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\" It also cited the \"unfairly onerous payments\" the U.S. has made to support the organization.\n\nFederal employees required to return to work in-person\n\nTrump signed an executive order directing department heads to require federal employees to \"return to work in-person at their respective duty stations on a full-time basis\" immediately, with exemptions allowed.\n\nOnly about 15% of federal employees work in D.C., according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The remaining 85% are spread across big cities like Dallas and state capitals like Carson City, Nevada.\n\nThey are, among others, the postal workers, the civil engineers and the Transportation Security Administration agents. They are mostly represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, a union of 750,000 federal workers.\n\nThis return-to-office mandate is expected to get major pushback from federal workers, he recently reinforced his strategy, threatening to take legal action against the AFGE's latest contract that extended remote worker protections until 2029.\n\nTrump revokes Biden order aimed at cutting prescription drug costs\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order revoking a 2022 Biden-era order aimed at bringing down the cost of prescription medications.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, Biden's major healthcare and climate package, granted Medicare the ability to negotiate lower prices for 10 frequently prescribed drugs with pharmaceutical companies, beginning in 2026.\n\nLast week, the Biden administration added another 15 drugs that treat cancer, diabetes and asthma, including Ozempic, to the list of medications up for negotiation in 2027.\n\nPharmaceutical CEOs and lobby groups have pushed Trump towards scrapping the measures. It is unclear if Trump's executive order would have any impact on the policy, since it was approved by Congress as part of the act.\n\n'Male and female' only\n\nTrump will declare that the federal government only recognizes two sexes − male and female − in a move an incoming White House official described as \"restoring sanity.\"\n\nThe State Department, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies will be tasked with enforcing the directive, which applies to passports, visas and other government documents, according to the incoming White House official.\n\nNew names from the mountains to the Gulf\n\nIn one of the orders, Trump is expected to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X, formerly known as Twitter, Monday morning.\n\nLeavitt's tweet also signaled Trump would rename Mount Denali, the highest peak in North America, back to Mount McKinley. The Alaskan government had long recognized the mountain as Mount Denali, and President Barack Obama renamed it at the federal level in 2015. Trump's action will revert to the pre-Obama name.\n\nMexico, which also borders the gulf that bears its name, is unlikely to go along with the renaming. After Trump initially floated the idea, President Claudia Sheinbaum noted the body of water that separates Miami from Cancun has been known as the Gulf of Mexico since the 17th century.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, Sudiksha Kochi, Eduardo Cuevas", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/biden-laws-passed-priorities-to-get-done-executive-orders/index.html", "title": "5 significant bills and 5 executive orders Biden signed in his first ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden took the oath of office a year ago with the country facing challenges not seen in generations.\n\nOn top of a once-in-a-century pandemic, the new President inherited an economy that had crumbled as Covid-19 cases rose and a nation so divided that his predecessors supporters had stormed the US Capitol two weeks prior in a bid to stop his ascent. Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden signed the American Rescue Plan, a sweeping $1.9 trillion package, into law in early March. The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/immigration/2025/01/21/is-trump-closing-the-border-latest-details-amid-executive-orders/77848879007/", "title": "Did Trump close the border? Latest details amid executive orders", "text": "The first day of President Donald Trump's second administration brought major changes for immigrants and communities along the United States' southern border.\n\nMany of the executive orders issued by Trump did away with immigration and border security policies put in place during the Biden administration. These changes have major impacts not only on the communities of the Borderland but also on migrants seeking to enter the United States and communities south of the border in Mexico.\n\nTrump has ended the CBP One app, called for reinstating a plan to keep asylum-seeking migrants in Mexico, sent federal troops to the border, and even changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nHere is an update from the El Paso border region:\n\nPhotos show migrants boarding military aircraft for deportation at Fort Bliss\n\nPhotos released by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt show handcuffed undocumented immigrants boarding a U.S. military aircraft for a deportation flight at Fort Bliss. The images, posted early Friday on Leavitt’s official X account, show at least 70 Guatemalan migrants who had recently crossed the border.\n\nWhile deportation flights are common, the use of military aircraft makes this operation notable. The deportation comes as the U.S. Department of Defense plans to deploy 1,500 active-duty troops to the southern border.\n\nBishop speaks out on Trump's authorization for ICE to target churches\n\nThe Diocese of El Paso joined representatives from El Paso county and civil society today to condemn President Trump's reversal if the long maintained sensitive locations policy.\n\n\"For years this policy has ensured a basic level of sacred trust for a healthy functioning community,\" Bishop Mark Seitz of the El Paso Diocese said from the steps of the Saint Patrick Cathedral on Mesa Avenue. \"Reversing the sensitive location undermines community trust. It is a frontal attack on parents and students. It is an attack on the sick. It is an attack on those who worship God. Crucially, the reversal of this policy is a necessary first step for a troubling campaign of terror.\"\n\nSeitz was joined by local officials El Paso County Attorney Christine Sanchez, City Rep. Chris Canales, who represents District 8 on the City Council, and El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, who stood along with Leah Hanany of the El Paso Independent School district board trustee, District 1, in condemning the policy change. Their voiced opposition to the policy shift was were joined by representatives from local organizations, including Glenn Fennelly of Doctors of the World, Melissa Lopez of Estrella del Paso, Susan Goodell of El Pasoans Fighting Hunger, and Dylan Corbett of Hope Border Institute.\n\n\"It is a massive change in policy that can have such a negative impact on our community,\" Canales said. \"We want people to feel safe when they are going to attend school or dropping their kids off or when they are seeking care at the hospital. Discouraging people those types of activities doesn't make our communities safer.\"\n\nThe sensitive locations policy has been maintained since the Obama administration. It protected schools, hospitals, social services, places of worship from indiscriminate immigration enforcement operations.\n\nThe Trump administration announced the reversal of the policy on Jan. 21.\n\nActivists hold protest on Paso del Norte bridge in solidarity with deported migrants\n\nThree solemn angels stood atop the Paso del Norte bridge Jan. 23 in a show of solidarity with migrants set to be deported to Juárez.\n\nThe sun flickered off the glitter on their white painted faces, as they silently held cards protesting the violence that migrants face in Mexico.\n\nThe demonstration in support of the deportees was organized by the Juárez based Colectivo por la Paz Ángeles Mensajeros (Messenger Angels Peace Collective), which has held regular protests related to migrants over the past 10 years.\n\n\"We are in solidarity with our brothers and sisters migrants who are to be deported from the United States,\" said Carlos Mayorga, the collective's founder said as he stood on the bridge that connects Juárez and El Paso. \"Authorities know that Mexican territory, and specifically Juárez, is a very dangerland where organized crime and mafias continue to operate that puts at risk migrants who were deported or who are stranded after their CBP One appointments were canceled.\"\n\nThe group called on the government of Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum to provide work permits to the migrants who are currently stranded in Mexico following the closure of CBP One on Monday.\n\nTrump sends military troops to border\n\nMilitary troops are expected to be deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border as part of President Trump's crackdown on immigration and border security. This is part of his plans to declare gangs, such as Central America's MS-13 and drug cartels, as terrorist organizations and invoke the 1798 \"Aliens Enemies Act\" to target and remove gang members.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that as many as 1500 active duty troops could be deployed.\n\nA formal announcement is expected later in the day Wednesday.\n\nMexico begins to construct structures to receive deported Mexican Nationals\n\nMexico has started to construct temporary faculties in cities across the country's northern border with the United States in preparation to receive Mexican nationals who are deported as part of President Trump's mass deportation campaign.\n\n\"The reception centers on the border are being installed,\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told the press on Wednesday as she started her morning press conference.\n\nThe reception center in Juárez began on Tuesday. The facility is near the Paso del Norte border crossing.\n\nShe has directed members of her cabinet to supervise the construction of the centers.\n\nPresident Sheinbaum also announced that she had spoken with Acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman on Tuesday. She also spoke with in coming Secretary of State Marco Rubio in what she called \"a very cordial\" call.\n\nTrump allows ICE arrests inside churches and schools\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman stated Tuesday that Federal immigration authorities will be permitted to carry out actions near schools and churches, a shift from previous policy that considered these \"sensitive areas.\"\n\n“Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense,” the statement read, according to CNN.\n\nEl Paso Bishop Mark Seitz previously said that he hoped that the Trump administration would respect these places.\n\nMexico plan for accepting Mexicans deported by the US?\n\nMexico has begun preparations to receive any Mexican nationals deported under President Trump's plans for mass deportation.\n\nThe plan was presented by the Mexican Secretary of the Interior, Rosa Icela Rodríguez during the daily press conference with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbuam. The program is entitled \"Mexico te abraza,\" or \"Mexico embraces you,\" which will receive migrants deported from the United States giving them access to health care, transportation, and telephone services.\n\nPresident Sheinbaum called for calm within the Mexican immigrant community in the United States.\n\nWill Mexico agree to 'Remain in Mexico' program with Trump?\n\nPresident Trump issued an executive order on Monday that eliminated the CBP One application, which has served as a legal pathway to request asylum in the United States.\n\nIn place of the application, the Trump administration is seeking to re-implement the Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly known as the \"Remain in Mexico\" program, which required during the first Trump administration that asylum seekers must wait in Mexico as their cases advance. Any reactivation of the protocol must be negotiated with Mexico.\n\nPresident Sheinbaum in Mexico said on Tuesday that migrants from other countries will continued to be treated under humanitarian norms, but that they would seek to remove migrants back to their countries of origin when applicable.\n\nThe U.S. State Department announced Tuesday that they will be re-implementing the Migrant Protection Protocol, which will require asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while they await their cases.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if Mexico had agreed to this policy change.\n\nDid Trump change the name of the Gulf of Mexico?\n\nTrump ordered the official renaming of the \"Gulf of Mexico\" to the \"Gulf of America\" in one of the first executive orders issued.\n\nHowever, this order only applies to documents, including maps, produced by the U.S. federal government. For the rest of the world, the name will continue to be \"the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\n\"For us and the rest of the world, it continues to be called the Gulf of Mexico,\" President Sheinbaum said during her morning news conference on Tuesday,\n\nThe Mexican president has long rebuffed Trump's assertion of the name change.\n\nWhat’s happening at El Paso border? Is the border closed?\n\nThe border crossings between Juárez and El Paso are open. Foot and vehicular traffic are moving normally following Monday's inauguration and spree of issuing executive orders.\n\nLegal crossings between border cities like Juárez and El Paso are normal and have helped form a special transborder culture. Many people in the Borderland may live, work, or go to school on one side of the border and travel daily across to the other side.\n\nA group of immigrants with appointments scheduled through CBP One arrived at the Paso del Norte border crossing on Tuesday but were not permitted to cross. The application was officially closed Monday following the inauguration.\n\nWhat’s did Trump say about border patrol jobs?\n\nPresident Trump issued an executive order on the first day to freeze all federal hiring. The freeze does not apply to hiring for immigration enforcement or national security.\n\nHe will need to greatly expand the federal employees of the Customs and Border Protection agency and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, both of which are under the Department of Homeland Security, if he can carry out his promises of mass deportation and of shutting down the southern border.\n\nThe president had promised to boost the number of border patrol agents during his campaign, NBC News reported in October 2024.\n\nWhat executive orders did Trump issue related to the border?\n\nPresident Trump issued a flurry of executive orders following his inauguration, many of which affect communities along the southern border with Mexico.\n\nThe new administration shut down the CBP One app, which permitted migrants to schedule appointments to request asylum in the United States. The action now leaves hundreds of thousands of migrants in Mexico without the means to seek asylum in the United States, as the Biden administration completely barred seeking between ports of entry in June 2024.\n\nHas Trump issued an emergency declaration at the border?\n\nPresident Trump declared an national emergency along the southern border on Monday.\n\nThe action is meant to repel what he alleges are \"forms of invasion,\" which include drug trafficking and irregular migration between ports of entry on the U.S./Mexico border. The executive order will deploy U.S. military personnel to the border, increase unmanned aerial surveillance systems, and expand the construction of the border wall.\n\nThe executive order comes as illegal border crossings between ports of entry are at their lowest levels in the last five years.

His nomination drew opposition from senators of both parties after he admitted to employing a housekeeper who was not legally authorized to work in the country. He was also accused of permitting practices that violated workers’ rights. A confirmation hearing was never held.\n\nFlash forward eight years, and Trump said he’d nominate Puzder to serve again, this time in the plum position of European ambassador.

Former President Joe Biden delisted the group from that designation shortly after taking office to help facilitate humanitarian assistance to Yemen. The State Department deemed it a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group last year over its sustained attacks on commercial shippers in the Red Sea.\n\nRepublicans had urged Trump before his inauguration to redesignate the militant group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Under the Biden administration, the Iranian proxy group was delisted as an FTO\n\nThe group's designation becomes effective in 30 days.\n\n\"Under President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’ capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea,\" the release says.\n\nThe Trump administration will also end its relationship with groups that \"have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis’ terrorism and abuses,\" it says.\n\n– Gabrielle Banks and Francesca Chambers\n\nSenate Democrats ask to meet privately with Pete Hegseth amid new allegations\n\nDemocratic senators on the Armed Services Committee asked Pete Hegseth to privately meet with every member of the committee after his former sister-in-law claimed in signed testimony that he terrified his ex-wife and drank to the point of vomiting and passing out, among other accusations.\n\nThe Senate has yet to vote on Hegseth's nomination for secretary of Defense, but the committee approved it Monday by a vote of 14-13, along party lines.\n\n\"We request that Mr. Hegseth meet privately with every interested lawmaker on the committee before the Senate votes on his nomination so that we can have frank discussions about the new information that has come to light,\" the group, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said in a joint statement. \"It would be irresponsible and contrary to our constitutional duty for the Senate to vote to confirm this nomination before such meetings have occurred.”\n\nIn the affidavit, the former wife of Hegseth's brother claimed Hegseth's ex-wife hid in closet and set a code word for when he threatened her. Hegseth was dragged out of a strip club where he was getting lap dances in military uniform, and drank to the point of vomiting and passing out, she claimed. He also made racist and sexist comments disparaging Hispanic people and Muslims, according to the document.\n\nHegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, dismissed all the allegations as false.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nJohnson creates new subcommittee to investigate Jan. 6. attack\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced a new select subcommittee on Wednesday that would continue House Republicans’ investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\n“House Republicans are proud of our work so far in exposing the false narratives peddled by the politically motivated January 6 Select Committee during the 117th Congress, but there is still more work to be done,” Johnson said in a statement.\n\nThe purpose of the new subcommittee, Johnson said, is to “uncover the full truth” of the riot.\n\nThough the House did form a bipartisan select committee in 2021 to investigate the attack, Republicans have criticized the panel's findings. The select committee released a final report in 2022 that alleged the “central cause” of the attack was Donald Trump, “who many others followed.”\n\nIn response to Johnson’s announcement, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who chaired the bipartisan committee, told reporters on Wednesday that you can’t “unwrite history.”\n\n“I stand by the work that we did,” he said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMurkowski knocks Trump's Jan. 6 pardons\n\nLisa Murkowski, one of the most moderate lawmakers in Congress, knocked Trump's pardons and commutations for over 1,500 people charged and convicted in the Jah. 6 Capitol riot.\n\n\"The Capitol Police officers are the backbone of Congress— every day they protect and serve the halls of democracy,\" the Alaska Republican shared on X. \"I strongly denounce the blanket pardons given to the violent offenders who assaulted these brave men and women in uniform.\"\n\nMurkowski voted to impeach Trump during his second impeachment trial, when he was charged with inciting the Capitol attack.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDonald Trump's transportation secretary pick clears hurdle\n\nSean Duffy, Trump's pick to lead the Transportation Department, cleared a pivotal hurdle on Wednesday. The Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously to send his nomination to the larger Senate, where he'll have his final confirmation vote soon.\n\nDuffy, a one-time Wisconsin lawmaker and reality star, told senators he believes Boeing requires \"tough love\" from federal officials, and he would allow an ongoing safety probe into Elon Musk's Tesla to continue if he's confirmed.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWoman convicted in Capitol riot turns down pardon from Donald Trump\n\nOne of Donald Trump's first acts in office was offering pardons or commutations to nearly 1,600 people charged or convicted in the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nBut at least one recipient isn't accepting the offer. Pamela Hemphill of Boise, Idaho, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail in connection with the riot. She said her attorney told her Tuesday that she had received a pardon, but she refused it.\n\n“Accepting the pardon would be an insult to the Capitol Police officers, to the rule of law, to our nation,” Hemphill told the Idaho Statesman. “The J6 criminals are trying to rewrite history by saying that it was not a riot; it wasn’t an insurrection. I don’t want to be a part of their trying to rewrite what happened that day.”\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nDemocrats, GOP split over the idea of billionaires acquiring TikTok\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that he was open to billionaire Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, or Larry Ellison, co-founder of the software company Oracle, to acquire TikTok – an idea that Democratic lawmakers have balked at.\n\n“That’s so predictable. I mean, anytime he can use his influence to lavish favors on rich friends, he does it. And this has all been just so predictable,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who voted in favor of the bipartisan law.\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said that Musk acquiring TikTok was “always a concern” of hers.\n\nBut Republicans have been open to the idea.\n\n“Somebody needs to take ownership of this from the Chinese Communist Party. I don't know who it is. I mean, if it's a U.S. citizen all the better,” said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo. TikTok's parent company, Bytedance, is based in Beijing.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\n‘We all taste like chicken’: GOP senator praises Trump’s anti-DEI move\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., commended Trump’s order placing federal DEI workers on leave.\n\n“The best way to stop discriminating against people on the basis of race of gender is to stop discriminating against people on the basis of race and gender,” Kennedy told reporters Wednesday.\n\n“The truth is the American people don't think about race or gender merely as much as some folks in Washington want to pretend,” he continued.\n\nKennedy said he would prefer a more race- or gender-blind approach to hiring, and expects to see this under the Trump administration.\n\n“To a bear, we all taste like chicken,” Kennedy said.– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMusk casts doubt on Stargate, a new AI venture touted by Trump\n\nDonald Trump’s billionaire ally Elon Musk undercut an announcement the president made Tuesday about a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to build artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nTrump said the project, named Stargate, would be a joint venture between ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, with each committing $100 billion for immediate deployment.\n\nAn announcement of the venture by Open AI CEO Sam Altman on X, was immediately derided by Musk.\n\n“They don’t actually have the money,” wrote Musk. Moments later, he added another tweet saying, “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.”\n\nMusk has been a vocal critic of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman since the company became a for-profit entity.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump says he’s not looking to hurt Russia…but\n\nPresident Trump urged Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to “stop this ridiculous” war with Ukraine or face consequences.\n\nTrump said he would be forced to “put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia” to the United States in a post on Truth Social.\n\n“I’m not looking to hurt Russia. I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin,” he said, saying the warning was a “favor” to Russia, whose economy he said was “failing.”\n\n“Let’s get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with,” he said.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson doesn’t ‘second-guess’ Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday he wouldn’t second-guess President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon nearly 1,600 people charged with the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nJohnson said peaceful protests should never be punished and that the Justice Department was weaponized against Trump’s supporters. But the pardons also covered hundreds of people convicted of assaulting police and other violence.\n\n“It was a terrible time and a terrible chapter in America’s history. The president has made his decision. I don’t second-guess those,” Johnson said. “We believe in redemption. We believe in second chances.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson calls Biden pardons of relatives ‘shocking’\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., slammed former President Joe Biden for pardoning his son Hunter, brother James and other relatives before leaving office Monday and said legislative action was possible.\n\n“It was shocking,” Johnson said. “It was breathtaking to us.”\n\nHe noted that Democrats criticized President Donald Trump four years earlier at the possibility he would pardon allies before leaving office. But Johnson said the pardons confirm GOP suspicions about what he called “the Biden crime family.”\n\nHouse Republicans conducted an impeachment inquiry against Biden, which included close scrutiny of Hunter Biden and James Biden for their overseas business deals. The former president denied wrongdoing and said he never benefited from the deals. Hunter Biden was convicted of gun and tax charges. Lawmakers urged the Justice Department to investigate James Biden.\n\nThe former president pardoned Hunter Biden WHEN and James Biden and other relatives on his last day in office Monday.\n\n“To us it is disgusting,” Johnson said. “There is a lot of attention that will be paid to this and we will be looking at it as well.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nPolice groups say Trump pardons for Jan. 6 ‘sends a dangerous message’\n\nTwo law enforcement groups – the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police – said President Donald Trump’s pardon of people charged in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, “sends a dangerous message” and they should have served their entire prison terms.\n\n“When perpetrators of crimes, especially serious crimes, are not held fully accountable, it sends a dangerous message that the consequences for attacking law enforcement are not severe, potentially emboldening others to commit similar acts of violence,” the two groups said in a joint statement Tuesday.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police had endorsed Trump in September and both groups said they have longstanding and positive relationships with him. But they voiced disappointment with Trump pardoning nearly 1,600 people, including hundreds convicted of assaulting police officers, and ended the sentences for 14 people.\n\n“The IACP and FOP firmly believe that those convicted of such crimes should serve their full sentences,” the groups said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump to address world leaders gathered in Davos\n\nPresident Donald Trump will be addressing leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday via video, according to organizers.\n\nThe address will start 11 a.m. and last 45 minutes.\n\nThe first day of the meeting coincided with the inauguration of President Trump, and the organizers expect the White House to be a “key topic” as Trump’s policy will impact the global economy in many ways.\n\n“These include imposing steep tariffs on other major economies, reassessing long-held military and diplomatic alliances, reforming multilateral institutions and rolling back an array of US regulations,” according to organizers.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nSen. Sanders defends Gabbard, Trump’s pick to lead DNI\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday night defended Tulsi Gabbard, President Trump’s pick for director of national intelligence, in an interview on CNN.\n\nSome lawmakers have called Gabbard, a former congresswoman from Hawaii, a likely “Russian asset,” and expressed concerns over Gabbard’s 2017 trip to Syria, where she met with former Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nGabbard, who was a Democrat when she served as a congresswoman from 2013 to 2021, supported Sanders during his presidential run in 2016.\n\nSanders said Gabbard “took a lot of heat” for supporting him over Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe said he was not worried about her visit with Assad.\n\n“The idea that you should not sit down with your adversaries whether it is Iran, whether it's China, whether it's North Korea, whether it's Syria, whatever it may be,” he said. “I don't think that that's a valid criticism.”\n\nHe went on praise Trump for his own meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2018.\n\n“Donald Trump did the right thing. Every once in a while, he does,” he said.\n\nHe said he had not made up his mind on how he would vote for Gabbard during the upcoming Senate confirmation hearing.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump orders end to FAA diversity hiring practices\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a document Tuesday evening that directed the Federal Aviation Administration to cease its use of diversity, equity and inclusion hiring authorities. He singled out disability hiring authorities in particular.\n\n“During the prior administration … the FAA betrayed its mission by elevating dangerous discrimination over excellence,” the president argued. He further decried the recruitment of \"individuals with serious infirmities,\" in a rebuke of disability hiring efforts.\n\nThe country's aviation watchdog used expedited disability hiring authorities for at least a decade, including during Trump's first administration. Such programs permitted hiring managers to bypass the competitive hiring process to appoint professionally qualified candidates with disabilities.\n\nIn the document, Trump argued pro-diversity hiring practices \"[penalize] hard-working Americans who want to serve in the FAA but are unable to do so, as they lack a requisite disability or skin color.”\n\nThe agency, however, struggles with large shortages of air traffic controllers, who must meet stringent medical requirements that disability hiring authorities could not circumvent.\n\nThe move is one of many executive actions focused on the federal workforce enacted since Trump took office Monday afternoon. His other actions addressed DEI hiring more broadly, froze hiring in most executive agencies and directed a return to in-person work for many federal employees, among other directives.\n\n– Davis Winkie\n\nTrump executive order inverts civil rights hiring protections\n\nPresident Donald Trump revoked a 1965 civil rights executive order Tuesday, rolling back authorities long used to prevent employment discrimination by federal contractors, subcontractors and grant recipients. He also ordered agencies to plan potential civil rights investigations against private sector entities who embrace diversity hiring.\n\nIn his own executive order, Trump attacked such policies as “dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called ‘diversity, equity and inclusion.’”\n\nTrump’s order flips the script, arguing that affirmative action provisions are illegally discriminatory. Federal agencies instead must now “enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.”\n\n– Davis Winkie\n\nWhat is on President Trump’s schedule today?\n\nTrump will sit down today for an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity for the first interview from the Oval Office, according to Politico. The interview will air at 9 p.m.\n\nThe president is also expected to meet a group of “centrist Republicans” at the White House, the outlet also reported.\n\nThe White House has not yet released a public schedule for the president. The in-town press pool (the rotation of the small group of reporters who shadow the president) has been asked to report at 9 a.m.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJustice Department career officials reshuffled to advance Donald Trump's immigration agenda\n\nJustice Department officials were swiftly reassigned in the wake of President Donald Trump's Monday inauguration in order to help align the department with the new administration's priorities – particularly on immigration, a department official familiar with the matter told USA TODAY.\n\nIn a speech to supporters Monday, Trump described immigration as his \"number one issue.\"\n\nThe swift moves at the Justice Department, which were in place by Tuesday, show the administration moving to enact his immigration agenda at the department level.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump pardons founder of Silk Road\n\nPresident Trump said Tuesday night that he had given a “full and unconditional” pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, an online black market which enabled users to buy and sell illegal drugs.\n\nThe president announced his decision on Truth Social.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump announces private sector investment in AI\n\nPresident Trump announced on Tuesday a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to build artificial intelligence infrastructure, aiming to outpace rival nations in the business-critical technology.\n\nTrump said the joint venture, called Stargate, will build data centers and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States. ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, along with other equity backers of Stargate, have committed $100 billion for immediate deployment, with the remaining investment expected over the next four years.\n\nAnd CEOs Masayoshi Son of SoftBank and Sam Altman of OpenAI CEO along with Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison joined Trump at the White House for the launch.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/10/trump-executive-order-obama-justice-department-succession/97752898/", "title": "Without fanfare, Trump reverses Obama order on Justice ...", "text": "Gregory Korte\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — President Trump has quietly signed an executive order changing the order of succession in the Department of Justice, reversing an executive order by President Obama signed just last month.\n\nThe order appears to be the first that Trump has not signed in a public ceremony. It's dated Thursday — the same day Attorney General Jeff Sessions was sworn in — but was not posted to the White House website until Friday morning. The White House did not explain the discrepancy.\n\nThe executive order spells out who will act as the nation's highest law enforcement officer if the attorney general dies, resigns or becomes incapacitated. Such orders have been routine since the 2001 terrorist attacks, but Trump's is notable becomes it comes two weeks after he fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to defend his executive order banning travelers from seven predominately Muslim countries.\n\nThat time, Trump went outside the official order of succession — as he has the right to do — to elevate Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to acting attorney general.\n\nBecause the Senate has not confirmed any other top Justice Department officials, Boente will continue to be second in the line of succession under Trump's order, followed by Zachary Fardon, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, and Tammy Dickinson, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri.\n\nSeven days before he left office, President Obama changed the order of succession without explanation to remove Boente from the list. Obama's order had listed U.S. attorneys in the District of Columbia, the Northern District of Illinois and the Central District of California.\n\nThe top positions remain unchanged: the deputy attorney general, the associate attorney general and — at the discretion of the attorney general — the solicitor general and other assistants. But because those positions are now officially vacant, the order currently skips to the Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys.\n\nRead more:\n\nHe calls them 'big stuff,' but most of Trump's executive orders are presidential small ball\n\nTrump's executive actions come faster and in different forms than before\n\nObama's executive orders you never hear about", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/10"}]}
