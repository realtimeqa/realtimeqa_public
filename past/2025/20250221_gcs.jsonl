The Delta flight crashed while landing at the airport at around 2:45 p.m. local time, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a preliminary statement.\n\nTodd Aitken, Toronto Pearson Airport's fire chief, said during a briefing Monday night that 18 injured passengers were transported to local hospitals after the crash. Hours earlier, the airport's president and CEO Deborah Flint said there were 17 injured in the accident.\n\n\"We can now confirm that 18 injured passengers have been transported to the local area hospitals,\" Aitken said. \"We had one additional passenger recently transported to a hospital.\"\n\nThe airport was shut down for more than two hours before departures and arrivals resumed. But the FAA warned that inbound flights were still being delayed significantly at their departure airports.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFlint said operational disruptions were likely in the coming days at the airport as two of its runways will be closed for an on-scene investigation.\n\nThe airport said earlier on Monday that it was dealing with frigid temperatures and high winds as airlines attempted to catch up with missed flights following a weekend snowstorm that dumped over 8.6 inches of snow at the airport. While Aitken said it wasn't appropriate for him to comment on the ongoing investigation into the crash, he noted that the \"runway was dry and there was no cross wind conditions.\"\n\nThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada will be in charge of the investigation, according to the FAA. The National Transportation Safety Board added that it will be leading a team of U.S. investigators to assist in the investigation.\n\n“The hearts of the entire global Delta family are with those affected by today’s incident at Toronto-Pearson International Airport,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement. “I want to express my thanks to the many Delta and Endeavor team members and the first responders on site. We are working to confirm the details and will share the most current information on news.delta.com as soon as it becomes available. In the meantime, please take care and stay safe.”\n\nEndeavor Air is a wholly-owned regional subsidiary of Delta, based in Minneapolis.\n\nHow many people were on board the plane in the Toronto crash?\n\nAccording to Delta and Flint, all 80 people on board were evacuated. A total of 18 people were injured and transported to hospitals, Delta and emergency response officials said.\n\nSeventeen injured passengers were immediately transported to hospitals, the airport said in a statement Monday night. Another injured passenger was transported after the others.\n\nOf those injured, two adults were taken to two different trauma centers by air ambulance and one child was transported to a children’s hospital, according to Lawrence Saindon, a superintendent for Peel Regional Paramedic Services. All other injuries range from minor to moderate.\n\nOrnge, which provides air ambulance services, confirmed that it responded to Toronto Pearson Airport for an “aviation occurrence.”\n\nOne pediatric patient was transported to the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, said spokesperson Joshua McNamara. Two adults were flown by helicopter to Toronto hospitals, including a man in his 60s and a woman in her 40s, according to McNamara.\n\n\"We are very grateful that there was no loss of life and relatively minor injuries,\" Flint said. \"We are very focused on the care and the concern and the passengers and the crew — some of whom have already been reunified with their friends and their families.\"\n\n'It's a lot of chatter and uneasy looks'\n\nZach Nolan learned his Air Canada flight was delayed upon arrival at the Toronto airport on Monday afternoon, but he didn’t know why. After visiting Montreal for the 4 Nations Face-Off ice hockey tournament, he used the extra time to watch a match between Canada and Finland.\n\nHe was at a bar during a layover en route to see relatives in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Then, a friend texted him that a plane had crashed just outside.\n\n“I look out (the window) behind me, and I'm 90% sure that I'm looking at the plane upside down,” said the 24-year-old Winnipeg resident. Red lights flashed on the runway; flyers filled multiple seats at gates as they waited to learn what would become of their itineraries amid a ground stop.\n\n“It's a lot of chatter and a lot of uneasy looks,” he said. Nolan, who was traveling with his parents and younger brother, later learned his flight had been canceled after being pushed back multiple times. Air Canada rebooked them for Tuesday morning, and they plan to get a hotel for the night.\n\n“If I had to sum (the scene at the airport) up in one word, I’d say uncertainty,” he said.\n\nInvestigation underway\n\nThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada (Canada's version of the U.S.'s National Transportation Safety Board) will lead the investigation into this incident and said it is sending investigators to the scene. The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known.\n\n\"The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) is deploying a team of investigators following an accident involving an aircraft operated by Delta Airlines, that occurred today at the Toronto / Lester B. Pearson International Airport, Ontario. The TSB will gather information and assess the occurrence,\" a statement from the agency said.\n\nThe NTSB confirmed in a post on social media it would be investigators to assist, but added that all official communications about the inquiry will come from Canada's TSB.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on X, formerly Twitter, that he's in communication with his Canadian counterpart \"to offer assistance and help with the investigation.\"\n\nExperts weigh in on Delta flight flip-over\n\nExpert engineering, the size of the aircraft and seatbelts all likely played a factor in protecting people aboard a passenger jet that flipped over at a Toronto airport, experts said Monday.\n\nWhile it is extremely rare for an aircraft to flip on its back, they are engineered to handle it, said Mike McCormick, associate professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\nThe structural elements of an aircraft are designed so that the wings and the tail will break off and away in the event of a tip over, McCormick said. The seats are designed to withstand impacts up to 16 times the force of gravity, so they will remain in place when the plane is upside down.\n\nThat's why people are asked to be strapped in at takeoff and landing, he said. “Absent any loose things flying around the cabin, the seats are designed to keep the passengers strapped in.”\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Dinah Voyles Pulver and Minnah Arshad\n\nDelta travel waiver\n\nDelta said it had canceled its remaining flights to Toronto for Monday and issued a travel waiver for passengers traveling to, from or through YYZ through Feb. 20. Full details of the waiver are available on Delta's website.\n\nOn the heels of other aviation incidents\n\nAlthough experts have said aviation remains extremely safe, Monday's crash in Canada comes on the heels of other incidents in North America. There have been at least four major aviation disasters in North America so far this year, USA TODAY reported.\n\nOn Jan. 29, an Army helicopter collided with an American Airlines regional jet, killing 67 people near Ronald Reagan National Airport. It was the first fatal crash of a U.S. airliner in nearly 16 years.\n\nThe crash, which is currently under intense scrutiny by the NTSB for potential radio communication lapses and altimeter errors, has heightened concerns over regional flight safety and operational protocols in the industry.\n\nJust days after the crash near Washington, D.C., a medical jet carrying a child patient crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood. Seven people died, including all six on board the aircraft and another in a car on the ground.\n\nEarlier this month, a small plane carrying 10 people crashed in Alaska after experiencing a rapid loss of altitude and speed. The aircraft, heading from the village of Unalakleet to the town of Nome, was initially reported missing before it was later recovered. All 10 victims died, the Alaska Department of Public Safety confirmed.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo, USA TODAY; Reuters\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter and writes the Cruising Altitude column for USA TODAY.

The CRJ-900 regional jet had departed from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.\n\nPeter Koukov, a passenger onboard, recounted the chaotic moments after the crash.\n\n“I didn't really know anything was wrong until we hit the ground … To me, it didn't feel like there was anything out of the ordinary, and there was no announcement,” Koukov said.\n\nThe plane hit the ground then bounced in the air, almost as if “we were lifting off again,” he said, before the plane turned on its side and ended upside down.\n\nNeed a break?

And the girl sitting next to me, she's ex-military, so her and I were, like, both pretty chill.”\n\nThey unbuckled quickly from their upside-down seats and lowered themselves to the ground, he said. Though they hadn’t spoken during the flight, Koukov recalled sharing a long hug with his fellow passenger after the crash.\n\n“And then we're, like, OK, what's next? We need to get off this plane.\"\n\nTwenty-one passengers were transported to area hospitals on Monday, according to Delta, and 19 had been released by Tuesday morning. Of those injured, two adults were taken to two different trauma centers by air ambulance and one child was transported to a children’s hospital, according to local officials.\n\n“If anyone was seriously hurt or dead, it would feel very different. It’s insane that everybody is alive, it’s crazy,” Koukov said, noting the collective calmness of passengers. “It was nice to see people working together.”\n\nImmediately after the crash, Canada's busiest airport shut down all of its runways. The airport resumed departures and arrivals by 5 p.m. but cancellations and delays have since piled up. The airport's President and CEO, Deborah Flint, said during a Tuesday press briefing that the longest east-west and north-south runways on the field are expected to remain closed for about 48 hours to accommodate the early stages of the investigation.\n\nMore:Upside-down plane: Experts weigh in on Delta flight flip-over in Toronto\n\nPassengers self-evacuated\n\nAccording to Toronto Airport Fire Chief Todd Aitken, most passengers self-evacuated from the overturned jet before first responders reached the scene.\n\n\"I believe that most of the passengers self-evacuated at that time and, upon arrival, they were being escorted to a second location,\" he said during a media briefing Tuesday.\n\nCory Tkatch, a commander of operations for Peel Regional Paramedic Services, said during a media briefing on Tuesday most of the injuries were common issues like back pain, head injuries and headaches, anxiety, vomiting, and nausea due to fuel exposure. According to the airport's president, none of the injuries, including those of the two people who remain hospitalized, is life-threatening.\n\nCancellations, delays pile up at Canada's busiest airport\n\nToronto Pearson International Airport said on Tuesday that it remains open with flights arriving and departing, but advised passengers to check the status of their flight before heading to the airport.\n\nOver 200 flights in and out of the airport were canceled and 446 others were delayed by Tuesday evening, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking website. On Monday, the airport saw nearly 400 cancellations and 362 delays.\n\nToronto Pearson International Airport is the nation's most traveled airport. The facility saw more than 44.8 million passengers in 2023, said the international industry organization Airports Council International. Pearson has five main runways and 30 taxiways, according to the airport's website.\n\nCrash was the latest major aviation accident in North America\n\nMonday's crash comes amid heightened scrutiny of air travel following a series of deadly incidents in the U.S. this year.\n\nOn Jan. 29, an American Airlines regional jet and a U.S. Army helicopter collided near Washington, D.C., killing 67 people aboard both aircraft. Days later, a Medivac plane crashed in Philadelphia, killing seven people and injuring over 20 others. On Feb. 6, a plane crashed in Alaska as it flew on the state's western coast, leaving all 10 passengers dead.\n\nCanadian authorities lead investigation into the crash\n\nThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada, an agency of the Canadian government, will be in charge of leading the investigation into the cause of the crash.\n\nIn a Tuesday evening video update, Senior Investigator Ken Webster said it was too early to know the cause of the accident but that the agency would provide updates as information and analysis became available.\n\n\"The fuselage came to rest slightly off the right side of the runway, upside down, facing the other direction,\" he said.\n\nFootage of the crash shows flames erupt near the plane's tail shortly after it reaches the ground, with a massive cloud of black smoke trailing behind. Photos of the aftermath show the plane fully overturned as a fire truck hoses down the aircraft.\n\nInvestigators continue to analyze the wreckage and the runway, and Webster added that the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder have both already been removed from the scene and sent to a laboratory for further investigation.\n\nThe U.S. National Transportation Safety Board will be involved in the probe, with a team of U.S. investigators assisting Canadian investigators. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement Monday on X that FAA investigators were on their way to Toronto. He added that he has been in touch with his Canadian counterpart to offer assistance with the investigation.\n\nDelta’s incident response team deployed to Toronto Pearson International Airport Monday evening, the airline said in a statement.\n\nContributing: Nathan Diller and Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/17/toronto-flight-flipped-evacuation-experts/78993650007/", "title": "Upside-down plane: Experts weigh in on Delta flight flip-over in ...", "text": "The drill is familiar for most airline passengers: how to buckle up your seat belt, put on the oxygen masks and use the seat cushion as a flotation device. What flight crews don't tell you is what to do if you suddenly find yourself in an upside-down aircraft.\n\nFor the passengers of a Delta flight on Monday, that became an extremely crucial detail.\n\nExpert engineering, the size of the aircraft and seatbelts all probably played a role in protecting people aboard a passenger jet that flipped over at an airport in Toronto, experts said Monday, the latest in a string of high-profile crashes that have raised questions about aviation safety.\n\nThe plane, a Bombardier CRJ900, flipped upon landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport. All 80 people aboard were evacuated, according to Delta. Eighteen injuries were reported, most of them minor to moderate.\n\nMore:Investigation into why Delta plane flipped on its roof is underway\n\nThough it is extremely rare for an aircraft to flip on its back, planes are engineered to handle it, said Mike McCormick, associate professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\nThe structural elements of an aircraft are designed so that the wings and the tail will break off and away if the plane tips over, McCormick said. The seats are designed to withstand impacts up to 16 times the force of gravity, so they will remain in place when the plane is upside down.\n\nThat's why people are asked to be strapped in at takeoff and landing, he said. “Absent any loose things flying around the cabin, the seats are designed to keep the passengers strapped in.”\n\nScenes showing the cabin crew swiftly directing passengers out of the aircraft are a testament to their training, McCormick said.\n\n“Most people think of them as flight attendants serving refreshments and answering questions. Where they really perform their true function is during experiences like this when their experience and training comes into play.”\n\nDespite the high-profile crashes this year, \"we are in the safest time in aviation history,\" McCormick said.\n\nTravel safely: Sign up for USA TODAY's Travel newsletter for best trip tips.\n\nSmall size of plane cushioned fall\n\nArnold Barnett, a leading aviation safety expert and statistics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told USA TODAY he was surprised to see the plane flip over, noting the crash could add to flight anxiety after recent crashes near Washington, D.C., in Alaska and in Philadelphia.\n\nBarnett said the plane going belly-up was akin to a \"horrible rollercoaster,\" but the plane's size and passengers' use of seat belts likely helped minimize injuries.\n\n“It's the kind of thing that can be, to say the least, unnerving,\" he said, but would not necessarily cause serious injuries.\n\nThe CRJ900 jet's cabin height is roughly 6 feet, which meant people didn't have far to fall when it overturned, Barnett said.\n\nFire danger spurs speedy evacuations\n\nNajm Meshkati, professor of engineering and expert of aviation safety at the University of Southern California, said the biggest concern in any plane crash is the risk of fire. He cited a disaster in South Korea in December that killed 179 people when a commercial plane veered off the runway, slammed into a wall and burst into flames.\n\nMeshkati noted the flight crew acts as another layer of fire protection for passengers by ensuring a quick and orderly exit, which may have saved lives.\n\nHassan Shahidi, president and CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation, lauded the airport's first responders.\n\n“They were there immediately dousing the aircraft with fire-resistant foam,” he said. “The Toronto Airport is known for being on top of these emergency-type situations.”\n\nTheir training was also “very visible” Monday as emergency crews arrived moments after the crash, he said.\n\n“All these things are very important in today’s accident that passengers were able to walk out of that airplane without any fatalities.”\n\nShahidi also lauded the actions of the cabin crew “under very difficult circumstances\" that they were able to help passengers reach the exit doors and ensure they were operable. He noted crew members go through rigorous training for emergency evacuations, including in unusual circumstances such as a flipped aircraft.\n\nFrom a design perspective, the aircraft are engineered to withstand all sorts of pressures.\n\n“They are put through extreme stress tests to look at all sorts of different scenarios to ensure they’re safe,” Shahidi said.\n\nIt’s remarkable the passengers were well enough to stand and walk out of the plane, Shahidi said.\n\n“We’re thankful and grateful that there were no fatalities and people were actually walking out.\"\n\nWhat can airline passengers learn from this crash?\n\nMike Shertz has been thinking about how to get out of an upside-down plane since reading about an Azerbaijan Airlines passenger jet that crashed during an emergency landing in Kazakhstan after it was struck by Russian air defenses in December.\n\nIn that tragedy, a large section of the aircraft appeared to break off and flip. Reuters reported 38 people died in the crash and 29 survived with injuries.\n\nShertz, an emergency room physician in Oregon, operates Crisis Medicine, a training program for emergency management of trauma patients in high-risk environments. He said the No. 1 thing to remember when flying is to fasten your seat belt and make it snug.\n\nIf the plane stops suddenly, “you’re going to be shifted forward in your seat, and a couple of inches could make the difference between you hitting something in front of you,” he said.\n\nA passenger who suddenly finds themselves upside down in an airplane would be in a similar situation as someone inside a flipped car.\n\n“It’s going to be massively disorienting,” Shertz said. “People don’t spend a lot of time hanging upside down.”\n\nBefore you release your seat belt, think about where you’re going to fall, he said, noting the ceiling that is now the floor is likely to be littered with debris.\n\n“If you’re by the window you’re going to fall into the overhead,” he said, “and if you’re along the aisle you’re going to fall farther.”\n\nContributing: Zach Wichter, Nathan Diller and Thao Nguyen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/17/plane-crashes-2025-washington-alaska-philadelphia/78990206007/", "title": "Plane crashes 2025: How many in the US so far?

A total of 18 people were injured but there were no fatalities.\n\nHere's what to know about aviation accidents in the U.S. this year and how safe flying remains.\n\nHow many aviation accidents have there been this year?\n\nThere have been 94 aviation accidents in 2025, according to data from the National Transportation Safety Board. There were 63 incidents in January and 31 in February, the agency says as of Wednesday.\n\nHow many deadly plane crashes have there been in 2025?\n\nData posted by safety board reported 13 fatal aircraft accidents this year, including 10 in January and three in February as of Monday. On Wednesday the fatal midair collision in Marana, Arizona, brought the annual total to 14, though the agency's website did not reflect the latest crash as of Wednesday night.\n\nHow many major US plane crashes in 2025?\n\nThere have been several major deadly U.S. aviation disasters this year. They happened within the span of two weeks in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Alaska and Arizona.\n\nYet the Jan. 29 crash in Washington that killed 67 people is the only fatal commercial aviation crash in 2025 and in the past 15 years.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration reports aviation incidents on its website for anyone to stay updated.\n\nHow many people have died in major plane crashes this year?\n\nAt least 87 people have died in five major U.S. aviation disasters in 2025.\n\nThey are:\n\nJan. 29 (Washington, D.C.) - An American Airlines regional jet carrying 64 people and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter carrying three people collided near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport just outside Washington after the plane departed from Wichita, Kansas.

And sometimes we do. But I slept on a bench last night.\n\nThis final Columbia travelblog was going to tell you about our last few hours in South Carolina and some final observations about a charming Southern city. Instead, this is the story of one of the craziest trips of my life.\n\nPlanes, trains and automobiles. You’re not going to believe the automobile portion.\n\nAnd the day began so swimmingly. We slept in after a late night, covering Virginia’s victory over the Sooners, then got up and completed most of our work for the day by noon. We had a 7:35 p.m. flight to Atlanta, so that gave us an afternoon to get one last dose of Columbia.\n\nWe started with one final drive down our dirt road. It’s sort of crazy. We were staying in the Residence Inn of West Columbia, in the middle of a metropolitan area of 750,000, and the best route to our hotel was on a dirt road. Coming from downtown and the campus area, the best route was Leaphart Road, from which you can circle around to Highway 378 and the Residence Inn. But a shortcut off Leaphart, according to Google Maps, was Mathias Road, which meanders almost half a mile and drops you off in the Residence Inn parking lot. A nice shortcut.\n\nMathias Road is a dirt road. Oh, parts of it is gravel, but it’s an old-fashioned dirt road, that goes through huge pine trees and past some old, mostly-rundown houses. Including a dilapidated two-story house that looks straight out of the Addams Family. A haunted house deluxe. Amazing that such a place, more suited for a rural adventure, would be smack in the middle of an American metro.\n\nWe bid farewell to Mathias Road, and went to lunch at Di Prato’s, a classy deli we passed the other day. No one had told us about it, but it looked good, sitting a few blocks off campus. And it was exceptional. Wasn’t a true deli in terms of going through a line and picking our lunch out of a glass counter. Diners sit down and are waited on. But the food was fantastic. I ordered a pastrami on rye, and Saint Joe Mussatto ordered what amounted to a meat lover’s special, with ham, turkey and roast beef, with all kinds of other good stuff, on sourdough bread. Each was cut in half, we split each. The pastrami was unbelievable.\n\nAfterwards, we gave the historic South Carolina statehouse another crack, and this time we got in and even took a tour. Learned a lot about South Carolina history – the Palmetto State claims to have been instrumental in the Revolutionary War, which I don’t doubt, and it mostly avoided major Civil War battles, until, of course, Sherman’s march to the sea. Our tour guide, a woman probably in her 60s, stayed away from too much controversy but did give Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman props for not burning the main buildings of the University of South Carolina, which were being used a hospital. I don’t expect to see a statue of Sherman anytime in Columbia, but that’s OK. Small steps.\n\nWe decided to just drive around a little, maybe see some of the outlying areas of Greater Columbia. Maybe find another ballpark; I got a nice email from John Katz, president of the Columbia Fireflies of the South Atlantic League (the famous Sally League of Class A baseball). I screwed up when I wrote that the Fireflies play at the University of South Carolina’s Founders Park. The Fireflies have their own new stadium, Segra Park.\n\nIt was still happy hour at Sonic, around 3:30 p.m., so we pulled in for a drink. And while we were in line came the text. Our 7:35 p.m. flight to Atlanta was delayed until 9 p.m. Uh-oh. Our connecting flight to OKC out Atlanta was 9:47. We wouldn’t make it, although the delay was because of Atlanta weather, so there was a great chance the OKC flight would be delayed, too.\n\nWe immediately called Delta, and Delta put us on standby for a 6:10 p.m. flight to Atlanta. Scores. That would get us to Atlanta well ahead of time, and no matter what happened with that flight to Oklahoma City, we would be there to board.\n\nStill, it’s a bummer to lose control. That’s my biggest problem with flying. It’s not airplanes. It’s not even airports. It’s airlines. You place your destiny in the hands of the airlines. And when it’s not Southwest, I get really nervous. I generally like Delta and have had good luck with Delta, but Delta is no Southwest.\n\nIn fact, when OU was assigned to Columbia a week ago Sunday, we booked our travel. Then the next day, I had buyer’s remorse. Why didn’t we just drive to Columbia? It’s 16 hours, but you’re in control. You leave when you want to leave, you return when you want to return. When you travel on the fly (pun intended) during spring break season, flying is expensive and hard to book. If the Sooners had lost to Ole Miss on Friday, we might not have gotten out of Columbia until Monday anyway. If the Sooners had beaten Virginia, we might have needed to go straight to Louisville, since we needed to be there Wednesday afternoon.\n\nI left my house last Wednesday at 9 a.m. I could have left at maybe 9 p.m. Tuesday, driven into Arkansas, then motored into Columbia all day Wednesday. Wouldn’t have cost me much home time and would have allowed me many more options. Oh well.\n\nFlying standby is dicey, but the Delta rep on the phone figured we had a good chance to make it. Our other options were to rent a car one-way and drive to Charlotte, to catch a flight to Atlanta, which would be perhaps possible, or just drive straight to Atlanta, about three hours. Google maps said we would make it with plenty of time to spare. Wish we had listened.\n\nDelta attendants at the smallish Columbia airport said things looked good for us, so we hunkered down and waited. I told Saint Joe, that’s the worst thing about flying standby. You literally just sit there and wait, with few clues, and most of your flight boards, and then at crunch time, they start calling names. Our flight boarded around 6 p.m., and then our names were quickly called.\n\nWhew. That was a relief. We were on board and headed to Atlanta and our quick-change plan was going to work. Except after we taxied away from the gate, we were told by the pilot there we had a delay. Planes were not being allowed to land in Atlanta, because of storms. He twice shut down one engine, only to restart it when told there was an opening. But after almost 90 minutes on the tarmac, the pilot informed us we would be returning to the gate.\n\nWe got off the plane about 7:45 p.m. All the food joints in the terminal were closed. The line at the Delta counter was long. We just waited out the line, then finally got up there and a nice Delta agent delivered the bad news. If we missed our OKC connection, there was nothing open for Tuesday. She checked Tulsa; nothing open there, either. She checked Dallas; an 7:25 a.m. flight to DFW was available, and she put us on a contingency flight. If we didn’t make Oklahoma City on Monday night, we would automatically be put on the Dallas flight.\n\nI felt bad for all kinds of people. Some business guys were trying to get to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. One couple had four kids under five. Another woman was travelling with two toddlers. Compared to them, our plight wasn’t so bad. Some passengers bolted, preferring to rebook and leave another day.\n\nAround 9:15, we got on our flight, which had gone from full to half-full. We took off at 9:30, hoping the OKC flight would be there.\n\nWe landed about 10:20. Saint Joe had been checking our flight’s status. Leaving at 10. Then 10:10. Then 10:24. When we hit the ground at Hartsfield Airport, the Delta app said the flight was boarding. Before we reached the gate, it said it was ready for takeoff, which I took to mean they had shut the door. When we finally started filing out of the plane, the Delta app said the flight had departed.\n\nBut hope didn’t sink. When we got into the terminal, the video screen of Delta flights said the OKC flight was “delayed.” We had landed in Terminal D. Our OKC flight was in Terminal C. So we made like O.J. Simpson and started running through the airport. We weren’t the only ones.\n\nIn Atlanta, the fastest route from terminal to terminal is below-ground trains. So we had to catch a train, then take a huge escalator back to the terminal level, then resume our sprint. Saint Joe beat me there – I know, hard to believe, but the old man is just glad he survived the workout – and turned with the sobering news. The plane was gone.\n\nI knew what that meant. Overnight in the airport. But there was good news. They close up the sidewalks early at the Columbia airport. Not so in Atlanta; 11 p.m., and tons of stuff was open. We hit the Chick-fil-A and enjoyed it as much as any meal we had had in Columbia; that’s no slight to Columbia. That’s a nod to our hunger.\n\nThen Saint Joe noticed that the late Tulsa flight had been delayed and had not left. Maybe we could get on it. We hurried back to the train and made for Terminal A. And Terminal A was madhouse. Much busier; looked like 7:30 a.m. Monday, with so many people trying to get to gate or waiting to board or holing up for the evening.\n\nWe got to the Tulsa gate and viola!, it sounded like there was room. But without an adjusted ticket, the Delta agent wouldn’t let us on. And there was no way we could get the ticket changed; the line at Delta customer service was 100 people long.\n\nReality set in. It was a night in the airport.\n\nSo I looked at the video to see what flights were left, found which Terminal had the least activity and back to C we went. Good call. It was relatively quiet. The customer service desk was down to just a few frustrated fliers. We waited in line and were entertained by an angry woman at the Delta counter. Look, I know everyone was frustrated. But it wasn’t anyone’s fault. It wasn’t those Delta agents’ fault. We hoped we would get the Delta employee trying to help the obtuse woman. We determined to try to brighten her day. The old bat – she wasn’t that old, but she was a bat – wasn’t going to get out of Atlanta until about 9 a.m. Tuesday. She wanted out earlier. Ended up saying she’d take a flight to anywhere. I’d have booked her to Istanbul.\n\nWe ended up with a different Delta agent and got confirmed to Dallas. We found an area largely unused, sat down and I pulled up the Thunder-Grizzlies on my laptop. Turns out, we were having a better night than did the Thunder.\n\nAround 1:30 a.m., Saint Joe caved. He found a wall to sleep against. I finished off the Thunder game, then I found a series of seats without armrests and laid down on that virtual bench.\n\nAirports in the middle of the night can be eerie places. But this wasn’t bad, because it wasn’t deserted. All kinds of people were in the same boat. The terminal was cold, real cold, so I might have had trouble sleeping even with a great mattress. And a television blared loudly in the background. Can’t we turn those things off?\n\nI nodded off a little for three hours, but I was too cold to really sleep.\n\nWe were up a little after 5 a.m., and I got on Hertz’s website to rent a one-way car to Oklahoma City. Sorry, it said. Sold out. I called Hertz. The guy said the same thing. “What’s going on in Dallas?” he asked.\n\nSaint Joe took a crack at it and found us a Hertz car off-airport, at the Gaylord Texan. OK. That should work. We would grab an Uber at DFW, go to the nearby Gaylord in Grapevine, and we’d be three hours from home.\n\nThe Delta people had given us overnight kits. Toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, deodorant, razor, shaving cream. Nice touch. I brushed my teeth.\n\nAnd we decided to celebrate the new day by grabbing breakfast at Bojangles. Bojangles is a fast-food chicken joint that is a Southern institution. I kept meaning to stop at one in Columbia. Former colleague Brooke Pryor and my brother both recommended Bojangles. We were going to grab a chicken leg on our way to the airport Monday night, but those plans were scuttlebutted.\n\nOn the train to T terminal – we were in four of Atlanta’s seven terminals over a 10-hour period – a woman fell and apparently hurt herself when the train lurched. You’ve got to hang on. There are poles and handle straps to brace yourself, and they warn you to hold, and that’s why. She seemed in good hands when we departed, but man, that’s a problem. People have to be aware.\n\nAt Bojangles, we got chicken biscuits. No chicken on the bone. That’s later in the day. And that’s on me. I had the chance to grab some Bojangles chicken for several days. There are 134 Bojangles in South Carolina, and I think I personally saw 80 of them during our five days in Columbia.\n\nWe made our way back to Terminal A and the gate for Dallas. We got seats together – Saint Joe graciously took the middle seat; he’s a saint for more than just graduating Mount St. Mary – and I tried to catch some more sleep, but the back of the Delta plane, even the window seat, didn’t fit my neck really well.\n\nBut we landed in Dallas and I felt better. Felt good to get back to the Central Time Zone and to the frontier, where I know my directions. We grabbed our bags, jumped in an Uber and went to the Gaylord Texan to get our rental car.\n\nSaint Joe never had been to the Gaylord Texan, so that was a plus. I had been for the College Football Playoff mock selections. The resort is definitely something to see. Huge and opulent, with a big conference center and stuff for kids and a bunch of Texas touches. We had to walk through the whole thing to get to the Hertz counter – where the agent told us he had no cars.\n\nTurns out a hailstorm came through the Metroplex on Sunday night, and all the rental cars in town were scooped up, much less the autos available for one-way rental out of state. The guy had no idea why Hertz had reserved us a car when none was available. We didn’t go all Seinfeld on him – “You know how to take the reservation, you just don’t know how to hold the reservation” – but I was past patience. I had worn the same clothes for 25 hours straight and was coming off a short night in which my bed was a bench. The Hertz guy told us some more cars were due in at 2 p.m., and we were on a list to get one, but he couldn’t guarantee it.\n\nSo I turned extreme. I pulled up Uber on my phone. To go from the Gaylord Texan to my house in Norman, it would cost $184. I thought that was a heck of a deal. The one-way rental was going to be $102, plus gas. When Saint Joe struck out with Enterprise, I punched the button on the Uber. I wondered if someone would accept.\n\nSomeone accepted. He would be there in six minutes. I had let sports editor Ryan Sharp know of the potential added expense, but I thought $184 to get two people from Grapevine, Texas, to East Norman was more than fair.\n\nA few minutes later, up drove Clyde, a Jamaican immigrant who lives in Little Elm, driving a Volkswagen Passat. “You ready to go to Oklahoma?” I asked. He laughed. He thought I was kidding.\n\nTurns out, Uber drivers don’t know their destinations when they accept clients. We could have been going to the Great Wolf Lodge, across the street, for all Clyde knew. Instead, he was going to Oklahoma for the first time in his life and had just lost six hours out of his day.\n\nIt seems a goofy system. Shouldn’t drivers know when they’re being asked to push off on a long trip? Clyde told us that the app informs drivers of rides at least 30 minutes or 60 minutes, but I guess Grapevine to Norman blew the system.\n\nClyde was a delight. He seemed to be thrilled to have a story to tell. He told us of Uber adventures. He was enthralled by Oklahoma’s casinos. I started writing this travelblog, and he loved learning more about it.\n\nCouldn’t have been a better experience. Clyde dropped us off at my house at 1 p.m., I drove Saint Joe to the Oklahoma City airport to get his car and I was back home before 2 p.m.\n\nNext time, I think I’ll drive to Columbia. Either drive or take an Uber.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/18/dc-plane-crash-family-claim-faa-army/79082549007/", "title": "DC plane crash: Family of victim files claim against FAA, Army", "text": "The family of one of the 67 people killed last month when a military helicopter crashed into a passenger jet outside Washington filed $250 million in claims against the U.S. government on Tuesday.\n\nThe claims were filed against the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Army, which was operating the Black Hawk helicopter, by the family of Casey Crafton, according to a news release from the Chicago-based Clifford Law Offices.\n\nCrafton, 40, of Salem, Connecticut, worked for an aviation consulting firm and was returning from a work trip on the American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas. He left behind his wife of 16 years, Rachel, and three young sons.\n\n“Casey was an incredible human being. He was a giver. He was a loving husband and father. He enjoyed coaching his boys on their youth soccer and little league baseball teams. They will be grieving him for the rest of their lives that will never be the same,\" attorney Robert Clifford said.\n\nThe plane was about to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport the evening of Jan. 29 when it collided with the helicopter, which was operating on a routine training mission. Both aircraft plummeted into the icy waters of the Potomac River below, killing the 64 people on board the plane and three on the helicopter. It was the first fatal crash of a commercial plane in the U.S. since 2009.\n\nFamily seeks $250 million for wrongful death, personal injury\n\nThe claims filed Tuesday are the first step in a process outlined by the Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows people to sue the federal government for injury, death or property loss. They listed $50 million for personal injury and $200 million for wrongful death.\n\nThe FAA cannot comment on potential litigation, spokesperson Jillian Angeline said in an email. Army spokesperson Maj. Montrell Russell also said the Army would not comment on the claim.\n\n\"Out of respect for the deceased, their families, and the ongoing investigation, it is inappropriate for the Army to comment on any speculation regarding claims or potential litigation. Our primary focus is on supporting the families and ensuring the safety of our Soldiers and the public,\" Russell said.\n\nThe government now has six months to respond to the claims. If the government either denies the claims or does not respond, Clifford said the family can file lawsuits in federal court.\n\nClifford also said he issued letters to American Airlines and other aircraft corporations linked to the crash demanding that they preserve all evidence related to the investigation while the family considers its legal options against the companies.\n\n\"It's been known for some time that there are major congestion problems between the commercial aircraft at that airport and the military aircraft,\" Clifford said, adding that the airline was aware of these issues. \"It's our intention to fully seek information by all the participants in the cause of this crash.\"\n\nWhat's the latest on DC plane crash investigation?\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the cause of the Jan. 29 plane crash, the first in a series of major aviation disasters in the U.S. so far this year. Officials have yet to release their preliminary report on the crash, but said the on-scene portion of the investigation was finished.\n\nNTSB Chairman Jennifer Homendy pointed to potential missed radio communication to the helicopter and its possible flight above maximum altitude as contributing factors in the latest update on Friday. The NTSB has said a preliminary report is expected within 30 days of the incident, but a final report would take one to two years.\n\n\"I'm not sure, as anyone is, what the exact cause of this crash was, but I know this: Those souls that perished in this crash, the preventable crash, they didn't cause it, and their families didn't cause it,\" Clifford said.\n\nDays after the Washington collision, another crash in Philadelphia of a medevac jet killed seven people and injured more than 20 others. Earlier this month, a small commuter plane went missing in Alaska and was found crashed amid sea ice with all 10 on board killed.

Sesselmann’s victory over incumbent district administrator Jürgen Köpper, of the center-right Christian Democrat Party (CDU), “comes amid a broader rise of the AfD in national polls”, said Politico’s politics reporter Hans von der Burchard.\n\nAlice Weidel, the AfD’s national leader, told the Financial Times that the Sonneberg victory was a “milestone”.

Only the CDU had a higher level of support, at 29%.\n\nThe AfD “seems to be scoring points among voters on two political stances in particular: opposing immigration and climate protection”, said Deutsche Welle.\n\nThe party has long claimed that “there is a threat to German culture”, political analyst Johannes Hillje told taz newspaper, and that “this came from the outside, through migrants”. But, he added, “now the narrative is that this threat is also coming from within, through the transformation of society to climate neutrality – a central project of the centre-left coalition in Berlin and the Green Party”.\n\nSince the government unveiled plans to phase out gas- and oil-fired boilers and move to renewable heat pumps, discontent has “reached a new peak in Sonneberg and in many other towns and cities in Germany”, said the FT.\n\n“The cheek of it, it’s just unbelievable,” an AfD voter reportedly said. “I don’t need a new boiler, mine works very well, thank you, and they can’t force me to replace it.”\n\n‘Lack of trust in established parties’\n\nThe election result in Sonneberg has triggered a “frantic search for explanations” and a blame game between Germany’s other parties, said historian Katja Hoyer in The Spectator. That close to one in five people seem willing to vote for “a relatively new party which contains many far-right extremists shows their lack of trust in the established political spectrum”, she wrote, and “in its willingness to solve the big issues of the day”.\n\nThe “overall mood in Germany is increasingly grim”, said Ronald G. Asch, former chair of early modern history at the Iniversity of Freiburg. “However crude its rhetoric may be”, he wrote for The Critic, the AfD is good at “giving a voice to this discontent”.\n\nAnd the spread of such discontent means the German political system is likely to become “even more unstable over the next couple of years”, Asch added. German politicians may “learn the hard way that telling fairy tales to voters such as ‘the Euro and European integration policies will make you ever more prosperous’ will only take you so far”.", "authors": ["Jamie Timson", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Staff", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/27"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/954262/who-will-lead-germany-next-chancellor", "title": "'Let the poker game begin': who will lead Germany? | The Week", "text": "Germany’s main political parties are vying to form a new coalition government as the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) claimed a narrow victory over the party of outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel in Sunday’s federal election.\n\nOlaf Scholz, the SPD’s candidate to replace Merkel, said he won a clear mandate, but rival Armin Laschet of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is “determined to fight on”, reported the BBC. The vote was the “tightest race in years, bringing an end to the post-war domination of the two big parties”, the broadcaster added.\n\nAccording to preliminary results, the SPD won 25.7% of the vote to the CDU’s 24.1% – a “historic low” for Merkel’s party, which suffered defeat even in the outgoing chancellor’s “traditionally safe” home district of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, reported EUobserver.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

And with no political party winning an outright majority, both Scholz and Laschet are now facing weeks of talks to form a majority coalition with two smaller rival parties, the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the Greens.\n\nThe chancellor will then be chosen through a vote in the Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament, with Merkel staying on as caretaker leader in the meantime.\n\nUnlike in most parliamentary systems where the head of state nominates a party to form a government – usually, the party that has won the largest share of the vote – in Germany all parties can enter into “exploratory talks”, explained The Guardian.\n\nThe initial phase of talks “has no time limit” and there is nothing to stop Germany’s political parties “from all holding coalition talks in parallel”, although normally the biggest parties will invite the smaller parties for discussions.\n\nBuilding a coalition government that will hold can take months. In 2017, it took Merkel six months to build a coalition that successfully saw her back into power, despite her party winning 33% of available seats.\n\nGermany has been ruled by a so-called “grand coalition” of the two major centre-left and centre-right parties for much of the 2000s. One such coalition governed under Merkel between 2005 and 2009, and another came into power in 2013 and has been in office ever since.\n\nBut with the SPD and the CDU/CSU (the alliance between the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union) having “haemorrhaged votes over several decades”, it is likely that this time around a three-party coalition will be needed to achieve a majority, explained Alim Baluch, a lecturer in German politics and society at the University of Bath, in The Conversation.\n\nThe kingmakers\n\nWhile a repeat of a “grand coalition” of the SPD and the CDU/CSU is “still mathematically possible”, both parties have “effectively ruled it out”, reported Bloomberg.\n\nAt the time of writing, a so-called “traffic light coalition” – a reference to the parties’ colours – made up of the SPD, FDP and Greens appeared the most likely to come together, although it is still possible that Laschet’s CDU/CSU may be able to form a government.\n\n“What we can clearly see right now is that we have two potential kingmakers in this party landscape, one is the Green Party, and the other are the liberal Free Democrats (FDP),” reported Melinda Crane, Deutsche Welle’s chief political correspondent.\n\nThat’s because the two parties make up over a quarter of the votes between them, meaning the Green Party and the free-market supporting FDP are likely to be essential to carrying Scholz – or possibly Laschet – over the line in forming a majority coalition government.\n\n“The question will be what can either Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats, or Armin Laschet, if he in fact does have the numbers that work mathematically, offer to those two other parties?” said Crane.\n\nShe added: “The SPD and the Greens have a lot of commonality. But there are quite a few big gaps between the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats. The one thing to keep your eye on now in the coming days is how do they position themselves vis a vis each other.”\n\nSky News noted that a pact between the centre-left SPD and the FDP has “no precedent” and may prove to be “tricky considering the pro-business stance of the FDP puts them at odds with many Greens”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/11/07/germany-government-coalition-collapse-olaf-scholz/76120656007/", "title": "Germany government collapse: Pressure mounts to trigger election", "text": "Sarah Marsh and Andreas Rinke\n\nReuters\n\nBERLIN — German opposition parties and business groups on Thursday urged Chancellor Olaf Scholz to trigger a new election quickly to minimize political uncertainty after his rocky three-way coalition collapsed.\n\nThe government coalition fell apart on Wednesday when Scholz fired his finance minister, as years of tensions culminated in a row over how to plug a multi-billion-euro hole in the budget and revive Europe's largest economy, headed for its second year of contraction.\n\nThe break-up creates a leadership vacuum at the heart of the European Union just as it seeks a united response to Tuesday's election of Donald Trump as U.S. president on issues ranging from possible new U.S. trade tariffs to Russia's war in Ukraine and the future of the U.S.-led NATO alliance.\n\nThe chancellor said he would hold a confidence vote in January, which he would probably lose, triggering a new election by the end of March — six months ahead of schedule.\n\nFriedrich Merz, leader of the opposition conservatives, who are leading in nationwide polls, called for a vote of confidence \"by the beginning of next week at the latest,\" in comments echoed by other opposition parties.\n\nAn election could take place in late January, he said.\n\n\"We simply cannot afford to have a government without a majority in Germany for several months now, followed by an election campaign for several more months and then possibly several weeks of coalition negotiations,\" Merz told reporters.\n\nGerman industry, reeling from high costs and fierce Asian competition, also urged Scholz's government on Thursday to arrange an election as soon as possible.\n\nThe uncertainty caused German borrowing costs to jump, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising as much as 10 basis points to its highest since July. A key market gauge that signals debt risk as it falls dropped to its lowest on record.\n\nScholz delayed his departure for Thursday's European Union summit in Budapest due to the crisis at home and canceled his attendance at the next United Nations climate change summit.\n\nScholz fails to secure conservative support\n\nScholz, of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), said he had fired his finance minister, Lindner of the fiscally conservative Free Democrats (FDP), for obstructing a resolution of budget disputes.\n\nThe last straw was his opposition to Scholz's plan to ease debt limits to increase support for Ukraine in the 2025 budget by $3.25 billion.\n\nLindner's dismissal led to the FDP quitting the coalition, leaving Scholz's SPD and the Greens running a minority government and relying on cobbled-together majorities to pass any substantial measures in parliament.\n\nA meeting between Scholz and Merz on Thursday failed to solve the impasse, a government source said.\n\nJoerg Kukies, a top official in the chancellery and close SPD ally of Scholz, will be named finance minister.\n\nThe crisis comes at a critical juncture for Germany, with a flatlining economy, aging infrastructure, and an unprepared military. It is likely to deal another blow to consumption and investment in coming months even as Trump's return threatens to dampen exports, economists said.\n\nThe FDP's exit is likely to spell the departure of the government's transatlantic coordinator, who has spent months cultivating ties with senior U.S. Republicans in preparation for a possible Trump return to the White House.\n\nBut the crisis could also be a long-term blessing given the tensions that have plagued the coalition, the first of its kind at the national level, said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.\n\n\"Elections and a new government could and should end the current paralysis of an entire country and offer new and clear policy guidance and certainty,\" he said.\n\nStill, the rise of both leftist and rightist populist parties in Germany, as elsewhere in Europe, means that even a new election might not easily enable a coherent coalition with a clear majority.\n\n\"You don't have to be a clairvoyant to deduce … that things will not automatically become easier in the future, even after the next election,\" said Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/09/22/merkel-triumphs-in-german-vote-but-allies-crushed/2850005/", "title": "Merkel triumphs in German vote but allies crushed", "text": "AP\n\nMerkel%27s Free Democrats party may not qualify for seats\n\nDetails about new coalitions remain hazy\n\nAn anti-Euro party%2C Alternative for Germany%2C is rising\n\nBERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel led her conservatives to a stunning victory in Germany's election Sunday, a personal triumph that cements her position as Europe's most powerful leader. But she will need to reach out to center-left rivals to form a new government after her coalition partner crashed out of Parliament.\n\nMerkel's Union bloc scored its best result in 23 years to put her on course for a third term, winning 41.5% of the vote, official results showed — and putting it just short of the other three parties in Parliament combined. Election officials didn't immediately give a seat tally.\n\nThe 59-year-old benefited from a strong economy and low unemployment that have helped keep her personal popularity sky-high — a contrast with the string of leaders who have lost their jobs in other European countries since the continent's debt crisis erupted three years ago.\n\nMerkel, Germany's chancellor since 2005 and the de facto leader of Europe's crisis response, told supporters it was \"a super result.\" She wouldn't immediately speculate about the shape of the next government, but made clear she plans to serve a full term.\n\n\"I see the next four years in front of me and I can promise that we will face many tasks, at home, in Europe and in the world,\" Merkel said during a television appearance with other party leaders.\n\nDespite the scale of her win, governing isn't likely to get easier for Merkel over the next four years.\n\nHer partners of choice, the pro-business Free Democrats, won only 4.8% of the vote. They fell short of the 5% needed to win seats in Parliament for the first time in Germany's post-World War II history, paying the price for frequent governing infighting and their failure to secure tax cuts they pledged four years ago.\n\nMerkel looks likely to end up leading either a \"grand coalition\" government with the center-left Social Democrats of defeated challenger Peer Steinbrueck — reviving the alliance that ran Germany in her first term — or less likely with the environmentalist Greens.\n\nEither way, several weeks of difficult negotiations are expected. Each combination might bring a slightly softer tone to Europe's debt crisis, but probably without any significant policy shifts.\n\n\"The ball is in Merkel's court,\" said Steinbrueck, a former finance minister under Merkel who has said he won't serve under her again. \"She has to get herself a majority.\"\n\n\"Angela Merkel is stronger than ever, also in her party,\" said Manfred Guellner, the head of the Forsa polling agency. \"But governing is going to be odd because she will have to form a 'grand coalition' although she is only a few seats away from an absolute majority.\"\n\nMerkel's conservatives finished far ahead of Steinbrueck's Social Democrats, who won 25.7% of the vote — not much better than the post-war low of 23% they hit four years ago.\n\nTheir Green allies polled a disappointing 8.4%, while the hard-line Left Party scored 8.6%. But although the three parties on the left together hold a thin majority, there's virtually no chance of them governing together.\n\nThe Left Party includes heirs of East Germany's former communist rulers, opposes German military deployments abroad and is the only party that voted against Merkel's policies of bailing out debt-troubled European countries in exchange for reforms. The two center-left parties on Sunday renewed promises not to form an alliance with the Left.\n\n\"We did not achieve the result we wanted,\" Steinbrueck told supporters. He said that he wouldn't engage in \"speculation\" about the next government.\n\nA \"grand coalition\" could result in a greater emphasis on bolstering economic growth over the austerity that Germany has insisted on in exchange for bailing out economically weak European countries such as Greece.\n\nMerkel's conservatives, the Social Democrats and Greens \"have largely similar positions\" on Europe, said Oscar Gabriel, a political science professor at Stuttgart University. He noted, however, that \"there are a few nuances,\" with the center-left parties more open to limited pooling of European countries' debt something the chancellor has refused to countenance.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Merkel and Steinbrueck clashed over center-left calls for tax increases on high earners and a mandatory national minimum wage. Merkel rejected both ideas, arguing that they would hurt the economy.\n\nTrue to her methodical style, Merkel said Sunday she would proceed \"step by step\" in working toward a new government.\n\nStill, she beamed earlier in the evening as she was greeted by a cheering crowd chanting \"Angie! Angie! Angie!\" at her party's headquarters.\n\nMerkel pledged that \"we will do everything together in the next four years to make them successful years for Germany.\"\n\nA new anti-euro party, Alternative for Germany, came close to winning the 5% support needed to win seats in Parliament on Sunday. The party, which advocates an \"orderly breakup\" of the eurozone and appeared to have a wider appeal to protest voters on the right, finished with 4.7%.\n\nIts leader, Bernd Lucke, said it had \"taught the other parties to be scared\" and \"strengthened democracy in Germany.\"\n\nMerkel has pursued a hard-nosed course in the euro crisis insisting on spending cuts and economic reforms in exchange for bailout struggling countries such as Greece. The bailouts haven't been popular, but Germany has largely escaped the economic fallout from the crisis, and Merkel has won credit for that. Europe played only a very limited role in the campaign.\n\nStill, senior Merkel ally Horst Seehofer, the conservative governor of Bavaria, conceded that the government needed to do a better job of explaining its policies. He told ZDF television he had noticed a \"communication deficit\" on the campaign trail.\n\nThere was shocked silence at the Free Democrats' election event as exit polls showed the party slumping below 5 percent of the vote.\n\nFour years ago, the party won nearly 15% of the vote, its best-ever result; over the past week, it had pleaded for votes from Merkel supporters to keep it afloat. Merkel called the outgoing coalition \"the most successful government since reunification\" 23 years ago, but her own popularity didn't extend to the coalition.\n\n\"It's the bitterest, saddest hour of the Free Democratic Party,\" the party's leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said.\n\nGabriel, the political scientist, said conservative voters who voted for the Free Democrats in 2009 \"returned in droves\" to Merkel. The smaller party, which was long the kingmaker of German politics, \"isn't considered competent by the voters anymore,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/23/election-2024-live-updates-harris-trump/75798623007/", "title": "Election 2024 recap: Harris, Trump polls; swing state results", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from the campaign trail for the2024 election from Wednesday, Oct. 23.

He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nBiden and Democrats have been careful to avoid commenting on Trump’s legal woes.\n\nAfter his initial comment to campaign workers in New Hampshire yesterday, Biden quickly clarified, “Politically lock him up.

Teak Brockbank, who also admitted he illegally possessed multiple firearms, posted on social media in 2021 that a Colorado election official \"has to Hang by the neck till she is Dead Dead Dead.\"\n\nIn the same post, Brockbank pledged there would be accountability \"for these peoples actions,\" saying it would come from him or from others who \"understand that there life does not matter anymore with the future our country has laid out before it.\"\n\nThe election threats task force also brought charges against two other men on Monday, one for allegedly threatening an election official in Florida and the other for allegedly threatening a Pennsylvania political party representative who was recruiting poll watchers.

Former WWE wrestler Mick Foley, also known as Mankind, on Wednesday endorsed Kamala Harris after WWE legend The Undertaker endorsed Donald Trump over the weekend.\n\n“I think it's important for everyone to have a moment where enough is enough,” Foley said in a roughly 4-minute long video posted on YouTube. “For me, enough was enough eight years ago.”\n\nTrump appeared on The Undertaker’s podcast, “Six Feet Under,” where the two spoke about realities of professional wrestling. The Undertaker, whose real name is Mark Calloway then endorsed Trump in a TikTok video on Sunday, alongside other former WWE wrestler Glen Jacobs, who played “Kane,” The Undertaker’s on-screen brother.\n\nFormer professional wrestling stars have played a role in Trump’s reelection campaign. WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan endorsed Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention over the summer.\n\nTrump, who is a member of WWE’s Hall of Fame, has long been associated with the professional wrestling company – even making his way into the ring in 2007 to feud with Vince McMahon, the former CEO of the company. McMahon is currently facing a federal investigation after a sex trafficking and sexual misconduct lawsuit was filed against him earlier this year. Linda McMahon, wife of Vince McMahon, served in the Trump administration as head of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump courts Christian voters at Georgia 'Believers' town hall\n\nTrump used a town hall focused on faith in Georgia to make a special request to Christian Americans: Vote.\n\n\"Christians are not tremendous voters,\" Trump said during a \"Believers and Ballots Faith Town Hall\" in Zebulon, Georgia.\n\nTurnout could make all the difference in Georgia, a major battleground state. Neither candidate currently holds a clear advantage in the Peach State; Trump led Harris by seven percentage points in a Quinnipiac poll last week, while Harris was up by four points in a Washington Post-Schar School survey released Monday.\n\nTrump on Wednesday also made an appeal by talking about his own beliefs.\n\n“When you have faith, when you believe in God, it’s a big advantage over people that don’t have that,” he said.\n\n− David Jackson and Savannah Kuchar\n\nAsk us anything!

They can return the ballot by mail or put in a ballot drop box.\n\nUnregistered voters in Nevada can register the same day, however since it's after Oct. 22, they must vote in-person at a polling place and show their valid Nevada driver’s license, Nevada ID card, or tribal ID to vote.\n\n− Mike Snider\n\nRussian smear of Tim Walz hits internet ahead of US election\n\nU.S. intelligence officials say Russia is behind a fake video smearing Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz with false sexual abuse allegations as part of an election interference effort favoring Donald Trump that will continue after Nov. 5.\n\nThe content, including baseless allegations from the Minnesota governor’s time as a high school teacher, was fabricated and then boosted online and across social media by operatives working for the Kremlin, said an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n\"The intelligence community assesses that Russian influence actors created and amplified content alleging inappropriate activity committed by the Democratic vice presidential candidate during his earlier career,\" the ODNI official told reporters Tuesday.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\n‘It’s not that hard to vote’: Barack Obama appeals to young voters in NBA podcast\n\nDuring an appearance on “The Young Man & the Three” basketball podcast, former President Barack Obama urged young people — specifically addressing young, male voters — to vote in the upcoming election.\n\n“I think that’s the main message that I have for folks,” Obama said during the episode, “it’s not that hard to vote.”\n\nObama has been on the campaign trail, stumping for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee opposing former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee.

The audit by Raffensper's office found just 20 noncitizens among more than 8.2 million registered voters.\n\n“This is the most comprehensive citizenship check conducted in the history of Georgia, if not the most comprehensive check ever conducted in the United States of America,” Raffensperger said.\n\nThe registrations were canceled for all 20 noncitizens, who have been referred for potential criminal prosecution, Raffensperger said.\n\nThe 20 individuals were found through affidavits they submitted to get out of jury duty, according to Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer within Raffensperger’s office.\n\n\"One of the reasons the secretary ordered this noncitizenship audit is to prove to people that, while there are ways that some can potentially get on, it is ceasingly rare,” Sterling said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHarris calls ex-aide's fascism warning a 'window into who Donald Trump really is'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris accused former President Donald Trump of wanting \"unchecked power\" as the Democratic nominee seized on remarks from John Kelly, Trump's former White House chief of staff, who warned Trump would rule like a dictator in a second term and recounted his past admiring statements about Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"This is a window into who Donald Trump really is from the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him, side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room,\" Harris said in remarks Wednesday from the vice president's Naval Observatory residence in Washington.\n\n\"The bottom line is this, we know what Donald Trump wants,\" Harris continued. \"He wants unchecked power. The question in 13 days will be: What do the American people want?\"\n\nOver three recorded interviews with the New York Times, Kelly said Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law.\n\nOver three recorded interviews with the New York Times, Kelly said Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law.\n\n\"Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he’s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators — he has said that,\" Kelly told the Times. \"So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.”\n\nHarris also referenced a separate report from the Atlantic, which quoted Trump saying that, \"I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,\" according to two unnamed individuals.\n\nThe Trump campaign has denied Kelly's accounts and the Atlantic story.\n\nSteven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, slammed Kelly’s accounts as “debunked stories” and said he had “beclowned” himself in a statement to the Times.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhen will the election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nJD Vance in Las Vegas urges supporters to vote with family, friends\n\nRepublican Vice-Presidential nominee JD Vance implored supporters during a Las Vegas rally on Tuesday to use methods of voting – including early in-person and by mail – that Republicans once criticized as ripe for fraud.\n\n“If Kamala Harris's team is using everything and we're only using one of those methods of voting, then we're going to get killed,” Vance told the crowd.\n\nDonald Trump, Vance’s running mate, attempted to sow doubt about the validity of mail-in voting during the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that it was “a whole big scam.”\n\nThis year, the Trump campaign has sought to walk back some of that rhetoric.\n\n“However you can – early, voting by mail, early in person, going on election day -- whatever makes the most sense to you. Get out there and let's try to bank as many votes by election day as possible,” Vance said on Tuesday.\n\nHe also joked that Trump supporters should “vote 10 times, the legal way” by bringing their friends and family with them to the polls.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nElection certification, inauguration to have heightened security\n\nBoth Jan. 6 and Jan. 20 will be treated as National Special Security Events, the U.S. Secret Service confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nThe results of the presidential election are certified in the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 and the next president-elect will be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20.\n\nA National Special Security Event is an event that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has deemed nationally or internationally significant and could be a target for terrorism or criminal activity, and enhanced security is likely.\n\nInaugurations, State of the Union addresses, the United Nations General Assembly and both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions are typically considered National Special Security Events. The 2024 NATO Summit held in Washington D.C. was also considered such an event.\n\nThe Secret Service could not confirm media reports that fencing would be erected around the Capitol complex from Jan. 5 to Jan. 20, said USSS spokesperson Nate Herring.\n\nAfter the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol building, an eight-foot-tall metal fence was erected around the complex and stayed up for months.\n\nThe National Park Service has already put up partial fencing near the White House that will stay up through February 2025.

Campaign readies for a party in Florida.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump is expected to have his election night party in Florida in the Palm Beach area, according to two sources familiar with the GOP campaign's planning.\n\nThat likely means Trump will be at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, with a Republican operative close to the campaign saying they are \"pretty sure that's where everyone\" will be on Nov. 5. The election night party could be at another venue, or spread across multiple venues, though, sources said.\n\nTrump was in New York City on election night in 2016 and the White House in 2020.\n\nKamala Harris plans to spend election night in Washington D.C. and is considering a speech at her alma mater, Howard University, according to NBC News.\n\n- Zac Anderson and David Jackson\n\nWalz: Trump crossed 'red line' with Hitler comments\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz addressed reporters Wednesday morning in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he reacted to former President Donald Trump's chief of staff John Kelly highlighting past comments made by Trump admiring Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"Donald Trump's descension into madness, and John Kelly, who I thank for showing the courage to come forward,\" Walz said. \"Truly telling the world, those closest to Donald Trump know how dangerous he is. The desire of Donald Trump to wish he had generals like Adolf Hitler had...\"\n\nHe added: \"If there was ever a red line, he has stepped across it.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung in an emailed statement to USA TODAY took issue with the former top White House staffer's comments. \"John Kelly has totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his President well while working as Chief of Staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" Cheung said.\n\n- Sam Woodward\n\nTrump's regard for Hitler referenced in 2022 book\n\nThis is not the first time voters have heard about Donald Trump's regard for German generals during the Adolf Hitler regime - or the first example of Trump's tenuous grasp of history.\n\nIn their 2022 book \"The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,\" authors Peter Baker and Susan Glasser reported that Trump told then-Chief of Staff John Kelly: \"You (bleeping) generals, why can’t you be like the German generals?”\n\nTaken aback, Kelly told Trump: “You do know that they tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off?”\n\nTrump did not know that, and insisted: “No, no, no, they were totally loyal to him.\"\n\nBaker and Glasser wrote about Trump: \"In his mind, the generals had been completely subservient to the Nazi dictator - and this was the model he wanted for his own military. Kelly told Trump there were no such generals in America, but the president was determined to test the proposition.\"\n\nTrump's campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung in an emailed statement to USA TODAY fired back at Kelly, saying the former White House chief of staff \"has totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his President well while working as Chief of Staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nJohn Kelly adviser says ‘he’s warning us’ about dangers of Trump\n\nThe Harris campaign Wednesday seized on remarks from John Kelly, Trump’s former White House chief of staff who warned that the Republican presidential nominee would rule like a dictator in a second term and made past admiring statements about Adolf Hitler.\n\nRetired Army Reserve Col. Kevin Carroll, a former senior adviser to Gen. Kelly, said during a Harris campaign call with reporters that speaking out “was no small step” for Kelly, who he called “a dedicated, measured public servant.”\n\n“But he’s seen Donald Trump up close in a way that very few other Americans have, and he's warning us that a second Trump term would be dangerous,” Carroll said.\n\n“What the public has learned about Donald Trump from John Kelly's accounting is damning,” Carroll said, adding that top officials who worked with the former president have made clear Trump “has no empathy, that he's increasingly unstable and unfit, and that he's more extreme than ever.”\n\n“Trump is seeking the power to do anything he wants, anytime he wants,\" Carroll added.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Kelly said the former president exhibits the tendencies of a fascist, including his threat to possibly use the military against domestic political opponents. Kelly also told the Times that Trump remarked on multiple occasions that “Hitler did some good things.”\n\n“It's no surprise that General Kelly came out like he did. I mean, I wish he had done it earlier, but it's great that he has,” said retired U.S. Army Brigadier Gen. Steve Anderson, a Republican who is part of a group of national security leaders backing Harris.\n\nAnderson said he and others worry Trump will use the military to “suppress his opposition in the country and man the U.S. border, which are things that the military is not supposed to do.”\n\n“With Donald Trump as a president, we are going to lose our status as a world leader, and that is so important,\" Anderson said.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWalz casts vote early with son, first-time voter\n\nMinnesota Gov.

Merkel's conservative bloc finish first with 32.8% of the vote.\n\nThe Social Democrats garnered 20.4%, according to the federal government.\n\nBut in a sign of disapproval with Merkel's open-door refugee policy that started in 2015, voters propelled the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party into the national parliament with 13% of the vote, according to the returns.\n\nIt is the first time since shortly after Nazi Germany that a far-right party will hold seats in the Bundestag.\n\nMerkel, appearing before supporters chanting \"Angie!,\" claimed a mandate to form a coalition government with her conservative Christian Democratic Union party. She also vowed to win back voters from the AfD.\n\nWhile the country's top job is all but certain, the makeup of the government coalition — which will determine the direction of this central European country — is anything but.\n\n\"This election is certainly not boring,\" said Thomas Petersen, a researcher at the Allensbach Institute, a Berlin think tank. \"But the music is in the smaller parties.\"\n\nWill Germany tilt right? Will it become more pro-business? Or will it soften its stance on hot-button issues such as jobs and refugees by moving left? Will voters opt for the status quo?\n\nAnalysts attribute Merkel and her conservative Christian Democratic Union win as a referendum on the party's success at navigating the euro crisis and other issues.\n\nThe Social Democrats, the country's second-largest party, were being punished for their cooperation with the conservatives, analysts said. Governing with Merkel's Christian Democrats for eight of the past 12 years, the party said it will be the opposition and not enter into another so-called grand coalition.\n\nThe pro-business, almost libertarian Free Democrats won 10.7% of Sunday's vote, after being thrown out of power four years ago, according to the exit polls.

The party gained support after Merkel opened the doors in 2015 to more than a million refugees, mainly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, sparking fears in Germany over terrorism and a threat to its culture.\n\nThe AfD entered 13 out of 16 state parliaments since its founding, and some voters say it's unthinkable it will enter the Bundestag in its first federal race.\n\n\"God forbid that the AfD will enter the Bundestag. it's terrible that there's even a possibility,\" said Ariele Amacher, 60, an executive secretary in Berlin. \"They need to disappear as quickly as possible. They're a risk for the future of our society.\"\n\nAnalysts say it's clear that voters want Merkel to continue to lead, not least because of the economic success of the past dozen years. In the early 2000s, the Economist magazine called Germany \"the sick man of Europe.\" Today, unemployment is at historic lows, and the country's economy is humming.\n\nAnd in spite of criticism over bailing out Greece during the euro crisis, Merkel is hailed for leading Germany through it. While deep concerns over the refugees remain, her actions won her praise from even staunch critics on the left and center.\n\nThat's because Germans like stability. They saw what happened when radical change entered politics, such as when Britain opted to leave the European Union in a referendum last year or when President Trump won in November.\n\n\"Germans like predictability. They don't like change if they can avoid it and are hyper on the issue of instability,\" said Jackson Janes, president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. \"With Merkel's experience in dealing with strong-willed people outside of Germany, I think people came to feel she's the best investment.\"\n\nBefore Europe's longest-serving, staunchly pro-European Union leader begins a historic fourth term — only Helmut Kohl served as long but that was over the former West Germany — she'll be looking toward her legacy and facing challenges such Brexit. She'll have to grapple with the integration of the refugees into German society and economy as it ages at one of the fastest rates in the world.\n\nAnd she'll face pressure to pledge to eliminate the combustion engine from Germany's streets after the discovery that Volkswagen cheated on emissions reports, a scandal that has spread to other powerhouse carmakers, including BMW. The sector makes up a quarter of the German economy and provides hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\n\"I'm not voting for Merkel, but it's very clear that she'll win, and that's not the worst thing,\" said Lyudmilla Karkmann, 42, a homemaker who is voting for the Left Party because she believes more attention needs to be paid to the poor.\n\n\"My family and I have a very good life, and I think Merkel's policies did bring us to this point.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/12/16/germany-olaf-scholz-no-confidence-vote/77018271007/", "title": "Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz loses confidence vote", "text": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a no-confidence vote Monday in the country's Parliament, paving the way for a snap election in February next year.\n\nConfidence votes in Germany are relatively rare. It was called after the nation's three-party governing coalition collapsed amid infighting over how to modernize and boost the European Union's largest economy.\n\nScholz needed 396 votes in Germany's Parliament, known as the Bundestag. He got 207. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has 21 days to decide whether to dissolve Parliament, a move he's widely expected to do. The dissolving of parliament is a formality. The process eventually leads to new elections, which are expected Feb. 23.\n\nPolitical turmoil and dysfunction at the heart of Europe is also taking place in France, where President Emmanuel Macron recently appointed his fourth prime minister in a year, prompted by disputes over budget cuts, tax increases and clashing centrist, right- and left-wing visions over how to mend France's divided society.\n\nAfter France's government collapses:Macron names Francois Bayrou prime minister\n\nScholz has been Germany's chancellor since late 2021, replacing conservative Angela Merkel, who spent 16 years in the role. But because no single party secured a majority in the Bundestag, Scholz's center-left Social Democrats formed a progressive governing coalition with the Greens, an environmentalist party led by Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, and Christian Lindner’s pro-business Free Democrats.\n\nThe ambitious coalition has failed to find a way forward on some key issues, notably how to resurrect Germany’s shrinking economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, war in Ukraine and competition from China. Scholz removed Lindner from his role as minister of finance in early November.\n\nGermany government collapse:pressure mounts on Chancellor Scholz to trigger election\n\nMoritz Schularick, a political scientist at the German research organization Kiel Institute for the World Economy, said President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House in January is likely to mean fresh economic challenges for Germany. \"In addition to the domestic structural crisis, the country now faces massive foreign trade and security policy challenges for which we are not prepared. Trump's economic policy measures are likely to include protectionist tariffs and import restrictions, which will put further pressure on growth in Germany and Europe.\"\n\nThere had been only five confidence votes in Germany's postwar history.

Germany's far-right populist Alternative for Germany, or AfD, scored wins in recent state elections but it is too early to know whether the party will be able to turns those gains into an elevated platform at the national level.\n\nUK voters punish Conservatives:Starmer-led Labour wins landslide, gains for right-wing Reform UK party, too\n\nSome polls suggest AfD could become the second-largest party after the so-called Union parties, a center-right Christian democratic and conservative political grand alliance presided over by Merkel when she was chancellor.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/20/meddling-germany-election-not-russia-but-u-s-right-wing/676142001/", "title": "Germany election: U.S. right-wing voices meddling more than Russia", "text": "An alliance of mostly anonymous online trolls and extremist agitators meddled in Germany's election, but researchers said Russians mostly weren't to blame.\n\nInstead, they said, right-wing groups in the United States were behind materials popping up on YouTube, messaging board sites like 4chan and reddit and texting service Gab.ai.\n\nThe evidence came less than a week before Sunday's vote that handed German Chancellor Angela Merkel a fourth term.\n\nMore:Analysis: Merkel extends her reign as Europe's longest serving leader\n\n\"So far we have not been able to track down any specific Russian activity,\" said Simon Hegelich,\" a professor of political science data at the Technical University of Munich who has advised the German government about the threat of hacking and false information.\n\nMore:Trump is boosting Merkel's re-election campaign because he is so unpopular\n\nHegelich said proving connections among sympathizers is difficult and may never be conclusive.\n\nBut an analysis of 300 million tweets over the past six months by Hegelich and researchers at the Technical University of Munich shows Germany is a hotspot for posts that use the hashtag \"#AltRight.\"\n\n\"A lot of the stuff we are seeing in Germany can be linked to, or is at least inspired by, the 'alt-right' movement in the U.S.,\" Hegelich said, referring to a loosely defined group whose far-right ideology includes racism and white nationalism.\n\nMany denigrate both leading candidates — Merkel and her conservative Christian Democratic Union party, and her chief rival, Martin Schulz of the left-of-center Social Democratic Party — with the hashtags #Merkel and #Schulz.\n\nAnd many of those posts originate in the U.S., adding to the impression that right-wing social media users in both countries may be trying to sway German public opinion. It's possible that some of this alt-right messaging coming out of the U.S. may be connected to Russian interference; that, too, is difficult to determine, Hegelich said.\n\n(In the final hours before the election, after this story first published, researchers at the Digital Research Forensic Lab, part of the Atlantic Council think tank, said they had uncovered automated social media accounts linked to Russia. These accounts amplified right-wing messages in favor of the Alternative for Germany party (AfD), which won enough votes Sunday to enter Germany's national parliament for the first time.)\n\n\"There will never be an election again in which trolling, hacking and extreme far-right politics do not play a role,\" Andrew Auernheimer, a hacker and blogger for the U.S. neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website wrote after Donald Trump's election victory last year.\n\nThe Daily Stormer has been available intermittently since August after major technology firms including Google forced the site offline for comments about the death of Heather Heyer by an alt-right protester in Charlottesville, Va. Nevertheless, the website continues to publish commentaries about the German election.\n\n\"There is essentially no chance that the AfD can win this election,\" Adrian Sol wrote Sunday on the site, referring to Germany's anti-immigration and anti-European Union party.\n\n\"However, if they can keep putting pressure on the establishment and change the narrative, (there) may be hope yet that Germany can some day be saved.\"\n\nA report published Wednesday by Hope Not Hate, a British anti-racism watchdog, concluded that the alt-right movement has \"breathed life and youth back into formerly declining and dormant parts of the European extreme right.\"\n\nThe report, based on an undercover investigation of far-right figureheads, found that extremist individuals, organizations, websites and forums on both sides of the Atlantic are increasingly engaging with each another and \"weaponizing\" the Internet.\n\nSandro Gaycken, the founder and director of the Berlin-based Digital Society Institute, said right-wing voices tried to infiltrate conversations about the German election on Facebook and other social media platforms.\n\nOne example: Gaycken said for the past two months, new and existing Facebook users in Germany who searched for political discussion groups were automatically given recommendations that prioritized right-wing parties such as AfD.\n\n\"It's really strange because Facebook says this should be impossible because you are only supposed to get recommendations based on your own 'friends,' 'groups' and 'likes.' But everyone in Germany is getting these right-wing party recommendations,\" he said. \"Even left-wing journalists.\"\n\nFacebook said in a statement it was aware of the issue reported in Germany and that it was related to its \"Groups Discover\" feature. Facebook has now temporarily turned off the category \"news and politics\" in the \"Discover\" tab while it investigates the matter.\n\nFacebook said it was also examining the accounts of apparently non-existent users who purchased Facebook ads during the U.S. election. These accounts were subsequently linked to the pro-Kremlin troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency. Facebook said that it has not yet uncovered similar ad purchases related to the German vote.\n\n\"We haven't seen any trace of the Russians, just right-wingers,\" Gaycken added.\n\nMerkel's party won win 33% of the vote, well ahead of Schulz's SPD on 2.05%. AfD came in third, with 12.6%. Merkel could forge ahead with plans to pursue closer political and economic union with EU members, a policy as deeply unpopular with AfD's supporters as her decision to open Germany's borders to 1 million refugees since 2015.\n\nGermany's vulnerability to political hackers, Internet trolls and bots linked to Russia is hard to gauge. Plus, there may not be much point doing so, according to Mark Galeotti, who runs the Center for European Security, a research institute in Prague.\n\n\"There is no 'pro-Putin' candidate,\" he said.\n\n\"Any interference would be unlikely to have any substantive impact on the election result and only harden Germany's position against Moscow.\"\n\nMerkel has sought to blunt potential Russian interference through aggressive public information campaigns, by establishing additional cybersecurity agencies and strategies and by ushering in the Network Enforcement Act, a law that comes this October will fine social media companies up to $57 million if they do not remove hate speech, defamation and incitements to violence within 24 hours.\n\nGerman political parties also pledged not to use social bots in the election campaign, and independent media monitoring organizations such as Correctiv, which debunk false information and call out disinformation, have been established recently.\n\nThe government has insisted the software used to tabulate votes — paper ballots are hand-counted and then passed to regional authorities — is secure despite a study published Sept. 7 by the Chaos Computer Club, a German technology watchdog, showing the system's encryption method was outdated and vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nBut what may seem like a lack of interest from Moscow may be a sign of success.\n\n\"I think there is more Russian activity than meets the eye,\" said Joerg Forbrig, a Berlin-based political affairs expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a public policy think tank whose Alliance for Securing Democracy unit built an online tool that tracks Russian propaganda and disinformation efforts. Its \"Hamilton 68\" dashboard analyzes about 600 Twitter accounts directly controlled by Russia, by users who promote Russian themes, and by users and topics Russia seeks to discredit or attack.\n\n\"In the past we have seen a very systematic and skilled outreach program into Germany's Russian-speaking population. This was first tested in state elections in Berlin last September. In those areas where there are very high numbers of Russian speakers living in Berlin, the AfD's vote share was up to 35%,\" Forbrig said.\n\nHe said these campaigns involved circulating posters and leaflets with messages that were inimical to the German government's position on Russian sanctions or NATO.\n\nForbrig said there could be forms of Russian support for the AfD not yet recognized.\n\nThe Alliance for Securing Democracy has concluded that Russia has meddled in the affairs of at least 27 European and North American countries since 2004 with interference that ranges from cyberattacks to disinformation campaigns.\n\nIn 2015, a Russian-intelligence-linked hacking group called Fancy Bear stole data from German parliamentarians, including Merkel. This data has yet to be released to the public. Fancy Bear is the same group thought to be behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee in the run up to the U.S. election. Moscow repeatedly has dismissed allegations it intervenes in elections as anti-Russian propaganda.\n\nMore:Alleged Russian political meddling documented in 27 countries since 2004\n\nStill, Forbrig added the German election may be less susceptible to outside influence for three reasons: Voters watched alleged Russian meddling take place in the U.S. and French elections, which has led to high levels of awareness; Germany's multi-party electoral system makes it more difficult to predict how messages and information targeted at one group might impact others; and Germany's media is, Forbrig said, generally more \"balanced and calm\" and lacks \"shrill voices\" compared to its counterparts elsewhere. Further, its media is still viewed as a trusted source of information — not always the case in President Trump's Washington.\n\n\"If the Russians have any juicy information obtained on Merkel or anyone else they probably would have dumped it by now,\" said Melissa Hooper, an expert on legal and civil society issues related to former Soviet Union countries.\n\nHooper has followed Russia's attempts to use Kremlin-backed NGOs, think tanks and public policy foundations to influence the outcome of the German election. Additionally, she is trying to determine if there is any crossover between what these institutions are saying about the German election and messaging coming from right-wing groups.\n\n\"On a lot of issues you see similarities, and they are what you would expect: the functioning of the EU; democracy and whether it's serving everyone or really the provenance of elites; it's about NATO and issues of migration,\" she said.\n\nHooper added: \"I have not seen any gotcha moment yet.\"\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/20"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/957980/giorgia-meloni-who-is-italys-next-potential-prime-minister", "title": "Giorgia Meloni: who is Italy's new prime minister? | The Week", "text": "Italy’s first ever female prime minister has taken power after being sworn in as head of a coalition described as the country’s most right-wing government since that of Benito Mussolini.\n\nGiorgia Meloni and her Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy) party won last month’s election with 26% of the vote. Following weeks of negotiations, Meloni announced a new coalition government on Friday that includes Matteo Salvini’s far-right League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia.\n\nMeloni is the “first politician with a post-fascist lineage” to lead Italy since the end of the Second World War, said The New York Times (NYT), after winning power by reassuring her “hard-right base” that she “hasn’t changed” while seemingly convincing more moderate voters and “international sceptics” that she is “no extremist”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

She was raised by her mother after being “abandoned by her father, who sailed off to the Canary Islands”, said The Washington Post.\n\nMeloni’s mother, Anna, was a “right-winger who wrote romance novels”, the paper added, while her father, Francesco, was left-wing – prompting speculation that her choice of “political path was motivated in part by a desire to seek revenge on her absent father”, said the BBC.\n\nAged 15 she joined the neo-fascist Youth Front, part of the Italian Social Movement, before becoming student president of the National Alliance. Meloni’s rapid rise in Italian politics saw her become the youngest minister in the country’s history in 2008, aged 31, as part of Berlusconi’s government.\n\nAs “populism swept Italy in the last decade”, Meloni built a following on “harsher tones” and “worked hard to purge fascists and build a new history”, said the NYT.\n\nShe formed the Brothers of Italy party in 2012, but won only 4% of the vote in the 2018 general election.\n\nHer support base has “steadily expanded” since then, however, after Meloni “turned her social media accounts into populist pasta on the wall” as part of her push to woo voters.\n\nRadical political shift\n\nAlthough she is “nearly always labelled ‘far-right’ by the international press”, Meloni insists that she is “not a fascist and poses no threat to democracy”, said Nicholas Farrell, author of Mussolini: A New Life, in The Spectator. She has accused those “well-embedded in the nerve centres of power” of staging “a smear campaign” against her.\n\nYet Meloni is “adept at both courting and distancing herself from such extremists whenever it suits her”, wrote Jamie Mackay in The Guardian. She has celebrated “‘patriots’ and ‘the natural family’ while attacking ‘the LGBT lobby’ and ‘enemies of civilisation’”.\n\nThe Washington Post noted that the new PM has “avoided the pitfalls of nationalist figures elsewhere” during the Ukraine war, condemning Russia’s invasion and Vladimir Putin, while also voicing strong support for Nato. But though Meloni has pledged that Italy won’t take an “authoritarian turn”, the paper added, “those on the left have sounded the alarm” over her views on immigration, gay adoption and her close ties to anti-abortion groups.\n\nHer party’s “close relationship” with Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán is “particularly concerning”, wrote Mackay in The Guardian. Human rights groups are warning that she is “hoping to impose a similar authoritarian regime in Italy”.\n\nFor her allies, however, she represents “the radical political shift that Italy needs”, said the BBC.\n\nHow will she govern?\n\nThe “flipside” of Italy’s recent “executive instability” has been the “resilience of the country’s democracy”, wrote Rosa Balfour, director of the Carnegie Europe think tank, in the Financial Times. A right-wing coalition government led by Meloni that holds a small majority will not be “able to do serious damage to Italy’s laws and society”, Balfour continued. However, the economy “hangs in the balance”.\n\n“Shielding households from rising inflation and the surge in energy prices brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are among the prime minister’s most pressing tasks,” said The Guardian’s Rome correspondent Angela Giuffrida. Meloni is “significantly short of the financial resources required to fulfil election campaign resources”.\n\nThe new PM also faces the challenge of balancing Italy’s relations with the EU while managing her party’s nationalist tendencies.\n\nThe Financial Times predicted that “her government’s relationship with Brussels will be a litmus test of the credibility of Italy’s right-wing and the EU’s solidity” at a time when Europe is likewise “grappling with the repercussions of Russia’s war in Ukraine and worried about the risk of recession”.\n\nBack at home, “her coalition appears united”, said the BBC’s Paul Kirby, “but that unity may not last”. According to Kirby, “Forza Italia in particular could become an awkward ally, with veteran ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi consigned to little more than a walk-on part”.\n\nGiven those tensions, Mackay wrote in The Guardian, the coalition could “break down even sooner than the average 13-month Italian government”. But “however short-lived”, the economic and social consequences of a Meloni administration may still be “terrible”.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "The Week Staff", "Harriet Marsden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}]}

The first such centre opened in the Swiss capital Bern in 1986, and there are now around 200 across the world from Berlin, Paris and Geneva to Sydney, Vancouver and New York.\n\nWhile the centres go under an array of different names including “drug consumption rooms”, “safer consumption sites” and “safe injecting facilities”, the essential concept – providing a safe environment for the use of risky, illegal drugs – remains the same. There have been no recorded overdose deaths within any of these centres since the first opened 36 years ago.\n\nNo such services exist in the UK, however. As drug-related deaths continue to rise, the debate over whether this should change has become increasingly heated – especially in Scotland, where drug mortality rates are among the highest in the world. The largest outbreak of HIV in the UK in over 30 years has been among people who inject drugs in Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city, and is ongoing.\n\nKrykant’s unsanctioned Glasgow OPC operated for nine months. It oversaw 894 injection events involving heroin and cocaine and treated nine potentially fatal overdoses. Krykant describes its impact as “overwhelming”:\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe Glasgow police largely tolerated the facility, although on one occasion Krykant was cautioned for refusing to let officers into the van while it was being used. And the media were fascinated: during its brief time of operation, reports about the van appeared in UK and international media including the New York Times.\n\nDue to health issues, Krykant reluctantly closed the facility in the summer of 2021. The van was donated to the Transform Drug Policy Foundation and now tours the UK, demonstrating what an OPC would look like in practice. Krykant believes it served a vital purpose in demonstrating that “it could be possible to set up and run OPCs within current frameworks”. He is still hopeful that a formal facility will be commissioned in the near future – but the UK government remains opposed to their introduction.\n\nCampaigning amid controversy\n\nPat Hudson is an emeritus professor of history at Cardiff University. In 2017, her son Kevin was found dead in a locked toilet in a department store in the Welsh town of Carmarthen. He was 32 and an experienced tree surgeon.\n\nKevin Hudson died of cardiac arrest and brain damage after injecting heroin. He had been battling addiction and was making progress, but died alone after the kind of accidental overdose that kills thousands of people in the UK every year.\n\nHudson, a member of the campaign group Anyone’s Child: Families for Safer Drug Control, is calling for OPCs to be introduced as a way of providing this kind of life-saving support. While first and foremost about saving lives, she says this is also about “providing medical and addiction advice for those seeking help”.\n\nOPCs have been found to successfully reduce the risk of blood-borne virus transmission, signpost clients to treatment services, provide advice on safer consumption, and reduce levels of public injecting and discarded needles. By creating a non-stigmatising environment, they can also attract people who might otherwise not come into contact with support services – or who previously had unhappy experiences in treatment.\n\nMore than 300,000 people are thought to use opiates or crack cocaine regularly in England, of whom about half are in treatment. But even for those accessing such services, treatment can only help if they are kept safe and alive when they are using. For people such as Kevin Hudson, a lack of safe drug consumption spaces significantly increases the risk of death.\n\nIn December 2021, in response to record levels of drug-related deaths, the UK government committed more than £700m to improving treatment services in England and Wales – a desperately needed injection of money following years of disinvestment. But despite organisations such as the harm reduction charity Cranstoun signalling their intention to open OPCs when conditions allow, there are no plans for piloting such facilities in the UK government’s ten-year drug strategy for England.\n\nThe UN’s International Narcotics Control Board has stated that OPCs are consistent with international drug control treaties, as long as they are part of a wider system of drug treatment. But under UK law, allowing the preparation of illicitly purchased drugs for ingestion could be construed as illegal.\n\nAs things stand, this means anyone operating an OPC could potentially be liable for prosecution. In 2016, Scotland’s largest NHS organisation, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, recommended that an OPC be opened in Glasgow city centre in response to the high rates of drug-related deaths and the emergence of an HIV outbreak, highlighting “widespread support [among] stakeholders from the target population, health services, and organisations representing drug users and their families”.\n\nThe lord advocate, Scotland’s chief public prosecutor, was asked to produce a “letter of comfort” to guarantee such facilities would not be a subject for prosecution. This proposal was not successful and the current lord advocate has stated she cannot make an activity unlawful, nor grant immunity from prosecution. However, in 2021 she said she “would be prepared to consider any such future proposal, but it would have to be specific and underpinned by evidence, and it would require fresh consideration”.\n\nIn September 2021, the Scottish Drug Deaths Taskforce asked the Scottish government to “explore all options within the existing legal framework” that would enable OPCs to be piloted. Many Scottish MPs and MSPs have also called for action, with a private members’ bill currently being put through the Scottish parliament. And in January 2022, the UK Faculty of Public Health published a letter signed by every royal medical college calling on the UK government to “take steps towards funding [OPC] pilots … to save lives and reduce harm”. Scotland’s minister for drugs confirmed in June 2022 that a new proposal had been submitted for consideration by the Crown Office.\n\nThe UK government’s consistent refusal to introduce legal reforms to protect OPC providers from the threat of criminal sanctions has set Westminster against the Scottish government, which views OPCs as an important tool in its broader public health-led response to drug harms.\n\nRecognising that a policy change in Westminster looks unlikely in the short term, the Scottish minister for drugs, Angela Constance, said the Scottish government is “leaving no stone unturned to deliver clinically and legally safe consumption facilities”. In contrast, according to Hudson, the UK government is “digging its heels in” because OPCs are seen as condoning illegal drug use.\n\nWhat the evidence tells us about OPCs\n\nInsite was the first sanctioned and supervised injecting site to open in North America. Founded in 2003, it operates in the Downtown Eastside neighbourhood of Vancouver, a city that for decades has experienced high levels of homelessness, street injecting and drug-related deaths.\n\nThe Insite facility provides an array of booths, each with a table, mirror and waste bin. According to 2019 data, there is space for more than 300 injections a day. People need not be registered and there is no form-filling on arrival. In almost two decades, there have been thousands of overdose events but no fatalities.\n\nInsite also offers a key source of evidence on the effectiveness and impact of OPCs. A 2011 study published in the Lancet found that, in the two years after Insite opened, the rate of overdose deaths within 500 metres of the facility fell by 35%, compared with 9% in the rest of Vancouver. More recently, a six-year cohort study found that people who used Insite and other OPCs in Vancouver at least weekly were almost 50% less likely to die of any cause than other people regularly using drugs.\n\nEvidence from Insite and other established OPCs shows that these centres reduce risky activities such as needle sharing while increasing engagement with health and treatment services. This led the UK government’s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to call for them to be considered for the UK in 2016.\n\nSimilarly, a 2019 review of global evidence commissioned by Public Health England found that OPCs were effective in reducing high-risk injecting behaviours, drug-related litter and ambulance callouts while increasing access to education and other forms of social support. This review also confirmed there was no evidence of increased crime in the vicinity of OPCs.\n\nOver the three decades since the first facility opened in Bern, the number of lives saved in OPCs across the world is likely to be enormous. And crucially, people who use drugs say they are likely to use OPCs if they are made available.\n\n‘Absolute and utter hope’\n\nOver a six-month period, our research team spoke to senior figures throughout Scotland – from the government and the criminal justice system to local health and social care teams and charities – to explore their views on OPCs and what they saw as barriers to adoption.\n\nWe also spoke to family members of people who use drugs, most of whom were overwhelmingly supportive. Many suggested that OPCs could provide a lifeline where other interventions had failed – and above all, “hope, just absolute and utter hope” that their loved ones could be kept safe when facing their most difficult and dangerous moments.\n\nMany were bewildered as to why OPCs had not been introduced already. One family member described a “lightbulb moment” when she found herself thinking: “I can’t believe we don’t do this as a humane society.” Another asked: “Why would we not want to keep everybody safe?”\n\nAs well as recognising the lifesaving potential of OPCs, local decision makers highlighted their value in reducing levels of public injecting and discarded needles – often the main concern for the general public who, as one respondent put it, just “want rid” of drug problems in their area. Among decision makers and family members alike, OPCs represented a compassionate, non-judgmental approach to drug issues. They mattered not only because they could save lives, but because they stood for an alternative response to drug problems more broadly. As one family member put it:\n\nKrykant, the pioneer of Glasgow’s mobile OPC van, sees this as a key point in understanding the full value of OPCs, concluding: “Although all data gathered is important, the human factor builds the most compelling case for implementation of these services.”\n\nSo why the resistance to introducing OPCs?\n\nIn June 2022, Alexis Goosdeel, director of the EU’s leading illicit drugs authority, described OPCs as “key instruments” in reducing drug harms. Goosdeel’s comments reflect a broad consensus within the drug research community – but this view is not shared by everybody.\n\nThe UK government argues that evidence of the effectiveness of OPCs is not sufficient to justify their introduction. In part, as one major review noted in 2018, this is because “estimating the overall effect of [OPCs] on fatal and nonfatal overdoses is difficult”.\n\nPreventing individual deaths does not automatically mean overall drug mortality rates will be reduced. Someone who has had an overdose reversed in an OPC may still suffer a fatal overdose later in another location. And OPCs often operate alongside other services such as the provision of take-home naloxone and drug treatment services such as methadone, which significantly reduce death rates.\n\nA recent review of an OPC in Melbourne, Australia, estimated that, of the 271 “extremely serious overdoses” that were treated in its first two years of operation, between 21 and 27 deaths were avoided. But again it is difficult to isolate the impact on drug deaths from other factors; some have argued that a “heroin drought” skewed the initial results from Sydney’s Medically Supervised Injecting Centre.\n\nTaken alongside the practical difficulties of gathering data on people who are often hard to engage with, OPCs are not practical or ethical for the randomised controlled trial (RCT) or large-scale cohort evaluations that may be expected for other medical interventions – although a recent French study applied some of these methods and shown positive results. However, as a recent Lancet commentary on OPCs pointed out, “many public health interventions have been introduced without RCTs when their mechanism of action is clearly understood”.\n\nOur study found that local decision makers are most concerned about whether OPCs are cost-effective compared with other interventions. Here, the question of how to interpret the available evidence – and decide what type of evidence is needed to justify investment – takes centre stage.\n\nWhile the UK government points to a lack of RCT evaluations, local decision makers are more pragmatic. Although there was a recognition that politically, the evidence would need to be extremely strong to get the green light, it was felt that such evidence could be produced through pilots or studies from other countries, people with experience of drug use, and public perceptions. Most of those we interviewed in Scotland felt the available evidence was sufficient to move forward to implementation.\n\nBut anyone hoping to develop local evidence faces a Catch-22. Building evidence requires opening an OPC – yet this is blocked by the UK government on the grounds that the available evidence is insufficient. Without the reassurance of central government support or formal agreements with local police, many local authorities and service providers lack the confidence to go ahead.\n\nWhat do families and communities want?\n\nAmong the family members we interviewed, OPCs were attractive not only because of the evidence that they save lives, but because they gave new hope and the promise of greater dignity for their loved ones:\n\nCommunities affected by visible public drug consumption, however, often have different priorities. As a number of our participants pointed out, OPCs also need the support of these wider community members if they are to be successful.\n\nIn the past, community support for OPCs has often been strongest when large-scale drug scenes – such as emerged in parts of Germany and Switzerland in the 1980s and in Sydney in the 1990s – became a pressing social problem. More recently, the dramatic rise in UK drug deaths has raised the political pressure for action. However, public concern over visible drug consumption, especially when many people find it threatening or morally wrong, does not necessarily translate into support for OPCs.\n\nA US survey found that many people believed money spent on OPCs would be better allocated to more conventional treatment and recovery programmes. Some community groups have expressed concern that OPCs would create a “honeypot effect”, not only attracting people using drugs but also dealers to the vicinity. However, other research suggests that if people hear stories about the experiences of people who use OPCs (or their families), rather than just being presented with statistics and data, then support increases.\n\nWhen a proposal to open an OPC in the Richmond district of Melbourne was announced in 2017, there was widespread opposition from residents who feared it would encourage higher levels of drug use, increase crime, and attract more dealers to their areas. A later evaluation found that, while a large number of deaths had been prevented and ambulance callouts had fallen by 25% near the facility, some local residents reported no perceived change to factors such as the number of discarded needles – and a degree of opposition to the OPC remained.\n\nBut this was in stark contrast to the experience in Sydney. In 2010, ten years after its OPC opened, the amount of street injecting reported by residents had halved, and there was a “considerable reduction” in reported levels of discarded needles in the vicinity – leading to high levels of local support. The Insite centre in Vancouver also continues to enjoy high levels of public support for similar reasons.\n\nIn a recent UK-wide poll, just under half the respondents supported OPCs and only 18% opposed their introduction. Yet for some sceptics, the basic principle of facilitating drug consumption is wrong, especially without a clear requirement that visitors take steps towards recovery.\n\nUnder former prime minister Boris Johnson, the UK’s Conservative government argued that OPCs ran counter to their “tough” approach to drugs – not only enabling but even “encouraging use” (a claim not supported by any available evidence). Because it is much easier not to open an OPC, political inertia and institutional risk-aversion are always liable to prevent innovation.\n\nSettling these controversies is about more than just appealing to evidence. Recent research confirmed what, to a casual observer, may seem obvious: even what you call these centres makes a difference. The label “drug consumption room”, for example, garners less public support than “overdose prevention centre” because one sounds like a facility designed to enable drug use to take place while the other frames it as saving lives. Getting public clarity on what OPCs actually do is therefore critical.\n\nThat OPCs save individual lives is beyond dispute. But they do so by accepting that creating safer environments for otherwise high-risk forms of drug consumption can be the right thing to do in certain circumstances. For some people, that will never be an acceptable principle – and the high level of stigmatisation towards people who inject drugs in political discussions only serves to reinforce this view. For many others, however, it sits at the heart of a compassionate and effective approach to reducing drug harms.\n\nWill OPCs happen in the UK?\n\nWhile every participant in our research supported piloting OPCs in principle, almost all decision makers felt the power to give the green light lay elsewhere. In Scotland, the issue is seen to have been kicked around like a political football, while the UK government insists that OPCs are a distraction from other treatment responses and claims advocates view them as a kind of silver bullet (something our participants strongly disputed).\n\nDespite many expert voices arguing that after more than 50 years, a review of the UK’s primary drug legislation, the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, is urgently needed, it seems unlikely that this act will be amended in the short term at least. Senior police authorities (such as regional police and crime commissioners in England), however, could agree to memorandums of understanding, guaranteeing that local police will not enforce the act in ways that prevent OPCs from operating. This would be possible without any change to primary legislation but relies on senior local leaders championing their case.\n\nThere is certainly growing support for OPCs in English regions such as the West Midlands that have pressing drug problems. Should regional police forces arrive at agreements to allow local adoption, there are organisations ready to create facilities and a considerable body of evaluation literature to support effective service designs. Importantly, there are also researchers in place to ensure that new services are rigorously evaluated.\n\nOPCs can only ever be one part of society’s response to drug dependency and harm. But without the opportunity to pilot them locally in the UK, it will never be possible to assess what the scale of that contribution could be, or how many lives would be saved. In the face of a growing drug death crisis, the need for action is more urgent than ever.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The reason: the money never came. “That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company… which has been around since my grandfather,” he said.\n\nDonald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \"protect your job.\" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades — and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.\n\nAt least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.\n\nTrump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.\n\nLitigator in chief\n\nIn addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens — filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work — since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.\n\nThe actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.\n\nTrump and his daughter Ivanka, in an interview with USA TODAY, shrugged off the lawsuits and other claims of non-payment. If a company or worker he hires isn’t paid fully, the Trumps said, it’s because The Trump Organization was unhappy with the work.\n\n“Let’s say that they do a job that’s not good, or a job that they didn’t finish, or a job that was way late. I’ll deduct from their contract, absolutely,” Trump said. “That’s what the country should be doing.”\n\nTo be sure, Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments, or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties.\n\nHowever, the consistent circumstances laid out in those lawsuits and other non-payment claims raise questions about Trump’s judgment as a businessman, and as a potential commander- in- chief. The number of companies and others alleging he hasn’t paid suggests that either his companies have a poor track record hiring workers and assessing contractors, or that Trump businesses renege on contracts, refuse to pay, or consistently attempt to change payment terms after work is complete as is alleged in dozens of court cases.\n\nIn the interview, Trump repeatedly said the cases were “a long time ago.” However, even as he campaigns for the presidency, new cases are continuing. Just last month, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort over failing to pay overtime for a special event. The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records. Some workers put in 20-hour days over the 10-day Passover event at Trump National Doral Miami, the lawsuit contends. Trump’s team initially argued a contractor hired the workers, and he wasn’t responsible, and counter-sued the contractor demanding payment.\n\n“Trump could have settled it right off the bat, but they wanted to fight it out, that’s their M.O.” said Rod Hannah, of Plantation, Fla., the lawyer who represented the workers, who he said are forbidden from talking about the case in public. “They’re known for their aggressiveness, and if you have the money, why not?”\n\nSimilar cases have cropped up with Trump’s facilities in California and New York, where hourly workers, bartenders and wait staff have sued with a range of allegations from not letting workers take breaks to not passing along tips to servers. Trump's company settled the California case, and the New York case is pending.\n\nTrump's Doral golf resort also has been embroiled in recent non-payment claims by two different paint firms, with one case settled and the other pending. Last month, his company’s refusal to pay one Florida painter more than $30,000 for work at Doral led the judge in the case to order foreclosure of the resort if the contractor isn’t paid.\n\nJuan Carlos Enriquez, owner of The Paint Spot, in South Florida, has been waiting more than two years to get paid for his work at the Doral. The Paint Spot first filed a lien against Trump’s course, then filed a lawsuit asking a Florida judge to intervene.\n\nIn courtroom testimony, the manager of the general contractor for the Doral renovation admitted that a decision was made not to pay The Paint Spot because Trump “already paid enough.” As the construction manager spoke, “Trump’s trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily, and attempted to make eye contact” with the witness, the judge noted in his ruling.\n\nThat, and other evidence, convinced the judge The Paint Spot’s claim was credible. He ordered last month that the Doral resort be foreclosed on, sold, and the proceeds used to pay Enriquez the money he was owed. Trump’s attorneys have since filed a motion to delay the sale, and the contest continues.\n\nEnriquez still hasn’t been paid.\n\nTrump frequently boasts that he will bring jobs back to America, including Tuesday in a primary-election night victory speech at his golf club in suburban New York City. “No matter who you are, we're going to protect your job,” Trump said Tuesday. “Because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we're babies.”\n\nBut the lawsuits show Trump’s organization wages Goliath vs David legal battles over small amounts of money that are negligible to the billionaire and his executives — but devastating to his much-smaller foes.\n\nIn 2007, for instance, dishwasher Guy Dorcinvil filed a federal lawsuit against Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club resort in Palm Beach, Fla., alleging the club failed to pay time-and-a-half for overtime he worked over three years and the company failed to keep proper time records for employees.\n\nMar-a-Lago LLC agreed to pay Dorcinvil $7,500 to settle the case in 2008. The terms of the settlement agreement includes a standard statement that Mar-a-Lago does not admit fault and forbids Dorcinvil or his lawyers from talking about the case, according to court records.\n\nDevelopers with histories of not paying contractors are a very small minority of the industry, said Colette Nelson, chief advocacy officer of the American Subcontractors Association. But late or missing payments can be devastating for small businesses and their employees.\n\n“Real estate is a tough and aggressive business, but most business people don’t set out to make their money by breaking the companies that they do business with,” she said, stressing she couldn’t speak directly to the specifics of cases in Trump’s record. “But there are a few.”\n\nIn the interview, Trump said that complaints represent a tiny fraction of his business empire and dealings with contractors and employees, insisting all are paid fairly. “We pay everybody what they’re supposed to be paid, and we pay everybody on time,” he said. “And we employ thousands and thousands of people. OK?”\n\nDespite the Trumps’ assertion that his their companies only refuse payment to contractors “when somebody does a bad job,” he has sometimes offered to hire those same contractors again. It’s a puzzling turn of events, since most people who have a poor experience with a contractor, and who refuse to pay and even fight the contractor in court, aren’t likely to offer to rehire them.\n\nNevertheless, such was the case for the Friels. After submitting the final bill for the Plaza casino cabinet-building in 1984, Paul Friel said he got a call asking that his father, Edward, come to the Trump family’s offices at the casino for a meeting. There Edward, and some other contractors, were called in one by one to meet with Donald Trump and his brother, Robert Trump.\n\n“He sat in a room with nine guys,” Paul Friel said. “We found out some of them were carpet guys. Some of them were glass guys. Plumbers. You name it.”\n\nIn the meeting, Donald Trump told his father that the company’s work was inferior, Friel said, even though the general contractor on the casino had approved it. The bottom line, Trump told Edward Friel, was the company wouldn't get the final payment. Then, Friel said Trump added something that struck the family as bizarre. Trump told his dad that he could work on other Trump projects in the future.\n\n“Wait a minute,” Paul Friel said, recalling his family's reaction to his dad’s account of the meeting. “Why would the Trump family want a company who they say their work is inferior to work for them in the future?”\n\nAsked about the meeting this week, Trump said, “Was the work bad? Was it bad work?” And, then, after being told that the general contractor had approved it, Trump added, “Well, see here’s the thing. You’re talking about, what, 30 years ago?”\n\nIvanka Trump added that any number of disputes over late or deficient payments that were found over the past few decades pale in comparison to the thousands of checks Trump companies cut each month.\n\n“We have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway. And we have, for the most part, exceptional contractors on them who get paid, and get paid quickly,” she said, adding that she doubted any contractor complaining in court or in the press would admit they delivered substandard work. “But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work. And he doesn’t do that.”\n\nBut, the Friels’ story is similar to experiences of hundreds of other contractors over the casino-boom decade in Atlantic City. Legal records, New Jersey Casino Control Commission records and contemporaneous local newspaper stories recounted time and again tales about the Trumps paying late or renegotiating deals for dimes on the dollar.\n\nA half-decade after the Friels’ encounter, in 1990, as Trump neared the opening of his third Atlantic City casino, he was once again attempting to pay contractors less than he owed. In casino commission records of an audit, it was revealed that Trump’s companies owed a total of $69.5 million to 253 subcontractors on the Taj Mahal project. Some already had sued Trump, the state audit said; others were negotiating with Trump to try to recover what they could. The companies and their hundreds of workers had installed walls, chandeliers, plumbing, lighting and even the casino’s trademark minarets.\n\nOne of the builders was Marty Rosenberg, vice president of Atlantic Plate Glass Co., who said he was owed about $1.5 million for work at the Taj Mahal. When it became clear Trump was not going to pay in full, Rosenberg took on an informal leadership role, representing about 100 to 150 contractors in negotiations with Trump.\n\nRosenberg’s mission: with Trump offering as little as 30 cents on the dollar to some of the contractors, Rosenberg wanted to get as much as he could for the small businesses, most staffed by younger tradesmen with modest incomes and often families to support.\n\n“Yes, there were a lot of other companies,\" he said of those Trump left waiting to get paid. \"Yes, some did not survive.\"\n\nRosenberg said his company was among the lucky ones. He had to delay paying his own suppliers to the project. The negotiations led to him eventually getting about 70 cents on the dollar for his work, and he was able to pay all of his suppliers in full.\n\nThe analysis of Trump lawsuits also found that professionals, such as real estate agents and lawyers, say he's refused to pay them sizable sums of money. Those cases show that even some loyal employees, those selling his properties and fighting for him in court, are only with him until they’re not.\n\nReal estate broker Rana Williams, who said she had sold hundreds of millions of dollars in Manhattan property for Trump International Realty over more than two decades with the company, sued in 2013 alleging Trump shorted her $735,212 in commissions on deals she brokered from 2009 to 2012. Williams, who managed as many as 16 other sales agents for Trump, said the tycoon and his senior deputies decided to pay her less than her contracted commission rate “based on nothing more than whimsy.”\n\nTrump and Williams settled their case in 2015, and the terms of the deal are confidential, as is the case in dozens of other settlements between plaintiffs and Trump companies.\n\nHowever, Williams' 2014 deposition in the case is not sealed. In her sworn testimony, Williams said the 2013 commission shortage wasn't the only one, and neither was she the only person who didn't get fully paid. “There were instances where a sizable commission would come in and we would be waiting for payment and it wouldn’t come,” she testified. “That was both for myself and for some of the agents.”\n\nAnother broker, Jennifer McGovern, filed a similar lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump Mortgage LLC in 2007, citing a six-figure commission on real-estate sales that she said went unpaid. A judge issued a judgment ordering Trump Mortgage to pay McGovern $298,274.\n\nEven Trump’s own attorneys, on several occasions, sued him over claims of unpaid bills.\n\nOne law firm that fought contractors over payments and other issues for Trump — New York City’s Morrison Cohen LLP — ended up on the other side of a similar battle with the mogul in 2008. Trump didn’t like that its lawyers were using his name in press releases touting its representation of Trump in a lawsuit against a construction contractor that Trump claimed overcharged him for work on a luxury golf club.\n\nAs Trump now turned his ire on his former lawyers, however, Morrison Cohen counter-sued. In court records, the law firm alleged Trump didn’t pay nearly a half million dollars in legal fees. Trump and his ex-lawyers settled their disputes out of court, confidentially, in 2009.\n\nIn 2012, Virginia-based law firm Cook, Heyward, Lee, Hopper & Feehan filed a lawsuit against the Trump Organization for $94,511 for legal fees and costs. The case was eventually settled out of court. But as the case unfolded, court records detail how Trump's senior deputies attacked the attorneys' quality of work in the local and trade press, leading the firm to make claims of defamation that a judge ultimately rejected on free speech grounds.\n\nTrump claims in his presidential personal financial disclosure to be worth $10 billion as a result of his business acumen. Many of the small contractors and individuals who weren’t paid by him haven’t been as fortunate.\n\nEdward Friel, of the Philadelphia cabinetry company allegedly shortchanged for the casino work, hired a lawyer to sue for the money, said his son, Paul Friel. But the attorney advised him that the Trumps would drag the case out in court and legal fees would exceed what they’d recover.\n\nThe unpaid bill took a huge chunk out of the bottom line of the company that Edward ran to take care of his wife and five kids. “The worst part wasn’t dealing with the Trumps,” Paul Friel said. After standing up to Trump, Friel said the family struggled to get other casino work in Atlantic City. “There’s tons of these stories out there,” he said.\n\nThe Edward J. Friel Co. filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 5, 1989.\n\nSays the founder's grandson: “Trump hits everybody.”\n\nContributing: John Kelly, Nick Penzenstadler, Karen Yi, David McKay Wilson\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nTrump and the Law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/asia/hong-kong-covid-cull-hamsters-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Hong Kong plans to cull 2,000 hamsters over Covid fears.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nHong Kong will euthanize about 2,000 hamsters and other small animals after a pet store worker and several rodents tested positive for coronavirus, as the city pursues an uncompromising zero-Covid strategy two years into the pandemic.\n\nThe announcement by the Hong Kong government on Tuesday was met with outrage by pet owners and animals rights advocates, with several online petitions urging authorities to reconsider.\n\nIt comes after an emerging cluster linked to the Little Boss pet store, where a 23-year-old employee was confirmed positive for the Delta variant on Monday. A customer who visited the store and interacted with the employee later tested positive as well.\n\nAfter investigating the pet store, officials said on Tuesday that 11 hamsters had tested preliminary positive for Covid, raising concerns around the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.\n\nGenerally, international health authorities have said the risk of transmission from animals to humans is possible, but low.\n\nEnvironmental samples taken at the shop’s warehouse, where other species of small animals are held, also confirmed traces of coronavirus, officials said. The hamsters at the pet store were imported from the Netherlands in two batches – on December 22 and January 7.\n\nOn Tuesday, authorities seized all the small animals in the shop, including hamsters, rabbits, guinea pigs and chinchillas, to be tested and euthanized – regardless of the test result – citing a health hazard to the public.\n\nAll pet stores selling hamsters in the city have been ordered to hand the animals over to be put down, with similar orders for anybody who bought a hamster in the lead-up to Christmas, beginning December 22.\n\nPhotos on Tuesday night show Covid control workers in hazmat suits at numerous pet stores, disinfecting the premises and bringing out bulky red plastic bags.\n\nAll animals taken from the store would be dealt with “humanely,” authorities said.\n\nHong Kong government workers investigate the Little Boss pet store on January 18. Kin Cheung/AP\n\nAuthorities also suspended the import of all small animals into the city, and told all pet stores selling hamsters to suspend operations immediately until all their small animals have tested negative. Officials urged residents on Tuesday to “adopt good hygiene practices” with their pets, including avoiding kissing them.\n\nMore than 20,000 people have signed the largest online petition urging the government not to cull the animals. Some social media users said many hamsters may have been bought around the holidays as gifts for young children.\n\n“Hamsters are our family, everybody please think rationally, don’t give them up because of one incident,” said the Hamster Concern Society, a volunteer organization in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) said in a statement it was “shocked and concerned” by the government’s decision, which “did not take animal welfare and human-animal bond into consideration.”\n\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, the hamster concern group said it had been flooded with questions and pleas from anxious pet owners. “My household’s hamster wasn’t bought from a pet store, but my family is very worried and want me to send it away,” said one owner, according to the group. “But I don’t want to, is there any way to test my hamster?\n\nA police officer stands guard outside a pet store that was closed after some pet hamsters tested positive for Covid-19 in Hong Kong on January 18. Kin Cheung/AP\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been documented Covid-19 cases in animals who likely caught the virus from humans – however, there is far less evidence to suggest the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.\n\nBut authorities defended the cull, arguing it was in the interest of public health and safety.\n\nHong Kong has stuck to a strict zero-Covid approach, aiming to stamp out all cases internally while maintaining strict border controls, even as increasingly transmissible variants – first Delta and now Omicron – make that more and more difficult.\n\nHong Kong is one of the few places still adhering to that strategy, in the hopes of reopening its border with mainland China, which continues to lock down millions of residents in an attempt to eradicate Covid.\n\nA spokesperson for the city’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said Tuesday that all hamsters would be killed regardless of their test result because the virus’ incubation period means “negative test results do not necessarily mean that the hamsters have not been infected.”\n\nHe added that the government doesn’t have the facilities or means to test more than a thousand hamsters every day, let alone isolating and quarantining all the small animals in the city – so killing them was “a safe and feasible way to control the epidemic.”\n\nTesting and isolating pets, and killing only the ones determined to be a threat, “could not control the epidemic completely and may cause loopholes,” he added.\n\nMainland China has also taken similar measures against pets during the pandemic.\n\nIn September, community workers in Harbin city killed three pet cats who tested positive for the virus while their owner was in hospital quarantine, without her consent. A similar incident two months later in Shangrao city saw Covid prevention workers violently kill a corgi while its owner was in compulsory quarantine.\n\nBoth cases went viral on Chinese social media, sparking widespread dismay and anger among pet owners and sympathizers – though some posters argued human lives were more important to protect than those of animals.\n\nThe Hong Kong AFCD spokesperson also pointed to European countries like the Netherlands and Denmark that had conducted similar mass cullings over Covid transmission concerns.\n\nIn November 2020, Denmark said it found a mutated strain of the coronavirus among its mink population that had spread to humans. In response, the government announced the culling of 17 million mink to stop its spread.\n\nBut the decision was controversial – and, it emerged last year, illegal. The government was thrown into turmoil when it emerged there had been no legal basis to order the cull of healthy mink, eventually leading to the resignation of the agriculture minister. When the prime minister was called into court in December and grilled on the mink culling as protesters marched outside, she responded: “There is no explanation (for the oversight) other than that it was busy.”\n\nDanish authorities were later forced to dig up thousands of dead mink after the gas used to kill them caused carcasses to swell and resurface from their mass graves.\n\nDenmark’s parliament commissioned an inquiry into whether ministers had known that the legal framework was absent, with the investigation set to finish in April.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}]}

Rolled-up towels are also a cheap way to keep cold air from coming through exterior doors, and could help reduce your heating bill.\n\nHere are some other ways to avoid a catastrophe at home:\n\nDrip your faucets\n\nOne of the biggest threats to a home during the winter is frozen water. Pipes can burst, causing water damage inside and erosion outside. The easiest way to avoid this nightmare scenario is to let faucets drip whenever the temperature dips below freezing.\n\nYou probably only need to let the cold tap drip, since hot water heaters are usually protected by insulation inside your home. Make sure to also open cabinet doors under the sink to let warm air circulate over the pipes. This advice is good for both single-family homes and apartments.\n\nCover external faucets\n\nExperts recommend covering external spigots with an insulated cap and properly storing hoses to avoid damage.\n\nThese external pipes are some of the most vulnerable to bursting because they are exposed to freezing air temperatures without the benefits of indoor insulation or the naturally insulating properties of soil.\n\nClear gutters and limbs\n\nHomeowners also should make sure gutters are clear to prevent ice accumulation, which can trap water and cause shingles and wood to rot.\n\nWhile you're outside, make sure to cut back tree limbs that could accumulate ice and fall on the roof or other property.\n\nSet your thermostat low, but comfortable\n\nIf you're looking for ways to save money during the winter, consider keeping your thermostat to around 70 degrees while you're awake and at home. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, you also can save as much as 10% a year on heating by lowering the thermostat 7 to 10 degrees while you sleep or are at work.\n\nIf your heating bill is unexpectedly high, make sure you're not using more electricity or natural gas than usual. The price of energy fluctuates throughout the year, which also can cause utility bills to increase or decrease even when your thermostat doesn't.\n\nBe safe driving in winter weather\n\nWhile it's best to stay home during a winter weather event, it's important to know how to prepare if you do have to get out or travel.\n\nWinterize your car by checking antifreeze, washer blades and tire pressure.\n\nLeave early and slow down.\n\nGive other cars more space than usual while on the road.\n\nIf you start to skid, do not overcorrect the steering wheel with jerky movements. Instead, steer with the skid until you regain control.\n\nKeep your gas tank full for emergency use and to keep the fuel line from freezing.\n\nAlso, keep these items on hand in your car in case of emergencies:\n\nWindshield scraper, de-icing spray/solution, snow shovel and small broom\n\nBlankets or sleeping bags, mittens, dry clothes and rain gear\n\nBottled water and non-perishable snacks\n\nSand or cat litter to spread on the ground underneath your tires to improve traction\n\nJumper cables, a flashlight with extra batteries, a cell-phone charger and a first-aid kit\n\nHow to prepare yourself for winter weather\n\nKnow the difference between a winter storm watch, warning or blizzard warning.\n\nIn case of a power outage, keep cell phones fully charged, as well as portable cell phone chargers.\n\nCheck on family, friends and neighbors to make sure they are prepared.\n\nPlan to bring pets indoors. Move livestock to shelter and ensure their drinking water isn't frozen.\n\nWhat to do when the power goes out in winter\n\nOne of the hardest parts about losing electricity in the winter is trying to stay warm. According to OSU-OKC, there are some do's and don'ts when it comes to heating your home during a power outage:\n\nDo not use gasoline, propane or charcoal-burning devices inside your home or garage. These things emit carbon monoxide, which can easily replace the air in a confined space. Gas-powered generators should be kept outside.\n\nDon't use your kitchen oven or stovetop to heat your home.\n\nOnly use fireplaces, wood stoves and other combustion heaters if there is proper ventilation. The National Fire Protection Association recommends cleaning your chimney every year regardless of how often it's used.\n\nIf you must use a space heater, keep it more than three feet away from anything that could catch fire.\n\nKeep a fire extinguisher on hand and make sure everyone in the house knows where it is.\n\nInstall a battery-operated carbon monoxide detector and check batteries on your smoke alarm every year.\n\nHave extra blankets and layered clothing on hand to help keep warm.\n\nOklahoman reporter Jana Hayes contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/02/17/mdot-and-jackson-planned-storm-but-resources-limited/6764029002/", "title": "MDOT and Jackson planned for storm, but resources are limited", "text": "Mississippi's largest city and the state agency overseeing its roads and bridges lack many of the resources cold weather states take for granted.\n\nThe problem is twofold, officials say.

The perfect day, or perfect time, rarely matches up with your schedule. But, right now IS the perfect time to go ice fishing.\n\nNortheast Ohio lakes, reservoirs and ponds have some of the best ice we’ve seen in years, and with the current stretch of arctic weather that we’re experiencing, it will only build on what’s already there.\n\nI’ve been out every day in the last week, either pond fishing or trying my luck at Nimisila Reservoir, part of the Portage Lakes system, and everywhere I have been, I’ve drilled through 5-8 inches of ice.\n\nOf course, this is where I should add you should treat no ice as safe ice, but as a general rule of thumb, 4 inches of good, clear ice is safe for foot traffic. At Nimisila, the first trip out I fished over 5 inches of ice, and it’s added on ever since, so I had no fear of walking across the lake to try different spots and depths.\n\nBuckeye Chuck. Yea or nay?:Will Buckeye Chuck see his shadow or not this year?\n\nNimisila, one of best bass fishing lakes in state\n\nDuring the summer months, Nimisila is one of the best bass fishing lakes in Ohio, with weed growth top-to-bottom in the water column making it nearly impossible to get around the 825-acre lake with a trolling motor. Nimisila is an electric-motor only lake, so it’s popular with those who have smaller boats and kayak fishermen.\n\nThe weeds, combined with acres of lily pads, provide excellent cover for largemouth bass, as well as bluegill, crappie and perch. And it’s the perch that are easiest to catch through the ice, as they seem to be at every hole you drill, whether that’s in 6-feet of water, or 20-feet.\n\nFishing small jigs, tipped with either waxworms or maggots, will trigger bites. But, if you’re looking to take fish home for dinner, you’ll have to pick through a ton of smaller fish to find any eaters.\n\nIt was a good day:One of best fishing days ever: Steelhead trip to Fairport Harbor raised the bar\n\nThat’s OK with me, because all I’m interested in at this time of year is catching, feeling a tug on the other end of the line, getting outdoors and trying to figure out the bite. When you think about it, being able to catch fish through a 6-inch hole is quite amazing.\n\nYou can’t cover water, you can’t cast to structure, you can’t see the weed line or pockets in the pads. You’ve got a vertical column to fish and that’s it. What you can call in from the surrounding area by your presentation, jigging cadence, skill – and most importantly, patience – will determine your success.\n\nThe joy of hopping around, this year with ice shanty in tow\n\nWith that being said, drilling a ton of holes and hopping from one to another is my preferred ice fishing method. Fish for 5-10 minutes, and if nothing is biting, move to another hole. That’s fine for a young man drilling through 4-inches of ice, but an old man and 8 inches of ice has changed things this year. Not to mention the extreme cold conditions.\n\nMost times I ice fish I don’t even take an ice shanty, but this year I’ve been hanging out more in my popup ice tent that blocks the wind. And when the sun is out, the tent provides warmth from the temperatures in the teens. As a result, I might only make three or four moves in a four-hour ice fishing trip, not wanting to set up and tear down too many times.\n\nLocal legend down:Chase for White Face ends in victory for 11-year-old Millersburg boy\n\nThat’s when history of past years of ice fishing helps you pick your spots. When pond fishing, that’s not so critical as the fish are more confined, but on lakes like Pleasant Hill, Tappan, Portage and Mosquito, knowing the lake is a big advantage. Of course, you can also always follow the crowd and ask questions. Most ice fishermen will gladly let you know how they’re doing and what they’re catching fish on. The rest then, is up to you.\n\nThe ins and outs of catching panfish\n\nAs for tips to catching panfish, generally, smaller presentations are best. The key is figuring out if they want a vertical or horizontal presentation, what color and what do they want it tipped with.\n\nBelieve it or not, even how you tie your knot will make a difference, especially with jigs that are meant to sit horizontal in the water column. Rotate it on the eyelet toward the hook and dangle it just inches into the water to make sure your bait is horizontal.\n\nI’ve had good luck this winter with a tungsten Clam drop jig and white Jamei plastic, tipped with a maggot for my horizontal presentation, and a silver pin min with a tiny blade tipped with two-three maggots for my vertical offering.\n\nI generally prefer waxworms in the summer, but maggots are tougher and stay on the hook better, which is important at a lake like Nimisila, where tons of 4-inch perch are always trying to steal your bait.\n\nMy best ice fishing tip, though, is to dress for success. A warm fisherman is a better fisherman. Good boots, several layers and hand warmers are a must.\n\nA couple of new toys to up the game\n\nTwo new toys this year that have helped me up my game have been the addition of an ice flasher and an ice rod with a spring bobber. I always just ice fished ultra-light foam bobbers before, but the spring bobber is a game-changer.\n\nFor one, with the extreme cold conditions, the spring bobber stays out of the water and doesn’t ice up, and I don’t have trouble reeling the fish up when the bobber hits the top eyelet of my rod and won’t move because it’s frozen to the line.\n\nThe ice flasher (I bought a Marcum M3) has definitely helped me catch 50 percent more fish. It reads my jig, and lets me know exactly where it is in the water column, and shows me when fish are under the hole. It’s a basic flasher, and a far cry from live imaging, but definitely has improved my catch rate.\n\nEven though a few warmer days are in the near forecast, nighttime temperatures will continue to be well below freezing for the foreseeable future, so the 2022 ice fishing season looks like it will be around for a while. Bundle up and get out there and try your luck, you just might find out that you like it.\n\nOutdoor correspondent Art Holden can be reached at letsplabal@yahoo.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2025/01/17/indiana-winter-ice-dams-leaky-roofs-flooding/71934122007/", "title": "Indiana winters could lead to more problems with ice dams, leaky roofs", "text": "This story was initially published Jan. 8, 2024.\n\nFor many people, the term ice dam conjures a specific image: A buildup of frozen crystals across a river or stream. For those who've have had roof leaks during the winter, a different image come to mind.\n\nThat’s the kind of ice dam we will be talking about for this story. Now, some of you may still be scratching your heads — but don’t worry, we’ll here's the deal.\n\nThe two premises are actually much the same. There is a build-up of ice that keeps water behind it. Depending where that dam forms, and when it thaws, it can cause big problems.\n\nScrub Hub:What is being done in Indiana to bring back American chestnut trees?\n\nFor this edition of the Scrub Hub we will be answering a couple questions about the home version of ice dams. First, we will look at precisely what they are and what causes them. Even more, we will try to determine if the risks of and problems from ice dams are getting worse.\n\nTo help find the answers, we looked at information from the National Weather Service and spoke with Indiana’s state climatologist.\n\nShort answer: Ice dams may be flooding your home\n\nWhen it comes to homes, an ice dam is a ridge of ice that forms at the edge of a roof. At its core, these dams are formed by uneven surface temperatures across your roof.\n\nHeat loss from your house, precipitation and outside temperatures all can interact to form ice dams. Heat escaping through the roof will often melt snow or ice on the surface, which will then flow down to the edge of the roof. As it reaches the eave of the house that extends past the walls, the temperature is much cooler, which can cause the water to freeze, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThis is what creates the ice dam. And an ice dam creates problems.\n\nWater that backs up behind the dam remains liquid and will find cracks or openings in the roof coverings. From there, it can get under your shingles and leak through the roof into your home. This can cause damage to walls, ceilings, insulation and more.\n\nThe dam can grow as it is fed by more liquid above it, and the problem perpetuates. Ice dams can be further exacerbated by shingles that roll up at the edge or filled gutters that further trap the water.\n\nLong answer: The problem might get worse\n\nNow some of you may be thinking to yourself: We don’t get as much snow these days in Central Indiana, so what’s the problem? But that actually is the problem.\n\nIn decades past, we used to see more snow in Indiana. We also used to see more consistently cold temperatures throughout the winter that hovered around and below freezing at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn recent years, however, our winters have been marked by more wet and rainy precipitation as well as temperatures that fluctuate much more rapidly and over a wider range. We may see below freezing for a few hours overnight, but during the day it’s not unusual for temperatures to climb to the high 30s and low 40s.\n\nThese weather patterns — brought on by our changing climate — actually have the potential to make ice dams and the damage they can cause even worse, according to Beth Hall, Indiana’s State Climatologist.\n\nThe increased wet precipitation introduces more cold liquid that can collect on curled shingles or full gutters and freeze, forming the foundation for an ice dam. That will build up over the weeks and create an increase chance for liquid seeping into the house behind the dam.\n\n“The gutter and eaves are much like the road on a bridge, it will stay frozen and icy for longer because colder air is all around it,” Hall said, compared to higher up the roof with heat escaping from the home.\n\n“I think we could be at greater risk of ice dams causing damage to houses in our latitude,” Hall added.\n\nScrub Hub:Are heat pumps better for the environment and my wallet?\n\nThe wetter winters and greater freeze-thaw cycles within short periods can stack up. The contraction and expansion with water creates the perfect storm to allow water to get under shingles and leak into the home.\n\nStill, Hall said the typical homeowner should not have to worry about this, “regardless of the climate changing” — that is if they take care of their gutters and roof.\n\n“It’s only an issue if your gutters are neglected or if your roof is already warping a bit at the edge,” she said. Hall recommends clearing gutters and having your roof checked if need be — the little bit of work up front might save homeowners a lot of work down the road.\n\nIf you have any more questions about ice dams, climate change or any other topic, please ask us!

Fall and early winter were relatively mild, but since the beginning of December winter has returned with snow and below zero temperatures. The cold weather has been accompanied by days of high pressure and high blue skies. This kind of weather is not that conducive to good ice fishing. Rarely, have I had much success in the cold weather that is accompanied by a high pressure system.\n\nBut, there have been a few times when fishing has been outstanding and much of the good fishing can be attributed to a falling barometer and an approaching winter storm. Before going fishing, I always check out what is forecasted in weather and so should you. If you’re on the ice early in the morning or just before or after dark, you can usually catch a few fish no matter what the weather outside may be. If you have had stable and cold weather for a few days and you hear that the temperatures are going to moderate with a low pressure system heading your way, make plans to go fishing on your favorite lake because the fish will be biting.\n\nRELATED: Open water fishing in winter\n\nRELATED: Wild-born salmon support lake's fishery\n\nAlmost every time this winter that I’ve had good fishing and a consistent bite has been under the conditions that I just explained. The same would hold true for hunting. Deer and most other birds and animals are much more active and will be out feeding in advance of an approaching storm. Another thing that can translate into good fishing is by watching the birds that you feed in the winter. Birds will begin feeding heavily before a low pressure system and this can also signal to me to get out fishing because the fish (no matter what species) will be active. The fish will usually be active and biting all day when the barometer is falling and a low pressure system coming your way.\n\nCheck out what the weather was like the last time that you had good day ice fishing and I’ll bet that the weather was changing and a winter storm was on the horizon. It’s tough enough to catch fish in the winter, so take a tip from me and watch the weather and try and be on the ice for those peak bites. Another good idea is to keep a journal whenever you go fishing and keep track of what the weather was like and any other factors that you feel important. After doing this for a while, you’ll begin to see patterns that emerge that can often affect and help your fishing.

The weather is still cold, there might be snow flurries, and while ponds and lakes are likely clear of ice, there's not a whole lot of hungry fish waiting to strike your bait. But there are a few, and bullhead catfish are one of them. Ohio has three kinds of these bottom dwellers, the black bullhead which is basically a worthless little bait stealer, the yellow bullhead which reaches two pounds or more and has a yellowish cast, and brown bullheads which can hit four pounds on rare occasion, and offer plenty of specimens in 2- or 3-pound sizes.\n\nBullheads are easy to recognize. They have the traditional catfish whiskers and have rounded tails as opposed to channel cats which have forked tails. I've caught them through the ice more than once, and caught plenty more when ice was still tinkling along the shore of farm ponds that had them, and more yet in shallow, swampy areas with cattails along the shore.\n\nI like those places because they draw lake run bullheads that would average two pounds and in numbers great enough that I could fill a stringer in just a couple of hours. But I've caught nice bullheads in inland lakes too. So long as there are shallow swampy areas with water often just 2-3 feet deep, the little catfish can usually be found there. Sometimes in the hot summer months their flesh can be a little soft, though still good for smoking. But at this early time of year, and coming out of ice water, their fillets rolled in flour and cornmeal and fried crisp can be downright tasty.\n\nIf there's a secret to catching these little cats, it's to have plenty of smell wafting through the water. They're almost blind, but those whiskers have hundreds of scent organs and more along their bodies and even tails. Their favorite feeding tactic is to travel slowly along the bottom, trailing those whiskers in the mud. When something edible turns up, it's scented and swallowed in almost the same motion. So, if you're fishing with garden worms or nightcrawlers, it's wise to change baits occasionally to keep fresh scent wafting around the worm, and if using minnows, slightly crush their abdominal cavities under foot to release scent.\n\nI usually fish them with two rods, each with a two hook rig consisting of a No. 6 snelled hook above a half ounce sinker and another No. 6 snell about a foot above the first. Cast out in one of those marshy areas, changing spots every 10 minutes or so until that rod tip starts to bounce and a fat pout takes hold. It's important to remember two things about bullhead fishing. One is that they've sharp spines and side fins, so handle with care. Two, when one bites, strike fast! Hesitate even a few seconds and he'll have the bait clear down into his stomach and you've got to dig the hook out. Given that, it's an easy business, just loafing along a marsh, watching redwing blackbirds doing acrobatics on cattails, and enjoying that weak sunshine.\n\nDick Martin is a retired biology teacher who has been writing outdoor columns for 30 years.

The first I ever saw was in the late ’80s, during my first winter in Door County. It took a little explaining by the Advocate staff before I went out with my camera to photograph it.\n\n“The ice does what?”\n\nGrowing up along the shore of Lake Michigan, in Kenosha, I thought I understood the ways of big, fresh water. But ice shoves? That was something new.\n\nI learned it takes certain, specific conditions. The surface must be covered with ice — something that happens on the bay side of the peninsula — and there needs to be a land mass to the east of the ice. Why east? Because prevailing winds come from the west.\n\nDoor County is the perfect place.\n\nThe ice has to be in the early stages of breaking up, and a strong, sustained wind must blow. Then, the ice has to crack and move just right.\n\nWhen everything lines up, the ice sheet shoves dramatically against the shore, piling up, layering itself, climbing itself, into mountains of giant cubes.\n\nThe mountains glow an unreal blue when the sun shines. Sometimes, the glowing piles are two stories tall or more. (Tip: Wear polarizing sunglasses to better see the blue effect.)\n\nYou’d think an event like that would take hours — moving tons and tons of frozen water with just the force of wind. Nope. It happens faster than you’d expect.\n\nThe first shove I ever saw probably the biggest. It was in Southern Door and actually destroyed some property, and tumbled over the road. People in their homes, in the path of the shove, ran when they heard roaring. The whole thing happened very quickly.\n\nAt the time, the only film in the Advocate office was black and white. So, I concentrated on contrast instead of color — and always regretted I didn’t run out and purchase some Kodachrome for myself. The ice chunks glowed aqua blue in the sun.\n\nI was mesmerized and spent hours and hours there, climbing all over the ice, exploring.\n\nA few years later, there was a great shove near Sherwood Point in Sturgeon Bay. Not quite as huge, but just as pretty.\n\nSince then, there have been scattered events, but nothing to write home about until last year’s at Peninsula State Park.\n\nUnfortunately, I got there a little late. The ice between the shore and the beautiful piles had begun to deteriorate, making it difficult to approach.\n\nSo this year, when my winter-hearty photographer friends told me a giant ice shove had taken place at Door Bluff Headlands County Park, I decided to get there before it was too late. And this time, with a camera capable of capturing color photos.\n\nIt’s nice when the phenomenon happens near public parks — and when nothing’s in danger of being destroyed. The last two season’s shoves have been accessible for sightseers, although this year’s was a little challenging to get to.\n\nDespite my vow to photograph this shove, I took my time picking the right day. I wanted plenty of sun. And I wanted it not too cold; I am not well known for having a hearty constitution in the face of bitter temperatures.\n\nThis past Monday was perfect. And not a moment too soon: as my two sons, my father and I explored the unreal icy landscape, the sounds of melting, dripping, and ice shattering were rhythmically in the background. And, after a couple hours in the sun, the ice under foot began to lose its integrity. In fact, at one point, my leg went through the surface, soaking it completely.\n\nNot that I was afraid the shove would melt before my eyes. No, I’m guessing it will be there for weeks (last year’s shove included a tremendous pile-up on Horseshoe Island off Peninsula State Park. The last of it melted after the first week in June, a sailor in the area told me.)\n\nThis year’s event was worth the effort of climbing down a treacherously icy, rocky bluff with camera gear, and finding enough purchase on the slippery (and sharp!) ice shove pillars. It was a sight and a day I won’t soon forget.\n\nBest of all, this time, I have color photos.\n\nHeidi Hodges is contributing editor of Door County Magazine and a freelance photographer.

The task included requests for welfare checks.\n\nGramaglia said he expects rising temperatures in the coming days will melt the snow and uncover more storm victims.\n\nAmid the frigid, whiteout conditions, “people … got stranded in their vehicles and passed away in their cars. We have people that were walking during blizzard conditions and passed away on the street, passed away in snowbanks,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said. “And we have people that were found that passed away in their homes.”\n\nNational Guard members check on Buffalo residents on Wednesday, December 28, 2022.

In one of those cases, emergency responders could not get to the person because of the snow, he told CNN a day earlier.\n\n“They were blocked, and by the time they got there it was too late,” Poloncarz said.\n\nOne Buffalo EMT told CNN she was stuck in her ambulance for hours Friday after trying to respond to an emergency call during the snowstorm.\n\n“The main reason we were getting stuck is because there were cars in the way,” said Joycelyn Benton, an advanced EMT at American Medical Response of Western New York.

Daniel Kim/The Seattle Times/AP In pictures: Winter storm impacts the US Prev Next\n\nBenton said she thinks officials could have put out snow plows earlier, sent National Guard resources in earlier and instituted the travel ban earlier to keep cars off the street.\n\n“Not being able to help people is horrible,” she told CNN. “Knowing we could be a block away from a call but we couldn’t get to it because of the weather was difficult.”\n\nThis storm marked the first time the Buffalo Fire Department could not respond to emergency calls because of severe conditions, Poloncarz said, citing the agency’s historian. Two-thirds of the equipment dispatched to help clear winter snow during the height of the storm also got stuck, he said.\n\nPoloncarz was asked Wednesday about the timing of the driving ban, which went into effect Friday at 9:30 a.m. as the storm hit, and whether there had been discussion among officials about issuing such a ban earlier.\n\nOfficials started discussing a potential ban last Thursday, Poloncarz said, but they initially believed the snow band wouldn’t reach the Erie County until 10 a.m. the next morning. They opted to wait, in part, because officials wanted workers to be able to get home before temperatures dropped below freezing, he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, temperatures “dropped dramatically,” going from rain to sleet to snow within five minutes around 8:40 a.m., he said. Whiteout conditions didn’t occur until about 10 a.m., he noted, after the ban was issued.\n\n“But we have to take a lot into consideration,” Poloncarz said. “If anyone is to be blamed, you can blame me. I’m the one who has to make the final call on behalf of the county.”\n\nCity faces criticism over cleanup; mayor says city working hard\n\nPoloncarz, the county executive, on Wednesday criticized how Buffalo’s mayor has handled storm cleanup efforts, saying Brown has not been on daily coordination calls with other municipalities and that the city has been slow to reopen.\n\n“I am a city resident myself, I live in the city of Buffalo, and it pains me to see the other 25 towns and two small cities opened in times when the city isn’t,” Poloncarz said, adding that the county should take over cleanup efforts so the city can fully reopen.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks, the mayor dismissed the criticism, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday evening, “I’m not concerned about those comments, my concern is for the residents of the city of Buffalo.”\n\n“I’ve just completed hours of touring neighborhoods throughout the city, watching the plowing operations,” Brown said, adding there were agencies from the city, county and state working in recovery efforts who have been doing a “great job working together, working around the clock.”\n\n“We believe that by tonight, we’ll have 100% of streets opened up in the city of Buffalo and it’s my hope to be able to lift the … driving ban before the start of business tomorrow,” Brown added.\n\nOther local leaders have urged a review of how the storm was handled.\n\nA person clears snow along a Buffalo road on Wednesday, December 28. Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n\nDozens of people rescued by National Guard\n\nThere were 580 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen on the ground Wednesday in the Buffalo area, according to the force’s public affairs office.\n\nThey have two separate missions: Teams of four soldiers go door-to-door to see if residents have power, heat and food – and distributing ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, and water as needed; and teams of two soldiers and two medical providers conduct wellness checks, spokesperson Eric Durr told CNN.\n\nAs of Tuesday, they had rescued at least 86 people “from hazardous situations,” according to a news release, including a woman taken to a hospital just before giving birth.\n\nSeparately, a member of the 105th Military Police Company “learned from his mother that a pregnant woman he was close to had gone into labor,” the release said.\n\n“He went to her home,” it said, “helped deliver the baby, then reported for duty.”\n\nPreparations for flooding\n\nMeantime, Buffalo faces a small risk of flooding as rising temperatures begin to melt the massive amount of snow and 2 inches of rain is forecast through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she directed state agencies to help support the affected communities with flood response resources.\n\nResources including generators, pumps and more than 700,000 sandbags were available for deployment from state stockpiles in Erie and Monroe counties, the release said.\n\nNationwide death toll rises\n\nIn Erie County, 29 who died were in the city of Buffalo, while seven were located in the suburbs, Poloncarz said Wednesday, adding he did not know where one person was found. Multiple bodies remain unidentified, Poloncarz added.\n\nHe has asked that anyone with a missing family member to call local police to help with the ID process.\n\nAmong the storm’s victims is Anndel Taylor, 22, whose family said she was found dead in Buffalo over the holiday weekend after getting trapped in her car by the blizzard.\n\nAfter losing contact with her, the family posted her location to a private Facebook page related to the storm to ask for help, and a man called to say he had found her without a pulse, her sister said.\n\nThe winter storm’s grim effects have been widespread, with at least 62 storm-related deaths reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 37 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning was reported in Niagara County. The preliminary investigation indicates snow “covered the external furnace causing carbon monoxide to enter the residence,” the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Wednesday, identifying the victim as 27-year-old Timothy M. Murphy of Lockport.\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a building’s power transformer, possibly seeking warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people died, officials have said, including one involved in a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a van slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New Hampshire: A hiker was found dead in Franconia on Christmas morning, said Lt. James Kneeland, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• South Carolina: Two men – including a 91-year-old who went outside on Christmas Day to fix a broken water pipe – died due to the storm in Anderson County, the coroner’s office there said. The other victim died on Christmas Eve after his home lost power.\n\n• Tennessee: The Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Vermont: One woman in Castleton died after a tree fell on her home, according to the police chief.\n\n• Wisconsin: The State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Nouran Salahieh Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Nouran Salahieh", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnists/paul-smith/2017/12/02/smith-field-duck-hunt-produces-after-marsh-turns-hard/904961001/", "title": "Smith: Field duck hunt produces after marsh turns hard", "text": "MAYVILLE - Marshes are defined as tracts of wetlands, typically with shallow water and growths of grasses or cattails.\n\nHere in the north, they also are among the first waters to freeze when the temperature drops.\n\nIt can happen astonishingly fast. Even overnight. Even on the world's largest cattail marsh.\n\n\"She's locked up pretty tight,\" said Bryan Muche, 47, my waterfowl hunting partner on the eve of our annual Nov. 11 outing on Horicon Marsh. \"Did you bring creepers and an ice axe?\"\n\nLaughter was the best medicine to treat the shock of seeing 33,000 acres of freshly frozen wetland.\n\nJust 24 hours earlier, on the front end of a cold front, hunters had reported great flights of ducks.\n\nThe temperature continued to drop, however, and by the next morning the marsh was encased in 1 to 3 inches of crystal.\n\nWhen Muche and I showed up, one of our favorite access points — Burnett Ditch — might as well have been filled with gravel.\n\nOur camouflaged skiff and small outboard would never make it as an icebreaker.\n\nBesides, the ducks had moved to nearby open waters, including deeper, bigger lakes and flowing rivers.\n\n\"Looks like we'll need a Plan B,\" Muche said.\n\nFor the last six years, Muche and I have shared an annual tradition of hunting Horicon Marsh on Armistice Day.\n\nNov. 11 is a red-letter day in waterfowling history, the date of a massive 1940 storm that killed dozens of hunters and others in the Midwest.\n\nThe day started mild and brought a \"grand passage\" of ducks on a cold front.\n\nIn just a few hours, the temperature fell from 50 to below freezing. Hunters described \"circus shooting\" before the conditions turned deadly.\n\nThe storm was so strong it sunk commercial ships on Lake Michigan.\n\nModern weather forecasting and communication technology assured us there would be no such change in the temperature or winds this year.\n\nBut with the marsh locked up, we would have to change our tactics.\n\nFortunately, we didn't have to look far. And better yet, the solution paid homage to Muche's roots and Horicon's rich waterfowling history.\n\nMuche, who was raised in southern Wisconsin and now lives in Barrington Hills, Ill., learned to love Horicon Marsh by joining his family on hunting outings in the area.\n\nHis grandfather, Walter Muche Sr., lived and worked in Mayville and started the family tradition of hunting on the famous wetland.\n\nAt one point, Walter Muche Sr. worked as a hunting guide and manager at Goose Haven Gun Club in Mayville.\n\nThe club was a hot spot during the marsh's goose hunting hay-days in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nIt continues to operate under the ownership of Mike and Monica Brummond. The club maintains about three dozen blinds, available for public rental, on fields on the east side of the marsh.\n\nBryan Muche called Mike Brummond to see if any blinds were available.\n\nBrummond told us to show up at 5 a.m. Saturday and he'd see what he could do.\n\nThe wood stove was stoked inside Goose Haven when we met the Brummonds early the next day.\n\nOutside, it was overcast and 27 degrees; a 10 to 15 mph breeze added a bite to the air.\n\nIn the dark of pre-dawn, Brummond directed us to a cut corn field a few miles east of Mayville.\n\nThere we met Ross Villwock of Mayville, Brummond's nephew, who was going to hunt with us for the morning.\n\n\"It was harvested about a week ago,\" said Villwock, 19. \"Ducks and geese have been feeding here pretty hard the last couple days.\"\n\nMuche, Villwock and I got busy putting out several dozen decoys and brushing in three layout blinds.\n\nDutch, Muche's Chesapeake Bay retriever, ran excitedly through the stubble as pink began to peak across the eastern horizon.\n\nThe wind was out of the south, mostly, so we faced the blinds to the north.\n\nBy legal hunting time, we were on our backs looking up into a woolen, gray sky.\n\n\"There's some,\" Villwock said as a trio of ducks strafed our spread.\n\nThe light was so dim, and the ducks moved so fast, that we didn't take a shot.\n\nTen minutes later, a single duck crossed into the spread from the northeast. It was large, brown and dark-breasted, an American black duck.\n\nMuche and I shot simultaneously, and Dutch made the first retrieve of the day.\n\nThe drake black duck was plump and in terrific condition; I was already imagining it served, roasted, on a platter.\n\nThe next half hour brought four more flocks that decoyed in textbook fashion.\n\n\"Would you look at that?\" Muche said as 20 mallards set wings and drifted down over our blinds.\n\nFor a waterfowl hunter, few sights are as rewarding as wild ducks maple-leafing into a spread.\n\nDutch scampered out and brought in several mallards as well as another black duck.\n\nAbout a dozen flocks of sandhill cranes also passed overhead.\n\n\"The cranes usually fly before the geese,\" Villwock said.\n\nHe was right. Twenty minutes later, flocks of Canada geese began tracing the sky.\n\nAt 9 a.m. a pair of geese came directly to our spread from the east.\n\nMuche, holder of Horicon Zone goose tags, showed his shooting skill and Dutch was soon at work bringing two giant birds to hand.\n\nThe honkers were the first Muche had shot at Horicon since he was 14 while hunting with his grandfather, Walter Muche Sr.\n\nThe duck flights diminished in mid-morning and we packed up at 10 a.m.\n\nMuche, Villwock and I each had three ducks (seven mallards and two black ducks).\n\nAnd Muche had the two geese.\n\nThe number of birds in the bag never is the full measure of a hunt, however.\n\n\"Must have been something about the company, the calling and the connection to Goose Haven and memories of my grandfather,\" Muche said. \"The waterfowl hunting karma was with us today.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/12/22/topeka-kansas-copes-as-wind-chill-index-plunges-to-29-below-zero/69751704007/", "title": "Topeka, Kansas copes as wind chill index plunges to 29 below zero", "text": "Sherry Hernandez found herself with no home heating system on Thursday, a bitterly cold day that brought Topeka wind chills of 29 degrees below zero amid what the National Weather Service called a \"once-in-a-generation storm.\"\n\nStill, she said she was doing OK.\n\n\"Our furnace is out so we are coping with space heaters and blankets,\" Hernandez wrote on the Facebook page of The Topeka Experience group. \"It's actually not too bad.\"\n\n\"Ours is too,\" responded Chloe Jewell, a fellow member of that Facebook group. \"Space heaters and our oven are keeping us warm.\"\n\nBaking cookies and cozying up under blankets\n\nHernandez and Jewell were among more than 50 people on The Topeka Experience page who answered a question The Capital-Journal posed asking what people were doing to cope with Thursday's historically frigid conditions.\n\nGroup members said they were taking steps that included staying home, sealing doors and windows, and cozying up under blankets or next to a roaring fire.\n\nSome were baking cookies, watching movies or preparing for Christmas.\n\nMore:Curbside recycling will soon cost extra in Shawnee County, but there will be a way to opt out\n\nKodie Randel Timberlake, who works from home, said she was taking part in all of her on-camera meetings while drinking a big mug of hot chai tea and wearing a \"snuggie,\" or blanket with sleeves.\n\nTimberlake was also \"making sure all the pets in the house are tucked into their favorite napping spots,\" she said.\n\nEnsuring pets and farm animals were properly cared for was a common theme Thursday.\n\nAndrea Keeler-Nolte said her family was feeding its farm animals extra while making sure they had plenty of bedding, hay and water.\n\nMore:Topeka planning body supports zoning changes while opponents decry 'spot zoning'\n\nTopeka organizations team up to check on unhoused residents\n\nThose working outdoors amid Thursday's frigid conditions included Shawn Holthaus, an employee with A-1 Plumbing, who scraped away snow and ice that morning just outside a building at 110 N.E.

Jackson Jr. said in a news release.\n\nJustin Howe, of Fort Riley, had been on the lake in his boat for about 40 minutes when its motor died and he called called dispatchers, Jackson said.\n\n\"The boat drifted further away from where Mr. Howe had been hunting and became stuck against the ice before becoming frozen in place,\" he said.\n\nThe Geary County Sheriff's Office marine unit broke ice to get a boat into the water, dealt with dense fog, then encountered mechanical issues of its own that caused it to go into \"limp mode,\" in which less important parts of the boat are shut off, Jackson said.\n\n\"The marine unit made their way through the ice around Mr. Howe’s jon boat and first attempted to tow Mr. Howe in his jon boat back to shore but were unable to break it free of the ice with their own boat in limp mode,\" he said. \"The marine unit had to break the ice around the jon boat in order to get close enough for Mr. Howe to board the Geary County Sheriff’s Office boat.\"\n\nHowe then boarded that board and returned to shore with deputies, arriving at 11:55 a.m. Thursday, Jackson said.\n\nHowe and the deputies were subsequently screened by emergency medical technicians from the Junction City Fire Department, then released, he said.\n\nWind chill index plunged to minus 29\n\nOfficials for several days had been warning of the approaching storm, which brought light snow to northeast Kansas late Wednesday and early Thursday.\n\nIt caused the wind chill index at Topeka's National Weather Service office to plunge 56 degrees in 14 hours, from 27 at 11 p.m. Wednesday to minus 29 at 1 p.m. Thursday.\n\nWednesday was the first day of winter.\n\nThough the weather service doesn't keep wind chill index records, it said this week's storm was expected to bring Topeka's coldest wind chills since a low of minus 41 was recorded here in December 1989.\n\nMore:Their future unclear, downtown Topeka's aging Nick Chiles buildings are back on the market\n\nThat minus 41 reading wouldn't be so low today, as the formula the weather service uses now to determine wind chill indices doesn't result in wind chills as low as those calculated under the formula that was in effect in 1989.\n\nThe weather service in November 2001 implemented an improved chart that uses advances in science, technology and computer modeling to provide a more accurate, understandable and useful formula for calculating wind chills.\n\nWhile the prior formula found that a temperature of 5 degrees combined with 15 mph winds brought a wind chill index of minus 25, that figure is only minus 13 under the current formula.\n\nFriday also marked the 33rd anniversary of the day Topeka saw its lowest temperature on record, when the mercury here dropped to minus 26 degrees on Dec. 23, 1989. The Capital City saw a low temperature of minus 22 on the previous day, Dec. 22, 1989.\n\nMore:Days are numbered for Topeka's time-and-temperature' telephone line\n\nWhat's the Kansas weather forecast for Christmas Day?\n\nThursday's snow was expected to stick around through the weekend, granting their wish to Topekans who had been dreaming of a White Christmas.\n\nThe weather service predicted temperatures would rise to 17 degrees under sunny skies on Saturday and 26 under partly cloudy skies on Christmas Day.\n\nThe weather service predicted a low 4 degrees under partly cloudy skies Saturday night and a low of 17 under mostly cloudy skies Sunday night, with a 20% chance of snow.\n\nContact Tim Hrenchir at threnchir@gannett.com or 785-213-5934.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}]}

He served as minister of diaspora affairs and as minister of defence under former ally Netanyahu, but now leads Yamina, a coalition of Israeli right-wing parties.\n\nBennett is “open about his plans for millions living under occupation”, the paper adds.\n\nHis ultimate ambition is to “expand Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem”, The Telegraph reports. However, Bennett is understood to have made “concessions that will benefit Arabs in Israel” in order to get the coalition over the line, a move that will be “very difficult for staunch right-wingers in Yamina to swallow”.\n\nUnder the coalition agreement, Bennett will serve as PM for the first two years of the government’s four-year term, before handing over to Lapid for the second half.\n\nPM No. 2: Yair Lapid\n\n17 seats\n\nA journalist and TV presenter-turned-political leader, Lapid is chair of Yesh Atid, a centrist party that sits as the main opposition in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset. He served as finance minister in Netanyahu’s coalition government between 2013 and 2014, and “focused on re-organising a system that provided welfare payouts to the ultra-Orthodox community”, Al Jazeera reports.\n\nUnlike his new coalition partner Bennett, Lapid advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but “opposes any division of Jerusalem which is seen by Palestinians as the capital of their future state”, the broadcaster adds.\n\nBennett has “long derided” Lapid for his support for a two-state end to hostilities, The Guardian says. But the pair have described each other as friends in recent days, a shift that has “infuriated right-wing voters” who see Bennett as “allying with a man they thought he detested”.\n\nThe outsider: Mansour Abbas\n\nFour seats\n\nWhat makes the coalition so unlikely is the inclusion of Ra’am, a small Islamist party representing Israel’s Arab population that has roots in the same religious movement as Hamas, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip.\n\nRa’am supports a two-state solution, with the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and wants the recognition of equal rights for the Arab population of Israel.\n\nParty leader Abbas has made history by agreeing to become the first Arab politician to join an Israeli government coalition - “in contrast to previous Arab leaders who have only offered external support to Israeli coalitions”, The Telegraph says.\n\nBut while the viral image of Abbas sitting alongside Bennett and Lapid is being hailed as a “warming emblem of co-existence between Israelis and Arabs”, the “political marriage could run aground very quickly”, the paper adds. “On the fundamental issues that define Israel's politics, its members are poles apart.”\n\nThe deputy-turned-foe: Benny Gantz\n\nEight seats\n\nGantz leads Kahol Lavan, often referred to as Blue and White, and currently sits as alternate PM and minister of defence, after forming a new government with then-caretaker PM Netanyahu last year.\n\nThat decision to team up with Netanyahu split the Blue and White alliance, with Gantz later saying that he “regretted” the move “because of the prime minister’s broken pledges”, The Washington Post reports.\n\nGantz’s platform includes amending the nation-state law to include Israeli minorities and reopening negotiations with the Palestinian Authority over a peace deal - making him another unlikely bedfellow for the ultra-nationalist Bennett.\n\nThe hard-line secularist: Avigdor Lieberman\n\nSeven seats\n\nLieberman is the founder and head of the secular nationalist Yisrael Beitenu (“Israel is our Home”) party. Born in Moldova, he lives in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank and served as an aide to Netanyahu in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2019, Lieberman “took a huge gamble by refusing to join a Netanyahu coalition government”, citing his opposition to “the long-standing divide within Israel between its secular and ultra-religious communities”, Haaretz reports.\n\nThe far-right politician has made “many, many headlines” for other reasons too since entering the Knesset in 1999, by triggering a series of scandals ranging from making “anti-Arab comments, to a conviction for assaulting a young boy, a graft trial and even telling the president of Egypt ‘to go to hell’”, the paper adds.\n\nBut Bennett may find a sympathetic ear in Lieberman, whose party has historically adopted a hard line on the peace process and the integration of Israeli Arabs. Yisrael Beitenu advocates for a recognition of the two-state solution, including the creation of a Palestinian state that would include an exchange of some majority Arab parts of Israel for largely Jewish-inhabited parts of the West Bank.\n\nThe progressive feminist: Merav Michaeli\n\nSeven seats\n\nA “blunt-speaking” former television journalist, Michaeli is the tenth leader of the Israeli Labor Party in the past two decades and has set her sights on “reinvigorating the left-wing party's fortunes after years in the wilderness”, The Jewish News reports.\n\nShe was the only one of Labor’s three Knesset members who refused last year to sit in the Netanyahu government, and is an avowed feminist, changing her use of Hebrew, “which is a strictly genderised language”, to include “feminine plurals”, the paper adds.\n\nMichaeli has stated that she wants to push forward with efforts to solve Israeli-Palestinian hostilities, describing the issue as being “of profound Israeli interest” and “necessary for the security and sustainability of Israel”. Her party’s foreign policy is strongly oriented towards the US, particularly Joe Biden’s Democrats, and also advocates for a mixed economy with strong social welfare programmes.\n\nThe ex-Likud hopeful: Gideon Sa’ar\n\nSix seats\n\nSa’ar is the head of the centre-right to right-wing New Hope, after running against Netanyahu unsuccessfully in 2019 to become the leader of the governing Likud party. During that election, Netanyahu’s campaign team repeatedly attacked Sa’ar, claiming on Twitter that he “aligned with the Left and the media in order to remove the prime minister from the leadership of the state”.\n\nThe New Hope chief is opposed to a two-state solution, telling The Times of Israel in 2018 that there “there is no two-state solution - there is at most a two-state slogan”. Instead, Sa’ar supports an annexation of the West Bank, while also being willing to back Palestinian autonomy in a federation with Jordan.\n\nSa’ar is set to be foreign minister in the new coalition and said during negotiations that Netanyahu “must be replaced”.\n\nThe leftist environmentalist: Nitzan Horowitz\n\nSix seats\n\nAnother former journalist, Horowitz resigned as head of the the news division of Israel’s Channel 10 in 2008 in order to enter politics, and is only the second openly gay Knesset member in Israeli history.\n\nHe became leader of Meretz in 2019 and is a staunch supporter of a two-state solution, LGBT rights and progressive environmentalism.\n\nHorowitz said following the signing of the new coalition deal that his involvement was based on a commitment from Lapid to include “a commitment to advance the LGBT community and the [legal] standing of same-sex couples as married”. However, such a “pledge appears to run counter to the coalition agreement signed with Islamist party Ra’am, which freezes any LGBT initiatives”, The Times of Israel reports.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe new government will not be sworn in until being approved by a parliamentary vote - and in the meantime, Netanyahu “will do all he can to stop it”, says the BBC’s Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen.\n\n“No rational political enemy of Netanyahu can underestimate his tenacity, ruthlessness and absolute determination to hold on to office,” Bowen writes, and “if he found himself leader of the opposition, he would do all he could to destabilise a coalition with a wafer-thin majority”.\n\nIndeed, getting the government over the line is just the beginning of the challenge facing Netanyahu’s political rivals.\n\nSome analysts view the “unusual and awkward alliance between eight political parties from a diverse array of ideologies” as “the embodiment of Israel’s political dysfunction”, says The New York Times’ Jerusalem bureau chief Patrick Kingsley.\n\nAnd while the newly agreed government may end Netanyahu’s political dominance, its members may prove to be “too incompatible for their compact to last”, Kingsley adds.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Harriet Marsden", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber"], "publish_date": "2021/06/03"}]}

A large portion of that rally was fueled by the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which drove more companies to buy Nvidia's high-end data center chips for processing AI tasks.\n\nNvidia might still have room to run, but it's asking a lot for a $1.2 trillion company to generate even bigger multibagger gains. Therefore, many investors are already likely seeking out the \"next Nvidia\" — a company that is exposed to the same secular AI tailwinds but has more upside potential. Could the quantum computing company IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) check all the right boxes?\n\nThey're going all in on quantum computing.\n\nUnlike traditional computers, which process data with binary \"bits\" of zeros and ones, quantum computers can store zeros and ones simultaneously in \"qubits\" to process data at much faster rates. However, quantum computing systems are also much larger, more expensive, and more prone to making mistakes than traditional computers.\n\nIonQ aims to resolve those issues with a \"trapped ion\" architecture that enables it to produce much smaller qubit processing unit (QPU) systems than its competitors. Its QPU system is only two inches wide, while IBM's refrigerated casing for a single QPU is about six feet wide. Alphabet's Google has also been developing a QPU system, which is about 20 feet wide.\n\nThis company measures its quantum processing power in algorithmic qubits (AQ). It reached AQ 29 earlier this year — seven months ahead of its original goal — and plans to reach AQ 35 in 2024, followed by AQ 64 in 2025. It expects to reach AQ 1,024 by 2028. That would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 104% in its quantum computing power, or roughly doubling the qubits each year.\n\nIonQ serves up that computing power as a cloud-based service through Amazon's quantum cloud computing service Braket, Microsoft's Azure, and Google Cloud. It only generated $3 million in revenue in 2021, but that figure jumped to $11 million in 2022 as it secured more contracts. Management expects IonQ's revenue to rise 93%-100% to $21.2-$22.0 million in 2023.\n\nIs IonQ an AI play like Nvidia?\n\nNvidia's GPUs are well suited to process AI tasks because they use vector processing, which processes a wide range of integers and floating point numbers simultaneously. Traditional CPUs process each piece of data individually with scalar processing, which makes them less efficient at processing complex AI and machine learning tasks.\n\nQuantum computing platforms could further accelerate that process by moving beyond binary computing methods. According to Fortune Business Insights, the quantum computing market could still grow at a CAGR of 32% from 2023 to 2030.\n\nOne of IonQ's top partners is Zapata AI, a developer of quantum-powered generative AI solutions for large organizations. Last year, Zapata, IonQ, and several of their partners received a multi-year award from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to fund the development of new quantum benchmarking tools.\n\nAnalysts expect IonQ's revenue to rise from $22 million in 2023 to $88 million in 2025, which would represent a two-year CAGR of 100%. They don't expect it to turn profitable anytime soon, but it could narrow the company's losses as the business scales up.\n\nCould IonQ replicate Nvidia's life-changing gains?\n\nIonQ's stock started trading at $10.60 per share after it closed its merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) on Oct. 1. It sank to about $3 last December, but it subsequently bounced back to about $12 as of this writing.\n\nWith an enterprise value of $2.4 billion, IonQ isn't cheap at 109 times this year's sales. Even if it matches analysts' expectations over the next two years, it still trades at 27 times its projected sales for 2025. That frothy valuation, along with its persistent losses, could limit its upside potential as long as interest rates remain elevated.\n\nBut if IonQ hits its processing target of AQ 1,024 by 2028, locks in more customers, and continues to expand, it could quickly grow into its valuations. Economies of scale would then kick in and boost its margins.\n\nI'm not confident enough to call IonQ the \"next Nvidia\" yet, since it has yet to successfully scale up its business and justify its sky-high valuations. However, I think this mid-cap stock could still have plenty of room to run if its trapped ion technology successfully shrinks down QPU systems and disrupts the nascent quantum computing market.\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

But this emerging field of computing will almost certainly help scientists and researchers confront future crises.\n\n“Can we compress the rate at which we discover, for example, a treatment or an approach to this?” asks Dario Gil, the director of IBM Research. “The goal is to do everything that we are doing today in terms of discovery of materials, chemistry, things like that, (in) factors of 10 times better, 100 times better,”\n\nAnd that, he says, “could be game-changing.”\n\nQuantum computing is the next big thing in computing, and it promises exponential advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning through the next decade and beyond, leading to potential breakthroughs in healthcare and pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, battery power, and financial services.\n\nFor a consumer with a retirement fund, “quantum computers over the next 10 to 15 years … may help you make better personal financial decisions through the calculations that your broker is doing,” says Bob Sutor, an IBM Research vice president tasked with driving the quantum computing ecosystem.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIBM, with 15 deployed quantum systems, is at the forefront of quantum computing. USA TODAY recently got to tour a quantum lab in Yorktown Heights, New York.\n\nBut Google, Amazon, Intel, Microsoft and Honeywell are among other tech stalwarts working in the field, as are several venture-backed global startups.\n\nThe U.S. government, which is in a quantum race against China, has also lent support. In late 2018, President Trump signed the National Quantum Initiative Act into law to fund quantum research to the tune of $1.2 billion over a five-year period.\n\nHere is a guide to help demystify quantum computing, which you will almost certainly hear a lot more about in the years ahead.\n\nWhat is quantum computing?\n\nIt isn’t easy to get a grip around quantum computing or the field of physics it harnesses, quantum mechanics. But such machines – they cost millions – are designed to model nature.\n\nIn the simplest terms, they are exponentially more powerful than what we consider classical computers, whose basic fundamental units are expressed in 1s or 0s – or bits. Quantum computing takes a quantum leap with what are known as quantum bits or \"qubits” for short.\n\nThink about it this way: If you flip a coin, it will land as either heads or tails, or in those classical computer terms, 1s and 0s. But what’s the state of that coin when it is still spinning? That’s kind of where qubits are, not necessarily as a 1 or a 0, but as all the possibilities in between.\n\nNow let’s take the analogy further. If you flip two coins in the physical world, the heads or tails of one coin has no bearing on the other. Qubits, though, can be entangled in multiple states at the same time.\n\n“This is one of those the 'Earth is not flat’ kind of moments,” Gil says. “There is actually a revolution going on.”\n\nWhat quantum computers look like\n\nA quantum computer chip is kept at a temperature that’s colder than outer space in a cylinder that's part of an elaborate refrigerated apparatus. The system has more than 2,000 components, including pulse tube coolers, superconducting coaxial lines, a mixing chamber and various circuits. It resembles a fancy chandelier.\n\nHow far along is quantum computing?\n\nIn May 2016, IBM became the first company to put a quantum computer on the cloud, where anyone with the computing know-how could run experiments.\n\nCurrently, more than 150 billion programs and executions have been run on IBM’s quantum machines, by more than 200,000 registered users in over 140 countries. There are over 12,000 monthly active users, and, on a typical day, the machines on the cloud run over 400 million quantum circuits.\n\nIBM says it has signed contracts around quantum with more than 100 universities, national laboratories and companies.\n\nFor example, quantum researchers at IBM are teaming up with counterparts at Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler to develop next-generation batteries for electric vehicles. IBM is also partnering with Delta Air Lines to explore quantum opportunities in the travel business.\n\nCoronavirus and working out:People working out at home to avoid contact at the gym\n\nThis past October, Google said it achieved what's been described as “quantum supremacy.” It was able to perform a calculation in 200 seconds that supposedly would take a classic state-of-the-art supercomputer about 10,000 years to handle.\n\nIBM pushed back. The company argued at the time that an ideal simulation of the same task can be performed on a classical system in 2½ days and with far greater fidelity, which at that it said was a conservative, worst-case estimate.\n\nGil told USA TODAY that “people are not making a distinction of what’s a lab experiment, versus what is a real system.”\n\nThe claims around quantum computing keep coming.\n\nJust this week, Honeywell announced what it said is “the most powerful quantum computer yet,” set for a mid-2020 release. Honeywell has formed a strategic partnership with JPMorgan Chase around financial solutions that exploit quantum. JPMorgan is also part of the IBM quantum ecosystem.\n\nBut these are still early days. Gil says quantum computing today is in roughly the same spot where artificial intelligence was in 2010.\n\nHis IBM colleague Sutor says, “Just to be clear, nobody on the planet has a quantum computer that can today do better that our classical computers.”\n\nBut IBM says it can double the power of a quantum computer every year, and at some point cross a threshold at which the quantum machines might leap past classical computers, at least to address certain types of problems.\n\nAre there security risks?\n\nThere could be. Large future “fault-tolerant” quantum computers – and such computers are not yet around the corner – have the potential to crack current encryption systems. IBM is working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on changing encryption standards that promise to keep quantum systems efficient while at the same time keeping them secure.\n\nThough security threats might be years away, Gil stresses the urgency to prepare now. “You cannot just sit and ignore the problem,” Gil says.\n\nEven years from now, you shouldn't expect to have a quantum computer sitting on your desk.\n\nBut the technology made possible by quantum computers will start to insert itself into supporting and making consumer apps more powerful. And society would benefit if quantum computers can stop a potential pandemic before it ever really gets started.\n\n“Nature itself is one great big computer,\" Sutor says, in the way atoms and molecules and light interact. “Can we learn enough about how it really does it and harness it for our own computing needs with the toughest sort of problems we have?”\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com.

But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T. Barnum.\n\n12. 1852: Construction of St. Peter's Catholic Church begins.\n\n13. 1853: The first synagogue in Tennessee, B'nai Israel, is established by Jewish German immigrants. In 1943 it adopts its current name: Temple Israel.\n\n14. July 15, 1853: Elmwood Cemetery opens for business, so to speak, when the late Mrs. R.B. Berry is laid to rest as its first occupant. The 75,000 interred since then have included slaves, suffragists, yellow fever victims and author Shelby Foote.\n\n15. \"May God bless Memphis, the noblest city on the face of the earth.” — Mark Twain, in an 1858 letter to his sister, after visiting the Memphis hospital where his brother Henry was taken after a steamboat explosion that took \"hundreds of lives.\"\n\n16. June 6, 1862: The Mississippi River churns as Union gunboats defeat Confederate naval forces at the first Battle of Memphis.\n\n17. Also June 6, 1862: To avoid \"Yankee\" takeover, the presses and plates of the pro-Confederacy newspaper, The Appeal, are loaded into a boxcar and moved to Grenada, Mississippi, where the newspaper resumes publication. Keeping one step ahead of Union confiscators, The Appeal later journeys to Jackson, Mississippi; Meridian, Mississippi; Atlanta; Montgomery, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia.\n\n18. Aug. 21, 1864: Nathan Bedford Forrest's troops raid the Union-occupied city but ultimately withdraw; this incursion becomes known as the second Battle of Memphis.\n\n19. Bright kid, promising future: In 1865, 18-year-old Thomas Edison works as a telegraph operator in Memphis.\n\n20. April 27, 1865: The greatest maritime disaster in U.S. history occurs on the Mississippi River at Memphis when the boilers of the overloaded Sultana explode. Close to 1,800 of the 2,400 people aboard the 260-foot wooden steamboat are killed or drowned (about 50 more than will be lost in the sinking of the Titanic). The boat's legal capacity was 376.\n\n21. Forty-six black people and two white people are killed when white civilians and police officers rampage through black neighborhoods for two days of mob violence, May 1-3, 1866. The event becomes known as the \"Memphis Massacre.\"\n\n22. 1869: The foundation stone is laid for Beale Street Baptist Church (also known as First Baptist Church — Beale Street), a congregation organized by freed slaves.\n\n23. The city's oldest degree-granting collegiate institution, Christian Brothers University, is established in 1871 (as Christian Brothers College) by members of a Catholic congregation founded by France's St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the patron saint for \"teachers of youth.\"\n\n24. 1875: Walter Burke Sr. opens the original Burke's Book Store at 180 N Main. Now located at 936 Cooper, the store has remained independent and Memphis-owned ever since.\n\n25. Jan. 15, 1877, becomes known as \"The Day It Rained Snakes.\" According to newspaper reports that inspired an investigation by Scientific American, a \"torrential downpour\" left behind great numbers of snakes in the area of Vance and Lauderdale. The Monthly Weather Review reported the snakes were dark brown or black and \"very thick in some places, being tangled together like a mass of thread or yarn.\" Whether the reptiles were driven from subterranean hiding places or deposited on the Bluff City via some sort of storm-driven snakenado remains a mystery.\n\n26. Aug. 13, 1878: Restaurant owner Kate Bionda becomes the city's first recorded victim of yellow fever, having contracted the disease from a man who had escaped a quarantined steamboat. She would be followed by close to 5,000 others by the end of the year, as the epidemic devastates the city.\n\n27. One of the most significant figures to ever call this city home, former slave Ida B. Wells moves to Memphis in 1882 at the age of 20. A few years later, she launches her anti-lynching campaign through her newspaper, the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight.\n\n28. Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl. She hails from Memphis, Tenn.

Thousands lined the streets (and were infiltrated by gangs of pickpockets, according to The Commercial Appeal), but the joy gives way to shock when a prominent local citizen, Judge Henry T. Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32.

In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902.

Norman, a steamboat. Lee's effort remains Memphis' most famous act of heroism.\n\n52. \"The Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel,\" journalist David Cohn wrote in 1935.

Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing.

Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage?

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins.

Hooks of Memphis becomes national executive director of the NAACP.\n\n127. Jan. 15, 1977: Three months after hitting No. 1 with his novelty dance hit \"Disco Duck,\" Memphis deejay Rick Dees — recording as \"Rick Dees and His Cast of Idiots\" — releases a follow-up single, \"Dis-Gorilla.\" Even an appearance on \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" that finds Dees introduced by the kids from \"What's Happening!!\" and performing in front of a pair of swinging King Kong arms couldn't lift the song above No. 56 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\n128. The Memphis in May International Festival is organized in 1977. The first \"honored country\" is Japan.\n\n129. Out of office less than five months, former president Gerald Ford sinks a hole-in-one during the June 1977 pro-am portion of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic golf tournament at Colonial Country Club. (The shot made up for a past tournament, when one of Ford's errant balls beaned a spectator.)\n\n130. Aug. 16, 1977: Elvis Presley dies at 42.\n\n131. A trio of apparent would-be grave robbers said to be plotting to burgle Elvis' body from Forest Hill Cemetery are arrested on Aug. 29, 1977, when one of them turns FBI informant.

Hundreds of National Guardsmen are assigned to Memphis in the summer of 1978 after police officers and firefighters go on strike. On July 1, 1,400 firefighters walk off the job; that same day, 45 fires occur in four hours, inspiring a front-page editorial in The Commercial Appeal: \"The rash of vandalism and harassment that accompanied the strike is contrary to the public image of Memphis firemen. It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. A charismatic and telegenic preacher, Rogers is a leader in the denomination's \"conservative resurgence,\" which emphasizes a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible.\n\n135. Known for pastel-colored playful postmodern furniture and ceramics, an internationally influential affiliation of Italian designers in 1980 dubs itself \"The Memphis Group,\" in homage to the Bob Dylan song, \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again.\"\n\n136. July 13, 1980: Memphis experiences what remains its record high temperature: 108 degrees.\n\n137. After Mayor Wyeth Chandler resigns from office in 1982 to accept a Circuit Court judgeship, City Council member J.O. Patterson Jr. is named interim mayor — making him the city's first black mayor. (W.W. Herenton does not become the first elected black mayor until 10 years later.)\n\n138. Graceland opens to the public on July 7, 1982 — less than five years after Elvis' death.

April 5, 1982: Wrestler Jerry Lawler \"injures\" comedian/wrestler Andy Kaufman with a \"piledriver\" move at the Mid-South Coliseum, a highlight of a still much talked-about feud that reaches its apex in July when Lawler slaps Kaufman's face on \"Late Night with David Letterman.\"\n\n142. January 1983: The \"Shannon Street\" tragedy leaves seven suspects dead after police storm a North Memphis house and kill all occupants, following the torture death of a police officer, Robert S. Hester, 34, who had been held hostage in the house.\n\n143. The city's daily evening newspaper, the distinctively named Memphis Press-Scimitar, publishes its final edition on Halloween 1983.

Memphis State University football coach Rex Dockery, 41, and three others — freshman defensive back Charles Greenhill, offensive coordinator Chris Faros and booster Glenn Jones — are killed Dec. 12, 1983, in a small plane crash while en route to a speaking engagement in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee.\n\n145. Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance. When the witch appears onstage, MASH members in the audience — mostly dancers at \"adult\" nightclubs — remove their tops. The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club. Newspaper stories promise that the coinage \"will soon grace billboards, newspaper advertisements and possibly airwaves.\" Memphis boosters are asked to use the phrase as often as possible. It is never heard of again.\n\n149.

Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993. In The Commercial Appeal, critic Fredric Koeppel writes that the Arkansas-born Cloar \"drew on memories of rural life to compose canvases whose realism was tempered with touches of whimsy, folklore and mystery.\" Many of Cloar's paintings are on display at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.\n\n169. Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet. This is the humble origin of what is now the region's largest film event, the Indie Memphis Film Festival.\n\n174. Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals.

In 2002, former Shelby County Public Defender A C Wharton is elected the first black mayor of Shelby County. In 2009, he is elected the 63rd mayor of Memphis, but he loses his 2015 re-election bid to Jim Strickland.\n\n178. During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181.

A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184. March 5, 2006: Thirty-four years after Stax legend Isaac Hayes earned an Oscar in the same category for \"Theme from Shaft,\" Memphis hip-hop artists Jordan Houston (Juicy J), Paul Beauregard (DJ Paul) and Cedric Coleman (Frayser Boy) win the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" their contribution to writer-director Craig Brewer's made-in-Memphis \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n185. Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W.

An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat.

April 9, 2011: Funeral services are held for former University of Memphis basketball player and coach Larry Finch, 60, arguably the most significant sports figure in local history.

After a decade of planning, Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid opens to the public on April 29, 2015, bringing camo boots, duck decoys and live gators to the 14-year-old pyramid-shaped arena that had hosted the Tigers, Grizzlies, Bruce Springsteen and Prince.\n\n193. May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196.

The state Department of Public Health issued its latest fish consumption advisories this month. They are based on nearly 500 samples of specific fish species taken during the fall of 2020 from 41 bodies of water, health officials said. Restrictions on consumption are broken down by waterbody and presented as the safe number of meals of a species that can be eaten in a given period of time. In some locations, people are advised to avoid all fish. Mercury is often cited as the fish contaminant of concern.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: It has been a record-breaking year for sockeye salmon catches in Alaska’s Bristol Bay Nushagak District this year, an official said. “We’re approaching 27 million total run,” said Tim Sands, a state Department of Fish and Game area management biologist. “Our average run would be 9 million, so to be triple the average is amazing.” The region has experienced numerous record-breaking days, Fairbanks television station KTVF reported. The record for catch in the Nushagak District on one day was more than 1.7 million set on June 30. “Then the very next day we broke it again at 1.8 million,” Sands said. “For perspective, up until 2017, we never had a single day in the history of this district where we harvested a million sockeye in a day. We did it seven days (this year).” Other Bristol Bay areas also are doing well. “I can tell you right now in Bristol Bay, we’re over 35 million harvest, and we probably have, I’d say, probably close to another 5 million at least to go,” he said. Sands said he He is hopeful the strong run will continue next year. “I’m not a forecaster, but certainly I am optimistic that next year for sure should be a very good year,” Sands said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey has appointed a former longtime Arizona Public Service lobbyist and a retired Microsoft executive to oversee Arizona’s three universities. Ducey announced Monday he’s picked Jessica Pacheco and Bob Herbold to fill two vacant seats on the Arizona Board of Regents. Pacheco was vice president of external affairs for APS parent company Pinnacle West Capital Corp., before leaving last year to start a public affairs firm. She oversaw the utility’s lobbying, political activities and public image when it controversially spent millions to elect favored regulators. Herbold had a long career with Proctor & Gamble and Microsoft before retiring in 2001 as chief operating officer of the software giant. He now runs a foundation that provides scholarships to graduates studying engineering and computer science, according to the governor’s office. The Board of Regents oversees Arizona State University, University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University. Pacheco and Herbold replace Karrin Taylor Robson, who left to enter the Republican primary for governor, and Kathryn Hackett King, whom Ducey appointed to the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of people hospitalized because of the coronavirus jumped by 106 over the weekend in Arkansas, which is leading the nation in new virus cases per capita.

Most of the new hospitalizations, 79, occurred since Sunday, the department said. The state’s virus cases increased over the past three days by 2,552 to 365,132 total since the pandemic began. The state reported 15 new deaths. The department recently stopped reporting daily COVID-19 numbers on weekends, releasing the figures on Mondays instead. Arkansas’ cases have surged in recent weeks because of the delta variant of the virus and a low number of people getting vaccinated. Only 35% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A California initiative that would require state regulators to reduce plastic waste has qualified for the November 2022 ballot, officials said. Secretary of State Shirley Weber’s office said the initiative exceeded the required 623,212 valid petition signatures needed for the measure to go before voters next year. If passed, the law would compel the state to take multiple steps to reduce plastic waste, including requiring that single-use plastic packaging, containers and utensils be reusable, recyclable, or compostable. Producers of single-use plastic packaging would be taxed, with the revenue allocated for recycling and environmental programs. In addition, the state Legislature would be prohibited from reducing funding to specified state environmental agencies below 2019 levels. The measure is supported by a coalition of environmental groups.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo:Colorado State University Pueblo’s campus ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic was recently judged as one of the nation’s best. The American Association of State Colleges and Universities recently selected CSU Pueblo to receive its 2021 Excellence and Innovation Award for Campus Pandemic Response for its submission, “A Study in COVID-19 Response and Planning: Pandemics and the Resiliency of CSU Pueblo, the People’s University.” One of its highlights: After partnering with Maryland-based medical technology company Spartan medical – which in turn partnered with data company NTT Data Services – to expand the university’s capabilities for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing on campus, CSU Pueblo reduced positivity rates from 20% to 1% in the partnership’s first six weeks.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A coalition of state agencies and organizations launched a new “elder justice hotline” on Monday to provide a “one stop shop” to help older people navigate state services, for everything from age-based discrimination to neglect issues. The hotline and an online complaint portal became operational on Monday. Amy Porter, commissioner of the Department of Aging and Disability Services, said this new centralized number, (860) 808-5555, will make it easier for people to find the support they need. Staffed by the Consumer Assistance Unit of the state Attorney General’s office, it will operate from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. Callers will be referred to the appropriate state agency for help.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes:Sen. Ernie López, a Republican from Sussex County, said he will retire from the General Assembly next year. The senator has held his beach-bestrewed seat, which includes Milton, Lewes and Rehoboth Beach, since 2013. He was the first Hispanic American elected to the state Senate, according to his biography on the General Assembly’s website. He announced Friday that he will step down when his term ends in November 2022. In a statement, López said it has been a “tremendous honor” to be a senator for nearly a decade and that he looks forward to finishing out his term that will include six more months of lawmaking during next year’s legislative session that runs from January to the end of June. López said he made the decision after taking his two daughters on a college tour through New England earlier this month and realizing he “didn’t want to miss another day” with them before they go to college. He said he plans to work full-time at the University of Delaware, where he is an extension specialist at the College of Agriculture.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: J. Thomas Manger, who has run large police departments in Maryland and Virginia, has been selected as chief of the U.S. Capitol Police in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection, in which pro-Trump rioters stormed the building, disrupting the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. Manger, who most recently served for 15 years as chief in Montgomery County, Maryland, was picked for the position following an extensive search, according to four people briefed on the matter. The people were not authorized to discuss the selection process publicly and spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The decision came as the Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies are struggling to determine the best way to secure the Capitol and what direction to take the 2,300-person force that guards the building and the lawmakers inside it and functions as mashup of a national security agency and local police department. The department has asked for more funding for more officers and better riot gear. In the meantime, the massive fence that encircled the grounds was taken down in the past few weeks. The Capitol Police Board, which includes the House and Senate sergeant at arms and the Architect of the Capitol, is charged with oversight of the police force and led the search.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart:An alligator attacked and seriously injured a man at a park Monday, officials said. The attack occurred shortly before noon at Halpatiokee Regional Park in Stuart, according to a Martin County Sheriff’s Office Facebook post. The man was riding a bicycle when he lost control and fell down an embankment toward a body of water, officials said. The female alligator measured at more than 8-feet long, weighing an estimated 170 pounds, and was captured by trapper John Davidson, who was called to the park. Davidson was able to capture the alligator quickly, he said, and believes it might have a nest nearby that prompted it to stay close to the area. The trapper planned to return to the park Tuesday to search for the eggs and safely relocate them. “You got to be careful when you’re around the water, especially this time of year” said Davidson, a retired firefighter who has been a trapper for about 10 years. “The females are sitting on nests and are particularly aggressive.” The alligator is being relocated to a farm near Fort Drum, Davidson said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: A judge on Monday dismissed all charges against a man convicted of the 1985 slayings of a couple at a south Georgia church, exonerating him after he spent two decades behind bars, the man’s attorneys said. Glynn County Superior Court Judge Stephen Scarlett granted a motion by prosecutors to dismiss the case against Dennis Perry, 59. Scarlett last year gave Perry the chance for a new trial after DNA recovered from the crime scene matched a different suspect during reinvestigation of the case. He also ordered Perry’s release from prison while prosecutors decided whether to refile charges. Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Keith Higgins, who took office in January, decided not to pursue the case. Perry, who had maintained his innocence, said in a statement he “knew that eventually someone else would see the truth.” The Swains were killed inside Rising Daughters Baptist Church in Waverly, Georgia, in 1985. Perry was convicted in 2003 largely on the testimony of his ex-girlfriend’s mother, who said Perry had told her he planned to kill Harold Swain. The state didn’t disclose to the defense that the woman was paid $12,000 in reward money for her testimony. Perry received two consecutive life sentences in prison. The new DNA evidence has cast suspicion on another man in the slaying. Authorities were led to that suspect after reporting by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found his alibi was fabricated, Perry’s attorneys said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Oahu restaurants and bars have the option to do away with social distancing if customers provide proof of vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test. But many restaurant operators aren’t doing so because diners don’t want to show their vaccination cards or present test results, Hawaii New Now reported Monday. Honolulu allows eateries to participate in the program under Tier 5 of its COVID-19 pandemic reopening guidelines. Restaurants that did so encountered backlash. “In the beginning, we were so excited,” said Sheryl Matsuoka, the executive director of the Hawaii Restaurant Association. “It gave restaurants an option.” Matsuoka said she expected smaller restaurants to participate in the change. “But as time went by, we found guests didn’t want to show their card or weren’t vaccinated,” she said. “Visitors were upset because guests came from states with less restrictions.” Sarah Nguyen, owner of The Pizza Press in Pearl City, said she asked her employees about the program, and decided against it. “I wanted to respect each person’s privacy. It would be hard to manage and I didn’t want to put my staff in a position where a situation would arise,” Nguyen said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Environmental groups have notified Gov. Brad Little and other state officials of their intent to file a lawsuit over an expanded wolf-killing law they believe will result in the illegal killing of federally protected grizzly bears and lynx. The Center for Biological Diversity, Western Watersheds Project and others on Monday gave a required 60-day notice of their intent to sue if Idaho officials don’t prohibit all hunting, trapping and snaring in grizzly bear and lynx habitat. For lynx, the conditions could cover most of Idaho except for the southwestern portion of the state. For grizzly bears, the areas would include portions of northern, central and eastern Idaho. Wolves are found in roughly the northern two-thirds of the state. In May, the Republican governor signed into law a measure lawmakers said could lead to killing 90% of the state’s 1,500 wolves through expanded trapping and hunting. It took effect July 1.\n\nIllinois\n\nBath:A central Illinois fishing tournament that was canceled two years ago because the Illinois River flooded and last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic is returning next month. The Redneck Fishing Tournament held in Bath along the river for about a decade is gain on the calendar, with this year’s event set for Aug. 6-7. “We’re back, and the fish had better look out,” event organizer Betty DeFord told the ( Peoria) Journal Star. The event will also include bands, a beer garden, raffles and food vendors, with the proceeds going to veterans organizations. Admission is $3 for the day and $5 for the weekend. The tournament is one of the more creative responses to the invasion of the Illinois River by Asian carp – a fish that overwhelms natural ecosystems and is known for jumping out of the water high into the air. The tournament is noteworthy for another reason: Fishing poles are not used. Instead, competitors either use nets to catch the fish as they leap into the air or collect them as they land inside their boats. Previous winners have caught hundreds of the fish in just a couple hours.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:Indiana University can require its roughly 90,000 students and 40,000 employees to get COVID-19 vaccinations under a federal judge’s ruling that might be the first of its kind regarding college immunization mandates. In a ruling dated Sunday, U.S. District Judge Damon Leichty in South Bend rejected a request from eight IU students who sought to block the requirement while they pursue a lawsuit claiming that the university’s policy violated their constitutional rights by forcing them to receive unwanted medical treatment. James Bopp, an attorney representing the students, said he plans to appeal the ruling, which he believes is the first by a federal judge in challenges to such mandates, which have been imposed by hundreds of U.S. public and private colleges. Leichty wrote that the students haven’t presented evidence showing they could prevail in the case, and that the Constitution “permits Indiana University to pursue a reasonable and due process of vaccination in the legitimate interest of public health for its students, faculty and staff.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Des Moines will no longer consider doubling the funding for a private security firm after a newspaper investigation revealed its top official had referred to local racial justice protests as “terrorism” and made denigrating remarks about Black activists. The move came after a Des Moines Register investigation into comments by Tom Conley, president and CEO of the Des Moines-based Conley Group, in emails to city officials and on his Facebook page. City manager Scott Sanders said he had instructed the city clerk to remove from Monday’s City Council agenda a proposal to allocate $550,000 for the firm’s services, more than doubling the contract signed in October, the Des Moines Register reported. Sanders said although the city is satisfied with the professionalism of the firm’s services, the comments must be “properly investigated.” The firm provides security services for several municipal and school buildings. Conley stood by his opinion that last summer’s protests should be considered terrorism. “If somebody doesn’t want to do business with me because of my opinions, then don’t … I’m just a candid individual, Conley said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The health department in Kansas’ most populous county urged its public schools Monday to require students and staff who aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19 to wear masks indoors when classes resume for the fall. The Johnson County Department of Health and Environment’s guidance came with confirmed cases of the faster-spreading delta variant continuing to rise across Kansas and fueling larger numbers of new COVID-19 cases overall. “We want a return to normalcy, but we need to be cautious and get vaccinated if eligible.” said Dr. Sanmi Areola, the department’s director. Lance Williamson, a registered nurse and infection prevention consultant for the University of Kansas Health System, said wearing masks is a “basic precaution” against COVID-19. The state reported Monday that confirmed delta variant cases increased by 20% since Friday, up 158 to 950. Confirming variant cases requires genetic testing of patients’ nasal swabs or saliva samples. State data also showed that Kansas averaged 440 new COVID-19 cases overall for the seven days ending Monday, the highest such average since Feb. 26.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:Gov. Andy Beshear urged front-line workers dealing with the public to wear masks, even if fully vaccinated against COVID-19, because of risks from the more infectious delta variant blamed for sparking an increase in coronavirus cases. With large swaths of Kentucky still showing lagging vaccination rates, Beshear offered mask-wearing recommendations to protect Kentuckians from the threat posed by the variant. Beshear continued to implore unvaccinated Kentuckians to get the shots. The COVID-19 vaccines offer “significant protection” against serious illness and death, including from the delta variant, he said, adding: “This is all it would take to protect America, if folks would do it.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Lawmakers entered uncharted territory Tuesday, holding their first veto override session under the nearly 50-year-old state constitution, with uncertainty about whether they will have the votes to overturn bill rejections or what the rules of engagement are. The majority-Republican House and Senate decided to return to the Capitol largely because of two bills rejected by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards: a measure banning transgender athletes from competing on school sports teams of their identified gender, and legislation allowing people 21 and older to carry a concealed handgun without needing a permit and safety training. But they also can consider other measures that Edwards rejected, such as his removal of specific projects from budget bills, or legislation that sought to ban coronavirus vaccine mandates, mandated regular audits of elections and required local school systems to publish their finances in the Louisiana Checkbook online site.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Voters could make Maine the first state in the U.S. to decide to amend the state constitution to establish growing and consuming food as a constitutional right. The proposal will be added to the Nov. 2 ballot, the Portland Press Herald reported. Efforts to establish food rights is an evolution of the movement that produced the Maine Food Sovereignty Act. The act authorized cities in Maine to adopt local food ordinances. “You have to have a right to food because food is life,” said Sen. Craig Hickman, a farmer and a supporter of the potential amendment. Critics of the amendment said it could have unforeseen consequences for food safety and animal welfare as judges interpret the amendment in future court cases. The bill was approved by a majority in the House and Senate and will not require the approval of Gov. Janet Mills before it goes directly to the ballot, the newspaper said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: State Sen. Paul Corderman, R-Washington, filed Monday to run for his District 2 seat in the 2022 Republican primary election. Corderman was appointed to the seat after former Sen. Andrew Serafini retired last summer. At that time, Corderman served in the House of Delegates from District 2B, which roughly includes the city limits of Hagerstown. He was appointed to that seat late in 2017 when former Del. Brett Wilson, R-Washington, was appointed as a judge in the Washington County Circuit Court. Corderman, who had served on the Hagerstown City Council, was then elected to return to the delegate seat in 2018.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: A popular tourist town on Cape Cod issued a new mask-wearing advisory Monday after more than 100 people tested positive for the coronavirus following the Fourth of July holiday. The public health advisory from Provincetown officials encouraged residents and visitors to the town, a popular LGBTQ+ summer destination, to resume wearing masks indoors, regardless of their vaccination status. It also urged crowded venues and other businesses where social distancing isn’t possible to verify that patrons are vaccinated. The advisory was approved during an emergency meeting with the town’s select board and board of health. Dr. Catherine Brown, of the state Department of Public Health, said the state has alerted other jurisdictions about the cluster of cases tied to Provincetown. Local officials said the majority are Massachusetts residents but more than 40 are from out of state. They said more 90% of those infected were men and that their median age is 35. Officials said they’re also investigating how many of those infected were already vaccinated.\n\nMichigan\n\nMount Pleasant: Students fully vaccinated against COVID-19 at Central Michigan University can enter to win full-year scholarships and hundreds of gift cards, the university announced Monday. The university will name winners Aug. 2 and Aug. 23, Sept. 13, and Oct. 4. Each drawing will have 100 students who will get a $75 gift card and one student who will win full-year scholarship equal to 30 domestic undergraduate credit hours or 18 domestic graduate credit hours to be used for the 2021-2022 school year. In the announcement from the university it cited a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where only 34% of adults ages 18 to 39 have received a COVID-19 vaccine. All participating students will receive a 20% discount at the university bookstore in an effort to get students vaccinated before the fall semester starts, said Jennifer DeHaemers, vice president for student recruitment and retention.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: An invasive weed that can choke out native plants and fish habitat has been found in one of Minnesota’s largest and most popular walleye lakes, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said. The DNR has confirmed the discovery of starry stonewort in Leech Lake, located in northwestern Minnesota. The bright green microalgae plant has now been verified in 18 of the state’s 11.842 lakes, according to the DNR, including nearby Cass Lake and Lake Winnibigoshish. Leech Lake is largely within the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Reservation boundaries. It is one of the 10 largest lakes in Minnesota with nearly 200 miles of shoreline, area tourism officials said. Starry stonewort has never been eradicated from any U.S. lake, but early detection is the key to effective management, the DNR said. It is most likely spread when fragments have not been properly cleaned from trailered boats, personal watercraft, docks, boat lifts, anchors or other water-related equipment. The species was first discovered in Minnesota in 2015 in Lake Koronis, which is located near Paynesville in Stearns County. The state has spent tens of millions of dollars trying to fight the weed.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Dr. Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi’s top public health official, said the state is seeing a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in July. The State Department of Health said 2,326 new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed Friday through Sunday. That is largest three-day increase of cases reported in the state since February. As of Monday, the Health Department said Mississippi has had 329,130 confirmed cases of the virus since the start of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. The department said 7,468 people in the state had died from the virus. Mississippi has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the nation, and the increase of cases is happening as schools prepare for the new academic year. Classes begin July 26 in the northern Mississippi city of Corinth and in early to mid-August in most other districts. The state Board of Education on Thursday adopted policies requiring all school districts to restart in-person learning as the main form of instruction for 2021-22. During the previous year, districts had the option for in-person or online instruction, or a combination of the two.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Kansas City Chiefs fans will have to get tickets in advance to visit the team’s training camp this year, and they won’t be able to get autographs from players because of the pandemic. Dr. Paul Schroeppel, the AFC champions’ head orthopedic surgeon, said fans won’t be allowed to interact with players under the NFL’s protocols for preventing coronavirus outbreaks. He discussed the rules during a daily webcast by the University of Kansas Health System. The Chiefs open their training camp in St. Joseph, Missouri, on July 28 with a special event for season ticket holders, with practices open to other fans July 29, with attendance limited. Missouri has seen a surge in new COVID-19 cases because of the faster-spreading delta variant.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Environmental groups are challenging the Montana Department of Environmental Quality for permitting wastewater disposal into the groundwater for a new development in Big Sky that they said could degrade water quality in the Gallatin River downstream from Yellowstone National Park. The Upper Missouri Waterkeeper and Montana Environmental Information Center filed Friday a complaint in Gallatin County court over the department’s May decision to approve a groundwater pollution permit for a septic system owned by Lazy J South, a residential and commercial development less than half a mile from the Gallatin River. The groups said the permit could lead to increased algal blooms in the river, which is suffering from unprecedented noxious algal blooms downstream from Big Sky. Such blooms could harm recreational activities on the river, including trout fishing and whitewater rafting, according to the court filing. A spokesperson for DEQ said the department does not comment on ongoing legal matters.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nebraska schools are getting conflicting advice from state and federal health officials over whether students should quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus. The Omaha World-Herald reported the state Department of Health and Human Services is telling schools that students who had contact with an infected person would not have to quarantine as long as they don’t have any symptoms. If symptoms develop, then the state said a student should isolate themselves. But the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said students who aren’t vaccinated and have close contact with an infected person should still quarantine. The CDC said vaccinated people who are showing no symptoms are not required to quarantine after a contact. Each school district will be left to decide which advice to follow after consulting with local health officials. The Nebraska State Education Association said it is urging school districts to follow the CDC guidelines.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Nevada-based scientists argued in a new study that wildfire smoke might increase the risk of contracting the coronavirus. A study published last week by scientists at the Desert Research Institute found that coronavirus infection rates increased disproportionately during wildfire season in 2020, when smoke from fires in neighboring states blanketed much of northern Nevada. In a paper in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, Desert Research Institute Assistant Research Scientist Daniel Kiser and four co-authors noted the test positivity rate in Washoe County increased significantly during periods when monitors measured high levels of particulate matter in the air from wildfire smoke. For every 10 micrograms per cubic meter of small particulate matter known as PM2.5 in the air, the positivity rate increased about 6.3% two to six days later, the study found. The authors argued that the association between wildfire smoke and the coronavirus likely suggested pollution made people more prone to viruses more broadly.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Applications are being accepted for New Hampshire’s “Summer Stipend Program,” which seeks to reward workers returning to jobs after unemployment. The state announced in May that it was ending federal pandemic unemployment benefits. Anyone who was on unemployment the week of May 15 and has since kept a job for at least eight weeks can now apply for the stipends, which are $500 for part-time workers and $1,000 for full-time employees. More than 1,700 individuals who found work between May 18-22 became eligible to apply on Monday. The program will remain active until the $10 million fund is depleted. Since the stipend was announced, more than 21,000 people have stopped filing for unemployment benefits, according to Gov. Chris Sununu’s office.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The 18-year old pilot of a banner plane made an emergency landing Monday on a bridge in southern New Jersey, snarling traffic but causing no injuries, authorities said. Landon Lucas reported that his plane started having engine trouble about 12:30 p.m. as he was flying near Steel Pier in Atlantic City, officials said. Lucas released his banner into the ocean and was trying to fly to a nearby municipal airport in Ocean City when he spotted a gap in traffic in the westbound lanes of the Route 52 causeway, which connects Ocean City and Somers Point. Lucas landed the plane without incident, witnesses said, and officials said the aircraft was not damaged. The incident remains under investigation, authorities said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Film Office said this fiscal year, which began in July 2020 during the pandemic, broke records in the state with film and TV productions spending roughly $623 million. An estimated 40% of production budgets are spent on procuring goods and services from New Mexico businesses, according to the state. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham touted the numbers, saying the productions would otherwise have been shot elsewhere had it not been for the state’s crew base, stunning locations and film incentive program. Earlier this year, NBCUniversal marked the opening of its production hub near downtown Albuquerque. It joined Netflix, which has plans to expand its footprint on the southern edge of the city. Both have received millions of dollars in state and local economic development funds as incentives for locating in New Mexico. An estimated 9,000 New Mexico residents work in the industry with an average wage of more than $56,000 annually, according to the state. About three-quarters of below-the-line crew and cast members involved in productions over the last year were residents.\n\nNew York\n\nWatertown: Lawmakers in Watertown voted to keep retail marijuana shops from opening in the northern New York city. The city council opted Watertown out of New York’s new marijuana legalization law after a marathon public hearing Monday night, according to WWNY-TV. New York approved a legalization bill in March that will allow sales of recreational-use cannabis. Sales are expected to begin next year. But the state law allows local governments to pass stricter rules on marijuana use and to prohibit retail dispensaries. Twenty-six people spoke at the hearing, most in favor of opting into the state law. “I’m asking, why wouldn’t you want to keep all of your city residents who do smoke marijuana, give them a safe place to buy marijuana, where it’s controlled?” Joanne Hughes said. Council members said they wanted more guidance from Albany and noted they could still opt back in later. Also, the public can petition the council to hold a referendum.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: A nearly four-year project to repair the hull of the USS North Carolina battleship was officially completed Tuesday with water from the Cape Fear River flooding the temporary barrier surrounding the ship. A Wilmington-based company cut and replaced steel on the bow and also repainted affected areas of the hull, news outlet reported. The $11 million project began in August 2016 with the construction of a cofferdam to surround the battleship which allowed crews to drain the river water and have access to the ship’s brittle hull. With the cofferdam construction wrapping up in May 2018, work to replace the steel at the ship’s water-wind line began in June 2020. Atlantic Coast Industrial Marine Construction cut and replaced steel on the bow, as well as repainted affected areas of the hull, according to a release on the battleship’s website. Money for the repair came from fundraising effort to aid in restoration and maintenance of the battleship and its facilities. The battleship arrived in Wilmington in 1961 after serving in World War II. It has suffered from more than 50 years of corrosion from the Cape Fear River and plans to repair the ship’s hull have been on the table since at least 2010.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: With nearly half the cattle in North Dakota in extreme drought locations, ranchers are making some tough decisions on thinning their herds. At Kist Livestock Auction in Mandan, weekly sales are up by 1,000 head over a typical year, an increase of one-third. Some cattle stay in the state, said Matt Lachenmeier, the auction barn’s field representative. But there’s demand for cattle in nearby states, as well, including Minnesota. “Now we’re starting to run out of homes for them,” he said. “There’s a lot of cattle moving.” Lachenmeier said ranchers are selling replacement heifers or older cows first and trying to hang on to younger cows. He said it’s hard to lose animals that have been part of a long-term breeding program, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The span from October 2020 to March 2021 is the driest on record, said Janna Block, extension livestock systems specialist at North Dakota State University’s Hettinger research center.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A Columbus police helicopter crew that spelled out the department’s initials during an early morning patrol over a residential neighborhood committed no misconduct, an internal review determined. But the department’s flight rules will be updated to “remind” all helicopter crews not to loiter over residential areas without a clear law-enforcement purpose, The Columbus Dispatch reported Tuesday. The newspaper obtained the report through a public records request. The two-person crew said the maneuver wasn’t planned, but carried out after they noticed on a flight-tracking display they had unintentionally spelled out what resembled a “C” while on patrol April 17. The pilot decided to continue on to spell out a “P” and “D” while they awaited their next call for service. Officials have said the maneuver took about 10 minutes to complete, was done at normal altitude and didn’t result in any missed calls for service or additional fuel usage. It was conducted over a “random area of the city” that included some residential area, something which the report said was “not intentional.” Some city officials have criticized the officers’ actions, calling the incident “a joyride” and a waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state is suing the U.S. Department of the Interior over the federal agency’s plan to strip Oklahoma of its jurisdiction to regulate coal mining on tribal reservations, Gov. Kevin Stitt said. The lawsuit, filed last week in federal court in Oklahoma City, names as defendants U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement and that agency’s acting director, Glenda Owens. The U.S. Department of the Interior notified the state earlier this year it planned to strip Oklahoma of its jurisdiction to regulate surface coal mining within the Muscogee Nation reservation following last year’s U.S. Supreme Court’s McGirt decision, which determined the tribe’s reservation in eastern Oklahoma was never disestablished by Congress. Stitt claims that the decision applies only to criminal jurisdiction.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The threat of thunderstorms and lightning has prompted officials in fire-ravaged Oregon to ask for help from outside the Pacific Northwest to prepare for additional blazes as many resources are already devoted to a massive fire in the state that has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island. The 537-square-mile blaze is burning 300 miles southeast of Portland in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges. Evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California. But eyeing how the Oergon fire – fueled by extreme weather – keeps growing by miles each day, officials with the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in southwest Oregon are asking for more outside crews to be ready should there be a surge in fire activity there. The worry is that dry conditions, a drought and the recent record-breaking heat wave in the region have created tinderbox conditions, so resources like fire engines are being recruited from places like Arkansas, Nevada and Alaska. Thunderstorms could bring wind to fan the flames and lightning that could spark new ones, the National Weather Service said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: City school officials are planning to consult with more air quality scientists after meeting Monday with an expert critical of the district’s $4.5 million purchase of NASA-originated air purifier technology. The expert, a Drexel professor, said the purifiers were ineffective at reducing the spread of the coronavirus and had the potential to create harmful chemicals. Preparing to welcome students in-person for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, district officials last week touted the multimillion-dollar investment in air purifiers advertised to rid air and surfaces of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.The devices have been purchased and will be installed in every classroom by the end of July, a district spokesperson said. But following the school district’s announcement, several experts questioned the purifiers’ effectiveness and safety. They included Michael Waring – professor of indoor air quality and department head of civil, architectural, and environmental engineering at Drexel University – who met with School District Chief Operating Officer Reggie McNeil on Monday. According to a spokesperson, the district used federal funding to purchase more than 9,500 devices for its 200-plus buildings. They use ActivePure Technology, which, according to its website, protects against the coronavirus by pulling free oxygen and water molecules through a “patented honeycomb matrix” that oxidizes molecules that are then released back into a room to neutralize viruses.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Ten nonprofits from across Rhode Island will receive $10,000 in grants as the state reached the first milestone of its RI Gives Vax Challenge, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee said. The Democrat said 5,000 more Rhode Islanders received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. “This is a win-win for Rhode Island, our local nonprofits and the communities they serve,” McKee said. “Through the RI Gives Vax Challenge, we’re getting healthier, we’re raising awareness, and we’re able to help the organizations that have stepped up to support those most in need during the pandemic.” The recipients of the first round of grants were selected through a lottery system by the Rhode Island Foundation. They include Access To Recovery, Adoption Rhode Island, Boys & Girls Clubs of Northern Rhode Island, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center, the Elisha Project, Pawtucket Soup Kitchen, the Refugee Development Center, the Rhode Island Free Clinic, Southern Rhode Island Volunteers, and the WARM Center. The fund has a budget of $750,000, which will be allocated in grants of $10,000 to a Rhode Island nonprofit each time the state administers an additional 5,000 first COVID-19 vaccine doses. The state provided $500,000 and the Rhode Island Foundation contributed $250,000.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The process to draw new districts for South Carolina House and Senate seats as well as the U.S. House kicked off Tuesday, with senators hopeful the whirlwind of map drawing, negotiations, public hearings and final vote will take less than four months. The Senate’s redistricting subcommittee agreed Tuesday at its first meeting to hold 10 public hearings across the state starting next week and ending before the final U.S. census data on where the 5.1 million people in South Carolina live is released Aug. 16. The districts are drawn every 10 years after the federal government completes its nationwide count. The goal of the high-stakes process is to make sure all 46 of the state’s Senate districts and 124 House districts have roughly the same number of people, give or take a few thousand.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said the state finished the last fiscal year with an $86 million surplus. Tax revenue hit a 30-year high, the Republican governor said, and finished $62 million over what was estimated. The state also spent about $24 million less than what was budgeted for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. Noem credited the state’s “respect for freedom and our continued emphasis on fiscal responsibility” for the financial windfall, though federal coronavirus relief funds sent to taxpayers and state government also fueled the surplus. The state government has received more than $2.2 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funds – money that was pumped into businesses and used to cover state expenses tied to the pandemic.Noem has pointed to the state’s growing economy as evidence her mostly hands-off approach to the pandemic worked.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Volkswagen said it will stop producing the Passat at its Chattanooga assembly plant. The German-based automaker said it will stop building the sedan model in Chattanooga with a limited edition 2022 model. Volkswagen said the move is part of its transformation to build future electric vehicles. The company began making the Passat in Chattanooga in 2011. The first versions of the Volkswagen Passat family sedans and wagons for U.S. customers launched in 1974 under the Dasher name. The Passat name first appeared in the U.S. market in 1990 and has remained since. The company exported the first six generations from Europe.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi:Former Police Chief Mike Markle is returning to the top spot, Mayor Paulette Guajardo and City Manager Peter Zanoni said. Markle retired in May 2021 after more than 30 years of serving Corpus Christi. He previously accepted a private sector job. In June, interim chief and former assistant chief David Blackmon announced he would pull his name from consideration for the permanent chief position. Markle’s reappointment requires City Council confirmation. His first day back on the job will be July 27 if approved by the council.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Health officials have warned that algae blooms are turning up in Utah Lake that can produce toxins harmful to humans and animals. The Utah County Health Department warned that samples taken from the lake water on July 13 showed that cyanobacteria cell counts have reached a dangerous level, The Daily Herald reported Monday. The warning came days after officials issued a similar advisory for American Fork Beach. Utah Lake marinas will remain open for boat traffic but water recreation “should be avoided” at the American Fork Marina, Lincoln Beach and within the Provo Bay, according to county health officials. Cyanobacteria are microorganisms that are a natural part of fresh water ecosystems but under certain conditions they can multiple rapidly, creating scums and blooms on the water’s surface and along shorelines\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Health Department warned Tuesday that algae blooms are turning up in Vermont waters that can produce toxins harmful to humans and animals. The department is encouraging people to go to its website to view a video and photos of what cyanobacteria and blooms look like. “By knowing what a bloom looks like, and scanning the water before you go in, you’ll know if you should stay out of the water,” Bridget O’Brien, an environmental health scientist with the Department of Health, said in a statement. Cyanobacteria are microorganisms that are a natural part of fresh water ecosystems but under certain conditions they can multiple rapidly, creating scums and blooms on the water’s surface and along shorelines, the department said. Blooms have shown up most often in northern parts of Lake Champlain, causing some Burlington beaches to recently be closed, and in other regions of the lake as well as other Vermont lakes in recent years. The blooms can cause skin rashes, diarrhea, a sore throat, stomach problems and more serious health concerns for swimmers and waders, the Health Department said, noting that exposure is a particular concern for small children who might ingest the water. Cyanobacteria is potentially fatal to dogs who might drink the water or lick the residue off their fur, officials warned.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Virginia Zoo is welcoming its first baby Southern white rhinoceros. The male calf was born to mom, Zina, and dad, Sibindi, on July 11, zoo officials announced Monday. He is strong, nursing well and is bonding with his mother, who is showing signs of good mothering, officials said. The calf is the first of his species to be born at the Virginia Zoo and his birth brings the zoo’s rhino count to four. The zoo’s veterinarian Dr. Tara Reilly examined the calf about 36 hours after he was born and he weighed in at 125 pounds. He is 22 inches tall and 36 inches long. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies the species as near-threatened because of threats in the wild from habitat loss and illegal poaching of their horns. The new calf needs a name, so the zoo is auctioning off the right to name him. The auction runs through July 30 and proceeds will go to the International Rhino Foundation.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: United Airlines plans to suspend service out of Paine Field airport in Everett beginning in early October. In a statement Monday, a United spokesperson said the airline has “continued to evaluate and adapt its network” and that the decision is “based on demand trends.” The airline now operates one daily United Express flight between Denver International Airport and Paine Field, which will be discontinued beginning Oct. 5, according to the statement. The Seattle Times reported United said it will continue to serve the region with nonstop service to Seattle from Denver, New York/Newark, Houston, Los Angeles, Chicago, the District of Columbia and San Francisco. John Gallagher, a spokesperson for Propeller Airports, which designed, built and operates the two-year-old terminal north of Seattle, said in a statement the move was not a surprise because “carriers are making post-pandemic adjustments to their schedules and markets.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: “America’s Got Talent” winner Landau Eugene Murphy Jr. is being featured on an adult literacy campaign in West Virginia. A photo of Murphy, a native of Logan, West Virginia, is on billboards throughout the state as part of the “Never Too Late to Graduate” push by the state Department of Education’s Office of Adult Education. Murphy also is displaying the materials and banners at his state concerts to provide information to help people earn their diplomas and pursue other educational opportunities, the department said. “I truly believe it is never too late to graduate, and I hope others use my story as an example of how to always have a goal and a dream,” Murphy said. Murphy dropped out of school in the 11th grade, a decision that haunted him for years. He worked numerous odd jobs and at one point was living out of his car. Last year during the coronavirus pandemic, the singer took online classes during the spring and summer after his road performances were eliminated by the virus shutdown. He earned his high school equivalency diploma 30 years after dropping out.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison:The University of Wisconsin Center for Human Genomics and Precision Medicine opened a new clinic Friday that will use the latest genetic technology, and exploit connections to top scientists around the world in order to help patients who have been at the mercy of unknown diseases. Stephen Meyn, who directs the Center for Human Genomics and Precision Medicine, said the new clinic represents an initial investment of several million dollars and is expected to take on about 100 cases a year “and ramp up from there.” The clinic has already “reviewed more than 50 cases with a wide range of conditions from birth defects to neurologic problems to skeletal disorders and immune system problems, Meyn said. The clinic, located in the Waisman Center, will partner with the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, the Biotechnology Center at UW-Madison, Stanford University in California and The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Meyn said that in addition to the clinic for patients, the project will also include research.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A judge has sentenced an Oklahoma man to a week in jail and ordered him to pay $1,100 for guiding visitors illegally in Yellowstone National Park. Theodore Eugene Garland, 60 of Edmond, Oklahoma, led visitors who trespassed in thermal areas and elsewhere, cliff-jumped in an off-limits area and altered a river’s flow by creating a pool for swimmers to soak in, U.S. prosecutors said in a statement Monday. Magistrate Judge Mark L. Carman in Mammoth Hot Springs found Garland guilty of the violations in a nonjury trial in April and sentenced him July 2. Besides imposing the jail time and payments, the judge banned Garland from the park for the remainder of 2021. Guiding in Yellowstone requires a permit. Garland had one but video he posted on Facebook of cliff-jumping in Firehole Canyon prompted a Yellowstone law enforcement ranger to investigate, according to court documents filed in the case. An Apple podcast, Instagram photo and Facebook video revealed other possible violations such as creating a “hot pot” for swimmers at the base of Mystic Falls on the Little Firehole River, ranger Devon Beeny said in the documents. Prosecutors charged Garland with 15 counts of illegal activities and violating park regulations. Carman found Garland guilty of seven, acquitting him of others that included disturbing a black bear while it was feeding.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/10/time-capsule-eyes-texas-pebble-mine-news-around-states/118805644/", "title": "Time capsule, 'Eyes of Texas': News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state said it will allow a death row inmate’s pastor to hold his hand during a lethal injection next month, a decision that was made to end litigation over the issue. Lawyers for Alabama wrote in a June court document that inmates can now have a personal spiritual adviser present with them in the execution chamber, and the adviser will be allowed to touch them. The agreement settled litigation over Willie Smith’s request to have his personal pastor with him as he is put to death. Smith was convicted of the 1991 kidnapping and murder of 22-year-old Sharma Ruth Johnson in Birmingham. Alabama has rescheduled Smith’s execution for next month. According to court documents, his spiritual adviser can anoint the inmate’s head with oil; pray with the inmate and hold his hand as the execution begins, as long as the adviser steps away before the consciousness assessment is performed; and remain in the execution chamber until the curtains to the witness rooms are drawn. The description was included in a footnote in a joint filing in June by the state and Smith’s attorneys in which the two sides announced they had reached an agreement over the spiritual adviser issue.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it would seek to restart a process that could restrict mining in the Bristol Bay region, renowned for its salmon runs. The announcement is the latest in a long-running dispute over a proposed copper-and-gold mine in the southwest Alaska region. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in November 2020, under the Trump administration, denied key authorization for the proposed Pebble Mine following an environmental review from the agency months earlier that the developer had viewed as a favorable to the project. In the rejection decision, a Corps official concluded the project would “result in significant degradation of the aquatic ecosystem” and was “contrary to the public interest.” The Pebble Limited Partnership, the mine developer owned by Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd., is appealing that determination. “As the Biden Administration seeks lower carbon emissions for energy production, they should recognize that such change will require significantly more mineral production – notably copper,” Mike Heatwole, a Pebble partnership spokesperson, said in an email. “The Pebble Project remains an important domestic source for the minerals necessary for the administration to reach its green energy goals.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A program announced by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey last month to give private school vouchers to parents who object to campus mask requirements has seen applications surge, with twice as many either started or completed as can be funded with the $10 million in federal coronavirus relief earmarked for the plan. And GOP lawmakers who back expansion of the state’s existing voucher program doubt any students who receive the grants will be forced back into public schools when the federal cash is exhausted. Opponents of the school voucher program suspect that is highly likely. The program Ducey created will give $7,000 per school year to each student who enrolled in a public school that either has mask requirements or requires unvaccinated children exposed to the coronavirus to quarantine or isolate differently from vaccinated children. Applicants can earn up to 350% of the federal poverty level, which equals $92,750 for a family of four. They can use the money for private school tuition, tutoring or other costs. The governor’s education policy adviser said last week that applications for 454 children had been completed and another 2,255 started in the first 13 days the application window was open, with 69 approved.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state is easing rules for its rental relief program to prioritize the funds for tenants at immediate risk of being evicted. Little of the state’s share of the federal money has been spent so far. Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced the changes to the Arkansas Rent Relief Program on Wednesday after asking the state Department of Human Services to review its processes surrounding the program. Arkansas set aside $173 million in federal funds for the program for people who have lost jobs or are struggling financially because of the pandemic. So far, though, only $9.8 million in assistance has been paid out. DHS said nearly 2,800 applicants are at immediate risk of eviction, and 51% of those will be prioritized under the changes. The remainder have been paid or are expected to be paid by next week. The other changes will also allow funds to be paid to eligible tenant applicants if a landlord does not submit the required information within 10 days. DHS said the contractor handling the program is also adding 70 staffers to handle calls and process cases, and a new case management team has been added to focus on previously submitted applications in which the landlord did not submit the required information.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Lawmakers on Wednesday sent Gov. Gavin Newsom legislation to end the careers of bad law enforcement officers, a year after an earlier effort died without a final vote. The measure aims to keep troubled officers from jumping from one job to another by creating a mandatory new state license, or certification, that could be permanently revoked. “This bill allows them to rid the bad apples that we know exist, bad apples that we know exist in every profession,” Democratic Sen. Steven Bradford said. “Just because you put on a uniform and a badge doesn’t absolve you or make you immune to being a bad person.” California licenses more than 200 professions, he noted – “we’re just adding law enforcement to that category.” The final, softened version of the legislation also allows for suspending the license as a lesser punishment and includes other safeguards like requiring a two-thirds vote for decertification. Senators gave final approval on a 28-9 vote, with Republicans opposed. California is one of just four states without a way of decertifying officers, alongside Hawaii, New Jersey and Rhode Island. Bradford named his bill the Kenneth Ross Jr. Police Decertification Act, after a 25-year-old Black man killed in Los Angeles County in 2018 by an officer who had previously been involved in three other shootings.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: The city announced Wednesday that it has agreed to pay $3 million to a woman with dementia who was roughly arrested by police last year after being suspected of shoplifting. Her family said the money will pay for the around-the-clock care she has needed after her condition deteriorated following her arrest. Then-Officer Austin Hopp arrested Karen Garner, 73, after she left a store without paying for $13.88 worth of items in Loveland, about 50 miles north of Denver, in June 2020. Police body camera video shows that after she turned away from him, he grabbed her arm and pushed her to the ground, with her still holding the wildflowers she had been picking as she walked through a field. A federal lawsuit that Garner filed claimed he dislocated her shoulder by shoving her handcuffed left arm forward onto the hood of a patrol car. Police station surveillance video also showed Hopp and others officers talking about the arrest and the “pop” sound her arm made, laughing and joking at times as Garner sat in a holding cell. Officials in Loveland apologized to Garner and her family in the announcement of the proposed settlement and listed the steps they have taken in response to her arrest, including a pending independent investigation and changes to how cases are reviewed when police use force.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMontville: Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday that his administration plans to close the Radgowski Correctional Center at the end of this year. The prison, part of the two-building Corrigan-Radgowski complex, is the second of three closures that were planned as part of budget cuts for the 2022-23 fiscal year. The move is expected to save the state $7.3 million, the governor’s office said. The state shuttered the maximum-security Northern Correctional Institution in June, a move expected to save about $11.75 million annually. The governor’s office has not announced the name of the third facility it plans to close or when that will happen. “Spending millions of dollars in annual operating costs on buildings that have historically low numbers of incarcerated individuals inside is just not a good use of resources,” Lamont, a Democrat, said in a statement. “By relocating them to other facilities that have available capacity, we can deliver on our administration’s goal of reducing the cost structure of state government.” The closures come during a steady decline in the inmate population, which has decreased by more than 3,200 over the past 17 months. The state currently houses about 9,200 prisoners, down from the all-time high of 19,894 in February 2008.\n\nDelaware\n\nMillsboro: About 30,000 gallons of diesel fuel were spilled at NRG Energy’s power plant on the Indian River near Millsboro overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday. The spill, discovered Wednesday morning, occurred after a pressurized hose detached and was contained to NRG property, according to a statement from the company. Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control spokeswoman Nikki Lavoie said the hose detached from an above-ground storage tank, and the fuel was released into “a contained outside area.” Lavoie said Tri-State Bird Rescue was contacted “to assist with the wildlife impacts from the spill,” including “affected geese on the property and seagulls that had flown into the area.” No waterways or public lands were affected by the spill, according to NRG spokesman Dave Schrader. He said the spill was contained to “the coal pile.” “NRG takes protection of the environment and compliance with all environmental regulations seriously,” Schrader said. DNREC, the Coast Guard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency continue to monitor cleanup. NRG announced earlier this year that the coal-fired Millsboro plant will close in June 2022.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Georgetown could soon be getting a Metro station, WUSA-TV reports. A two-year study commissioned by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to address overcrowding on the Blue, Orange and Silver lines presented six options for extended rail service on the lines, which have exceeded capacity limits during peak hours for years, according to Metro. The study, launched in 2019, identified a preferred Blue line route that would extend the line to National Harbor by way of a second Rosslyn station, a new Potomac River tunnel and a new station at Georgetown. The study predicts cities and counties along Metro rail lines will add 37% more people and 30% more jobs by 2040, noting that large rail projects can take up to 20 years to complete. Metro said in its report that the expansion would cost between $20 billion and $25 billion to build and between $175 million and $200 million annually to operate, but of the six options, the National Harbor expansion would create the biggest ridership growth – one of the main goals of the study. Metro board members planned to meet Thursday to discuss the results of the study.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A chance encounter with a former Marine beset by delusions of child sex trafficking ultimately led to the massacre of four members of a family, including a mother holding her baby boy, a sheriff said Thursday. Bryan Riley, who faces murder and other charges in Sunday’s killings, stopped by the slain family’s Lakeland home briefly the day before after going to a nearby friend’s house to pick up a first aid kit, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a news conference. Riley had told acquaintances he was headed for Hurricane Ida relief work. A short distance from the friend’s home, Riley saw Justice Gleason mowing his lawn with his 11-year-old daughter in the yard, Judd said. That provided the trigger that led to the slayings, Judd said: Riley believed she was an imaginary child named Amber who was suicidal and being held by a supposed sex trafficking ring that God had told him to confront. No one named Amber lived at the home, as Gleason repeatedly told Riley before asking him to leave their initial encounter. “This was all fiction, all made up by him,” Judd said. Riley, wearing body armor, had three weapons with him and fired at least 100 shots in the main home and a smaller one in back. An 11-year-old girl who played dead survived the attack despite being shot multiple times and has undergone four surgeries so far, Judd said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city’s public safety net hospital became the latest to temporarily cancel elective surgeries Wednesday, saying it’s being overrun with COVID-19 patients. Grady Memorial Hospital CEO John Haupert made the announcement, saying the hospital was “inundated” with patients over the Labor Day weekend even though it was officially diverting ambulances. “Because of the strain this is putting on the health system, our patients, and our staff, we must make some changes to the way we operate,” Haupert wrote. “As of today, we are canceling non-essential outpatient surgery and procedures. We will regularly review patient volumes to determine when we can resume those services.” More than 5,900 people sickened by the respiratory illness were in Georgia hospitals Wednesday. COVID-19 patient numbers have been hovering around 6,000, a record high, for more than a week. Across the state, 97% of intensive care beds were in use Wednesday, an all-time high. Some other Georgia hospitals were already postponing elective surgeries, as more than 50 hospitals statewide Wednesday reported they were turning away ambulances bringing emergency or ICU patients.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state is launching a program that will allow people to use their smartphones to prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Hawaii Smart Health Card comes shortly before Honolulu and Maui begin instituting vaccine requirements for patrons of restaurants and other businesses. State officials say that starting Friday, people who have been vaccinated in Hawaii will be able to upload a photo of their vaccination card to the Safe Travels Hawaii website to create a digital vaccination record. The website will cross-check this information with data stored in the state’s vaccination database. Gov. David Ige said this should help prevent the use of fake vaccination cards. The verification process should only take a few seconds. Customers may show restaurants, museums and other establishments their verified Hawaii Smart Health Card in lieu of their paper vaccination card to gain admittance. Businesses will have the option to use a validator app to scan a QR code on the digital vaccination records to verify their legitimacy. “Participation in the Hawaii Smart Health Card is voluntary. It is strictly a convenience for those residents who have been vaccinated here in the state of Hawaii,” Ige said at a news conference.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Scientists studying pack rat middens at the City of Rocks National Reserve have determined that the area’s iconic pinyon pine trees first arrived about 2,800 years ago and became prevalent about 700 years ago. That’s just one example of what scientists have learned by studying the middens – piles of seeds, bones, leaves and waste – in the area that date back 45,000 years. Julio Betancourt of the U.S. Geological Survey has studied pack rat middens in the U.S. West and South America. “They’re hard as a rock, kind of black, big chunks, sometimes huge chunks of pack rat deposits that have been consolidated, cemented by the crystalized urine of pack rats,” Betancourt told the Post Register. “The pack rats are just collecting tons of stuff and don’t go very far to collect it – mostly within 50 meters . The spatial resolution is really high. We’ve studied all kinds of things in these deposits. The principal thing is plant remains.” The middens can be dated, giving a snapshot of the local ecology over time. The U.S. Geological Survey keeps a database of pack rat middens for western North America. One midden from the area dated to about 10,000 years ago is on display at the City of Rocks visitor center in Almo. Betancourt said the middens have allowed scientists to track climate and vegetation changes at the City of Rocks.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A federal judge has granted class-action status in a lawsuit filed six years ago that alleged the Chicago Police Department’s stop-and-frisk policy targeted Black and Hispanic people who hadn’t committed any crime. Attorneys involved in the lawsuit announced Tuesday that the case’s six original plaintiffs are now part of a class of more than 1 million people. The plaintiffs’ lawyers say some 2 million unconstitutional stops occurred in Chicago between 2010 and 2017 in which officers allegedly had no “reasonable suspicion” that a crime had been or was about to be committed. The decision was handed down by U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood on Aug. 31. The ruling, which could lead to a trial, comes at a difficult time for a police department that has long been plagued by a legacy of excessive force and racism and has scrambled to restore public trust. “This practice has to stop – and elevating this issue to a class action provides a way to make significant change and make our community better,” Antonio Romanucci, an attorney who filed the lawsuit, said in a statement. In fact, the judge limited her ruling only to the possibility of a change in policy, according to Jennifer McGuffin, a spokeswoman for Romanucci’s firm.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s ban on telemedicine consultations between doctors and women seeking abortions and several other abortion restrictions are back in force after a federal appeals court set aside a judge’s ruling that they were unconstitutional. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals panel issued a 2-1 ruling Wednesday that allows Indiana to continue enforcing those laws while the court considers a full appeal of the case. It said District Court Judge Sarah Evans Barker’s ruling last month was inconsistent with previous Supreme Court decisions and reinstated Indiana’s telemedicine ban, along with state laws requiring in-person examinations by a doctor before medication-induced abortions can be performed and a prohibition on second-trimester abortions outside hospitals or surgery centers. “Plaintiffs contend, and the district court found, that developments in videoconferencing make it possible to dispense with in-person meetings, that improvements in medicine make the use of hospitals or surgical centers unnecessary, and that nurses are competent to approve and monitor medication-induced abortions,” the ruling said. “The district court concluded that these findings permit it to depart from the holdings of earlier cases. Yet the Supreme Court insists that it alone has the authority to modify its precedents.”\n\nIowa\n\nWinterset: More than 100 students walked out of Winterset Junior High and Winterset High School this week in protest over the school district placing seventh grade literacy teacher Lucas Kaufmann on leave after a presentation about himself to his class featured the LGBT pride flag, according to a change.org petition. When asked by students, Kaufmann said he was bisexual. More than 2,500 people had signed the online petition as of Thursday afternoon. Winterset Community School District Superintendent Justin Gross confirmed Kaufmann was placed on leave after concerns were raised following the presentation but declined further comment. State law prohibits employers from firing employees based on sexual orientation and gender identification, which Gross acknowledged. Kaufmann did not respond to a request for comment. His presentation and personnel status were the subject of a report by the Iowa Standard, a conservative website. Students standing outside the school building during the protest said having teachers who share similar experiences can help them navigate their own identities. And they worried what the district’s decision would mean for LGBTQ students, especially those who are not publically out.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A plan to allocate up to $50 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds to retention incentives for nurses and front-line workers has stalled because of top Republican legislators’ concerns about which hospitals would receive the money and how the funds would be spent. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s bipartisan pandemic response advisory task force delayed approving the proposal after a top Republican legislator argued that it should allow hospitals to use the funds to address other pandemic-related issues including mental health. And another Republican leader on the task force on Wednesday proposed excluding hospitals that require all of their employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The task force expects to meet again by early next week to consider a revised version of the plan. It would have to sign off on the details before the funds could be spent. The retention incentives would be capped at $13 an hour and $25,000 a year to comply with federal requirements. Workers would need to have been hired at a hospital as of September to qualify for the retention pay. Senate President Ty Masterson’s proposal to make hospitals with vaccine mandates ineligible for retention incentives failed on a 5-2 vote.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: Officials say they’ve reached a milestone at a chemical weapons depot with the destruction of all projectiles containing mustard agent. The last projectiles containing mustard agent were destroyed Saturday at the Blue Grass Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant in Madison County, the facility said in a statement this week. The U.S. is destroying its chemical weapons stockpile under an international treaty. Mustard and nerve agent are being destroyed at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky, while mustard agent is being destroyed at a Colorado facility. The chemical weapons stockpile at the Kentucky site originally contained 523 tons of chemical agent configured in 155 mm projectiles containing mustard and VX nerve agent, 8-inch projectiles containing GB nerve agent, and M55 rockets containing GB and VX nerve agent. The last of Kentucky’s projectiles containing VX nerve agent were destroyed in May. Now that the mustard agent projectiles are gone, only rockets are left to destroy.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A young giraffe named for a Louisiana football star has died at the Baton Rouge Zoo, officials said Thursday. In a news release, the zoo said the 20-month-old giraffe named Burreaux – after Cincinnati Bengals quarterback and former LSU star Joe Burrow – died early Wednesday. The zoo said Burreaux fell ill Tuesday with a sudden onset of symptoms including a severe cough and overall agitation. “The Zoo’s veterinary staff took immediate measures to help, including swiftly administering medications to stabilize,” the statement said. “As well, he underwent constant staff evaluation to optimize his chances of recovery. The Zoo’s team reached out to numerous zoological veterinarians throughout the nation – none of which had experienced a giraffe with comparable symptoms.” The zoo said an LSU veterinary team has performed a necropsy to determine the possible cause of death. The official results are expected in about 30 days.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Opponents of a proposal to replace the state’s private utility companies with a consumer-owned utility have crafted a referendum that could create a hurdle to issuing bonds to fund the effort. The referendum proposal submitted to the secretary of state’s office Tuesday would require voter approval for any quasi-government entity, including a consumer-owned utility, to take on $1 billion or more in debt. It also requires voters to be presented with the full accounting of the cost. “The principle is straightforward: You should know how much something is going to cost before you commit to borrowing billions of dollars to buy it,” said Willy Ritch from Maine Affordable Energy. Groups that want to buy out Central Maine Power and Versant power and create a consumer utility called Pine Tree Power also are pressing for a referendum after Gov. Janet Mills vetoed their bill. The effort came at a time of frustration with CMP, the state’s largest electric utility, over a botched rollout of a billing system, slow response to storm damage and power outages, and a controversial utility corridor that would serve as a conduit for Canadian hydropower. It’s possible both the proposals could appear on the ballot at the same time next year. Both petitions are pending with the secretary of state’s office.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state is authorizing COVID-19 booster shots for all residents 65 and older who live in congregate care settings, Gov. Larry Hogan said Wednesday. Residents in nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, residential drug treatment centers and developmentally disabled group homes are eligible for boosters, the governor said. “To be clear, these facilities in Maryland will not have to wait to begin offering boosters,” Hogan, a Republican, said at a news conference. “Boosters can now be immediately administered.” While the federal government has yet to say when most people should get booster shots, Hogan said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has approved them for people who are immunocompromised, and a Maryland study indicates many in those facilities are immunocompromised. “So we’re following CDC guidance but broadening the definition,” Hogan said. The governor also announced that the state’s health department is issuing new guidance for pharmacies and other vaccine providers across the state to administer boosters without any need of a prescription or doctor’s order to anyone who considers themselves to be immunocompromised.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A strike by nurses at St. Vincent Hospital hit the six-month mark Wednesday, an anniversary the nurses called “sad” and hospital CEO Carolyn Jackson called “unbelievable,” as the sides traded blame. “The fact that we are still outside this hospital, the hospital we love and have served, some of us for 10, 20, even 40 years is a travesty and serves as an indictment of (hospital owners) Tenet Healthcare and their unyielding desire for profit and power at the expense of the suffering of our patients and our community,” Marlena Pellegrino, a longtime nurse at the hospital and co-chair of the nurses local bargaining unit of the Massachusetts Nurses Association, said in a statement Tuesday. Jackson blamed the nurses union. “It’s truly unbelievable that the MNA has prolonged a strike that was based on false pretenses for six months,” she said in an interview Wednesday. While the strike initially focused primarily on staffing – with nurses alleging unsafe levels and the hospital saying such charges are false – the hospital and nurses are now stymied by a return-to-work agreement. Nurses want a provision that would enable them to return to their old jobs and proposed a $2,000 bonus for striking and nonstriking nurses in recognition of their work during the pandemic.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Ten sexual assault victims sued the University of Michigan on Thursday over a policy that limits the number of people who can offer public comment at meetings of the school’s governing board. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of nine men and a woman who said they were molested by Dr. Robert Anderson during his decades as a campus physician. They said they were denied an opportunity to address the Board of Regents in July, in violation of Michigan’s open meetings law. The university caps the number of speakers and limits the number of people who can talk about a specific topic at five. Regents have been meeting by video conference during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2017, The number of speakers was increased to as many as 17, under certain conditions, from 10. Five people who said they were assaulted by Anderson spoke in July, spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said. Regents have the “authority to establish rules by which members of the public may address a meeting of the board, and the process in place at U-M is consistent with those at other Michigan public universities,” Fitzgerald said. Hundreds of men say they were molested by Anderson, who died in 2008, while he served for decades as a university doctor. The university has acknowledged assaults occurred and is in mediation to settle lawsuits.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said Wednesday that he will no longer prosecute felony charges stemming from most low-level traffic stops, saying it’s time to change a practice that has disproportionately affected generations of minority communities. “Recognizing the role we play as prosecutors in perpetuating racial inequities that often result from these types of stops is an important first step in charting a new, less harmful course,” Choi said in a statement. Choi said his office will not prosecute crimes that are discovered solely because of a low-level traffic stop, such as broken taillight or expired license tabs. He said the new policy does not apply to situations that create a public safety hazard or when a vehicle is stopped because of a dangerous condition. Choi said during a news conference that he used to believe that pretextual stops – in which police use a minor violation as a reason to pull someone over and search for a more serious crime – amounted to good policing. “I no longer believe that,” he said, adding that such stops seldom result in seized contraband. And sometimes the consequences can be fatal, as seen in a series of encounters in recent years in Ramsey County and elsewhere.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is closing its only remaining parking garage field hospital set up to treat coronavirus patients during the delta variant surge, but it is still relying on out-of-state workers to help increase intensive care unit capacity in state hospitals, officials said Wednesday. Health officials also reported the state’s seventh child death from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic and raised alarms about a string of deaths in unvaccinated pregnant women. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said eight pregnant women with the coronavirus have died over the past four weeks. “We do know that COVID is especially problematic and dangerous for pregnant women,” he said. Dobbs said COVID-19 can be deadly for babies in the womb, too. Very preliminary data collected by the Department of Health indicates babies are twice as likely to die in the womb after 20 weeks in coronavirus-infected pregnant women than in women without the virus, he said. “It’s been a real tragedy,” he said. Jim Craig, senior deputy for the Mississippi Department of Health and Director of Health Protection, said the state is seeing a small improvement in hospital bed availability, but ICU capacity continues to be “very scarce ... effectively zero.”\n\nMissouri\n\nNeosho: A teacher said he resigned from Neosho Junior High School after he was told to remove a gay pride flag from his classroom and to sign a letter saying he would not discuss human sexuality or gender with his students. John Wallis, 22, said he hung the flag and a sign that said “everyone is welcome” in his classroom so his students would know they could come to him for help, The Kansas City Star reports. Superintendent Jim Cummins said in a statement that he could not discuss personnel matters. He said Wallis, a theater, world mythology and speech and debate teacher, was hired Aug. 13 and resigned Sept. 1. Wallis said he took down the flag and sign after being told a parent complained. He said he was told more parents complained after he told students they should consider finding another classroom if they were uncomfortable with him or LGBTQ students. He said he was then asked to sign a letter saying he would be fired if he could not teach his curriculum without keeping his “personal agenda on sexuality” out of the classroom. Wallis said he’s filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: An area of the city contaminated with dry cleaning chemicals that emit toxic vapors has been added to the federal government’s Superfund list of cleanup sites. The move makes the Billings PCE site eligible for federal money for permanent cleanup. Solvents from old dry cleanings businesses in Billings created an underground plume that stretches for miles, the Billings Gazette reports. Employees of businesses near one of the dry cleaners have complained of feeling sick because of exposure to PCE, a solvent used to remove stains that’s been linked to liver and some other cancers, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The area was declared a state Superfund site in 1992. Over the next year, workers from the EPA and Montana Department of Environmental Quality will investigate which buildings have been contaminated and outline cleanup options.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police have announced the procession route through the city for a Marine who died in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. The body of 23-year-old Cpl. Daegan Page will be transported starting at 1:30 p.m. Friday from Eppley Airfield in Omaha to Braman Mortuary in southwest Omaha, police said. The procession will begin at Abbott Drive, then head south on 10th Street before traveling over I-480 west and I-80 west. The procession will exit I-80 at L Street and head south on 132nd Street and Millard Avenue South before continuing to Millard Avenue and 144th Street south to the funeral home. Officials have encouraged the public to line the streets of the route to pay their respects to the fallen Marine. Page was one of 13 U.S. service members killed Aug. 26 in the bombing at the Kabul airport, which also killed at least 169 Afghans. A memorial service will be held the morning of Sept. 17 at St. Paul’s Lutheran Church in Millard. Page will be buried in Omaha National Cemetery.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: All 17 counties in the state were expected to be subject to an indoor mask mandate by Friday, health officials said. An emergency directive from Gov. Steve Sisolak requires counties to adopt mask requirements for indoor public spaces and crowded outdoor spaces in line with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if they surpass thresholds for COVID-19 transmission. Rural Eureka County is the state’s only jurisdiction currently not subject to a mask requirement but reported high transmission for the second week in a row, triggering the mandate. The reintroduction of masks and the debut of vaccine requirements in venues like sporting events, conventions and some schools have been met with resistance throughout the state. In the Las Vegas area, the president of the school board said she has received death threats since the district approved a requirement for employees to get COVID-19 shots. Clark County School District Board of Trustees President Linda Cavazos said on Twitter that the threats had “very disturbing images” but that she and her colleagues were continuing to do their jobs, KVVU-TV reports. “We have no time for hate,” she said. The board’s plan includes a process for requesting accommodations for medical conditions or for sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: St. Paul’s School now has an advocate who provides confidential support to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault and a new software system to keep track of campus misconduct reports, according to a compliance monitor hired to oversee the handling of sexual abuse claims at the school. The report from Donald Sullivan was released Thursday through the New Hampshire attorney general’s office, which mandated the position as part of an agreement that subjected the Concord boarding school to as much as five years of government oversight in lieu of criminal charges. The 2018 agreement followed an investigation that found credible evidence of abuse involving 20 former faculty members over several decades. Sullivan started his job Jan. 18. His report was completed in July. Just like other schools, St. Paul’s was affected by COVID-19 protocols that resulted in a smaller campus population and additional quarantine time, Sullivan wrote. “There is no way to tell how much the diminished on-campus time or other COVID-19 protocols affected the number of reportable incidents, but it is reasonable to assume that there was some reduction,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLower Alloways Creek: State and federal officials broke ground Thursday on a facility designed to help the state take a leadership position in the burgeoning offshore wind energy industry on the East Coast. Gov. Phil Murphy and U.S. Labor Secretary Martin Walsh were among those who spoke at the ceremony for the New Jersey Wind Port in Lower Alloways Creek Township, in Salem County. The facility is designed to provide a place to manufacture giant blades and other components for offshore wind energy projects, which are increasingly being proposed – and approved – off the New Jersey coastline. Its cost is estimated at $300 million to $400 million. “What we are doing is not only going to create good jobs, but it is going to be our greatest stand against climate change,” said Murphy, a Democrat. Walsh, the former Boston mayor, noted that President Joe Biden in March set a goal of having 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind energy operating by 2030, enough to power about 10 million homes. Walsh said he hopes similar projects will be approved elsewhere along the nation’s shorelines. “Other states can follow suit, right here, with what is happening in New Jersey,” he said. Major construction is due to begin in December and should be completed by the end of 2023.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A police officer who adopted a child from a pregnant woman he found using heroin in what has been held up as an alternative to abortion is pictured in uniform on an anti-abortion billboard without his permission, his superiors say. Albuquerque Police Officer Ryan Holets appears on a billboard along an interstate that runs through the city, along with the words “My favorite right is life.” The images include two of him holding his daughters, including one daughter he adopted from a couple he found shooting heroin while on patrol in 2017. Holets also helped raise money to find housing for girl’s biological parents while they completed a drug rehabilitation program in 2018. The heroin-using woman was pregnant at the time Holets found her, and she agreed to give up the girl for adoption after the birth. Anti-abortion activists who have held up Holets’ adoption of the girl as an alternative to abortion include the grandmother of his other daughter, Ethel Maharg, who is the executive director of Right to Life New Mexico, the anti-abortion group that used his image on the billboard. The Albuquerque Police Department said Holets declined the group permission to use the image of him in uniform because it would violate policy. “That’s not true,” Maharg told local TV station KRQE in an edited interview.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A former nurse who co-founded and once ran the cultlike NXIVM group – in which prosecutors say some women were brainwashed, branded like animals and coerced into sex – was sentenced Wednesday to 42 months in prison but won’t be locked up until January. Nancy Salzman, the former president and co-founder of NXIVM, must also pay a $150,000 fine, U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis said. She has agreed to forfeit more than $500,000 in cash, several properties and a Steinway grand piano. Salzman must report to prison by Jan. 19, Garaufis said. Her lawyers said she has been caring for her ailing mother. Speaking in Brooklyn federal court, Salzman, 67, said that she fell under NXIVM leader Keith Raniere’s spell when they started working together 20 years ago and that she started rationalizing and overlooking the wrongdoing she saw around her. She offered an apology to everyone she’s hurt. “I don’t know that I can ever forgive myself,” she said. Salzman, known within the Albany-based group as “Prefect,” pleaded guilty in March 2019 to charges of racketeering conspiracy that involved conspiracy to commit identity theft and conspiracy to obstruct justice. She was one of the first in the group’s leadership to plead guilty to criminal charges.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Unvaccinated Buncombe County workers might lose paid COVID-19 quarantine leave under a proposal put forward by local government leaders, with one elected official calling those who have not gotten the shot “irresponsible” and questioning whether they should face deeper benefit cuts. “I think we’ve had a very generous policy around these kinds of issues throughout the pandemics, as well we should. But for staff who make the irresponsible decision to not get vaccinated, I question whether we can continue to provide these kind of policies,” Buncombe Board of Commissioners Chair Brownie Newman said. The board will hold a Sept. 21 public hearing on the potential change to emergency sick leave policy that would affect some members of the approximately 1,800-person county workforce, including sheriff’s staff. The county started the paid quarantine leave before “vaccines came into play,” Buncombe Human Resources Director Sharon Burke told commissioners at a Tuesday meeting. It was given to select employees who could not work from home, such as detention facility officers, patrol deputies, emergency medical technicians and staff administering vaccines.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nKeene: State regulators are investigating a spill that released nearly 48,000 gallons of produced water and more than 1,000 gallons of oil. The state Oil and Gas Division said the incident happened Wednesday at a Slawson Exploration well about 14 miles northwest of Keene. The spill was due an equipment failure or malfunction, officials said. Authorities said Thursday that the water and oil was contained to the site and was recovered and hauled away. Produced water is a byproduct of oil extraction and is typically taken from the well to a disposal site. A state inspector has been to the location and will monitor any additional cleanup that’s required.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Legislature violated the state constitution when they added and approved a last-minute provision that eliminated gun owners’ duty to retreat when facing threats, according to two Democratic lawmakers, the Ohio branch of the NAACP and a grassroots organizing group that filed a lawsuit Thursday. The lawsuit filed in state court in Columbus seeks to repeal the law signed by GOP Gov. Mike DeWine in January. The amendment was improperly added during the final hours of the Legislature’s two-year session in December to what had been a largely bipartisan bill giving nonprofits and other organizations civil immunity when someone with a concealed carry license causes injury or death on their property or at events, the lawsuit said. The “stand-your-ground” provision is unconstitutional, the lawsuit said, because lawmakers voted on it without three days of hearings and violated a law that says legislation should be limited to similar subjects. The NAACP said eliminating the duty to retreat makes it “easier to kill human beings without the perpetrators facing any legal consequences,” a problem that would especially imperil “human beings” who are Black Ohioans.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon will require proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of the race in order to participate in the annual event this year. “This marathon stands for the same resilience of our community we saw (following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing) and we can see now,” Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum Director Kari Watkins said Wednesday. “We believe we can honor those who were killed, those who survived and those changed forever by running this race and honoring so many who have bravely battled this worldwide pandemic.” The race will also be capped at 12,000 runners, half the number for the last live race in 2019, and will start in waves to allow for social distancing. Like last year’s race, which was run virtually because of the pandemic, the 2021 race has been rescheduled for October from the traditional date in April to coincide with the anniversary of the bombing. Also Wednesday, Oklahoma County District Judge Natalie Mai formalized her temporary injunction blocking a state law that bans schools from implementing mask mandates. Mai’s order said exemptions must be granted for medical reasons or personal objections.\n\nOregon\n\nRoseburg: An infant has died from COVID-19 complications, officials said. The News-Review in Roseburg reports the baby less than a year old was diagnosed with COVID-19-related symptoms Aug. 20 and died Monday, according to the Douglas County COVID-19 Recovery Team. The baby was one of 13 deaths listed in the county’s Wednesday report. Children under age 12 are not eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. All but one of the others who died and were mentioned in the Wednesday report were not fully vaccinated, officials said. “The significant number of deaths over the past month have been so incredibly tragic and heartbreaking,” Douglas County Public Health Officer Bob Dannenhoffer said. He said officials have chosen not to provide detailed case information out of respect for patient privacy and because of ethical responsibility to medical records laws. “We can say that some of those who died were perfectly well before they contracted COVID and died,” Dannenhoffer said. The health team thoroughly investigates all deaths and reviews all medical records to make sure everyone meets the requirements for a COVID-19-related death per the Oregon Investigative Guidelines, he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An apparent loophole in the state’s mask mandate for schools is making it easier for some students to go to class without having to cover their faces, even as education regulators sought to make an example of one openly defiant school board. The state health secretary’s order requiring masks to be worn inside K-12 school and child care facilities, which took effect Tuesday, includes an exemption for students who claim it would cause or worsen a medical condition. But there’s no obligation in the masking order for a student to produce a doctor’s note or other supporting medical documentation. Now some school boards that oppose the statewide mandate or have gotten an earful from parents are allowing students to go unmasked with just a parent’s signature. Spot checks by the Associated Press of about 50 school districts Thursday revealed at least a dozen around the state – from huge suburban school systems outside Philadelphia to rural districts in the west – are using exemption forms that don’t require a medical professional’s signature, making it easy for parents to opt out on behalf of their children. And while most districts are complying with the letter of the mask mandate, the Tamaqua Area School Board in Schuylkill County is openly flouting it by keeping face coverings optional.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: The state’s smallest city has a new slogan. Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera announced Thursday that her city will now carry the tagline “Diversity that Inspires.” Rivera said the new slogan honors the city’s distinction as the most ethnically diverse in Rhode Island. It’s intended to replace Central Falls’ unofficial nickname as the “Comeback City,” which it earned after filing for bankruptcy in 2011. It emerged from bankruptcy the following year. The new slogan was selected by an all-volunteer branding committee. Located north of Providence, Central Falls is a city of 20,000 that occupies a little more than 1 square mile.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSummerton: Three new historical markers unveiled in the community commemorate its role in two legal battles that helped end racial segregation in U.S. schools. One of the markers stands outside the home where the Rev. J.A. De Laine asked Levi Pearson to file an NAACP-backed lawsuit demanding equal access to busing for Black schoolchildren. The 1948 case Levi Pearson v. County Board of Education was dismissed because of a technicality. But it set the stage for a second challenge from the Summerton community, WIS-TV reports. In 1950, the NAACP again sued over unequal busing by the Clarendon County school board. Though initially unsuccessful, the case Briggs vs. Elliott became one of five lawsuits appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court that formed the basis of its landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954. A marker was placed outside the St. Mark AME Church in Summerton where the NAACP held fundraisers and public meetings to recruit parents willing to demand equal school transportation. Another marks the home where Harry Briggs Sr. signed a petition against Clarendon County School Board President R.W. Elliott, who refused to supply Black schools with buses. The Summerton Community Action Group said it hopes the markers inspire others to keep pursuing equality.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Sanford Health said Wednesday that it is giving $350 million to a clinical initiative that aims to create a virtual care center to treat people in rural and underserved areas of the Midwest. The center will serve people from across Sanford Health’s network of hospitals, clinics and long-term care facilities. It will also house innovation, education and research initiatives to work on digital healthcare solutions for the future. Sanford bills itself as one of the largest rural health care systems in the country. It has 46 hospitals, 1,500 physicians and more than 200 Good Samaritan Society senior care locations in 26 states and 10 countries. It is based in Sioux Falls and also has major medical centers in Fargo and Bismarck, North Dakota, and Bemidji, Minnesota. The gift comes on the heels of a $300 million donation announced in March that included a significant expansion of graduate medical education and the addition of 18 new sports fields at the Sanford Sports Complex in Sioux Falls.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s forestry office is now taking orders for tree seedlings for planting throughout the state. The Department of Agriculture’s Division of Forestry said it is offering tree and shrub seedlings for reforestation and conservation projects through the East Tennessee Nursery in Delano. It is accepting orders until April 15, while supplies last. Officials said landowners may apply for free seedlings under three different programs. “Trees for Tennessee” seeks to increase pine regeneration on recently harvested land or fallow fields. “Play, Plant, Preserve” works to make sure wood used for making drumsticks and mallets in Tennessee is sustainable. For both programs, the landowner must have a reforestation prescription plan prepared by a professional forester, officials said. The Duck and Elk River Watershed Buffer Initiative seeks to enhance riparian zone or wetland buffers for wildlife with primarily nut-producing hardwoods. The land must be in one of the following counties: Bedford, Coffee, Dickson, Franklin, Giles, Hickman, Humphreys, Lewis, Lincoln, Marshall, Maury, Moore or Williamson.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Texas chapter of the NAACP and a group of students have filed a federal civil rights complaint against the University of Texas for its continued use of school song “The Eyes of Texas,” which has racist elements in its past. The complaint filed Sept. 3 with the U.S. Department of Education alleges that Black students, athletes, band members, faculty and alumni are being subjected to violations of the Civil Rights Act and a hostile campus environment over the “offensive,” “disrespectful” and “aggressive” use of the song. The NAACP and the students want the federal government to withhold funding from the university. Gary Bledsoe, president of the Texas NAACP and a Texas law school graduate, sharply criticized the state Wednesday for requiring the Longhorn Band to play the song at athletic events and expecting athletes to stand and sing it after games. “It’s like slave owners making slaves buck dance for their entertainment,” Bledsoe said. The complaint, which includes statements from several anonymous students, alleges that those who oppose the song on campus are being harassed and that Black students feel “humiliated” whenever it is played or sung. “The Eyes of Texas” was written in 1903 and has a history of performances in minstrel shows with musicians often in blackface.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A nearly 5-month-old California condor has made its maiden flight, becoming Zion National Park’s second wild-hatched nestling to successfully fledge. The California condor is an ancient but critically endangered species, meaning this young bird is now a crucial part of Utah and Arizona’s 103-bird strong population, the park said in a press release. “We are elated to see the continued success of this condor pair in Zion National Park. It is certainly an occasion for celebration in the recovery effort, yet again demonstrating the resiliency of the California condor. What a spectacular site, to see wild-hatched condors soaring amongst the towering rock formations of Zion National Park.” Tim Hauck, condor program manager for the Peregrine Fund, said in the release. Condor #1111 made the flight early, as most condors take their first leap into the air at about 6 months old, though it will continue to be dependent on its parents for the next 12-24 months. Young #1111’s parents, both bred in captivity and released into Vermillion Cliffs National Monument in the late aughts, have been together for four years, and this is their fourth nestling. “Because the adults spend so much time caring for their young, wild condor pairs normally produce one egg every other year,” the release said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A new museum dedicated to the state’s musical heritage is opening in the city. The Tiny Museum of Vermont Music History opens Friday evening during the first day of the annual South End Art Hop. The museum on Howard Street will become a permanent addition to the headquarters of the nonprofit group Big Heavy World, which promotes and preserves Vermont-made music. The museum will feature photographs, posters, instruments and even menus from old venues. The collection “reflects how music is an art form, a catalyst for community-building, and also a contributor to the state’s economy,” James Lockridge, executive director of Big Heavy World, wrote in a news release. “People are – and have been – making music of all kinds across the state, deserving to be heard and celebrated.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Work crews searching for a time capsule they believed was buried inside the pedestal under a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that had towered over the city hit a snag Thursday. Crews were having difficulty finding the capsule’s precise location. Then late Thursday morning, a crane they were using to lift heavy pieces of a cornerstone broke down, stalling work until another crane was brought in a few hours later. State officials were scheduled to remove the 134-year-old time capsule from the cornerstone a day after the large Confederate statue was taken down. But after removing a 2,500-pound capstone and a 500-pound lid, crews were unable to pinpoint the capsule’s precise location. Workers had been using ground-penetrating radar devices to try to find the capsule in a third piece of the cornerstone. Gov. Ralph Northam’s chief of staff, Clark Mercer, said crews would keep looking for it in the cornerstone and adjoining stones. They also decided to dig into the lid of the cornerstone to insert a new time capsule, and state officials ceremonially placed it Thursday. The new capsule contains items reflective of current times, including an expired vial of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, a Black Lives Matter sticker, and a photograph of a Black ballerina with her fist raised near the Lee statue amid racial justice protests last year.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: King County is working to set up a COVID-19 vaccine verification system that could go into effect next month at certain nonessential, high-risk settings. The Seattle Times reports this would make it easier for places like clubs, theaters and stadiums to check the vaccination status of their patrons. King County’s announcement came as nearly all major spectator sports in the Seattle area said they would require vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test for admission to their games. The county said it is gathering feedback from community organizations, labor unions, businesses and cities. “COVID-19 vaccines are safe, highly effective and readily available, and verifying vaccination in certain nonessential, high-risk settings can make those places safer for the public, workers and our community, including children who are not currently eligible for vaccination,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, King County’s health officer. Vaccines are free, and health insurance is not required. Other jurisdictions including Hawaii, New York, San Francisco and British Columbia have begun to implement vaccine verification systems.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Some hospitals in rural parts of the state have reached their critical bed capacities as coronavirus cases and deaths continue to surge statewide, health officials said Wednesday. Health officials are pleading with the public to avoid unnecessary emergency room visits to allow hospitals to focus their resources on treating COVID-19 patients. There were 813 patients hospitalized for the virus statewide Wednesday, just below the record 818 on Jan. 5, when vaccination efforts were starting. There were a record 252 virus patients in hospital ICUs and a record 132 patients on ventilators, according to state data. “Our hospitals are being stressed in ways that they haven’t been stressed before,” Dr. Clay Marsh, the state’s coronavirus expert, said at a news conference. In southern West Virginia, Princeton Community Hospital had no ICU beds available due to an increase in COVID-19-related patients, hospital President and CEO Karen Bowling said Wednesday. In Lewisburg in the southeastern corner of the state, the 122-bed Greenbrier Valley Medical Center also was at capacity, according to a Facebook post from Dr. Bridgett Morrison, Greenbrier County’s health officer.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Sen. Steve Nass has officially asked the Legislature’s Republican leaders to sue the University of Wisconsin System after system officials refused to submit their COVID-19 protocols to his committee for approval. Nass sent a letter to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu demanding they file a lawsuit forcing system leaders to submit their policies to the Legislature’s rules committee. Nass, a Republican and longtime UW critic, co-chairs the committee. UW System President Tommy Thompson has called for UW campuses to hold at least 75% of classes in person this semester. The schools have implemented a range of protocols to meet that goal, including mask and coronavirus testing mandates. Nass had been threatening to sue for weeks unless system leaders hand over the policies to the rules committee for approval. Thompson has maintained the system has the legal authority to manage itself and doesn’t need legislators’ approval to adopt policies to protect students and faculty. He has said he would win any lawsuit. The squabble has caused a rift between Republicans who vehemently oppose any mandates to mitigate COVID-19 and those who still see Thompson, who served four terms as governor, as a GOP icon.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: For a second year in a row, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch will not visit the University of Wyoming due to the coronavirus pandemic. Gorsuch had been scheduled to visit the law school and campus Sept. 16, giving a talk alongside Wyoming Supreme Court Justice Lynne Boomgaarden in the Buchanan Center for the Performing Arts concert hall. The virus postponed a 2020 visit planned in recognition of the law school’s 100th anniversary. Rising rates of COVID-19 generally, not cases at the university specifically, were the reason for cancellation, university spokesman Chad Baldwin said Tuesday. There were no plans to reschedule, university officials said in a statement.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/09/uk/queen-elizabeth-ii-platinum-jubilee-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee: Palace reveals how Queen's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThis year is set to be a landmark one for Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIt is her Platinum Jubilee – marking 70 years since the Queen first took the throne in 1952 and making her both the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-serving female head of state in history.\n\nTo celebrate the unprecedented anniversary, a number of events will take place throughout the UK over the year – culminating in a four-day national bank holiday weekend from Thursday June 2 until Sunday June 5, known as the Jubilee Weekend.\n\nThe holiday itself will include a variety of public events and community activities, as well as “national moments of reflection” on the Queen’s 70 years of service.\n\nThe upcoming celebrations will be the Queen’s first jubilee without her husband, Prince Philip, who died in 2021.\n\nThe monarch’s private estates – including Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle – will also join in with Jubilee themed events.\n\nOne of the initiatives due to take place as part of the celebrations is known as the “Platinum Pudding” celebration – a nationwide baking competition seeking out a new dessert dedicated to the Queen. UK residents aged 8 and over will be invited to create a recipe and the finalists will be judged by a panel including famed baker Mary Berry, Monica Galetti and the Buckingham Palace head chef Mark Flanagan.\n\nThe winning recipe will then be made available to the public ahead of the Jubilee Weekend.\n\nOther events planned to mark the occasion include the “BBC Platinum Party at the Palace” – a live concert which promises to bring together some of the world’s biggest entertainment stars to celebrate significant moments from the Queen’s reign.\n\nOn Thursday June 2, more than 1,500 towns, villages and cities throughout the UK and its overseas territories will light a beacon to mark the Jubilee. The capitals of Commonwealth countries will also light beacons – even as sentiment towards the British monarch in the Commonwealth now differs throughout different nations.\n\nThe Jubilee Weekend celebrations will also see “Big Jubilee Lunches” take place across Britain, including flagship events in London and at Cornwall’s Eden Project – where the idea for the lunches originated.\n\nA Platinum Jubilee Pageant will also be held, in which artistic performers, dancers, musicians, military personnel, key workers and volunteers will unite to tell the story of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in a festival of creativity.

Kay Ivey said South Korean auto parts manufacturer Shinhwa Group is investing $42 million in a facility and will create 95 jobs in Auburn, the company’s first manufacturing facility in the United States. Construction is already underway. Phase 1 of the project is expected to be finished by the summer. Shinhwa will initially make driveshafts for vehicles built by Hyundai Motor Manufacturing’s plant in Montgomery, as well as for Kia Motor Manufacturing’s plant, just across the state line in West Point, Georgia. Alabama Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said the company is a “welcome addition” to the state’s network of “high-caliber auto suppliers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Northern fur seals have declined at the world’s largest rookery in Alaska’s Pribilof Islands, but they’re thriving at an unlikely location. Numbers of fur seals continue to grow on Bogoslof Island, a tiny landmass at the tip of an active undersea volcano in the Aleutian Islands. The volcano two years ago spewed ash into the path of jetliners. Hot mud, steam and sulfurous gases continue to spit up from vents on the island. Fur seals give birth and raise pups along the beach of the island that’s only about one-third the size of New York City’s Central Park. Tom Gelatt of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said biologists in 2015 estimated there were 28,000 pups on the island. He said the 2019 estimate likely will be more than 36,000 pups.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Game and Fish Department is investigating the poaching of a bull elk north of Heber in late August and is asking for the public’s help finding whoever killed the animal. The agency said Tuesday the poacher left the bull elk’s meat to waste west of Forest Road 153 near Point and Javelina water catchments. Agency officials said in a press release they believe someone has information about the case because the poaching incident occurred during a time when many hunters were scouting the area for upcoming hunts. Other recreationists are also believed to have been in the area at the time of the crime, the agency said. Hunting elk and other types of game in Arizona is regulated by the department. Hunters are required to draw permits, which are limited in number and allow them to hunt a limited number of game. Hunting can take place only in designated areas during designated periods. Most elk hunting takes place during the fall season in Arizona, although there are a few locations designated during other times of the year, according to the Game and Fish website. Anyone with information about the poaching incident should call the department’s Operation Game Thief hotline at 800-352-0700 or visit www.azgfd.gov and refer to case #19-003199. Callers can remain anonymous upon request and might be eligible for a reward of up to $1,500 upon an arrest. The Arizona Elk Society and Arizona Deer Association are each offering an additional $2,500 reward upon the arrest and conviction of the poachers, according to a press release from the department.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: The Saracen Casino Annex, the largest tourism investment project in Arkansas, opened Tuesday morning. The annex is part of the $350 million Saracen Casino Resort project owned and operated by the Oklahoma-based Quapaw Nation. The casino resort is expected to open next June. About 10,000 guests have visited the 300-slot-machine annex since Friday’s surprise “soft opening.” Quapaw Nation officials said they plan to employ 1,100 people permanently at the Saracen Casino Resort. More than 200 are employed at the annex and a new nearby convenience store and gas station. Most hires came from Pine Bluff. The project is expected to feature 2,000 slot machines and 50 gambling tables, along with a 300-room hotel with a fire safety and an emergency services facility.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Residents had a chance to see a mini-air show as the Royal Air Force Red Arrows aerobatic team tours California. The team flew past the famed Hollywood sign Wednesday afternoon and headed south to the Port of Long Beach to fly over the retired British ocean liner Queen Mary, which is now a tourist attraction and hotel. On Tuesday, the Red Arrows’ jets flew over San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate bridge. This weekend, they will join the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds and other performers at the Great Pacific Airshow over the surf at Huntington Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A falcon that has served as the mascot for the U.S. Air Force Academy for the past 23 years has died. KCNC-TV reported the passing of the falcon named Aurora was announced by the academy on Wednesday. The academy said in a statement that the falcon was the longest-serving live mascot in the school’s 65-year history. Aurora was reported to have recovered after suffering injuries to its wings in November 2018 during a prank abduction before the annual football game against the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. The Air Force Academy uses several falcons during home games and Aurora attended most road games to greet fans. The academy described her as a “feisty, spirited bird who commanded respect.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nGroton: The Pentagon said the USS Oregon, the Navy’s newest attack submarine, will be christened Saturday at General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton. U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, said he will attend as the keynote speaker. He said the submarine will be christened with water from Crater Lake and wine from Oregon. Oregon, a Virginia-class submarine, is the third U.S. Navy ship to honor the state. Virginia-class submarines are built to conduct anti-submarine warfare; anti-surface ship warfare; strike warfare; special operation forces support; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; irregular warfare; and mine warfare missions. The Pentagon said they have stealth, endurance, mobility and firepower.\n\nDelaware\n\nFenwick Island:State environmental officials might soon lease public parkland to an offshore wind energy company in exchange for millions of dollars in new amenities at Delaware’s southernmost beach. The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has signed an initial memorandum of understanding with Ørsted, an offshore wind company based in Denmark, to discuss leasing up to 1.5 acres at Fenwick Island State Park. Ørsted would use park property to build an interconnection facility that will connect power generated by the yet-to-be-built Skipjack Wind Farm to the electrical grid. In exchange for leasing the public land, the company would fund improvements at the park, with the state now suggesting more than a dozen projects worth upward of $18 million. Those projects could include a two-level parking garage, a pedestrian overpass that allows foot traffic to cross Coastal Highway from the ocean side to the bayside, connections for a trail or sidewalk system, two additional bathrooms, an amphitheater and a new local Chamber of Commerce building that would house the park’s visitors center, a small nature center and more.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A museum dedicated to journalism and the First Amendment is set to close its doors near the National Mall by the end of the year. WTOP-FM reported the Newseum announced its impending closure Tuesday, citing yearslong financial issues. A company statement said that despite more than 11 years of service and nearly 10 million visitors, continued operations have proved to be unsustainable. The statement said the museum’s founder and primary funder, the Freedom Forum, remains committed to its mission to champion the five freedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment. It said efforts to increase public awareness about the importance of a free press are needed now more than ever. Visitors are welcome through Dec. 31. Tickets purchased online include a 15% discount, with prices now starting at about $12.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan said Wednesday that he will be the majority investor in the nation’s only 24-hour news network aimed at African American viewers, giving the network a deep pocket as it launches next month. The network has been in the works for years and an announcement about its launch was made earlier this year. But Khan’s backing gives it a substantial boost. He declined to say how much he would invest initially but said it would be enough to keep the network running for a long time. Khan is worth an estimated $8 billion and made his fortune in the auto equipment industry. As well as the Jaguars, he owns Fulham Football Club of the English Football League, Four Seasons Hotel Toronto and All Elite Wrestling. Former Republican U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts, who was a star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma in the 1980s, will be chairman of the new network. It will be available via cable and satellite viewers in 33 million households. The network has agreements with Charter Communications, Comcast and DISH and will be carried in major African American markets such as New York, Atlanta, New Orleans, Chicago and Los Angeles. The network is to begin broadcasting in November and will be based in Tallahassee, Florida’s capital, with bureaus across the country, Watts said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAdel: A hospital and nursing home in south Georgia has moved into a new $40 million facility. The Adel hospital began operating from its new home Tuesday. What had previously been Cook Medical Center is now called Southwell Medical. The 20-bed hospital, 95-bed nursing home and physicians’ offices are operated by Tift Regional Health System. Tift Regional Health System President Christopher Dorman told WALB-TV that the new complex just off Interstate 75 was renamed to help attract patients from beyond Cook County. The new hospital doesn’t have an emergency room but does have a walk-in clinic. The health system borrowed about 70% of construction costs through a U.S. Department of Agriculture rural development loan. Cook County and Adel government agencies provided the remainder. The old hospital’s new use remains undetermined.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A post-mortem examination of two pygmy killer whales that were found stranded on a Maui beach suggested they were fighting an infection. The Maui News reported Wednesday that the adult males had inflamed lymph nodes when they stranded themselves at Sugar Beach last month. The infection was also found in pygmy killer whales that stranded themselves at the same beach in August. An official from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the whales were afflicted elsewhere and there is no indication of an environmental toxin at Sugar Beach. The animals were euthanized after tests indicated little chance for survival at sea. Researchers said unusual food items, including excess plant material found in the animals, indicate they were not feeding normally.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge said she agrees that fulfilling public records requests can put a big burden on governmental resources, but she expressed skepticism about the number of completely redacted pages provided to four Boise-area journalists by Ada County officials this year. Fourth District Judge Deborah Bail made the comments during a hearing on a lawsuit between the Idaho Press Club and Ada County Commissioners on Wednesday afternoon. In the lawsuit the Idaho Press Club and the four journalists contend county officials repeatedly violated the state’s Public Records Act by wrongly denying access to some documents, over-redacting others and otherwise mishandling public information requests. In court Wednesday, Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney James Dickinson said the judge has all the evidence she needs in the form of the unredacted documents. Dickinson said some of the redacted documents require context to understand why they should be kept from release but said he can’t discuss it in open court lest he reveal private protected information.\n\nIllinois\n\nFairview Heights: Planned Parenthood has quietly been building a new abortion clinic in Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, as women concerned about the uncertain future of Missouri’s sole abortion clinic flock across the state line. The 18,000-square-foot in Fairview Heights, 12 miles east of St. Louis, will provide abortion services, as well as family planning, when it opens in mid-October, Planned Parenthood officials said at a news conference Wednesday. Planned Parenthood has been fighting Missouri’s health department for months to try and keep open its St. Louis clinic. The state has refused to renew its license to perform abortions, citing concerns that include “failed abortions” that required additional surgeries. Missouri’s Administrative Hearing Commission is deciding the fate of the St. Louis clinic. During an annual inspection of the St. Louis clinic in March, Missouri health investigators cited numerous concerns, including reports of failed abortions. Planned Parenthood said it has already addressed those concerns and defended its clinic. It claims the state is using the licensing process as an excuse to stop abortions.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: More than 2,200 sets of preserved fetal remains found in the Illinois garage of a late Indiana abortion doctor have been returned to Indiana. Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill said Thursday that the fetal remains found last month at Dr. Ulrich Klopfer’s Will County, Illinois, home were transferred Wednesday to the St. Joseph County coroner’s office for “safekeeping.” Hill said at a news conference in South Bend that investigators determined the remains came from abortions performed in Indiana in 2000, 2001 and 2002. Authorities are still investigating where the abortions occurred. Klopfer performed abortions at clinics in Fort Wayne, South Bend and Gary. Relatives cleaning out Klopfer’s garage after his Sept. 3 death found the remains. Hill said they will be “given the decency of a burial that they deserve.”\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: The Iowa Department of Natural Resources said it plans to collect as many deer samples in northeastern Iowa as it can this hunting season to test for chronic wasting disease after the first case in Dubuque County was confirmed in January, the Telegraph Herald reported Thursday. Chris Ensminger, the wildlife research section supervisor for the department, said officials want to collect at least 250 samples from an area in which the diseased deer was killed and at least 250 samples from elsewhere in Dubuque County. Samples also will be collected from surrounding eastern Iowa counties. The disease attacks the brains of deer and elk and is always fatal. No human cases have been recorded, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to not eat meat from infected animals. The disease has become increasingly prevalent in parts of the Midwest, including Wisconsin and Minnesota. Nearly 400 of the 1,060 deer that tested positive for the disease in Wisconsin from April 2018 to the end of March were in Iowa County in southwest Wisconsin. Other cases came from surrounding Crawford, Grant and Lafayette counties.\n\nKansas\n\nLinwood: A plan to build a village of foster care homes in northeast Kansas has gotten the OK, although the project has been scaled down. The Kansas City Star reported that the nonprofit Joy Meadows initially sought to create a development with up to 10 homes that could house large sibling sets on a 23-acre property in the Linwood area. Instead, the Leavenworth County Commission voted Wednesday to limit the first phase of development to four total homes, including one that is located there. The nonprofit would be allowed to add three more in a future phase, upon review from the county. Foster care advocates and the Kansas Department for Children and Families voiced support for the residential development. But the project faced opposition from neighbors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLudlow:Fire and police units are at the scene of a barge accident that set several boats adrift or sinking in the Ohio River. The barge hit the Ludlow Bromley Yacht Club on Wednesday morning hard enough to partially submerge the marina’s bar and grill. Steve Hensley, Kenton County’s Director of Homeland Security and Management, told news outlets six boats were knocked loose. Hensley said there was one person on the barge and one person on one of the boats, but neither was injured. Officials said the restaurant and patio of the yacht club were heavily damaged with some of it attached to the barge that struck it. Ludlow Police Chief Scott Smith said the Coast Guard is investigating and the barge operator was being questioned.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGonzales: The federal government has bought out an entire flood-prone neighborhood in Louisiana, prompting all its residents to move to higher ground. News outlets reported the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Emergency Watershed Protection Program financed the buyouts on along Silverleaf Street in Gonzales, which was carved out of a wetland in the 1980s and has frequently flooded since. Chief city engineer Jackie Baumann said the federal agency is buying the homes at preflood market value, and Restore Louisiana is offering to make up shortfalls in the purchasing price for some residents, as long as their next home isn’t in a flood zone. The 2017 offer required all 41 residents to agree to the deal, and the last resident agreed last month, enabling the government to restore the wetland.\n\nMaine\n\nLubec: American fishermen are expected to get a little more fishing quota under terms of an agreement with Canada. The countries are home to fisheries for economically important species that cross international boundaries, such as cod and haddock. They reach an agreement every year about how to divide catch on eastern Georges Bank, a crucial fishing area off New England and Canada. The New England Fishery Management Council said the U.S is scheduled to get 29% of the 1.4 million-pound total allowable catch of cod on eastern Georges Bank in 2020. It’s also set for 54% of the 66 million-pound total allowable catch of haddock in the area. The figures are subject to federal approval. They represent a 2.6 million-pound bump for haddock and about the same figure for cod compared to 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A 1,600-pound bull escaped from a truck into the streets of Baltimore for several hours. The Baltimore Sun reported that it took three tranquilizer shots and a crew of zoo officials to recapture the animal on Wednesday. The purebred Angus breeding bull broke out of a truck while it was stopped at a red light. A crowd gathered and watched as the animal was corralled. Baltimore Police spokeswoman Det. Nicole Monroe told the newspaper that the “owner of the bull said he doesn’t have the best disposition.” The bull was from Hedgeapple Farm in Buckeystown. Executive director Scott Barao said the animal was very expensive and thanked the police for not shooting it. He said the bull is “extremely valuable to us and we’re just glad to have him alive.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: State wildlife officials said a moose that was struck by two cars and had a broken leg has been euthanized. Marion Larson, a spokeswoman for the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, told The Boston Globe that Worcester police were called about a bull moose that was hit by a car Monday morning and Monday night. The moose was spotted in a pond Tuesday morning, and the state Environmental Police responded to the scene. Several boats were deployed so the moose did not approach Interstate 290, and to maneuver the animal into a suitable darting area. Larson said the 3 ½-year-old moose would not have survived its injuries. Another moose spotted in a Worcester cemetery Monday was tranquilized and freed at a state park.\n\nMichigan\n\nBattle Creek:A fourth Michigan resident has died from a rare mosquito-borne virus that has been recorded across the southern half of the state. WWMT-TV reported that 79-year-old Stan Zalner of Battle Creek died Wednesday after contracting eastern equine encephalitis. Ronna Bagent told the television station that her father was hospitalized in September with severe flu-like symptoms before doctors were able to confirm the illness through blood tests. Nine cases have been confirmed in six southern or southwestern Michigan counties. More than 30 animals – including 18 horses – in more than a dozen counties also have died from the disease. State health officials say low-flying aircraft were expected to spray pesticides Wednesday in Calhoun and 10 other counties. The pesticides kill adult mosquitoes on contact.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A federal judge has rejected challenges by several environmental groups to a land swap needed for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen dismissed the four lawsuits late Monday, ruling that the groups lacked the necessary legal standing to block the land exchange between PolyMet and the federal government. She said the groups couldn’t establish that they had been harmed. PolyMet traded 6,650 acres of federal land in the Superior National Forest at the mine site near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes for a similar amount of private land last year. Several environmental groups sued to challenge various aspects of the deal, saying it undervalued the federal land and violated other laws, including the Endangered Species Act. PolyMet disputed those claims and persuaded the judge to dismiss the lawsuits. Ericksen dismissed the lawsuits without prejudice, meaning the groups could refile them at some later point. They could also appeal to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg:At least 22 soldiers training at Champ Shelby were injured during a night parachuting exercise. U.S. Army spokesman John Pennell told WDAM-TV that at least 15 people were treated by medics and another seven were hospitalized. Staff Sgt. John Healy said none of the injuries is considered to be life-threatening. Camp Shelby Cmdr. Col. Bobby Ginn said the troopers belong to the 4th Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division stationed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. Pennell said about 89 paratroopers were on the plane for the Wednesday night exercise. Ginn said the soldiers jumped from a C-130 aircraft and were blown off-course from their intended landing zone and into a group of pine trees. Several were entangled in the trees and had to be rescued. Healy says about 650 soldiers were involved in the exercise. About 3,000 troops from the Alaska base are at monthlong training at Camp Shelby called “Operation Arctic Anvil.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A compromise has been reached after Kansas City-area defense attorneys complained that their underwire bras were setting off jail metal detectors, forcing them to remove their lingerie for screening if they wanted to meet with their clients face-to-face. KCUR reported that the solution reached last month allows attorneys who set off metal detectors at the Jackson County Jail to be wanded or patted down. Attorneys protested after the jail rolled out a new security protocol in May. Jail officials initially responded by offering to allow attorneys to have noncontact visits, in which they talked to their clients by phones separated by glass, without clearing metal detectors first. But attorneys continued to push for change. Attorney Tracy Spradlin said she is thankful the issue was resolved without a lawsuit.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana has announced plans to build a larger veterans affairs clinic in Missoula. The Missoulian reported that Tester, Democrat, announced Tuesday a location was chosen for a new community-based outpatient clinic. Officials said the clinic will be three times larger than the current clinic, which serves more than 6,000 veterans. It will have expanded primary care, mental health and specialty services. Tester said the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act that passed in 2017 set aside about $7 million in federal funding for the project. The clinic is expected to open in 2022. The current clinic will continue to serve patients until the new clinic opens.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A bobcat that wandered into a Lincoln building has been captured and released back into the wild. Staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs campus in south Lincoln called the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission on Tuesday to report the animal had been spotted inside one of its buildings. Commission staffers set a cage trap and baited it with raw fish. The estimated 20-pound bobcat bit on the bait and was caught. It was freed outside of town Wednesday. Bobcats are common in Nebraska and can be found at the edge of Lincoln, sometimes coming inside to hunt. Sam Wilson with the commission said bobcats are common but rarely seen.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A firefighter suffered burns and a woman was hospitalized after she jumped from a second-floor window at a motel that was on fire just east of downtown Reno. Police closed part of East Fourth Street for about three hours Tuesday afternoon before firefighters knocked down the blaze at the Lucky Motel. Fire officials told KRNV-TV the blaze destroyed two units at the weekly motel. One firefighter was being treated for burns to his leg. The woman was transported to a local hospital after she jumped from the window onto a car. She also suffered smoke inhalation. There was no immediate information available on their conditions Wednesday. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. The Reno Fire Department chaplain and motel owner were working to relocate displaced residents to a nearby motel.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBedford: A young moose that got stuck in a swimming pool has been successfully coaxed out. New Hampshire Fish and Game Department biologists and conservation officers were called to a Bedford home Tuesday to help remove the young bull. He was in the water for several hours. Officers said he was unable to get himself out of the pool, so they put in a set of wooden steps. The department posted a video of the moose looking back and forth as the team held a rope and coaxed him out. He scampered away. Col. Kevin Jordan suggested it had to do with it being moose breeding season. He told television station WMUR that “the younger moose will wander long distances struggling to find a female.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nForked River: The state has created an oversight panel to evaluate the process of dismantling the former Oyster Creek nuclear plant. Gov. Phil Murphy said it will ensure the “proper protocols” are in place throughout the process. Oyster Creek is being decommissioned after it was permanently shuttered in September 2018. Its spent fuel is also being put into safe storage. The panel’s formation was announced Wednesday. It plans to meet at least twice a year and will allow the public to share their concerns. Its members include the state’s Environmental Protection Commissioner, state police superintendent, homeland security director and the president of the Board of Public Utilities. Oyster Creek is located about 60 miles east of Philadelphia. It produced enough electricity each year to supply about 600,000 typical homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons will lift off from the New Mexico desert over nine days as part of one of the world’s largest festivals dedicated to the sport of ballooning. In its 48th year, the annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is scheduled to kick off Saturday with a mass ascension. More than 580 balloons are registered, 17 countries are represented and tens of thousands of spectators from around the world are expected to turn out for the opening weekend. Albuquerque has played host to the fiesta since its inception in 1972. Troy Bradley, one of the ballooning world’s most prolific record-setters, said, “There’s just nothing like it in the world, to see that much color going into the sky.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Homeowners hurt by record flooding along Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River have until the end of this month to seek state funding. People living in Cayuga, Jefferson, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Oswego, St. Lawrence and Wayne counties can apply for up to $50,000 to offset damages sustained this year to their primary residences. The window for applications opened Tuesday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office said $20 million is available through the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Flood Relief and Recovery Program.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville:State health officials said 116 people have been diagnosed with Legionnaire’s disease since an outbreak was reported in September. The Asheville Citizen Times reported the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services released the figures Wednesday, adding that there was one death. The department also said 65% of those diagnosed had to be hospitalized. DHHS expected the number of confirmed cases to continue to climb as diagnostic tests are processed. Health officials aren’t sure if the illness originated from last month’s Mountain State Fair. Legionnaires’ disease is bacterial pneumonia that develops when someone breathes in mist or water that contains the bacteria into their lungs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A pipeline spill has released produced water into a small creek and a stock pond in western North Dakota. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality was notified of the spill, which happened Tuesday in Dunn County. The pipeline is part of a gathering system operated by Marathon Oil. The spill happened about 1.5 miles northeast of Manning. Authorities don’t know what caused the leak. An estimated 21,000 gallons of produced water were released, impacting the creek and stock pond within pastureland. The creek discharges into the Knife River, but no impacts have been detected in the river. Produced water is a by-product of oil and gas development. State inspectors are checking the site and will continue to monitor the investigation and remediation.\n\nOhio\n\nOxford: An investigation into alleged hazing by a fraternity at Miami University has led to misdemeanor charges of hazing and assault against more than a dozen fraternity members. A student reported in March that members of the Delta Tau Delta chapter at the university in Oxford hazed him during initiation. The student said he was beaten with a spiked paddle, kicked and forced to drink lots of alcohol. The Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News reported Oxford police confirmed that a Butler County grand jury’s recent indictments of the 18 men stemmed from an investigation into hazing. Miami suspended the fraternity in August for 10 to 15 years after its investigation determined violations of the school’s Code of Student Conduct. Delta Tau Delta’s national headquarters revoked the chapter’s charter in June.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Some of the 44 death row inmates housed at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester will soon be moved from the prison’s maximum-security H-Unit to another unit to give them more benefits and access to the outdoors, the state’s new prisons boss said. In a letter released by the agency on Thursday, the Department of Corrections’ Interim Executive Director Scott Crow told officials with the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma that the agency plans to move “qualifying inmates” to its less restrictive A-Unit by the end of October. The ACLU had threatened legal action over what it said are potential constitutional violations of the rights of death row inmates, mostly by confining them to their cells for 23 hours per day. Crow said the agency also plans to begin “contact” visitation for some of the moved death row inmates, who are allowed only noncontact visits behind Plexiglas and over a telephone.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: The City Council has agreed to discuss whether to impose a ban on feeding deer and elk that wander city streets. KTVZ-TV reported councilmember Chris Piper, who with Bruce Abernethy proposed considering such a ban Wednesday, said the plans were brought to him and other councilmembers by neighborhood associations. Piper said dozens of collisions involving vehicles and deer were reported in the city last year. Piper said cities including Sunriver and Sisters have seen positive results from similar wildlife feeding regulations. There is a similar ban on feeding geese in Bend that can result in a $372 fine. Although that ban is isolated to Mirror Pond, the potential deer and elk feeding ban would be citywide.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Another alligator has turned up in Pittsburgh, the seventh this year. George DeSavage told WTAE-TV he and his girlfriend spotted it along the Allegheny River as the sun was setting on Tuesday. He said he grabbed it and it “went kind of limp and calm.” He said it seemed like it was handled by somebody. Police took it to Humane Animal Rescue, which named the gator Gus. The shelter shared photos on its Facebook page. The shelter believes the reptile was a pet. It’s not illegal to own an alligator in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s high school students scored significantly lower on the SAT than the national averages. The Providence Journal reported Thursday that the state’s Class of 2019 scored an average of 483 points on the English portion of the standardized college entrance exam; the national average was 531. On the math section of the test, Rhode Islanders scored an average of 474; the national average was 528. The numbers also showed a gap between white students and students of color, with white students scoring about 70 points higher in English and math. The Rhode Island Department of Education said SAT scores were flat statewide. State Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green called on district leaders to develop action plans to increase test participation and overall scores.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: A man who set a fire at a Walmart to divert attention as he stole a case of beer has been sentenced to the maximum of 15 years in prison. Solicitor David Stumbo said 34-year-old Russell Geddings pleaded guilty Tuesday to third-degree arson – the same day his trial was set to start. Stumbo said Geddings set a clothes rack on fire at a Greenwood Walmart on Dec. 5 then stole the beer in the chaos. Stumbo said in a statement no one was injured, but $1.2 million worth of damage was done to the store and merchandise. Stumbo said Geddings deserved the maximum sentence for putting so many people at risk to steal beer. Geddings’ attorneys did not answer an email from a reporter seeking comment.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A Delta commercial airplane made an emergency landing in Sioux Falls on Thursday morning for a passenger who had a medical emergency, officials said. The Delta flight, scheduled around 7:30 a.m. from Chicago to Seattle, was diverted when a 63-year-old male passenger started to experience emergency medical symptoms, said Dan Letellier, executive director for the Sioux Falls Regional Airport. The flight was over Pierre when its pilots diverted to Sioux Falls, he said. The airplane landed around 8:30 a.m. and the passenger was transported to a local hospital, Letellier said. The passenger was alert and conscious, but Letellier didn’t comment any further on the man’s condition. “Based on our location in the country, there are thousands of flights that go overhead each year,” Letellier said. “We get at least one or two medical diversions a month. It’s a matter of where we fit in the country.”\n\nTennessee\n\nCollierville:Dozens gathered Tuesday to welcome home fallen soldier Maj. Trevor Joseph. The 33-year-old died Sept. 26 in an aviation accident at Fort Polk, Louisiana. He is survived by his wife, Erin. “Trevor was the greatest individual who was truly just so humble,” family members said in a text. “He would be so embarrassed by all this heroic attention, but this is exactly what he deserves.” Funeral arrangements are pending. Joseph, a soldier from the Joint Readiness Training Center and Fort Polk’s 1st Battalion, 5th Aviation Regiment, was killed during a JRTC rotation in a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter within the training area, according to a Facebook post from JRTC and Fort Polk. Three other 1st Battalion, 5th Aviation Regiment soldiers were injured. The cause of the accident is under investigation.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A truck driver from California was killed Wednesday when his semi crashed into an overpass support column on Interstate 10 in downtown El Paso. The fatal crash closed westbound lanes for several hours Wednesday morning. Harjot Singh Goraya, 32, of Riverside, California, was driving when he veered off the road and crashed into a support column shortly before 1 a.m. by the Mesa Street exit ramp. Traffic Police said that the road was wet from an earlier rainstorm but that the Special Traffic Investigations Unit has yet to determine how the driver lost control. The crash closed all westbound lanes early Wednesday. Drivers were urged to find alternative routes into downtown or West El Paso, including Paisano Drive, Montana Avenue and Trans Mountain Road. Traffic was directed off the highway at the downtown exit, police said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Department of Health has confirmed the state’s first human death from West Nile virus this yer. Authorities said Saturday that a central Utah resident at least 65 years old died from the disease carried by mosquitoes sometime between Sept. 21 and Sept. 28. Information about the victim including name and gender have not been released. Utah health officials have confirmed 19 human cases West Nile virus this year. The total is higher than last year, when 11 residents contracted the virus and one person died. State health officials have said a wet spring this year created more standing water habitats for mosquitoes, attracting species that can transmit West Nile virus to Utah. Symptoms include headaches, joint pains and a high fever.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: Residents of a town along the route of the Appalachian Trail have taken the first steps toward filing an application to become a designated Appalachian Trail Community. Local and county officials in Bennington met with state counterparts and community organizers recently to discuss plans to apply for the designation. Officials said the label as an Appalachian Trail Community will bring greater publicity and boost local business. The Appalachian Trail stretches about 2,200 miles, through 14 states and 40 communities. More than 100 miles of the trail runs through Vermont and a portion of it is just east of Bennington. The Bennington Banner reported that in addition to publicity, the move could bring stakeholders together to improve the trail system locally for hikers.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A popular nature center will soon be closing temporarily for a $2.3 million renovation. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Maymont’s Robins Nature & Visitor Center will close Nov. 1 and open in March. The center houses fish, turtles, otters and other animals found within the James River and Chesapeake Bay. It attracts roughly 45,000 people each year. The animals will have upgraded habitats with lighting and heating systems and will be more visible to guests when the center reopens.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A late cold snap last winter has cut the production of Washington apricots in half. The Washington State Fruit Commission said the state usually produces 5,000 tons of apricots a year. But The Spokesman-Review reported that the yield this year is only about 2,500 tons. Washington produces about 20% of the nation’s apricots. The commission said frost in February, when apricot trees had bloomed, hurt production. Apricots produced in Washington are shipped across the country.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal officials said drought conditions in West Virginia are worsening as unusually high heat continues to beat down on the region. The U.S. Drought Monitor map released Thursday showed large swaths of southern West Virginia in a severe drought, a designation that includes the likely loss of crops and water shortages. The map also classified the entire northern part of the state as abnormally dry. Officials said nearly 50% of the state’s population is now in a drought. The National Weather Service marked last month as one of warmest and driest Septembers on record in multiple West Virginia cities. Less than 1 inch of rain was recorded in the month. Temperatures measured on Oct. 1 also surpassed record highs for the month in five cities.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said during a stop in Wisconsin that he doesn’t know if the family dairy farm can survive as the industry moves toward a factory farm model. Perdue told reporters Tuesday following an appearance at the World Dairy Expo that it’s getting harder for farmers to get by on milking smaller herds. Perdue’s visit comes as Wisconsin dairy farmers are wrestling with a host of problems, including declining milk prices, rising suicide rates, the transition to larger farms with hundreds or thousands of animals and international trade wars. Wisconsin, which touts itself as America’s Dairyland on its license plates, has lost 551 dairy farms in 2019 after losing 638 in 2018 and 465 in 2017, according to data from the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. The Legislature’s finance committee voted unanimously last month to spend an additional $200,000 to help struggling farmers deal with depression and mental health problems.\n\nWyoming", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/27/scrambled-eggs-pa-road-stolen-golden-coffin-chocolate-university-news-around-states/40208517/", "title": "Scrambled eggs on Pa. road, stolen golden coffin, Chocolate ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Forestry Commission issued a statewide fire alert Wednesday because of extremely dry weather. It was an upgrade from a previously issued fire danger advisory. The extremely dry weather means any fire can quickly spread out of control. The commission said over the last week firefighters responded to 182 wildfires across the state, burning about 2,608 acres. Those included a 470-acre fire in Talladega County and a 39-acre fire in DeKalb County. The commission said permits for outdoor burning will be restricted and issued on an individual basis at the discretion of the state forester. Anyone who burns a field, grassland or woodland without a permit could face prosecution.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Two pilots have been fined $3,000 apiece for flying airplanes low over walruses on the shore near Point Lay two years ago. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Andrea Medeiros said names of the pilots who disturbed walruses can’t be released, but didn’t explain why. Residents of Point Lay in September 2017 saw two airplanes flying near resting walruses. Cameras that monitor the marine mammals captured photos of the airplanes and walruses leaving the remote beach in response. Low-flying aircraft can cause stampedes that crush young animals. Walruses’ preferred habitat is sea ice. Ice since 2007 has retreated beyond the shallow continental shelf to water too deep for walruses to dive for clams. Walruses this year began showing up on shore in July. On Saturday, about 40,000 walruses were near Point Lay.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:A miniature pig “craze,” paired with a lack of education on how to raise them, has led to owners surrendering or releasing them into the desert at an alarming rate, said Danielle Betterman, owner and director of Better Piggies Rescue, a pig sanctuary in Phoenix. The overflow of miniature pigs is so bad, she said, that her sanctuary has had to stop accepting owner surrenders. The Ironwood Pig Sanctuary in Marana has more than 100 pigs on its surrender waitlist to date, said Mary Schanz, its president and co-founder. Most of them aren’t spayed or neutered. Schanz, who has been in the pig rescue business for 18 years, said her sanctuary has largely been able to keep up with the incoming pigs, “but now, it’s just beyond our capability.” The problem, she said, is that there are no regulations for pig breeding. Backyard breeders rear too many pigs and then sell them to people who mistakenly think they will stay small. The Arizona Department of Agriculture saw an increase in pickups of stray pigs in the last year. There have already been 17 pig pickups in 2019, compared to 15 in all of 2018, said Cody Egnor, an assistant state veterinarian for the agriculture department.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort is raising the minimum wage for its nearly 1,000 employees. The racetrack and casino said it would increase the minimum wage for nontipped employees from $9.25 an hour to $13 an hour starting at the end of the month. Tipped employees will see their minimum wage increase from $2.76 an hour to $6 an hour. Oaklawn said the change affects about 970 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees. Oaklawn is expanding after voters legalized casino gambling in four counties in 2018. Construction is underway on a $100 million expansion, which includes adding a hotel and event center. In 2018, Arkansas voters approved an initiative to gradually raise the state’s minimum wage to $11 an hour by 2021.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said California is falling short on preventing water pollution, largely because of its problem with homelessness in big cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler outlined the complaints Thursday in a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Wheeler is demanding a detailed plan for fixing the problems within 30 days. The letter said “piles of human feces on sidewalks and streets” could cause water contamination. It criticized San Francisco for routinely discharging inadequately treated sewage into the Pacific Ocean. Wheeler said if the state doesn’t meet its responsibilities, the EPA will have to take action. The letter escalated a feud between the Trump administration and California, a predominantly Democrat state that has fought the administration’s efforts to weaken environmental regulations.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A flight was diverted to Denver after a passenger was found trapped inside the airplane’s bathroom. KUSA-TV reported that Denver International Airport spokeswoman Emily Williams said the door to one of the airplane’s bathrooms got stuck, but could not confirm why or how. Officials said United Flight 1554 was scheduled to travel from the District of Columbia to San Francisco before it made an emergency landing Wednesday in Denver. Williams said the flight crew called for assistance and the Denver Fire Department responded to the airport and helped open the door. Williams said there were no calls for medical assistance. United Airlines confirmed that someone was in the bathroom.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A service dog that was the subject of several books by an Iraqi war veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder has died. Tuesday, a golden retriever, was 13 when he died Tuesday in Burlington, according to Educated Canines Assisting with Disabilities, a service dog training organization that places dogs with veterans. Tuesday gained fame touring the country with former U.S. Army Cpt. Luis Carlos Montalvan, who wrote the memoir “Until Tuesday: A Wounded Warrior and the Golden Retriever Who Saved Him.” The book, the first of four written by Montalvan about his life with Tuesday, became a bestseller in 2011. It was credited with helping raise awareness of PTSD and the availability of service dogs for veterans. Montalvan, who was wounded in Iraq, earned two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart. Montalvan became a leading advocate for military veterans’ mental health and increasing access to more service animals. Montalvan took his own life in 2016. He had left Tuesday with family members and the dog was not with him at the time. Tuesday was later placed as a service dog with a Connecticut cancer patient. He died in the arms of that man, Gordon Schafer, at their home after being diagnosed with a mass in his abdomen.\n\nDelaware\n\nSeaford:The Seaford School District issued an apology for a mix-up and is investigating why a parody version of the national anthem sung by Rosanne Barr was used before a volleyball match Tuesday between Seaford and Milford high schools. In a letter to the district and community, Superintendent David Perrington said pregame proceedings will be improved to prevent it from happening again. Called “disgraceful and disrespectful” by parents on social media, the incident sparked uproar from spectators wondering how it was allowed to happen, and whether not it was an honest mistake made by students. “The district plays the National Anthem prior to sporting events to honor our country and in support for the men and women who serve in the nation’s armed forces,” Perrington wrote in the apology. “In the future, the district will utilize our district-approved version at athletic events.” The school district also reached out to Milford School District on Tuesday night to apologize. Performed in 1990 before a San Diego Padres game, Barr’s screeching rendition rocked the country before there was such thing as a viral video. Complete with spitting and midsong laughter, Barr’s off-key shrieks often are ranked among the worst performances the anthem.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A technology developer who filed a lawsuit against the District’s $215 million no-bid sports gambling contract has requested a temporary restraining order to stop the district from upholding it. WTOP-FM reported that Dylan Carragher filed the motion Tuesday, stating the single-source contract awarded to Intralot violates the city’s procurement laws that ensure competitive bidding. Carragher’s attorney, Donald Temple, said if the contract is illegal, and the government shouldn’t be allowed to execute it. Carragher’s lawsuit said the contract illegally bars him and other potential vendors from participating in the “potentially lucrative enterprise.” The D.C. Attorney General’s Office declined to comment. Court documents said the order, if granted, will block Intralot from receiving a $30 million payment due Oct. 1.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne:A local zoo assisted 39 green and loggerhead sea turtle “washbacks” that were pushed ashore when heavy waves disrupted their habitat. Brevard Zoo’s sea turtle manager Shanon Gann said in a news release that the washbacks were found on Brevard County’s beaches over the last week. Gann said staff members and volunteers cared for the turtles, which were then sent to Gumbo Limbo Nature Center in Boca Raton. They were expected to be taken by boat to the weed line and released on Thursday. Sea turtles rely on energy stored in their yolk sac upon hatching to make the multimile swim to offshore weed lines. If the seaweed is disrupted by strong winds or waves, they might get washed back onshore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A Georgia sheriff’s employee has been fired over a video that showed him confronting a 19-year-old Latina for speaking Spanish at a McDonald’s and then admitting to being a racist. Chatham County Sheriff John Wilcher told reporters that the man has been fired from the department, but declined to identify the man or provide his job title. The expletive-filled video shared on Twitter showed the white man confronting Cristina Riofrio for speaking Spanish to her friends, saying she probably came over on a boat. At one point, Riofrio said“I’m videoing this. You’re a racist,” to which the man replies, “I know I am.” Riofrio said the man shouldn’t be proud of that fact just before an off-screen employee told the man he needs to leave.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Wildlife officials on Tuesday euthanized two emaciated, sick dolphins that stranded on a Maui beach less than a month after another mass stranding in the same area. The two animals were breathing heavily and had abnormal heart rates, said David Schofield, the regional stranding coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They also had critically low levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase, which in dolphins and whales indicates inflammation, illness or poor nutrition, Schofield said. Veterinarians who examined the animals determined the most humane thing to do would be to euthanize them, he said. The two were among six pygmy killer whales, a species of deep-ocean dwelling dolphin, that agency officials had been monitoring for about 10 days in shallow waters off Maui. The remaining four were still in the area off Sugar Beach in the coastal town of Kihei. Pygmy killer whales are often confused with false killer whales and melon-headed whales. The species is found primarily in deep waters throughout tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Eleven pygmy killer whales stranded on the same beach on Aug. 29. One calf died and officials euthanized four adults after that stranding. Dorsal fin marks showed different individuals were involved in the two stranding events.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho Humane Society officials said they’re seeing an increase in the number of people surrendering their pets because of housing issues. Kristine Schellhaas with the Idaho Humane Society told KBOI-TV in Boise that some owners can’t afford pet insurance or the higher rental rates they must pay with pets. So far this year, the shelter has taken in more than 1,500 owner-surrendered cats and dogs. Schellhaas said it’s heartbreaking because the families love their animals even though they need to rehome them. For pets needing temporary help, the Idaho Humane Society has a pet food pantry. Owners facing financial issues can get six months of access to the pantry. The shelter’s animal clinic also provides veterinary care to low-income pet owners.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois State Museum has agreed to return 42 culturally significant objects to Australia. The gesture comes nearly a century after they were brought to the United States. The museum said in a news release that it’s the first institution in the world to repatriate artifacts as part of the Australian government’s Return of Cultural Heritage Project. It’s an attempt to bring back indigenous materials taken from the country. Boomerangs, necklaces, shields, spears and other items that will be returned were collected in Australia between 1929 and 1931 by University of Chicago linguistic anthropologist Gerhardt Laves. They were transferred by the university to the state museum in 1942 for incorporation into its rotating exhibit series on international cultures. They haven’t been exhibited by the museum since 1981.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Marketing research firm J.D. Power released its 2019 North America Airport Satisfaction Study, and Indianapolis International Airport ranked highest in customer satisfaction for medium-size airports, which service 4.5 million to 9.9 million passengers a year. This is the second time the airport received this honor, topping the list in 2016. Indianapolis International earned 833 points, ranking first in the cleanliness of terminal concourses, hallways and restrooms, as well as comfort in the terminal, ambiance, Wi-Fi service and clarity of signs and directions. Jacksonville International Airport in Florida was second with 831 points and Buffalo Niagara International Airport in New York came in third with 829 points. Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport topped the satisfaction list for mega airports and Portland International Airport in Oregon earned the title for large airports. Indianapolis International Airport first earned a top J.D. Power ranking in 2010 for the best small airport in North America. It landed in the top three each year except for 2011 through 2014, when no study was published. In July, the airport landed at No. 2 on the Travel + Leisure Top 10 Domestic Airports list. In April, construction began on a refresh of the airport’s dining and retail options. The three-year plan will see new restaurants, including Shake Shack and Bub’s Burgers. At an Indianapolis Airport Authority Board meeting this month, officials said some restaurants would start to close in October, replaced by temporary food and beverage vendors.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a proclamation Wednesday naming Sept. 28, 2019, as “Carson King Day” in Iowa to honor the 24-year-old Altoona resident who has raised more than $1 million for charity. “Individuals like Carson King demonstrate how ‘Iowa Nice’ isn’t just a slogan, but our way of life,” the proclamation reads. Reynolds, joined by King, read it aloud and signed it in her formal office in the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon. She also signed a proclamation designating September as “Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.” King rose to prominence after hoisting a sign on ESPN’s “College GameDay” in Ames that read “Busch Light Supply Needs Replenished,” and requesting beer money be sent to his Venmo account. When he received several hundred dollars, King said he would donate it to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital, a move that prompted more donations to start pouring in, along with matching donations from Busch Beer and Venmo. King now is hoping to raise $2 million for the hospital by the end of the month.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A couple from Emporia, Kansas, has committed $1 million to the internal medicine program at the University of Kansas School of Medicine in Wichita. The university on Wednesday announced the gift from Scott and Julie Smiley. The money will be divided into three funds. One will benefit the Department of Internal Medicine, another will support residents in the internal medicine program, and the third will fund student scholarships, with preference given to students interested in internal medicine. Scott Smiley, a native of Newton, Kansas, who graduated from the school of medicine in Wichita, is a physician in Emporia. Julie Smiley is a veterinarian who also practices in Emporia.\n\nKentucky\n\nMammoth Cave: A historic Baptist church at a state park has been vandalized with orange spray paint. WBKO-TV reported graffiti now covers parts of Mammoth Cave Baptist Church’s exterior and interior, along with its windows and benches. One wall now reads “I heart Satan,” with a drawing of a heart. Mammoth Cave National Park Superintendent Barclay Trimble said the church is one of only three that remain from the time before the park was established in 1941. Park officials said the process of removing graffiti can destroy the historic wood, making the graffiti’s complete removal nearly impossible. Repairs are estimated to cost at least $10,000. The station said those caught spray painting surfaces in the park can face up to six months in jail and fines of up to $5,000.\n\nLouisiana\n\nFort Polk: A helicopter crashed on an Army base, killing one person and injuring three others, military officials said Thursday. The Army chopper crashed early Thursday in the Fort Polk training area, Fort Polk officials said in a statement. There were four crew members on board, authorities said. Their names weren’t being released until relatives are notified. The fort said the cause of the crash is under investigation, and no further details were immediately released. About 8,000 soldiers are stationed at Fort Polk, its website states. The base is in central Louisiana, about 150 miles northwest of Baton Rouge.\n\nMaine\n\nCastine: A referee who was hit in the face by a cannon blast during a Maine Maritime Academy football game is recovering from his injuries. The referee was taken to a hospital with nonlife-threatening injuries Saturday. The Hancock County Sheriff’s Department told WCSH-TV that an academy alumnus brought the cannon to the game in Castine. The alumnus reportedly loaded the cannon with black powder and a substance that had been made into a wad. It is a tradition for a cannon to be fired with a blank shotgun shell when the academy scores.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Baltimore official said the city is still looking for an organization that wants to acquire the Confederate monuments it removed in the middle of the night two years ago. The Baltimore Sun reported the statues have been hidden in a city-owned lot since their August 2017 removal. Historical and Architectural Preservation official Eric Holcomb told the newspaper a museum expressed interest in the bronze statues but they were too large. He said the commission is looking for any organization that will provide a “historically accurate interpretation” of them. Former Mayor Catherine Pugh ordered the monuments taken down following violent clashes over similar statues in Charlottesville, Virginia. Since then, suggestions have ranged from destroying them to adding contextual markers, to melting them and turning them into statues of civil rights figures.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State public health officials said a fourth Massachusetts resident has died of the mosquito-borne eastern equine encephalitis virus. The state Department of Public Health announced Wednesday that the latest victim was an Essex County resident. No additional information about the person was disclosed. Officials also said they have confirmed an 11th human case of the virus, a Worcester County man in his 70s. As a result, the communities of Auburn, Charlton, Dudley, Leicester, Southbridge and Spencer have been elevated to high risk for the disease. There are now 35 communities in the state at critical risk, 46 at high risk and 122 at moderate risk. State epidemiologist Dr. Catherine Brown said residents should continue to protect themselves from mosquito bites until the first hard frost.\n\nMichigan\n\nHolland: High water along a west Michigan river has forced Hope College to move its annual tug-of-war contest for the first time in more than a century. The Holland Sentinel reported the Pull traces its roots back to 1898 and the 122nd installment is Saturday. But instead of being held across the Black River, the competition between the freshman and sophomore classes will take place along a Holland street. The newspaper said the Pull has only been held in two locations, with teams competing across a stream in the early years. The Pull’s staff adviser, Richard Frost, said “students agonized over this.” He said they’re dedicated to tradition but “mindful of the safety of the participants.” Frost said the competition is expected to return to the Black River.\n\nMinnesota\n\nAlbany: Officials are monitoring a farm near Holdingford where about 20,000 gallons of liquid manure leaked from an above-ground storage tank. The Stearns County sheriff’s office said the farmer, Mark Leukam of Albany, reported Wednesday that he had a manure leak from a tank that holds 400,000 gallons. An estimated 20,000 gallons leaked out and drained into a low area, which contains an intermittent stream that flows through several miles of swampy area before connecting with a creek. The leak was stopped with a temporary fix. A trench and dirt berm were dug to contain any future leaks until the tank can be fixed. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency will continue to monitor the spill and pumping efforts, and work with the farm owner to mitigate the impact.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: A heating, ventilation and air conditioning technician found a slithering surprise while repairing an outdoor unit at a home. WLOX-TV reported that what started as a typical day for technician Conner Smith quickly turned into an episode on National Geographic after Smith found a ball python inside the HVAC unit. Homeowner Steve Ramos said he heard Smith say “whoa,” but he thought Smith was shocked by the repair work. Smith told Ramos he found the homeowner’s snake. But Ramos doesn’t own a ball python. Smith said it’s not uncommon to find animals, especially reptiles, inside AC units. Ramos said finding the snake explained a few household mysteries, such as why his dogs were barking at a nearby tree.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:A homegrown program that mixes international business, entrepreneurship, community development – and chocolate – will mark its 10th year by taking another crop of area high school students to Tanzania. Chocolate University, a partnership between Askinosie Chocolate and Drury University, is now accepting applications for the immersive program that includes an overseas trip next summer. The deadline to apply is Monday. Missy Gelner, chief kinship officer for Askinosie Chocolate, said students from Greene and Christian counties – who will graduate in 2020 or 2021 – are eligible to apply for one of 14 spots. Founded in 2009, Chocolate University completed its first immersion program with a trip in 2010. The trips are offered every other summer and the 2020 trip will be the sixth in the history of the program. The selected students will participate in a 10-day immersion of entrepreneurship, craft chocolate and cacao agronomy during a trip to rural Tanzania, where they will meet with farmers who provide raw ingredients for Askinosie Chocolate. They will also learn about leadership, the Tanzanian culture and the Swahili language. Before the trip, the students gather for learning sessions regarding direct trade and the ways a local business can give back and invest in the people of another culture. Shawn Askinosie, the founder of Askinosie Chocolate, said students get to know farmers that partner with the Springfield-based company and help harvest cacao. The 2018 trip cost $4,000 per traveler with scholarships available through grants and private donations. To apply, visit www.chocolate university.org. The online application process requires an essay and recommendation letters, from which a narrowed pool of applicants are chosen for in-person interviews.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: State wildlife officials have been unable to locate a grizzly bear that mauled an Ohio hunter in southwestern Montana. Fish, Wildlife and Parks wardens began investigating Tuesday, shortly after the attack was reported in the Gravelly Mountains. FWP spokesman Morgan Jacobsen said Thursday the hunter reported he was walking through blown-down timber when he was attacked by a bear at close range. The hunter said he fired several shots at the bear until it left. Investigators did find evidence the bear was injured. The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest has posted signs warning visitors of bear activity. Tuesday’s mauling happened about 8 miles south of where three hunters were injured in two separate attacks on Sept. 16. The bear or bears involved in those attacks were not found.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Nebraska Capitol Commission has approved spending $181,000 on emergency repairs, in part to keep gold tiles from falling off the dome. Work will begin soon to protect the dome from moisture and winter’s freeze-thaw cycles now that the state’s Capitol Commission voted to shift around funding. A July inspection discovered caulking applied to expansion joints in 2001 had deteriorated so much that water was getting inside the inner dome structure. Some exterior tiles had been moved out of place, raising the risk they could fall off, Ripley said. The caulking had been replaced as part of a masonry restoration project completed in 2010. But current caulking products don’t last as long as previous formulations, which contained more toxic ingredients, he said. Recaulking of joints in the lower parts of the building has been done every year, but budget limitations prevented the commission from checking the dome previously, Ripley said. To inspect the dome, contractors use rope harnesses and rappel down from the base of the Sower statue. He decided this year that the dome inspection could wait no longer. Plans for the emergency repairs call for workers to rappel down the dome and temporarily seal the expansion joints to keep the tiles in place. The longer-term solution will require scaffolding so workers can remove the tiles, fix the underlying structure and put the tiles back in place, he said. Caulking work also will be needed on the tower.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Officials said that the number of passengers using McCarran International Airport was up in August compared with the same month a year ago. The Clark County Department of Aviation on Wednesday reported 4.4 million arriving and departing travelers last month. That’s a 3.1% increase from August 2018. The airport has handled nearly 34.2 million passengers this year, keeping it on pace to surpass 50 million for the year for the first time. McCarran handled a record 49.7 million passengers in 2018. It’s one of the 10 busiest airports in the U.S. based on passenger count. Southwest Airlines was the busiest carrier at McCarran in August. Spirit overcame Delta for second, followed by American and United.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Office of the Child Advocate has started a review of how restraint and seclusion are being used on about 400 children in behavioral health settings. The review will look at children placed in private residential facilities and the Sununu Youth Services Center by the Division for Children, Youth and Families. Child Advocate Moira O’Neill said the patterns of how restraint and seclusion are used in New Hampshire are poorly understood. She said the only statewide data available is an aggregate number that shows the total incidents of restraint and seclusion across all facilities. Since 2014, there have been more than 20,000 incidents of restraint and seclusion across all residential facilities. But it’s not clear what that means.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: New Jersey horsemen could get millions of dollars in damages after a federal appeals court ruled that the horsemen were financially harmed while the legality of sports betting was being litigated. In a ruling Tuesday, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals said that the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association, representing owners and trainers, is entitled to damages. The association has sought the payment, with interest, of a $3.4 million bond that the four major pro sports leagues and the NCAA posted in 2014. It was intended to secure losses that might be suffered during the month that a restraining order was in effect, prohibiting the horsemen from offering sports betting at Monmouth Park Racetrack. A lower court ruled against them, but the appeals court reversed that ruling, kicking the case back to U.S. District Court in New Jersey to determine the appropriate amount of damages. New Jersey ultimately won a U.S. Supreme Court case in May year clearing the way for legal sports betting in all 50 states. The horsemen also are seeking economic damages over not being able to offer sports betting from the time the restraining order expired in Oct. 2014 until the Supreme Court ruling in an amount Drazin estimated at $150 million. That amount was not covered in Tuesday’s ruling. When the association returns to court, it will seek to prove it should receive the $3.4 million from the bond. But it also will seek extended damages, intending to argue that the leagues acted in bad faith, something the leagues have denied in previous court filings. No hearing date has yet been set.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: New Mexico’s U.S. senators want the Trump administration to defend the state’s pecan growers from tariffs during ongoing trade negotiations with India. U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall, both Democrats, recently signed on to a bipartisan letter from 12 senators urging U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to negotiate the lifting of a trade barrier, the Carlsbad Current-Argus reported. The senators argued that rising imports from Mexico, Chinese tariffs and tree loss after Hurricane Michael strained U.S. pecan prices, and India’s growing middle class represented a market that could help minimize the economic damage. Records show India charges a 36% tariff on pecan imports, while other tree nuts such as pistachios and almonds are charged tariff rates of 10% or less. New Mexico became the largest pecan-producing state last year after Hurricane Michael ravaged Georgia’s crop. New Mexico was estimated to have produced about 90 million pounds of pecans in 2018, down about 2 million from 2017.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: A gilded coffin that was featured at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art is on its way back to Egypt after it was determined to be a looted antiquity. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and Egypt’s foreign minister Sameh Hassan Shoukry held a repatriation ceremony in New York on Wednesday for the Coffin of Nedjemankh. The Met bought the piece from a Paris art dealer in 2017 for about $4 million and made it the centerpiece of an exhibition. It was removed last February. The Met has apologized to Egypt. Investigators said the coffin was smuggled from Egypt through the United Arab Emirates, Germany and France. They said the museum was given fraudulent documents, including a forged 1971 Egyptian export license. Prosecutors said they’ve found evidence of hundreds more antiquities thefts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Officials said nearly half of North Carolina’s counties are experiencing a moderate drought because of a lack of rainfall. Klaus Albertin, chairman of the N.C. Drought Management Advisory Council, said in a news release issued by the Department of Environmental Quality on Thursday that water supplies, agriculture, fire threat and stream-flows statewide are beginning to reflect the lack of precipitation. Forty-five counties in the western and central parts of the state are in moderate drought stage, the least detrimental of four categories used in federal drought maps. Twenty-two counties are experiencing abnormally dry conditions, which means a drought could emerge without adequate rainfall. Albertin said although Hurricane Dorian left heavy rainfall along the coast, almost none fell west of Interstate 95. He said conditions could worsen before they improve.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The flags of North Dakota’s five tribal nations will be on permanent display outside the governor’s office at the state Capitol. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum announced the decision to display the flags during his State of the State address in January. The bipartisan Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee approved making the display permanent on Thursday. They represent the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation; the Standing Rock Sioux; the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa; the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate; and the Spirit Lake Nation. The relationship between North Dakota officials and tribes has been strained in the past, especially during protests three years ago against the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Burgum said the tribal flag display was done “in the spirit of mutual respect.”\n\nOhio\n\nReynoldsburg: The Ohio Department of Health has confirmed the first human death in the state this year from the West Nile virus. Authorities said Wednesday that a 68-year-old Lucas County man hospitalized with encephalitis also was the first human case in the state this year. Health officials said Ohio had six fatalities among 65 human West Nile cases in 2017, after five deaths among 34 human cases in 2016. On Tuesday, Agriculture Department officials reported two confirmed West Nile cases among horses in the state. Most West Nile cases are transmitted by mosquitoes. Authorities urge using repellant and protective clothing and eliminating standing water and other potential mosquito breeding areas. Most infected people don’t have symptoms, but some get flu-like symptoms. A few will develop a serious neurologic illness.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: The life of Oklahoma State University alumnus and benefactor T. Boone Pickens has been celebrated on the campus where the late energy industry billionaire donated hundreds of millions of dollars to support academic and athletic programs. Pickens, who died in Dallas on Sept. 11 at age 91, was lauded at a memorial service Wednesday for his legacy of philanthropy and inspiration that university President Burns Hargis has encouraged other donors to transform the university. During his lifetime, Pickens donated $652 million to the university, including a $165 million gift in 2005 that at the time was the largest athletic gift in NCAA history. Since then, the university has raised $2 billion in cash and pledges. Pickens was a 1951 graduate of the university’s School of Geology, now known as the Boone Pickens School of Geology.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The pregnancy of a 26-year-old elephant known as Chendra at the Oregon Zoo has ended in miscarriage. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported veterinarians at the zoo grew concerned earlier this month when they noticed a drop in some of the Asian elephant’s reproductive hormones. Last week, more definitive tests showed that she was no longer pregnant, said Bob Lee, who oversees the elephant program at the zoo. Chendra was around eight months along, which would correspond to the first trimester in humans. The gestation period for elephants is around 22 months. Chendra came to Oregon in 1999. She was found as a young calf wandering alone near a palm oil plantation in Borneo. Twenty-five elephants have been born at the Oregon Zoo since 1962.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHegins Township: Police said more than 136,000 eggs splattered on a road when they shifted and fell out of a tractor-trailer driving through Pennsylvania. The Republican Herald reported that 11,340 dozen eggs and 2,260 gallons of egg product were ruined when a 66-year-old driver lost control of the rig Tuesday. Hegins Township police said driver Joseph Miles had just picked the eggs up at Carl Faus Farm and was on his way to Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. Police said Miles was driving north on Route 125 uphill. As he approached the Route 25 intersection, the load shifted causing the eggs and egg products to fall and roll down the hill. Miles reportedly did not realize the eggs had fallen and continued his drive. A section of Route 125 was closed for several hours after the incident. An investigation into the unsecured load is ongoing.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Several models and actresses have sued a Rhode Island strip club they said used their images in social media and advertising campaigns without permission. The models, including Tara Leigh Patrick, who is better known as Carmen Electra, said by using their images, the Cadillac Lounge in Providence made it appear as if they either worked at, endorsed or were otherwise affiliated the club. The plaintiffs are alleging misleading advertising, violation of privacy, defamation and unjust enrichment. The suit filed last week in federal court in Rhode Island seeks unspecified damages, an end to the use of their images and a jury trial. No attorney for was listed for the club or owner Nancy Shappy in court records. A listed number for the club was not in service.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A national organization said Gov. Henry McMaster is violating the Constitution by holding prayers before news conferences. News outlets reported the Freedom From Religion Foundation sent a letter to the governor’s office concerning two prayers earlier this month before news conferences regarding Hurricane Dorian. Foundation attorney Ryan Jayne said the practice violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from favoring one religion over others. A spokesperson for the governor, Brian Symmes, said as long as McMaster is governor and the state has to prepare for dangerous storms, there will be a chaplain saying prayers before news conferences. The foundation also sent McMaster a letter in January concerning prayers before news conferences for Hurricane Florence last September.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:An incident that prompted Southeast Technical Institute officials to alert students of a police investigation on campus Wednesday morning was determined to not be an immediate threat. Sioux Falls police officers investigated a “potential incident” on the campus after a suspicious item was found in the Technology Center on the west side of campus, STI president Robert Griggs said. The Technology Center is home to the New Tech High School, which is where the item was found, said Capt. Mike Walsh with the Minnehaha County Sheriff’s Office, which provides security for the STI campus. Walsh did not say what the found item was that caused the incident. The initial release, sent to students at 10:29 a.m., read “The Sioux Falls Police Department is on campus to investigate a potential incident. Reminder: If you see something, say something!” At 10:57, an all-clear was sent: “The Sioux Falls Police Department has investigated the situation and it has been determined there is no immediate threat to safety or security.” Southeast Technical Institute serves more than 2,000 students and offers more than 60 programs as one of two technical colleges in the region. The school is overseen by the Sioux Falls School District’s school board.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: The guardian of an autistic kindergartener said the 5-year-old boy was for punished for hugging a classmate. Chattanooga resident Summery Putnam told WTVC-TV a teacher accused the boy of sexual activities after he hugged one child and kissed another on the cheek. Putnam said the teacher told her the child was overstepping boundaries and she said a report was filed with the state Department of Child Services. Hamilton County Department of Education spokesman Tim Hensley released a statement that said school personnel are required to report concerns regarding children. Putnam said the child doesn’t understand normal social cues and boundaries. She said he has now switched classrooms and teachers and is enrolled in special education services.\n\nTexas\n\nCaddo Mills: Emergency officials said several airplanes have been destroyed in a hangar fire at a small airport in North Texas. Fire officials said no one was injured in Wednesday’s blaze at Caddo Mills Municipal Airport, about 35 miles northeast of Dallas. Authorities are trying to determine what sparked the fire, which was brought under control after about two hours. Hunt County Fire Marshal Richard Hill said no foul play is suspected in the fire that destroyed three aircraft, an automobile and a motorcycle. Caddo Mills is a town of about 1,600.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State officials said they have shaved $100 million off the estimated price of a proposed pipeline that would pull water from Lake Powell. The Utah Division of Water Resources said in a news release Wednesday the cost savings come from scrapping plans for two reservoirs that would have generated hydropower at peak demand times. Division spokeswoman Marcie Larson said the project is estimated to cost $1 billion to 1.7 billion, down from as much as $1.8 billion. It would be repaid over 50 years. A legislative audit found it will require a large fee, rate and tax increases in Washington County in southern Utah to pay for the project. Critics call the pipeline an unnecessary use of funds and said the emphasis should be on getting residents to use less water. The project is pending regulatory reviews.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: An after-school active shooter drill at an elementary school has raised concerns from several parents who were upset that some children heard words like “intruder” and “active shooter.” A school resource officer said the children, who were on the playground during the drill, were not meant to hear what was happening, but direct language is needed to avoid confusion in a real crisis. Several parents complained on social media about the terms that were broadcast at Union Elementary School during the drill Monday, the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus reported. Superintendent Libby Bonesteel said the drill was part of state-mandated training for all four schools in the Montpelier-Roxbury Public Schools District. The drill was meant to train faculty and staff, so students in an after-school program were sent to the playground, school administrators said. But some students could still hear the public address system, they said. Cpl. Matthew Knisley, a Montpelier Police Department school resource officer, said it was a standard drill that uses direct words to describe the threat. But he said children were not meant to be a part of the drill, which is why they were sent outside.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A Canadian-owned timber company is spending $32 million to expand sawmill and wood drying operations at two lumber mills. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Wednesday that Teal-Jones Group will create a total of 126 new jobs with expansions in Martinsville and Kinsale. The company will receive various state grants worth $650,000 to secure the project. Northam’s office said Virginia beat out Oklahoma and Washington for the projects. Northam said the company plans to buy more than $100 million in timber from Virginia sources in the next four years.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton:U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have arrested multiple people in Kitsap County, a move critics said was based on racial profiling. The Kitsap Sun reported Tuesday that immigration advocates have criticized ICE activity in Kitsap County for racial profiling during targeted operations. Two immigrant advocacy organizations have urged residents to know their rights. American Civil Liberties Union officials said a judge-signed search warrant is required to give police and immigration officers’ access to search property. Officials said there are some exceptions, but people should assert their rights under the Constitution, including the right to remain silent. Some county officials say increasing immigration operations in the state are inflicting fear in families and pushing communities into economic crisis when a friend or relative is detained.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Appalachian Queer Film Festival is making its way back to screens in West Virginia after a short hiatus. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported the festival will be from Friday to Sunday at the Floralee Hark Cohen Cinema in Charleston. Organizer Jon Matthews said the festival opened successfully in Lewisburg in 2015, but lost funding after a 2016 study by the Koch Brothers on government waste was critical of the festival. The newspaper reported that the study said taxpayers would find the films “objectionable.” Matthews said the festival was targeted for its use of the word “Queer.” He said the festival fought to stay afloat as it opens minds in and about Appalachia. He said it took time off to gather support. Matthews said everyone is welcome.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMishicot: The season for hunting ruffed grouse in the northwestern two-thirds of Wisconsin has been shortened by more than three weeks. The state Department of Natural Resources board voted Wednesday to make the change over concerns about a dwindling population. The ruffed grouse season currently runs from mid-September through Jan. 31 in that part of the state. The season will now end on Jan. 5. Hunters in Wisconsin took only 173,347 birds last year, the lowest total in 35 years of hunter surveys. The reason for the decline is unknown.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded $5 million to multiple Wyoming-based research initiatives to advance alternative uses for coal beyond energy generation. The Casper Star-Tribune reported that the federal government selected Ramaco Carbon, a coal technology company in Sheridan, for four research and development grants to delve deeper into the material science behind coal. The research grants come at a time when depressed demand for coal from the electricity generation sector becomes a new normal. Ramaco will partner with two other organizations to look into using coal for products like carbon fiber, a hearty material used to build aircraft, cars and more. Ramaco also received a federal Energy Department grant about a year ago.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/24/paulies-push-sweet-connie-vr-brain-rewiring-news-around-states/118465756/", "title": "Paulie's Push, sweet Connie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPanola: General Store owner Dorothy Oliver has persuaded and helped almost everyone in her community to get their COVID-19 shots. In her decades living in Panola, Oliver has become one of the most influential people in the area. She is the vice president of the local day care center and on the board of the community center, in addition to owning her store. “All of them know me,” she said of her customers. “They come in, and I just start talking to them like I know them. I don’t have to know you to talk to you.” And she isn’t afraid to ask about their vaccination status. “Back in December, whenever vaccination started, I started with it,” she said. “I went to calling all the older people around in the community, trying to make sure how their mind is and make sure they started thinking on going and getting a shot whenever it got ready for them.” By the time doses were readily available in Alabama, there were not any vaccination sites in the immediate area, with the closest facilities about 40 minutes away. So Oliver volunteered to schedule neighbors’ appointments and drive them to and from the sites. According to Oliver’s records, only about 20 adults in the community of roughly 350 people are left unvaccinated. “I know all my people that haven’t got it,” she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Three-time Super Bowl champion Mark Schlereth returned home to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines. Anchorage Daily News reports the Service High alumnus made a halftime appearance Friday night at West High, where his alma mater squared off against the West Eagles. “I just want to encourage everybody to do your part, to talk to your doctor, and if it’s the right decision for you, please get vaccinated,” Schlereth said. “Please take care of one another.” He has been advocating for COVID-19 shots on social media, and he said the NFL Players Association reached out to him about spreading the word in his home state. Almost 54% of Alaska residents 12 and older have been inoculated, according to the state dashboard. Schlereth, 55, was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder in 1993 while playing for Washington. He said one of the reasons he got the vaccine was to visit with his mother, who has cancer. “I wanted to spend as much time safely with her as possible … so it was just a no-brainer for us,” Schlereth said. He said one of his high school coaches whom he considered a mentor died Thursday from COVID-19. “I just lost a dear, dear friend who refused to get vaccinated, so that hit home for me,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Private businesses can require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but must allow reasonable religious and medical exemptions under state and federal law, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote in a legal opinion. And they can impose vaccine requirements on patrons as well, as long as they provide reasonable accommodation for customers who can’t take a vaccine because of a disability and don’t discriminate against those who won’t for religious reasons, the Republican wrote in Friday’s opinion. Public schools and universities and local and state government agencies are different because of laws enacted this year by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. They are not allowed to require employees or students to get inoculated once the new laws take effect Sept. 29. But private schools can, if they allow exemptions for religious or health reasons. Ducey last week issued an executive order barring state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing law that says health agencies can’t force people to be treated if they comply with sanitary or quarantine rules. A violation carries criminal sanctions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Connie Hamzy, a rock ’n’ roll groupie from the Natural State who was immortalized as “sweet, sweet Connie” in the 1973 Grand Funk Railroad hit “We’re an American Band,” has died. She was 66. “I was determined to become a famous groupie,” Hamzy, who lived in Little Rock, told KTHV in 2019. She told the station she was finishing her senior year of high school when the manager of Grand Funk Railroad called to say her name would be in a song. “I said, ‘Yeah I’ll have to see it to believe it,’ ” she said. But that summer, at the lake with friends, she heard a radio announcer introduce the new song and note that a local girl was in the first few lines, she said. “Out on the road for forty days. Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze. Sweet, sweet Connie, doin’ her act. She had the whole show, and that’s a natural fact.” Hamzy told KTHV she first got backstage at age 15 after her mother, who didn’t want to deal with traffic, dropped her off early to see Steppenwolf at Barton Coliseum. “We’d go out there, and then we’d wander around the backstage area, and one thing would lead to another,” she told KTHV. Hamzy, who worked for a time as a substitute teacher, hung out with groups including Queen, the Eagles and Kiss, KTHV reports. She told the station Van Halen was a particular favorite.\n\nCalifornia\n\nMalibu: Powerful surf washed away a section of a beach access road, and swimmers and surfers were urged to use caution as huge waves from a southern swell battered the Southern California coastline. The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted photos Saturday that showed the ground under Westward Beach Road completely collapsed. Beach hazard advisories had mostly expired by Sunday morning, but officials warned that dangerous rip currents and localized flooding were still possible. “We cannot emphasize this enough: surf and swim in front of an open lifeguard tower,” the Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted. “Check with the nearest lifeguard before entering the water.” Aerial video by CBS 2 News showed huge waves hitting the patio and second-story balconies of a hotel in the Orange County city of Laguna Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: After taking last season off due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bustang rides to Denver Broncos home games are back with service from Fort Collins and Colorado Springs. The state Department of Transportation said the return of rides on its Bustang coaches will begin with the team’s final preseason game at 7 p.m. Saturday at Empower Field at Mile High against the Los Angeles Rams. Service was suspended last year due to the pandemic and restricted capacity at the stadium. This is the fifth season the service has been offered. The round-trip fare is $30 per person. Coaches are climate-controlled and equipped with Wi-Fi, restrooms, USB and power outlets, comfortable seats and wheelchair access. Face masks are required for drivers and passengers, and hand sanitizer wipes will be offered to passengers when boarding the bus. The buses are cleaned and disinfected upon completion of each route and each day’s routes, according to officials. Amber Blake, CDOT’s director of Transit and Rail, said the service provides an alternative for fans, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, provides a designated driver and enhances safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Slot machine revenues generated at the state’s two tribal casinos continue to rebound. Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino report seeing an influx of visitors over the summer as COVID-19 restrictions have eased. Both destinations closed for more than three months at the height of the pandemic last year. Mohegan Sun, owned by the Mohegan Tribe, generated $49.9 million in slot machine revenues in July after paying out winnings. That’s a 5% increase from July 2020 and the most money the casino has retained since August 2019, according to The Day of New London. Foxwoods, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, kept $36.5 million in July, marking a 19.6% increase from the more than $30.5 million in generated in July 2020. It’s the casino’s highest amount since November 2019. Jason Guyot, CEO of Foxwoods, said slot revenues at the site increased by $7.1 million from June to July. To meet increased consumer demand this summer, he said the casino has offered new experiences, including an outdoor pop-up eatery and a “Cocktail Carnival.” Mohegan Sun has also rolled out more promotions and entertainment over the summer, helping to drive traffic, said Jeff Hamilton, the resort casino’s president and CEO.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As housing prices soared over the past year, the dream of homeownership was less achievable in the First State, where buyers need more cash for closing the sale. Delaware has the highest real estate transfer tax in the nation, making the average closing costs the second-highest behind Washington, D.C. On a $250,000 home, the transfer tax due at settlement in Delaware is $10,000, which is usually split between the seller and buyer and must be paid at closing. The buyer can’t roll that amount into the mortgage and pay it off over time. Mia Burch, president of the Delaware Association of Realtors, said she has worked with buyers who were in good financial shape in almost every way but had trouble coming up with all the cash they needed at closing. She calls the transfer tax a “discouragement” tax. In 2017, the Legislature hiked the real estate transfer tax from 3% of the property’s sale price to 4%. It was only supposed to be a temporary increase to help solve the state’s budget deficit, said Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek. But four years later, even after a $1 billion budget surplus, the 4% tax is still in place. “Seniors and young people are the ones getting squeezed,” Ramone said. In January, he introduced a bill to reduce the tax to its previous level, but it’s yet to make it to the House floor for a vote.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ten years after an earthquake shook the nation’s capital, repair work is only half done on the National Cathedral, WUSA-TV reports. The Aug. 23, 2011, temblor registered a 5.8 on the Richter scale and dealt extensive damage to buildings across the area. “The quake lasted 58 seconds,” said Joe Alonso, National Cathedral head stonemason. He still can recall every single second of that shake that bent the historic cathedral’s beautiful spires, split its gargoyles and sent chunks of masonry to the ground. “I thought, ‘Wow we’ve got a task ahead of us, that’s for sure,’ ” Alonso said. Repairing the spires and towers is not as simple as slapping some glue on the pieces and putting them back up. “It’s just the nature of the work – everything is handmade, hand-done,” Alonso said. “But that’s how the cathedral was built.” For ten years, the stonemasons have had to reconstruct every single broken piece and reset it hundreds of feet in the air by scaffolding or crane. “What it costs to do this is very expensive, and we are doing (a) sort of a pay-as-you-go,” Alonso said. He believes the 58 seconds were the difference between a slow, tedious repair and complete reconstruction. “If the quake had lasted 2 or 3 more seconds, the stuff that was like a Jenga game would have just come completely down,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: The state’s power struggle over wearing masks in school landed Monday before a judge considering a lawsuit that challenges Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order reserving the decision for parents. The three-day hearing before Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper pits pro-mask parents against the Republican governor and state education officials who say parents, not schools, should choose whether their children cover up inside schools. The hearings come as the highly contagious delta variant causes a surge in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across Florida, where the school year is already being disrupted. Charles Dodson, a former judge representing the parents challenging the governor’s order, in an opening statement that the delta variant affects children more than the previous virus strain and places them at greater risk in crowded schools. He said the Florida Constitution and state law give local school boards the authority to decide health and safety matters affecting their students. Michael Abel, a lawyer for the defendants, said the state’s experts will testify that requiring students to wear masks causes many harms – speaking difficulty, mood changes, breathing issues and depression – while scientists disagree on their effectiveness against the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge has found that part of the state’s sweeping new election law that broadly prohibits the photographing of a completed ballot is likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee on Friday granted a preliminary injunction on that section of the law, meaning it cannot be enforced for now. In the same order, he declined to block a number of other provisions that mostly have to do with monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The judge’s order came in a lawsuit filed by the Coalition for Good Governance, an election integrity group, and others. Boulee wrote that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit “have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” that the broad ban on photographing a voted ballot in both public and nonpublic places violates their First Amendment rights. The new law, known as SB 202, also adds a voter ID requirement for mail ballots, shortens the time period for requesting a mail ballot, results in fewer ballot drop boxes available in metro Atlanta, and gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. There are currently eight federal lawsuits challenging parts of the 98-page law enacted earlier this year, including one filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials say a surge in tourists is leading to increased harassment of sea turtles on a popular North Shore Oahu beach. Hordes of people are crowding turtles at Laniakea Beach Park, known as Turtle Beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said increased patrols are being dispatched to enforce laws against approaching the turtles. “There are packs of 200 people at a time, throughout the day,” said Debbie Herrera, volunteer and education coordinator for turtle conservation group Malama na Honu. The state Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement has assigned officers to Laniakea. “Typically, if there’s a uniformed officer standing on the beach, people are not going to break the law in front of them,” said Jason Redulla, division chief. Harassment of turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals led Gov. David Ige to warn that violators will be prosecuted if caught. Tourists at Laniakea Beach tell Malama na Honu they didn’t know touching turtles was illegal, Herrera said. Most follow the rules once informed, but there have been a “very few who refuse, despite dozens of cautionary signs or warnings from volunteers, to give green sea turtles on the beach or in the ocean wide berth,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: One of two U.S. district judges for Idaho announced seven months ago that he’d take senior status in August, but there’s still no official nominee to replace him. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill planned to continue to hear a full caseload when he took senior status Aug. 16, but expected Idaho to have a new district judge to replace him by then – effectively giving the state the third judge it has needed for decades, the Idaho Press reports. “We desperately need the help,” Winmill said. But there’s been no word from the White House about a nominee for the now-open second federal judgeship, though Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials interviewed candidates last winter and submitted an all-female shortlist of four nominees to the Biden administration in March: Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson, and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Traditionally, state senators are given a big say in federal district judge nominees, but that system was jettisoned under the Trump administration. The Senate – where Democrats hold a thin majority – must confirm any nominee by simple majority. It’s unclear what role Idaho’s Republican senators will play in the nomination.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials have dropped a “do not eat” advisory for sport fish in the Illinois River for the first time since the 1970s. The Illinois Department of Public Health relaxed the warning because concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, have declined, the Chicago Tribune reports. The toxic contaminants were banned in 1979 but stick around in the environment, prompting the advisory. IDPH issues advisories annually based on fish samples collected from 40 to 50 streams, rivers and inland lakes, as well as from four stations in Lake Michigan. They are geared toward vulnerable populations including pregnant and nursing women, along with children younger than age 15. The department said there is no known immediate health hazard from eating contaminated fish in Illinois. But there are “concerns about the effects of long-term, low-level exposure” to contaminants including PCBs. Guidance also was relaxed for some Lake Michigan fish, including whitefish and rainbow trout. Recommended consumption is now no more than one meal a week. Previous guidance was to limit consumption to once per month.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Hoosier Lottery saw record profits in the past year as its ticket sales soared 26% from the year before. That big jump was fueled by 27% growth in scratch-off ticket sales that accounted for nearly 80% of the lottery’s $1.74 billion in revenue during the year period ending June 30, officials told the State Lottery Commission this past week. Lottery administrators had projected a slight drop in sales because of worries about coronavirus-related shutdowns and the possible economic impact. But the boost in revenue will result in the lottery sending a record $375 million in profits to the state – up about $71 million, or 23%, from the year before. That’s even higher than the $368 million profits that lottery officials had projected in May. “These are really extraordinary numbers,” Lottery Commission Chairman William Zielke said. “It certainly reflects the efforts of a lot of people who tried to keep it going (through the pandemic).” The state directs about $235 million of the lottery profits toward reducing auto excise taxes, with $60 million going to pension funds for teachers, police officers and firefighters. The scratch-off tickets sales growth follows the lottery’s long-term strategy to attract more players enticed by the regular release of new instant games.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: When state Sen. Joe Bolkcom asked in June how much it would cost to deploy Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border, the Department of Public Safety said expenses wouldn’t be calculated until the mission was completed. The response ignored that the state agency had run its own internal cost estimate a week before the since-completed deployment had even been made public, according to records reviewed by the Des Moines Register. The department recently released more than 2,200 pages of emails in response to a joint records request from the Register and the Cedar Rapids Gazette. Gov. Kim Reynolds announced June 24 that troopers would be deployed to the border after Texas asked for help with an influx of migrants. The announcement led legislators and the media to ask questions of the Department of Public Safety and Iowa State Patrol. At the onset, Iowa officials issued scant details about the operations, citing concerns for officer safety. They did not cite that for costs. On June 17, Iowa State Patrol Maj. Robert Hansen sent top department officials an initial cost estimate: $383,700.24 to cover a 16-day deployment of 28 troopers of various ranks. Initial cost estimates after they returned were shy of $300,000, department Commissioner Stephan Bayens said at a July 28 news conference.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: If the Evel Knievel museum moves to Las Vegas, the owner of the museum dedicated to the daredevil has pledged to repay $117,000 it has received from the city of Topeka since it opened in 2017. It was reported earlier this month that the museum dedicated to the career of Robert Craig Knievel, who became known for his death-defying stunts and tricks on motorbikes, may move to the Las Vegas Arts District. Museum owner Mike Patterson told city officials in a meeting last week that he believes it is appropriate to repay the city even though it might not be required in the incentive contract the museum signed. Patterson said private loans were the main source of funding for the roughly $3.5 million museum. But it was also slated to receive up to $300,000 from the city over 12 years if it continued operating in Topeka. The money it received came from the city’s tax on hotel stays. City Council member Spencer Duncan said Topeka will make sure future incentive contracts with businesses include terms that require businesses to repay the incentives they received if they do leave the city.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear has declared this week Healthcare Heroes Appreciation Week in honor of the doctors, nurses, hospital and clinic staff, and others who have helped the Bluegrass State during the COVID-19 pandemic. “They are heroes. They have earned that title,” Beshear said at a press briefing Thursday, urging local businesses and community members to find ways to show gratitude for health care workers. The most important way, he said, is to get vaccinated against COVID-19. “Let’s make sure that everywhere these health care heroes go, they see how much we care,” the Democratic governor said. Following a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling impacting his executive authority, Beshear on Monday rescinded his executive order requiring masks in schools. The move came a day before a federal judge is scheduled to decide whether to continue a temporary restraining order preventing the mandate from being enforced. Without an order to block, the legal challenge is likely moot. A separate mask mandate for public schools from the Kentucky Department of Education still stands, as does a similar measure for child care centers from the Department of Public Health. Without a mandate in place, private schools across the state are now able to adopt mask-optional policies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 20 government agencies, universities and electric utilities in the state soon will be getting electric vehicle charging stations worth more than $1.7 million. The Department of Environmental Quality is awarding grants to 26 entities for 82 charging stations, using money from the state’s $19.8 million share from a settlement worth nearly $3 billion between the U.S. Justice Department and Volkswagen over violations of the Clean Air Act, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Volkswagen sold about 590,000 vehicles equipped with devices that worked against their air pollution control features, resulting in increased emissions of nitrogen oxide. Almost $12 million of Louisiana’s share of the 2016 settlement was set aside to replace 351 diesel engine buses owned by 16 school boards. The new engines will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Another $7.3 million was given to the state Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Agriculture to replace old diesel equipment and vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s $1,500 bonus to attract new workers back to the workforce this summer during the pandemic hasn’t been successful. Only about 5% of the 7,500 people whom the $10 million program could cover have been declared provisionally eligible, the Bangor Daily News reports. An extended deadline to file applications closed Friday. The bonus for new employees who work at least eight weeks and meet other criteria equates to about two weeks of unemployment pay. It may not have been enough to entice workers to give up benefits or to get overworked employers to handle the extra paperwork that the program entails, said Steve Hewins, executive director of the industry group HospitalityMaine. Maine’s neighbor to the west has had a bit more success. New Hampshire, which stopped the enhanced unemployment benefits in June, drew 700 applicants to its $1,000 return-to-work program in the first four weeks after it started July 19. In contrast, Maine had attracted only 400 applicants since mid-June.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The woeful record of the Baltimore Orioles is combining with the coronavirus pandemic to cost the state millions of dollars in rent payments. The Baltimore Sun reports the Major League Baseball team’s rent payments to the Maryland Stadium Authority have dropped precipitously in the past year due to low attendance and loss of ballpark-generated revenue. The Orioles paid $1.6 million in rent to the Stadium Authority for the use of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in the fiscal year ending June 30. The team’s average annual rent of its 30-year lease has been $6.8 million. The rent payments are based on a percentage of ticket sales, concessions, parking and stadium advertising. The team has the worst record in the majors, and attendance is sparse. During the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, fans were not allowed in the stadium at all. The rent money is used specifically for the maintenance of the ballpark. Stadium officials say they have curtailed maintenance expenses accordingly. The rent losses are in addition to the loss of admission taxes on ticket sales. The newspaper based its reporting on data obtained under the state’s Public Information Act.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNatick: A retired flight attendant pushing an airline beverage cart more than 200 miles from Boston to New York City to honor colleagues who died during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is well on his way. Paul Veneto, 62, resumed his 20th anniversary journey Monday after a night at the Verve Hotel in Natick, two days after starting his trek at Logan International Airport and a day after braving drenching rains from the Henri storm system. He plans on pushing the cart – decorated with photos of all the 9/11 airline crews for inspiration and courage – to ground zero by Sept. 10. “I look on top of this cart, I see these crew members’ faces, every time my legs hurt, it’s cold, rainy, they’re smiling back at me, the pain goes away,” Veneto said Saturday before he departed. The walk called Paulie’s Push will benefit the families of his former colleagues as well as Power Forward 25, a nonprofit that assists people dealing with addiction. Veneto himself is in recovery from an opioid dependency caused in part by the attacks. “I turned my life around to be able to recognize these guys who were never recognized,” he said Saturday. United Flight 175, which was flown into the World Trade Center’s south tower, was Veneto’s regular run. But he had the day off Sept. 11, 2001. The Braintree resident spent 30 years as a flight attendant for five different airlines.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Bloomfield Township woman who won the grand $2 million prize in the state’s COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes said Monday that she and her husband will save money for their three kids’ college education, remodel their house and donate a portion to improve mental health services. When the pandemic struck in 2020, Christine Duval left her full-time job as a project manager for a language training company in Troy to help her daughter, now 10, with remote learning after her school closed. She and her husband got their first COVID-19 shots in early April and their second ones weeks later. Their 18- and 15-year-old sons also are vaccinated. Winning $2 million “will help us achieve all of our dreams,” Duval said. “We are really lucky and want to give back to those in need. The pandemic was tough on everyone, and we believe the need for providing services that promote positive mental health care is more important than ever.” The MI Shot to Win Sweepstakes program was designed to boost the vaccination rate in July. The weekly number of people getting a first shot across the state rose for four straight weeks between July 11 and Aug. 7 before dropping in the past two weeks. About 65% of residents ages 16 and up have received at least one dose, federal data shows.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Igor Vovkovinskiy, the tallest man in the United States, has died at age 38. His family said the Ukrainian-born Vovkovinskiy died of heart disease Friday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. His mother, Svetlana Vovkovinska, an ICU nurse at Mayo, initially posted about his death on Facebook. Vovkovinskiy came to the Mayo Clinic in 1989 as a child seeking treatment. A tumor pressing against his pituitary gland caused it to secrete abnormal levels of growth hormone. He grew to become the tallest man in the U.S. at 7 feet, 8.33 inches and ended up staying in Rochester. His older brother, Oleh Ladan of Brooklyn Park, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that Vovkovinskiy was a celebrity when he arrived from Ukraine because of his size and the flickering Cold War of the late 1980s. But Ladan said Vovkovinskiy “would have rather lived a normal life than be known.” Vovkovinskiy appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and was called out by President Barack Obama during a campaign rally in 2009, when the president noticed him near the stage wearing a T-shirt that read: “World’s Biggest Obama Supporter.” In 2013, he carried the Ukrainian contestant onto the stage to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi Poison Control Center officials say they are receiving an influx of calls from people trying to treat COVID-19 by using anti-parasite medicine purchased at livestock stores. At least 70% of recent calls to the center have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers, Mississippi Department of Health officials said. Some of the symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurologic disorders, and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization, though no hospitalizations have been reported. Most callers – 85% – have had mild symptoms, according to the Department of Health. “Patients should be advised to not take any medications intended to treat animals and should be instructed to only take ivermectin as prescribed by their physician,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers wrote in a memo Friday. “Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans.” Ivermectin tablets are approved for human use at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical formulations for head lice and skin conditions. Ivermectin is not a drug for treating viruses.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Two groups that work to overturn wrongful convictions argued in a petition filed Monday that a man who has spent more than 20 years in prison for killing his mother did not commit the crime. Michael Politte was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2002. He was 14 when his mother, Rita Politte, was burned to death inside their home in Hopewell, eastern Missouri, in 1998. The Midwest Innocence Project and the MacArthur Justice Center argue in the petition filed with the Missouri Court of Appeals Western District that Politte was convicted because of a biased investigation, faulty science and an incompetent defense at trial. Michael Politte and a friend were sleeping when they awoke to smoke early Dec. 5, 1998. Michael told authorities he found his mother’s burning body in her bedroom as he and his friend tried to escape, according to the petition. She also suffered blunt force trauma to her head. The petition alleges fire investigators quickly decided the fire was started with gasoline, and police immediately zeroed in on her son as a suspect, although no blood or other injuries were found on him. Investigators also said he did not show much emotion or remorse in the following days. Law enforcement did not investigate other viable suspects, the attorneys say.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge has ordered the director of the state’s public defender office to appear before him next month to explain why her office is failing to assign public defenders to Billings-area cases in a timely manner and why she shouldn’t be held in contempt of court. District Judge Donald Harris set a Sept. 13 hearing for Rhonda Lindquist, The Billings Gazette reports. The director of the Office of Public Defender is required to ensure that qualified attorneys are immediately assigned after a judge assigns cases to the public defender’s office, according to Harris’ order, which was signed Tuesday. At times, public defenders have a conflict of interest in representing a defendant. When that happens, their case is assigned to the agency’s Conflict Office to hire an outside attorney. The managing attorney for the Conflict Office told Harris that as of July 31, his office had a backlog of 663 unassigned cases. State law requires the Office of Public Defender to immediately assign a lawyer to any case in which a judge designates the office as counsel. Harris said the office has not been able to meet this obligation for months, causing “significant delays in conducting court proceedings and jeopardizes the administration of justice.” The state’s jobs website lists postings for three public defenders and an appellate defender.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state currently appears relatively safe on some national websites tracking the spread of COVID-19, but state health officials say those maps aren’t accurate. The problem is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been using different data for Nebraska since the state retired its website that reported coronavirus figures daily and started reporting updates weekly with fewer details. So two-thirds of Nebraska’s counties shouldn’t be colored blue on the CDC map, indicating low COVID-19 transmission rates, at a time when cases are surging statewide, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “The color blue on the map may not be an accurate representation of transmission rates,” said Olga Dack, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Over the past two weeks, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has nearly doubled from 374.14 new cases per day Aug. 6 to 727.57 new cases per day Friday. In its most recent update, the state said Wednesday that 2,676 cases had been reported in the previous week – more than 10 times higher than the 253 cases per week the state reported in late June. Dack said the state continues to report county-level virus data to the CDC, but the agency hasn’t been using that for some technical reasons.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Several organizations led by women of color have banded together to shed light on the ways the state’s low-income and diverse communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution. The advocacy groups are creating a website, breathefreenv.com, that aims to raise awareness about climate change and steps that can be taken to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, and lower energy costs for families, especially in low-income communities. Erika Washington, executive director of Make It Work Nevada, one of the groups involved in the effort, told the Las Vegas Sun that Black communities have not received as much outreach about climate change or the environment as white communities. “It’s been very white-led for a very long time,” said Washington, who is Black. “You have to include the people who are closest to the issue in order to actually make any sort of change.” Along with Make It Work Nevada, other groups participating include Battle Born Progress, CHISPA, Make the Road Nevada, Mi Familia Vota Nevada, the Faith Organizing Alliance and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund. All seven groups are led by women of color.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Revenue has completed a three-year project aimed at providing a better online experience for taxpayers. The department, which collects more than $2 billion in taxes each year, launched the first phase of its online user portal and revenue management system in 2019. The final phase of the Granite Tax Connect portal was completed this month, allowing tax preparers and others to file taxes electronically, schedule automated payments, check on the status of refunds, and complete other tasks. Officials said the system could serve about 148,000 taxpayers. The portal also can be used to anonymously report suspected tax fraud.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state joined a small but growing list of places Monday to require COVID-19 vaccinations for teachers and state workers or for them to undergo regular coronavirus testing. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the new mandate during a news conference, saying pre-K-12 teachers and staff and state employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or get tested once or twice a week. New Jersey has about 130,000 public school teachers, 1.3 million public school students and an estimated 70,000 state workers. “Scientific data shows that vaccination and testing requirements, coupled with strong masking policies, are the best tools for keeping our schools and communities safe for in-person activities,” Murphy said. The Democratic governor, who’s running for reelection this year, announced the move just as schools across the state prepare to begin the new academic year. The decision follows an announcement earlier this month to require staff, students and visitors to wear masks on school grounds. The state’s biggest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, supported the order, as did the state’s School Nurses Association and the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The ritual burning of a giant, ghostly marionette in the city will be a hybrid event this year. Organizers of the Zozobra burning said they are planning to limit in-person attendance to 10,000 while also broadcasting the event on television and online. The nighttime spectacle that’s been transformed by modern pyrotechnics is in its 97th year. A team of a dozen puppeteers heaves on cords to flex the groaning marionette’s arms, head and jaw. Will Shuster, a painter from Philadelphia who migrated to the Southwest, created Zozobra, a name derived from a Spanish word for “anguish.” Donations from energy companies ensured the event could move forward Sept. 3. It typically happens around Santa Fe’s weeklong community fiestas that include historic and religious processions. Anyone attending in person must prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of the event. Face masks will be required for anyone who is not vaccinated. The Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe uses the event to raise money for youth charities. Organizers said they’ll tweak the event as needed to comply with federal and state public health orders.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Andrew Cuomo defended his record over a decade as governor and portrayed himself as the victim of a “media frenzy” Monday as he prepared for a midnight power transfer that will make Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul the state’s first female governor. Cuomo, a Democrat, was set to end his term at 11:59 p.m., just under two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face a likely impeachment battle over sexual harassment allegations. In a prerecorded farewell address released at noon, Cuomo boasted of making government effective in his years in office, cited his work battling the COVID-19 pandemic and struck a defiant tone on the harassment allegations. He said the report that triggered his resignation – a scathing account of what Attorney General Letitia James said was sexual harassment or inappropriate touching of 11 women – was “designed to be a political firecracker on an explosive topic, and it did work,” Cuomo said. He also touted his “progressive” record and positioned himself as a bulwark against his party’s left-wing faction that he said wants to “defund the police” and “demonize businesses.” He touted New York’s long-awaited passage of same-sex marriage under his administration, as well as gun control legislation and a law setting an eventual statewide $15 minimum wage.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of state residents who have been convicted of felonies but whose current punishments don’t include prison time can register to vote and cast ballots, a judicial panel declared Monday. Several civil rights groups and ex-offenders who sued legislative leaders and state officials in 2019 argue the current 1973 law is unconstitutional by denying the right to vote to people who have completed their active sentences or received no such sentence, such as people on probation. They said the rules disproportionately affect Black residents. In a brief hearing following a trial last week challenging North Carolina’s voting restrictions upon felons, Superior Court Judge Lisa Bell said two judges on the three-judge panel have agreed they will issue a formal order soon allowing more felony offenders to vote. The judges are acting before issuing a final ruling from the trial, as voting in October municipal elections begins next month. The law says felons can register to vote again once they complete all aspects of their sentence, including probation and parole. With Bell’s ruling, felons who only must complete these punishments that have no element of incarceration can register again.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A petroleum company has reported a saltwater spill in northwestern North Dakota to state regulators. The Bismarck Tribune reports Whiting Oil and Gas says the spill occurred Thursday. The company told regulators that a broken fitting in a pipeline system operated by Goodnight Midstream resulted in the spill at a well site 11 miles south of Stanley in Mountrail County. The company said 1,400 barrels containing 58,800 gallons of saltwater spilled but were contained, and most of the fluid has been recovered. Saltwater, also known as brine, can come up along with oil and gas from a well. The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division said a state inspector has visited the site and will monitor cleanup efforts.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: More than 120 activists, scholars, pastors, students and average citizens attended the first hearing Monday of a new panel charged with redrawing state legislative districts for the next 10 years, most advocating new maps that are more fair and representative. Witnesses at the first of nine public hearings of the Ohio Redistricting Commission at Cleveland State University maligned the current gerrymandered maps and called the process disheartening, embarrassing, demoralizing and unfair. “My vote doesn’t count,” Daisie Reish, 77, of Grafton, told the panel. “I call my representatives constantly, and they never vote for me. They always vote the opposite.” Person after person – young, old, Black, Muslim, immigrant, and people whose families have lived in the area for generations – told the panel they feel disadvantaged and unheard by their government as a result of the current district maps. Meanwhile, Tom Hach, executive director of Free Ohio Now, complained that all nine of the commission’s hearings will be held at universities, which he said don’t attract a diversity of political participation. He called the process unfair and said commissioners, the majority of whom are Republicans, were being bullied by Democrats. An Associated Press analysis has found Ohio to have some of the nation’s most gerrymandered maps.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Blocks from where she initiated one of the nation’s first sit-in movements, civil rights icon Clara Luper is now memorialized in the name of the city’s downtown post office. Luper’s descendants, former students and original “sit-inners” joined local dignitaries Saturday for the dedication of the Clara Luper Post Office Building, formerly called the Center City Station. Luper’s daughter, Chelle Luper Wilson, said her mother would want others to take it as a call to action against inequality. “One of the things I know she would say is she never wanted her name to just be a symbolic gesture,” Wilson said. “She was never about symbolism without any action. She was about structural and systemic change. I know she would want people whenever they see her name not to just think, ‘Oh great, what a great woman,’ but hope it sparks them to become passionate about a cause.” Luper, a longtime public school teacher, died in 2011 at age 88. The renaming coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the Oklahoma City sit-in movement. Luper and a group of Black schoolchildren arrived at the whites-only lunch counter of Katz Drug Store on Aug. 19, 1958, and refused to leave until they were served. It was the beginning of a successful six-year campaign to end racial segregation in Oklahoma City establishments.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Opposing rallies that drew hundreds of people sparked clashes Sunday. The two groups had gathered in different parts of the city after a far-right group changed the location of its event. The right-wing rally drew about 100 people in a parking lot of a former Kmart store, and clashes began as it wound down, KOIN-TV reports. A van tried to drive into the parking lot but crashed, and the driver ran away. Demonstrators then began igniting fireworks and similar devices. It was not immediately clear whether anyone suffered serious injuries. Later, shots were fired near demonstrators downtown. Dustin Brandon Ferreira, 37, a left-wing activist, told The Oregonian/OregonLive he was with others Sunday evening when a man used a slur against a Black man in the group and then fired multiple rounds in their direction. Portland police said the man was arrested. No one was injured. Demonstrations associated with anti-fascists had earlier drawn more than 200 people downtown. The plans for the opposing demonstrations had prompted Portland police to call in all available police personnel. Sunday’s event fell on the one-year anniversary of a particularly violent political clash in which opposing groups brawled on the street next to police headquarters for hours.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More drivers have been hitting the road as coronavirus restrictions have loosened, and it’s showing in the number of those who have been caught speeding through photo-enforced construction zones. The state has issued more than 220,000 violations in the first seven months of this year, surpassing the total for all of 2020, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Nearly $2.9 million has been collected in fines so far, higher than the $1.7 million remitted in 2020, said Jennifer Kuntch, a spokeswoman for PennDOT. Drivers receive a warning for the first offense, but second and subsequent violations carry a fine. Traffic volumes were down last year because of the pandemic, and that led to fewer violations than what might have been expected, Kuntch said. Meanwhile, the program remains on track to double its speed camera deployments this year. PennDOT is expecting to see a downward trend in violations through the rest of the year, Kuntch said. Based on evaluating Maryland’s trends and in having consistent deployments to the same work zones in Pennsylvania, drivers begin to comply with the speed limits, which leads to fewer violations, she said. In addition, drivers tend to watch their speed after getting their first warning.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public health officials are warning residents about a fake form circulating that purports to give the bearer a medical or religious exemption from coronavirus mask requirements. The certificate even includes a Rhode Island Department of Health logo, the agency said in a tweet Sunday. “It was not developed by RIDOH or any official source, should not be filled out, and should not/will not be accepted by any entity, as the form is not legitimate,” the department wrote in the tweet. The agency did not say where the fake certificate originated. The state has recently been restoring mask mandates for some indoor spaces in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant. Last week Gov. Daniel McKee issued an executive order requiring masks in K-12 schools for the upcoming school year regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Before the order, McKee had simply recommended masks for schoolchildren, leaving the final decision up to individual school districts. But state officials said more than a quarter of Rhode Island’s new coronavirus cases are among children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible for a vaccination against the disease.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Prosecutors are now required to share evidence of innocence they find even after a defendant is convicted of a crime. The changes to the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct were announced last week, The Post and Courier reports. South Carolina is joining about two dozen other states with the rules, which were first developed by the American Bar Association in 2008. They require a prosecutor to disclose any information when they become aware of “credible, material” evidence that indicates a defendant was wrongfully convicted to the defendant or defense attorney as well as the chief prosecutor where the person was tried. Prosecutors who have “clear and convincing” evidence that a person was wrongfully convicted in their jurisdiction then have an ethical obligation to remedy the conviction, according to the new rules. Prosecutors will have discretion to determine what exactly crosses the threshold of the new rules, said John Freeman, professor emeritus for the University of South Carolina School of Law. The rules also protect a defendant even after exhausting all normal appeals, Freeman said. “What this says, basically, is that so long as there is a possibility of proof surfacing that shows that the guy is innocent, it ain’t over,” he said. “And, frankly, isn’t that the way it should be?”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The state is facing a shortage of nurses at a time when they are needed most, officials say. South Dakota News Watch reports that stress, long hours and fear of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused more nurses than usual to leave the field, move to other states or retire early. From 2015 to 2016, about 1,700 registered nurses left South Dakota. Last year, more than 2,500 nurses dropped out of the state workforce. “The pandemic just kind of burned them out,” said Michelle Bruns, a spokeswoman for the nursing program at Oglala Lakota College. “It’s a tough situation.” The state’s higher education system has not produced enough nursing graduates to keep up with a growing population and rising demand for health care services, and educators are scrambling to find ways to lure more students and produce degrees more quickly. Meanwhile, a shortage of nurses in other states has raised competition to attract new graduates and experienced providers, but South Dakota health care systems are at a competitive disadvantage because median pay for nurses in the state is the lowest in the nation, according to federal labor data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The University of Tennessee announced Monday that it will extend its mask mandate to all indoor public spaces due to the ongoing spike in coronavirus cases and increasing hospitalizations. UT had been under a temporary mask mandate that only applied to classrooms, laboratories and indoor academic student events. Officials say the new requirement will extend to all indoor public spaces, but exceptions will include private offices, residence hall rooms and while engaging in fitness activities. According to a news release, the university will “re-evaluate the need for the expanded face-covering requirement by Sept. 7.” “While we are trying to do our part to keep our campuses healthy, we continue to stress the importance of getting the COVID-19 vaccine,” UT System President Randy Boyd said in a statement. As of Monday, Tennessee has seen 13,135 COVID-19-related deaths to date, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. That death count is the 15th highest in the country overall and the 24th highest per capita at 194 deaths per 100,000 people. The state is averaging 2,508.3 current COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to data through Aug. 20 from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Dell Medical School at the University of Texas is beginning a three-year study using video games and virtual reality to try to rewire the brains of teens with epilepsy. It’s taking the concept of neuroplasticity – that brains can create new pathways after an injury – and seeing if brains also can create the new pathways before the injury ever occurs. In this case, the injury is surgery to the affected area of the brain that is causing the epileptic seizures. The study is funded by a $2.5 million grant from the Coleman Fung Foundation. Fung is the founder of software company Open Link Financials Inc., and his Austin-based business venture, Blue Goji, is a wellness technology company that uses treadmills, virtual reality and video gaming to create a fitness experience. Dell Medical School will receive two Infinity treadmill virtual realty game systems from Blue Goji to use in the study. Dr. David Paydarfar, chair of Dell Medical School’s department of neurology and the study’s lead researcher, said that while people have studied neuroplasticity for decades, this study will actually implement the research. Previously, it was like studying rocket science without trying to go to the moon. The study is targeting 15- to 20-year-olds with epilepsy who need to have surgery to stop their seizures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A ban on school districts requiring masks is forcing parents of vulnerable kids to wrestle with the painful choice of whether to risk coronavirus infections at school or keep them at home yet again, according to a lawsuit filed Monday. Parents like Jessica Pyper say a Utah law that blocks districts from passing mandates wrongly prevents children from getting a safe education. She wants her 10-year-old son, Ryker, to join his fifth grade classmates this year, but his Type 1 diabetes puts him at serious risk. “It just sort of seems like nobody cares,” she said. “Kids with disabilities often get left behind. They don’t get considered when these types of decisions are being made.” The case filed by a group of nine parents is the latest U.S. lawsuit of its kind from families and educators concerned about school without masks as the highly contagious delta variant surges. Officials, mostly Republican, contend that there are downsides to kids being masked all day and that parents should have the power to decide whether to put them on children, who tend to be less vulnerable to the virus than older adults. The lawsuit was filed against Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, whose office didn’t immediately respond to messages requesting comment, and Republican Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who declined comment.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Agency of Commerce and Community Development has launched its latest relocation program to get workers to move to Vermont – especially cooks, servers, child care workers, registered nurses, construction laborers, delivery drivers, elementary school teachers and retail salespeople. The reimbursement grants are for up to $7,500 for “eligible expenses” after moving. The online application for the grants requires proof of residency and documentation of eligible expenses. Grants will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. In 2018, the Legislature created the remote worker grant program, which offered reimbursement grants of up to $10,000 for workers who could relocate to the state and bring their current job with them. The next year, in 2019, the Legislature created the worker relocation grant program, which offered reimbursement grants to move to the state and take a job. The two programs together have awarded more than 300 grants to “newly settled Vermonters” in towns across the state, according to a news release. The worker relocation program is available to those who relocate to Vermont on or after July 1, 2021, and fill one of the qualifying positions with a Vermont employer. Remote worker grants are for those who relocate on or after Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Monday urged all employers to require COVID-19 vaccines for eligible workers, sharpening a policy debate in the governor’s race over how best to deal with the pandemic. McAuliffe’s call followed a decision by federal regulators to give full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. The former governor now seeking a second term has previously urged Virginia health systems and school divisions to issue mandates and required his own campaign staff to be fully inoculated. McAuliffe is facing Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer, in the November general election. Youngkin has consistently urged Virginians to get COVID-19 shots but said he opposes vaccine or mask mandates. At a campaign event last week, the former co-CEO of the Carlyle Group was asked about his approach to managing the pandemic as the delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. “First of all, we pray it’s behind us every day,” he said. “My expectation is, this virus is tough. And so first thing that I would ask everybody to do is get the vaccine.” He said in a statement Monday that McAuliffe was trying to “bully” Virginians and businesses into compliance with a step that will “clearly evolve into closing down businesses and locking down Virginia again.”\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Authorities say they have found the first Asian giant hornet nest of 2021 in a rural area of the state, about a quarter-mile from where a resident reported seeing one of the hornets earlier this month. The Washington State Department of Agriculture narrowed the search area last week and located the nest east of Blaine, department officials said. Crews found the nest Thursday after they followed a hornet that was equipped with a tracking device, KOMO reports. Crews were able to net and tag three hornets between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. State entomologists will now develop a plan to eradicate the nest, most likely this week. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canadian border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: An annual festival that celebrates a local legend about a “Mothman” has been called off for the second straight year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers of the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant announced the festival’s cancellation Thursday. It had been set for next month. The organizers said in a statement that thousands of people pack the town along the Ohio River during the festival and that local health officials predict rising COVID-19 cases could peak around that time. “We are disappointed, but it was not an easy decision to make, we can assure you of that,” the statement said. Mothman is a mysterious creature with glowing red eyes that witnesses described seeing in 1966 and 1967. It was the subject of the 2002 film “The Mothman Prophecies.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Residents who get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine between Aug. 20 and Labor Day will receive a $100 gift card, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday. The reward being offered just as students return to school is Wisconsin’s latest incentive designed to entice those who have yet to be inoculated to receive the shots. As of Monday, just over 50% of the state’s entire population and 61% of adult residents were fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Many other states have offered similar programs to get more people vaccinated. Recently in Wisconsin, attendees at the state fair who got vaccinated received a free cream puff. More than 600 fairgoers took advantage of that promotion. The $100 Visa gift card will be available to anyone age 12 and up who gets their first shot during the 18-day eligibility window that closes Sept. 6. To receive the gift card, those being vaccinated will need to fill out an application form, available at 100.wisconsin.gov. The cards will be mailed up to six weeks later. Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths caused by the more contagious delta variant have spiked in Wisconsin and across the country in recent weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: The outdoor gear and clothing company Patagonia has stopped providing its merchandise for sale at a Wyoming ski resort to protest the owners’ sponsorship of a Republican fundraiser featuring Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other top supporters of former President Donald Trump. Well known for decades for its outspoken support of progressive causes and environmentalism, Patagonia in the past has brought unwanted attention to Facebook and Instagram and the Outdoor Retailer shows in Salt Lake City. Now, the company’s activism could spell trouble – among left-leaning skiers, at least – for Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. A major tourism destination in Wyoming, the resort known for its bright red gondola car and logo with a silhouetted bucking horse and rider is among the best-known brands from one of the most Republican states. “We join with the local community that is using its voice in protest. We will continue to use our business to advocate for stronger policies to protect our planet, end hate speech and support voting rights and a strong democracy,” Patagonia spokeswoman Corley Kenna said in a statement. The boycott, first reported by WyoFile, means Patagonia merchandise won’t be available in three shops at the resort that Kenna said were Patagonia’s largest account in Jackson Hole.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/03/rockefeller-christmas-snake-burglar-truman-library-news-around-states/49471921/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Republican Gov. Kay Ivey recognized Ashley M. Jones, the state’s first Black poet laureate, a creative writing teacher who delves into inequality and the difficulty of being Black in America, in the same building where Southern delegates voted to form the Confederacy 160 years ago. Standing in the white-domed Capitol, Ivey presented Jones with a commendation for the honor, bestowed earlier this year by the Alabama Writers Cooperative for a four-year term that begins in January. “Everyone in this room, and I would add folks around the country, are proud of you for being honored with this well-deserved, historic recognition,” Ivey told Jones during the ceremony. As poet laureate, Jones will advocate for poetry and writing in general during lectures and appearances at schools, libraries and other institutions. “I am committed to making space for all of us who write,” she said. Jones’ appointment is “pretty revolutionary,” said Jeanie Thompson, an author and executive director of the Alabama Writers Forum. “She brings a strong statement, but she brings a lot of balance,” said Thompson. “And so I think that she will have things to say that people will hear.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The remains of a man found on Fire Island just west of Anchorage in 1989 have been identified through DNA and genome sequencing, Alaska State Troopers said. Troopers said the victim was Michael Allison Beavers, who owned an excavation business in Chugiak. He was reported missing in 1980. The decadeslong investigation started when human remains were discovered July 24, 1989. An autopsy concluded it was a Caucasian male between the ages of 35 and 50, and evidence found on the remains indicated the death was criminal, troopers said. Officials said it appeared the remains had been on the beach for at least a year, but the date of death couldn’t be determined. A DNA profile entered into the national missing persons database in 2003 came back with no match. Earlier this year, the Alaska Bureau of Investigation Cold Case Investigation Unit reopened the case. Bone samples retained in the case were sent to a private lab, where DNA was extracted and genome sequencing was used to create a comprehensive DNA profile. Beavers’ spouse reported him missing two months after he was last seen alive, in November 1979. Beavers, 40, left his home in Chugiak to travel to Seattle by car to contact a business associate. He never arrived, troopers said. The investigation into his disappearance stalled and closed in 1982. Ten years later, he was declared dead. Troopers said the investigation into his death continues, and anyone with information about his disappearance and death should contact authorities.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A 25-foot-tall white pine installed in the state Capitol’s executive tower lobby was lit for the first time Wednesday by Gov. Doug Ducey during a celebration marking the start of the holiday season. The lighting of the Capitol tree is an annual tradition and brings together schoolchildren, state workers and the governor. This year’s celebration featured Christmas carols sung by students from Chandler High School’s choir, the Treblemakers. Last year’s tree lighting ceremony was forced to be held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic. Ducey cheered the return to an in-person ceremony, noting at the time of last year’s lighting, vaccines were not available and the state’s economy was just starting to revive from effects of the pandemic shutdowns.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court upheld the 20-year prison sentence for a former pathologist at an Arkansas veterans hospital who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death of a patient he misdiagnosed. The three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected arguments by Robert Levy’s attorneys that the sentence was unreasonable. Levy pleaded guilty to misdiagnosing a patient with small cell carcinoma who died after being treated for a type of cancer he didn’t have. Levy falsified the patient’s medical record to state that a second pathologist agreed with his diagnosis, according to a plea agreement. Levy was fired from the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville in April 2018. VA officials said in 2019 that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating to 2005.\n\nCalifornia\n\nRiverside: Police are looking for a man dubbed the “snake burglar” who wriggled his way through a Southern California business and fled with several thousands dollars. Surveillance video showed the man slithering on his belly at the Rustic Roots salon in Riverside at about 5 a.m. last Friday after apparently getting into the business through a rooftop fire escape. “It just gave me chills up my spine,” owner Lori Hajj told KNBC-TV. Hajj said the thief she called the “snake burglar” stole hundreds of dollars worth of products, cash from the register and a safe with more than $8,000 inside. A security guard who was installing a new alarm system at the salon told KNBC-TV that the crook had been trying successfully to avoid a motion sensor. The same man might have tried to burglarize other businesses previously, including a local pizza parlor where security video showed a man crawling on his belly, the station said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Rocky Mountain National Park will have a timed-entry permit system for the third straight season, pending approval from the National Park Service. The park is proposing the system for 2022 with minor tweaks to what was implemented in 2021. The third-most visited national park implemented the pilot system in 2020 to address visitor congestion and resource damage. The park’s timed-entry permit system has been polarizing, with some visitors enjoying less congestion and others complaining about the restrictions that curtail spontaneous trips. Through August, the last month for which visitation numbers were available, the park saw nearly 3.3 million visitors compared with 2.2 million during the same time in 2020. In 2019, the park saw nearly 4.7 million visitors over the entire year. Park spokesperson Kyle Patterson said the park is continually adjusting the system based on data it has collected to help balance visitor experience with resource protection.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Connecticut collected about $1.7 million during its first partial month of legalized online gambling and sports wagering, Gov. Ned Lamont said. The figures represent the state’s share of revenue collected Oct. 12-31. Roughly $1.2 million came from the state’s portion of online casino gambling revenue generated by the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribes, and approximately $513,000 came from sports betting revenue generated by the tribes and the Connecticut Lottery Corporation. The money will be deposited into the state’s general fund. Under the state’s new legalized system, Connecticut collects 13.75% of gross gambling revenue from sports wagering, and 18% from online casino gambling until 2026, when the rate increases to 20%. The state does not receive any payments on sports wagers placed at the southeastern Connecticut casinos owned by the two tribes, which currently have opened temporary sports book facilities.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Children can now visit inmates at Delaware correctional facilities for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, correction officials said. The Delaware Department of Correction announced in a news release Tuesday that in-person visits at all of its facilities have been expanded to include children and youth under 18. The department said it’s making the change as COVID-19 vaccination expands to include children and aggressive COVID-19 mitigation measures continue in the correctional system. Visiting children must be accompanied by an adult visitor and inmate visits are limited to either one adult or one adult and one child. The department said all in-person inmate visits must be scheduled in advance through the facility and all visits are subject to COVID-19 screening. Commissioner Monroe B. Hudson Jr. emphasized that video visitation is available in all Delaware prison facilities and was expanded early in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:When United flight 2701 from Chicago landed at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday afternoon, it became the first commercial flight to use 100% sustainable aviation fuel, WUSA-TV reported. It was an important milestone as the travel industry works to fight its contributions to climate change. “Today’s SAF flight is not only a significant milestone for efforts to decarbonize our industry, but when combined with the surge in commitments to produce and purchase alternative fuels, we’re demonstrating the scalable and impactful way companies can join together and play a role in addressing the biggest challenge of our lifetimes,” said United CEO Scott Kirby. The demonstration flight departed O’Hare Airport at 1 p.m. CST carrying 100 passengers, with an arrival time of 4 p.m. EST. The flight used 500 gallons of SAF -- a clean alternative to jet fuel -- in one engine and 500 gallons of jet fuel in the other. According to United, airlines are only allowed to use a maximum of 50% SAF on board, meaning past flights using SAF were a combination of the alternative fuel with conventional jet fuel. United Airlines has set a goal of being 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. To work towards this goal the company says it plans to buy 1.5 billion gallons of SAF; so far this year they’ve purchased more than 7 million gallons through the Eco-Skies Alliance program.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami is making face coverings optional for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated students whose parents sign opt-out paperwork. The archdiocese made the announcement Tuesday, citing community COVID-19 statistics and the advice of physician advisors, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Miami-Dade County Department of Health. The CDC recommends mask-wearing in public indoor settings, including schools, in areas of substantial or high community transmission. As of Wednesday, Florida was the only state in the nation where transmission was low in nearly every county, according to the CDC’s COVID-19 data tracker. Face masks were already optional for fully vaccinated students and teachers who provided vaccination cards to the school or were confirmed through the FL SHOTS database, the archdiocese said in a statement. Public schools in Miami-Dade and Broward counties allowed parents to opt their children out of wearing masks in early November. If the data trends negatively again, archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Ross Agosta said measures will be put back in place.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGrovetown:A nutrition manager at Cedar Ridge Elementary School has been arrested on charges of possession of methamphetamine found at the school, according to a press release from the Grovetown Department of Public Safety. At approximately 8:30 a.m., the department responded to the school where a small amount of methamphetamine was found in an employee restroom in the kitchen. After an investigation, the department believed it belonged to Kelley Nile, the nutritional manager. The Richmond County Sheriff’s Office K-9 Division responded to the campus and discovered an additional user amount of methamphetamine in the center console of Nile’s vehicle. Nile was arrested on charges of possession of schedule II narcotics and transported to the Columbia County Detention Center. The Columbia County School District said Nile is no longer employed by the school system. The school is in the process of notifying staff and parents about the situation.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii State Department of Health said a laboratory has detected petroleum product in a water sample from an elementary school near Pearl Harbor amid heightened concerns that fuel from a massive Navy storage facility could contaminate Oahu’s water supply. The department said the test result from a University of Hawaii lab is preliminary, and it’s not yet known what type of petroleum was in the water. The sample was taken Tuesday at Red Hill Elementary School. The department is still awaiting test results of samples sent to a lab in California. For three days, hundreds of residents in Navy housing complained of a fuel-like odor coming from their tap water. Some have said they suffered from stomach pain and headaches. The department said all complaints have come from people using the Navy’s water system, and not from anyone who gets their water from Honolulu’s municipal water utility. The Navy and the utility have wells that draw on the Moanalua-Waimalu aquifer, which is located 100 feet below the Navy’s fuel storage tanks at Red Hill. The Navy on Sunday shut down a Red Hill well that draws water from the aquifer out of an “abundance of caution,” a spokesperson said. The department has advised all those using the Navy’s water not to drink their tap water. It’s recommending that those who can smell fuel in their water not to use it for bathing, washing dishes or laundry. The system provides water to about 93,000 people living in and near Pearl Harbor.\n\nIdaho\n\nSugar City: State wildlife officials have euthanized three lion cubs in southeastern Idaho. Officials with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game captured and euthanized the cubs on Friday after they appeared in the backyards of homes in Sugar City. The cubs had been in the area for several days before being captured by wildlife officials. Idaho Department of Fish and Game spokesman James Brower told the East Idaho News that the mother was nowhere to be found, and the cubs were in poor health. It’s not known what happened to the mother. “We did a pretty thorough examination of these cubs, and they were fairly emaciated,” Brower said. “They were in really poor body condition, so they were not very healthy. There’s no rehabilitation center or place that you can take them to. They would have not made it on their own. They would have starved to death. They were pretty young.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city dropped its lawsuit against the police union in its fight over city employee COVID-19 vaccine orders, saying the complaint became unnecessary as more officers complied. The move follows a judge’s ruling last month to suspend an end-of-the-year city deadline for police officers to get vaccinated. Still, Mayor Lori Lightfoot vowed Wednesday that if union leaders revived talk of an “illegal work stoppage” over the mandate, the city would return to court. The city sued the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 7 in October, accusing President John Catanzara of encouraging an “illegal strike.” The city said those who didn’t comply with the vaccine mandate would be placed on “no-pay status.” In public statements and on social media, Catanzara encouraged police to disobey the order. The union also sued. Lightfoot and police leaders said the mandate was put in place to protect officers and the public. More than 460 law enforcement officers have died of COVID-19, including four in Chicago, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.\n\nIndiana\n\nLafayette:Six African penguins died at the Columbian Park Zoo after falling ill with avian malaria, zoo officials said. The zoo announced Tuesday that the penguins died despite around-the-clock care that included anti-malarial medications intended to halt their infections. Zoo Director Neil Dale said in a news release that the zoo’s three remaining African penguins were in critical condition after also contracting the illness, the Journal & Courier reported. Avian malaria is a parasitic disease caused by a “plasmodium” that’s transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitos, the zoo said. This disease only affects birds and is not transmissible to humans or other zoo animals. Dale said the first African penguin fell ill on Oct. 24 and despite the zoo veterinary team’s efforts, it died four days later. Five other penguins later died. The zoo’s Penguin Cove exhibit opened at the zoo in July after being pushed back several times because of the COIVD-19 pandemic. Dale said the zoo is working with the exhibit’s design team and continuing to consult experts for preventative measures that would help ward off exposures to the illness.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Former television news anchor Tiffany O’Donnell has been elected mayor of Cedar Rapids. O’Donnell garnered 68% of the vote to businesswoman Amara Andrews’ 32% in Tuesday’s runoff election. The runoff was triggered when no candidate reached a majority 50% of the vote in the Nov. 2 general election. O’Donnell, a former news anchor for television station KGAN and chief executive of Iowa-based women’s leadership group Women Lead Change, campaigned on finishing cleanup from last year’s derecho, fixing city streets and accelerating flood recovery. O’Donnell will take office in January at the end of incumbent Mayor Brad Hart’s term.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A lawsuit filed against a Wichita car dealership by the wife of a police officer injured when he was run over by a sport utility vehicle from the business has been settled for an undisclosed amount. Officer Brian Arterburn was critically injured in February 2017 when he was hit by an SUV driver while putting down stop sticks to stop the vehicle as police chased it. Arterburn’s wife, fellow Wichita police officer Claudale Arterburn, sued Eddy’s Chevrolet Cadillac, its owners and the driver of the SUV, Justin Terrazas. The dealership has said that the vehicle was stolen and that it has “no clear understanding” of how Terrazas came to have it in his possession, the Wichita Eagle reported. But the lawsuit alleged Eddy’s Chevrolet Cadillac gave Terrazas access to the vehicle and did not report the car was stolen for two months before the chase, despite being told it was being used for criminal activity. Terrazas pleaded guilty to charges in the case and was sentenced to nearly 29 years in prison. The lawsuit, which had sought $75 million in actual and punitive damages, had been set to go to trial before the settlement was announced Tuesday.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Gov. Andy Beshear said he will propose devoting $10 million to support an expansion of Waterfront Park into western Louisville. The 22-acre park expansion will connect downtown and West Louisville along the Ohio River in the state’s largest city, officials said. The total cost of the expansion is $50 million. “For so many people in this city, Waterfront Park is not just a place, it’s an experience,” Beshear said. “It’s the backdrop for some of their happiest moments with family and friends. It’s time that this experience is accessible to all members of the Louisville community.” Beshear will submit his budget proposals to the legislature early next year. The park expansion site will be in the Portland neighborhood within West Louisville. The expansion will include plazas, gardens and an observation pier at the river’s edge that can accommodate events, performances and other gatherings.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:In two short weeks, Miss Louisiana, Julia Claire Williams, will compete on the national stage for the title of Miss America. “I really am most looking forward to visiting with all of the state title holders,” Williams said. “They’re such kind, strong, compassionate, impactful, young women, and to stand amongst them to compete for this job is such an honor.” The competition, which takes place Dec. 16 at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. The centennial Miss America competition was set to take place last year, but it was canceled because of the pandemic. Williams works as an emergency room scribe for St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe. She is a graduate of University of Louisiana Monroe and hails from Kinder in the southwest part of the state. Williams said she has enjoyed fulfilling the role of Miss Louisiana, including her social impact initiative, which focuses on serving disadvantaged and disabled youth. Although there isn’t one specific facet she has enjoyed more than the others, she said the job has helped her grow as a person. Through her experience, Williams said she has increased her public speaking skills and grown in her adaptability.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunk: The federal government is providing a small meat processor in Maine with $200,000 to help rebuild from a devastating fire last year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is giving the money to Nest & Mullen LLC of Kennebunk, Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree said Tuesday. The fire destroyed a processing plant in September 2020. The grant will help the business recover and rebuild, Pingree said. She said the fire “not only destroyed their plant, but it shook the foundation of their entire business and threatened their livelihood.” Nest & Mullen is a five-generation farm and butcher shop, Pingree said. The money is through USDA’s Meat and Poultry Inspection Readiness Grant program. The agency announced $32 million in grants to dozens of processing facilities earlier in the week.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan outlined preparation plans in the state for the omicron variant of COVID-19, urging people to get vaccinated and to get a booster shot if enough time has gone by since they have been vaccinated. The governor spoke at a news conference not long after after the White House announced that a person in California who had been vaccinated against COVID-19 became the first in the U.S. to have an identified case of the omicron variant. The state’s Board of Public Works approved an emergency procurement Wednesday to acquire additional special reagents and supplies to further expand the state’s capacity to track and detect variants of the coronavirus. The board also voted to extend the state’s genomic sequencing agreements to track various mutations of the coronavirus with the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University. Through agreements with the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University, Maryland is now sequencing at nearly three times the level recommended by public health experts, the governor’s office said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts is deploying three mobile units to administer monoclonal antibody treatment to high-risk individuals who have been exposed to or have COVID-19, Gov. Charlie Baker said. The clinics have the capacity to treat up to 500 patients a week with therapies that can help reduce the severity of the disease and keep COVID-19-positive individuals from being hospitalized. Two of the new mobile units – currently in Fall River and Holyoke – began administering monoclonal antibody treatment to patients last week, according to the administration. A third unit is set to be deployed to Everett on Friday. The mobile clinics will increase access to monoclonal antibody treatment in Massachusetts, according to Baker. The mobile clinics can be relocated based on demand. Referral from a health care provider is required for treatment at any of the three new mobile clinics. Treatment will be provided at no cost to the patient and offered regardless of immigration status or health insurance. Patients should talk to their doctor about whether monoclonal antibody treatment is right for them.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: An 11-year-old girl who survived a plane crash that killed her father and three other people was released Wednesday from a rehabilitation hospital. “She’s Laney, she’s great and she’s our miracle,” said Christie Perdue of Gaylord, referring to her daughter Laney. Laney was one of five people in a plane that crashed on Beaver Island off Michigan’s northern Lower Peninsula on Nov. 13. The family believes Laney survived because her father, Mike, shielded her during the crash. Laney was released from Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids. “We’ve gone from no walking to a wheelchair to a walker and now to crutches,” Christie Perdue told WOOD-TV. “Her goal was to go home on crutches.” Mike Perdue died, along with the pilot and a couple. The crash is being investigated by a federal transportation agency. “Our community has just surrounded us with love,” Christie Perdue said. “Laney’s getting letters from schools all over Michigan, letters from New York and Minnesota, and we are just so grateful.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Department of Health said it’s not approving anxiety disorders as a qualifying condition for medical marijuana, unlike neighboring North Dakota and three other states. State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said there’s not enough scientific evidence of benefits of medical cannabis use when compared to the possibility of “unintended consequences.” No new conditions will be added to the existing list of 17 qualifying health issues. “We received many comments from health care practitioners treating patients with anxiety disorder, and they urged us to not approve it as a qualifying medical condition,” Malcolm said. North Dakota added anxiety disorders to its accepted uses two years ago, when it immediately became the most commonly cited condition. Minnesota did agree to add infused edibles in the form of gummies and chews to a list of approved products that includes pills, vapor oil, liquids, topicals, powdered mixtures, and orally dissolvable medicines like lozenges. “Expanding delivery methods to gummies and chews will mean more options for patients who cannot tolerate current available forms of medical cannabis,” Malcolm said.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A downtown Tupelo neighborhood has joined the National Register of Historic Places. Advocates learned about the designation in late September, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported. The largely residential area includes hundreds of parcels on about 163 acres of land. Chris Grimes, vice president of the Historic Downtown Neighborhood Association, helped organize the effort. Grimes owns a historic home in the newly designated neighborhood that dates to 1870 and will now be able to apply for tax credits for some of the restoration work that’s underway, the Daily Journal reported. He had initially sought National Register designation only for his home, but the Mississippi Department of Archives & History thought other homes should be included, according to the newspaper. Downtown Tupelo and other neighborhoods in the city already have the designation. “Believe it or not, it’s easier to get a neighborhood on the register than it is to get an individual home,” Grimes said. Mississippi has more than 1,300 listings in the register, the nation’s official list of sites, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their significance.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence:The Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum was scheduled to reopen with limited hours Thursday. The museum will initially reopen on Thursdays through Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. for those who bought advance tickets online. Visitors will be required to wear masks. The museum reopened in July after a two-year renovation project but was closed again in October when COVID-19 cases began to increase in Jackson County. “The pandemic has presented a lot of challenges, but we are prepared and anxious to open our doors to make history come to life for our visitors,” museum Director Kurt Graham said. The nearly $30 million renovation was the most extensive project at the museum since it was built in 1957. It offers more exhibits and artifacts, along with interactive exhibits, and a new layout that walks visitors through Truman’s life from his Missouri childhood through his presidency and his later years.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Wildlife workers and volunteers scrambled Wednesday to save trout and other fish stranded by an abrupt drop in water levels on a river that’s renowned among anglers. A malfunctioning gate that lets water out of Hebgen Dam just west of Yellowstone National Park caused flows into the Madison River to plummet early Tuesday, according to dam operator NorthWestern Energy. That left side channels cut off from the main river and some areas with no water. Some fish have died, according to outfitters who provided photos of fish lying on exposed rock beds that normally would be covered with water. More fish are at risk in the cut-off side channels, fly fishing shop owner Kelly Galloup said. Galloup said bigger trout likely moved to deeper pools as water levels dropped. But he expected a significant impact on fish born last year that were too small to escape the sudden drop in flows. There was no immediate estimate of the number of fish stranded, but Galloup said hundreds had been rescued Tuesday.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of people hospitalized in Nebraska with the coronavirus continues to climb and reached 555 on Tuesday, which was the highest since last winter. The state said 14% of the hospitalized patients were between the ages of 20 and 44, and doctors at several of Nebraska’s largest hospitals said younger patients have been showing up in intensive care units more often. Although the number of hospitalizations remains well below last fall’s peak of 987, the state’s hospital capacity is strained because hospitals were busy with other patients before COVID-19 cases increased this fall. The state said only 13% of the adult ICU beds and 20% of the pediatric ICU beds were available Tuesday. Dr. Matthew Donahue, the acting state epidemiologist, said unvaccinated Nebraskans are 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than people who have been vaccinated. He said the spread of the coronavirus’ highly contagious delta variant has fueled the rise in cases. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska decreased over the past two weeks, going from about 864 per day on Nov. 15 to about 771 per day on Monday. But the number remains high.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A union for drivers and the operator of metro Reno’s transit bus system said they have reached a tentative agreement to settle a contract dispute that dramatically reduced service during the past three weeks. Officials of Teamsters Local 533 and Keolis International said Tuesday normal service would resume immediately if the agreement is approved by a vote of represented employees later this week. Terms of the proposed settlement were not immediately available. Only a handful of routes ran during the strike, leaving thousands of riders without public transportation. Teamsters 533 President Gary Watson said some issues between the union and Keolis remained unresolved but that union officials were hopeful that those can be resolved in the coming months. Keolis Vice President Mike Ake said the tentative agreement resulted from productive negotiation sessions held over the weekend. The strike began Nov. 9 after the union rejected the “best and last offer” proposed by Keolis, which operates the system for the Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nExeter:The 23rd annual Festival of Trees benefitting the Community Children’s Fund kicked off in-person Wednesday morning at the Town Hall after a fully virtual event last year. The event was spread out over two days in an effort to manage the number of visitors. Bidding on the 51 Christmas trees donated and decorated by local businesses was done online. Organizers said they were elated to be able to restart the event in-person at the Town Hall after a year marred by the pandemic. The Christmas trees, all donated by Ace Hardware, feature a variety of goodies for the lucky winners ranging from candy to Guinness beer. Foss Motors has a double donation tree where the dealership will match the buyer’s bid up to $2,000 to be donated to a charity of the buyer’s choosing. And, as always, there is the gift card tree, which features gift certificates from local businesses totaling $2,800.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Republican lawmakers scorned statehouse rules requiring proof of either COVID-19 vaccination or a negative test to enter the building and sought to halt the mandate with a lawsuit. Assembly and Senate Republicans, who are in the minority, sued late Wednesday seeking to stop the requirement and set the stage for a confrontation with law enforcement officials. That’s because both chambers have scheduled votes for the afternoon, when legislators are expected to gather to cast their votes. GOP Assembly member Brian Bergen walked into the statehouse complex unstopped by officials and didn’t show proof required under the policy set by the State Capitol Joint Management Commission, the panel made up of administration and legislative officials that sets rules for the building. “It’s unfair and completely discriminatory policy. they’re essentially creating two classes of people, vaccinated and unvaccinated,” he said in an interview. Legislators who don’t follow the protocol won’t be permitted into the legislative chambers, according to Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin’s spokesperson Kevin McArdle, who added that leaders have spoken with state police and the attorney general’s office.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she will pursue a 7% pay increase for educators and staff at K-12 public schools, as well as higher minimum salaries for teachers at various career stages. The proposal would boost salaries for more than 50,000 public school workers across the state at an annual cost of about $280 million. The Legislature convenes in January to craft a general fund spending plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1. The governor’s office estimated the proposed changes would increase the statewide average for teacher pay to just over $64,000 a year. New Mexico’s minimum teacher salaries would increase to between $50,000 and $70,000, depending on experience and certifications. Current minimums ranging from $41,000 to $60,000 were set in 2019. The proposed changes would bring New Mexico roughly in line with the recent national average for teacher pay of about $64,000.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The holly, jolly, best time of the year got a light-filled launch Wednesday, when the towering Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center was officially turned on. The 79-foot Norway spruce, covered with more than 50,000 lights in a rainbow of colors and bearing a crystal-covered, 900-pound star, was lit in a midtown Manhattan ceremony again open to the public, in contrast with last year’s virus-impacted event. The lighting was televised on NBC and hosted by NBC “Today” anchors Al Roker, Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Craig Melvin. Among the musical performances were Harry Connick Jr., Norah Jones, Brad Paisley and Alessia Cara. The high-kicking Radio City Rockettes were also part of the celebration. This year’s tree came from Elkton, Maryland, where it stood for more than 80 years outside a family home. The first Christmas tree was placed in Rockefeller Center by men working there in 1931.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed legislation that would bar officials from counting mail-in absentee ballots received after Election Day, even if their envelopes were postmarked on or before that date. Cooper’s veto was expected, given that Republicans pushed through the measure on party lines. Any GOP attempt to override his veto also is likely to fail given that Republicans majorities in both the House and Senate aren’t veto-proof. Republicans haven’t overturned any of Cooper’s previous 12 vetoes this year. Current law says envelopes postmarked by the day of the primary or general election can count if they are received within a three-day grace period. Republicans insist the bill would boost confidence in election outcomes by the public and help the media call results more quickly.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck:Gov. Doug Burgum said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has granted his request for another extension of the hours of service waiver for drivers of commercial vehicles transporting water and livestock feed to help North Dakota livestock producers affected by continuing drought conditions. Burgum first granted a similar 30-day waiver in an executive order Sept. 22, and the FMCSA previously extended the waiver through Nov. 23. Under the new extension, the waiver will remain in effect through Dec. 24 or until the end of the emergency, whichever is earlier. Thursday’s U.S. Drought Monitor report showed 9% of North Dakota remains in extreme drought, mostly in the northwest corner, 33% is in severe drought, 30% is in moderate drought and 21% is rated as abnormally dry.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:The Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund is asking lawmakers to boost the required employer contribution rates to the retirement system. The fund is backing legislation that would increase employer contribution rates to 26.5% of payroll for police and firefighters, up from 19.5% and 24%, respectively. An estimate for how much that would cost Ohio’s 900 local police and fire departments was not immediately available. “I think that the employers, mayors, etc, understand the essential nature of recruiting and retaining public safety officers – not just through COVID but we’ve had a lot of social unrest,” said fund Director Mary Beth Foley. “So we need them and they need a defined benefit plan that they can rely upon, they need disability benefits to be ensured.” The employer contribution was last increased in 1986. Foley said the goal is to move legislation, which has yet to be introduced, through the House and Senate by December 2022. Over the past eight years, employee contribution rates increased by 2.25% to 12.25% and retirees have been forced to pay more for health care benefits.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A human skull found in southwestern Oklahoma 16 years ago has been identified as that of a missing Muskogee woman, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said. The skull is that of Rebecca Jean Boyd, who was 29 when she disappeared in 2002, the OSBI said. The skull, found in a field by a farmer in Kiowa County in July 2005, was known only as Kiowa Jane Doe. “We are happy that Rebecca’s family has her back and can give her the proper burial that she deserves,” said OSBI Director Ricky Adams. “Now our Cold Case Unit is going to determine how she ended up in that field and who is responsible.” No other remains have been found and a suspected cause of death has not been determined, according to OSBI spokeswoman Brook Arbeitman. “We have a lot of questions that need to be answered,” Arbeitman said. “The first step was to get her identified.” Arbeitman said Boyd was visiting relatives in Lawton when she was last seen on July 26, 2002. Boyd was reported missing four days later and was identified when the skull matched a DNA profile of Boyd that had been entered into a national missing persons database.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A Canadian energy company canceled a controversial natural gas pipeline and marine export terminal on the southern Oregon coast after failing to obtain all necessary state permits. Opponents of the Jordan Cove project, which would have created the first liquefied natural gas export terminal on the West Coast in the lower 48 states, rejoiced at the news. The marine export terminal would have been located at Coos Bay, with a 230-mile feeder pipeline crossing southern Oregon. Many landowners, Indian tribes and environmentalists had objected, saying the project by Calgary-based Pembina Pipeline Corp. could spoil the environment and would have contributed to global warming by producing greenhouse gases. In 2019, protesters filled the Oregon State Capitol and occupied the governor’s office until they were hauled away by state police. Supporters of the project to ship U.S. and Canadian natural gas to Asia said it would create jobs and help the economy. The Coos Bay City Council last year approved dredging part of the bay to increase the width and depth of the shipping channel. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the project in March 2020. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown threatened to go to court to stop the project if it didn’t obtain every permit required from state and local agencies. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality denied a water quality certification for the project, and the Department of State Lands refused to grant another extension to Pembina to file documents in its application for a permit to dredge sediment out of Coos Bay.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: TV stations in Philadelphia, New York City and Cleveland said they are taking down the “Dr. Oz Show,” now that the show’s host, Mehmet Oz, has formally become a candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. The stations were compelled by the Federal Communications Commission’s “equal time” rules that give rival candidates the ability to request matching air time. Oz, 61, will bring his unrivaled name recognition and wealth to a wide-open race that is expected to be among the nation’s most competitive and could determine control of the Senate in next year’s election. This is the celebrity heart surgeon’s first run for public office, but he is facing a crowded Republican primary. The longtime New Jersey resident said he moved to Pennsylvania a year ago.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: An animal shelter has tripled the reward it is offering to $15,500 for help identifying the people who abandoned two dogs found by the side of a road in Portsmouth on Thanksgiving morning. The Potter League for Animals is offering the reward for information about the people who left the two female dogs, WPRI-TV reported. Police said the dogs appeared to be “lethargic and emaciated,” when they were found near a sports complex. They were treated by an emergency veterinarian. One of the dogs had to be euthanized because of her poor health, police said. The animal shelter initially offered a $5,000 reward but contributions from anonymous donors increased the amount of the reward, the station reported. Anyone with information can call Portsmouth police.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Laura Cantral, the executive director of the Coastal Conservation League, one of South Carolina’s most influential environmental groups, is stepping down, prompting a nationwide search for her replacement. Cantral is leaving at the end of December, the organization said in a Wednesday news release. Cantral took over the organization four years ago after the Conservation League’s founder and longtime leader Dana Beach stepped down. The group has worked to oppose offshore drilling, preserve fragile coastal ecosystems against development and advocate to protect other natural resources along the state’s coast. The organization said Cantral is departing for personal family reasons and will move to Atlanta next year. The group’s board of directors will begin searching for a replacement in the coming weeks.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWagner:Wagner High School principal and activities director Neil Goster, who was accused of making racist comments toward Native Americans last summer, resigned more than two weeks ago, along with his wife, Cindy, who was a fourth-grade teacher. In a special school board meeting in Wagner two weeks ago, the Goters’ resignations from the Wagner Community School District were accepted by the board in a 5-0 vote. Two board members were absent at the time of the vote. Local residents called on Neil Goter to resign in July and August after LaJuanda Stands and Looks Back alleged in a formal letter that Goter made racist comments to her and other Indigenous people in the town on the Yankton Sioux Reservation. Stands and Looks Back alleged that on July 24, Goter told her and a group of Native American women at a golf course that “my face is so red, I must be Native American.” She was told administrative action was taken by the district after her allegations, but it’s unknown what action was made. According to the Department of Education’s Teacher 411 webpage, Neil and Cindy Goter’s teaching certificates are still active until July 2026. Superintendent Matt Yost would not comment on the story when reached by the Argus Leader. Attempts to reach both Neil and Cindy Goter at their listed phone numbers and email addresses were unsuccessful.\n\nTennessee\n\nSewanee: Reuben Brigety, the University of the South’s vice chancellor and president, said he will resign later this month and would accept a position as U.S. ambassador to South Africa if offered. In a letter Wednesday, Brigety said he decided to leave the post Dec. 21. He wrote that he would accept a nomination for the ambassador job if President Joe Biden nominates him, saying news reports have indicated Biden intends to do so. Brigety, a former U.S. ambassador to the African Union, said “it would be unfair to prolong any uncertainty at the University.” The White House has not yet announced a nomination. Additionally, the role requires Senate confirmation. “I have been profoundly honored to serve as the 17th vice-chancellor of the University of the South, and I had expected to serve Sewanee for a long time to come,” Brigety wrote. “Yet I also know that I would not decline my obligation to serve my country if asked by the president of the United States.” Brigety took office in June 2020 as the first African American vice chancellor at the university also known as Sewanee. He previously served as dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An appeals court halted a federal judge’s order that stopped Texas from enforcing its ban on mask mandates in the state’s schools, allowing the prohibition to remain in effect. In a 15-page ruling, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans granted a request by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to stay the ruling by U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel. The appeals court on Nov. 24 had granted an administrative stay while it issued a formal ruling on Paxton’s request. The 5th Circuit’s ruling on Wednesday means Yeakel’s decision will be on hold while the case goes through the appeals process. The appeals court will ultimately issue a final ruling on his order. The federal judge ruled on Nov. 10 that the ban ordered by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott through an executive order violated a federal law protecting disabled students’ access to public education. The nonprofit advocacy group Disability Rights Texas, which had filed the lawsuit that prompted Yeakel’s ruling, argued Abbott’s ban prohibited accommodations for disabled children particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. In granting the stay, the appeals court said that Paxton would likely win in his appeal, the students represented by Disability Rights Texas likely do not have standing to challenge the ban and the students and the group had not exhausted all remedies under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a federal law that makes available a free public education to eligible U.S. children with disabilities.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Nate Brooksby was selected as the Washington County sheriff after the local Republican Party gathered in a special election to decide who would replace Sheriff Cory Pulsipher, who retired because of health problems. Brooksby, who had been the department’s chief deputy, beat out Jared Redfearn with 106 out of 140 votes. The position opened outside of the regular election cycle after Pulsipher announced he would be retiring effective Wednesday. This isn’t the only change in the department leadership, as Undersheriff James Standley also retired this fall. After Standley left the department, Brooksby was appointed to replace him as undersheriff by Pulsipher so Brooksby would be “brought up to speed” on the department’s budget and projects, according to a press release.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: More than 300 Vermont National Guard soldiers are beginning to return to the state, many after nearly a year deployed overseas. The first of the soldiers returned on Wednesday. All are scheduled to be home by Dec. 10. The 172nd Law Enforcement Detachment deployed in January 2021 to support the U.S. Europe Command. Soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the 172nd Infantry (Mountain) departed in February for the U.S. Central Command. The two units were the first of several to deploy throughout the first half of 2021, with a total of more than 950 Vermonters deploying to various locations across Europe, Africa and Southwest Asia. The soldiers of the the law enforcement detachment operated as the primary law enforcement element on Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base in Romania. The soldiers from the 3rd Battalion participated in a variety of missions, including assisting with security at the Kabul during the August evacuations from Afghanistan.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia has launched a new system to improve the response to mental health emergencies. The Marcus Alert system launched Wednesday in five regions in the state, news outlets reported. The system is named for Marcus-David Peters, who was fatally shot in 2018 by police after he charged an officer amid a behavioral health crisis. It will start as a pilot program in Richmond, Virginia Beach, Prince William County, Bristol and adjacent Washington County, and five counties in the northern Piedmont. It must expand to all parts of the state by July 1, 2026. It’s part of a rollout of new services financed by Virginia’s Medicaid program to help people in behavioral crises in their communities to avoid sending them to state mental hospitals, private emergency rooms and juvenile detention centers. The system aims to use regional call centers to alert mental health teams to potential psychiatric emergencies, quickly assess risks and dispatch professionals to help the person in crisis by persuasion instead of force.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Republican state Sen. Keith Wagoner said he plans to challenge newly appointed Democratic Secretary of State Steve Hobbs in next year’s election. Hobbs was sworn into office Nov. 22 following his appointment by Gov. Jay Inslee to replace Kim Wyman, a Republican. Wyman – the fifth consecutive GOP secretary of state in Washington dating to 1965 – resigned to take a key election security job in the Biden administration. Wagoner said voters have long shown a preference for a Republican secretary of state and Inslee failed to recognize that by naming Hobbs, who was a Democratic state senator since 2007. Hobbs’ appointment lasts until the November 2022 election, which will determine who serves the remaining two years of Wyman’s four-year term. Hobbs said he plans to enter that race.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Union maintenance and service workers at Cabell Huntington Hospital ratified a contract late Wednesday to end a month-old strike, the hospital announced. Members of the Service Employees International Union District 119 ratified the three-year contract covering more than 900 workers at the hospital, which said in a statement that employees could likely begin returning to work as soon as Friday. The statement did not disclose details of the contract, which Dr. Kevin Yingling, the hospital’s president, called “fair and equitable.” Under an earlier offer, the hospital had asked union members to begin paying health insurance premiums. “We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said hospital Chief Operating Officer Tim Martin. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:FPC Live, a division of Madison-based Frank Productions and one of the world's largest concert promoters, announced plans to operate a built-from-scratch music venue in the Historic Third Ward, adjacent to the southern end of Maier Festival Park. Actually, it would be two venues – an 800-person-capacity room and a 4,000-person- capacity room – with separate entrances, both housed in the same 108,000-square-foot facility. Pending approvals, including from the Historic Third Ward Architectural Review Board and the City of Milwaukee Board of Harbor Commissioners, construction on the venue could begin in early 2022 and would open in the second half of 2023. The new concert venue would be the latest in Milwaukee's entertainment-building boom. The Milwaukee Bucks' Fiserv Forum, constructed for $524 million, opened in 2018. This year saw the openings of the Bradley Symphony Center, following a $90 million renovation of the Warner Grand Theatre, and the reopening of Summerfest's American Family Insurance Amphitheater after a $51.3 million upgrade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon made state District Court judge John G. Fenn his first appointment to the state Supreme Court. Fenn has served on the Fourth Judicial District bench for Johnson and Sheridan counties since 2007. He previously was an attorney in private practice in Sheridan for 13 years. Fenn’s experience as a judge has earned him respect in Wyoming’s legal community, Gordon said in a statement Thursday. “He has shown himself to be keenly aware of the impact of Wyoming Supreme Court decisions, not only on the law, but also with particular attention to the consequences for the individuals involved in these cases,” Gordon said. Fenn replaces Justice Michael Davis, who is retiring, and will begin on the state high court on Jan. 17. Fenn is a graduate of Big Piney High School and holds undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Wyoming. He helped develop Wyoming’s new Chancery Court created by legislation signed by Gordon in 2019, according to the governor’s office.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/03"}]}

He said it's unclear when the two world leaders could meet next, adding that the current diplomatic standoff had created an \"untenable pause\" in U.S.-Russia relations.\n\nLast week, Trump canceled a high-stakes meeting with Putin that had been scheduled to take place when both men were in Argentina to attend the G-20 summit of world leaders. Trump said he nixed that tête-à-tête because of Russia's seizure of three Ukrainian vessels and crewmembers.\n\nBut Trump's decision came just hours after his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, admitted lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower development in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign. Cohen's admission was part of a plea agreement with special counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing Russia's efforts to tilt that election in Trump's favor.\n\nA White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Peskov's remarks. The White House invited Putin to meet with Trump in Washington last summer, after their controversial summit in Helsinki.\n\nTrump earned widespread condemnation after that closed-door meeting because he seemed to defer to Putin and to downplay U.S. intelligence conclusions that Russia interfered with the U.S. election. The chorus of criticism grew even louder after the White House issued its invitation to Putin to come to Washington.\n\nBut no one is talking about that possibility now \"because now general prospects for their next meeting are unclear,\" Peskov said.

Roughly a dozen of Donald Trump’s senior campaign officials and top Republican surrogates swarmed the spin room floor to gloat to reporters about the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent's stumbles.\n\nNowhere to be seen: Susie Wiles.\n\nAmong the most powerful figures in national politics, Wiles has helped lead Trump’s political operation for three years and now is co-piloting a presidential campaign that's in as strong a position as it ever could have expected to deliver the controversial former president back to the White House.\n\nYet Wiles, 66, remains a somewhat mysterious figure, rarely front and center on the campaign trail or heard from in public other than through campaign memos co-signed by Trump’s other top campaign aide.\n\n\"She hates the limelight,\" said John Delaney, who employed Wiles when he was the Republican mayor of Jacksonville and is a longtime friend.\n\nWiles traveled to Atlanta for the debate, flying to the event with Trump. She stayed with the former president as other campaign aides, surrogates and several vice presidential contenders raced toward the bright lights of the media.\n\nAvoiding attention is a Wiles specialty. The mild-mannered daughter of a professional football legend is careful not to draw eyes to herself, which may be one of the biggest reasons she has stayed in this particular job longer than any other top Trump campaign leader, many of whom had big personalities that contributed to their downfalls.\n\nWiles prefers to work behind the scenes, like when she lined up a series of congressional endorsements for Trump in Florida early in 2023 before Gov. Ron DeSantis had even entered the Republican primary, laying the groundwork to humiliate DeSantis by getting his home state lawmakers to reject him.\n\nHer methodical approach to the endorsement power play highlights a trait that makes her extremely effective as a leading force in Trump’s 2024 campaign, allies say. Highly organized, Wiles has brought an unprecedented level of order and professionalism to a Trump political operation that often has been in disarray through two White House campaigns and a chaotic presidential term, according to multiple sources close to the campaign. And while those who know Wiles describe her as friendly and low-key, her effort to kill DeSantis' campaign in the crib shows she can play hardball, too.\n\n\"She'll be smiling and walk you right off the plank,\" said a Republican who has worked with Wiles for years.\n\nUSA TODAY spoke with more than 20 people who know Wiles, some going back decades, who describe a savvy political operator who achieved unprecedented success in Florida and has made herself essential to Trump, emerging from his 2020 defeat and her own fallout with DeSantis to become a major power player.\n\nWiles is navigating through one of the wildest campaigns in modern history, one shaped by a criminal trial and three other indictments, with a style that longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone calls “unflappable.”\n\nShe is immersed in every aspect of Trump’s 2024 operation, from developing the themes of next week's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to leading the search for Trump’s running mate. One ally says she has “the biggest vote” in whom is selected other than Trump.\n\nTrump's trial in New York City on state charges stemming from paying hush money to an adult film actress to conceal an affair was a big test of Wiles' skills. She helped orchestrate an unprecedented \"campaign from the courtroom\" that included daily diatribes from Trump, events around Manhattan, court visits from top allies − including the House speaker and vice presidential contenders − and a huge fundraising blitz that helped Trump close the money gap with President Joe Biden despite his historic felony conviction earlier this spring.\n\nUnlike past Trump campaign leaders, Wiles has managed to generate goodwill from all corners of his political orbit. Trump allies credit her with helping make good things happen, like the endorsements, and note that bad things can happen when she’s not around.\n\nWiles killed multiple times the plans for the notorious dinner that Trump ultimately had in late 2022 at his Mar-a-Lago estate with Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, that caused an uproar when Ye brought along white supremacist Nick Fuentes. It finally occurred just days before Thanksgiving when she was out of town, according to a source with knowledge of the incident.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, Wiles said she doesn't deserve the credit for Trump’s surging campaign. “We do everything as a team, and I would argue that’s why we’ve been successful,” she said.\n\nWiles said having other staffers serve as the public-facing part of the campaign frees her up to “to do a better job” orchestrating the mechanics.\n\n“I do prefer to be in the background,” she said.\n\nThough opponents may view Wiles as abetting a candidate many Democrats view as a wannabe dictator, her closeness with Trump and his confidence in her makes the Florida grandmother essential to the GOP's bid to reclaim the White House. She's someone Trump trusts with his most important tasks, such as devising the plan to dispatch DeSantis.\n\n“I think she’s got a very good balance,” said former Trump White House press secretary Sean Spicer. “She’s not looking to be in the spotlight. She’s got the experience. She’s got the trust. She is flying right exactly on the radar where you want to be.”\n\n'He tried to ruin her life'\n\nIn many ways, it’s an odd-couple pairing between Trump and Wiles, who was described in a recent Wall Street Journal column as “the most important woman in American politics.”\n\nWiles hates public attention. Trump craves it. Wiles is disciplined. Trump is chaotic. Wiles is “no drama.” Trump is all drama.\n\nThough there are many stylistic differences between Trump and Wiles, they share at least one thing in common: Both are attempting a comeback after their political careers seemed to be over.\n\nIf Trump completes his resurrection after losing in 2020 and facing widespread recrimination after the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Wiles will be a big reason why.\n\nWiles, meanwhile, has resurrected herself after steering DeSantis to his first gubernatorial victory in 2018 and then being booted from his orbit. She joined DeSantis' campaign that year in the final stretch, when he was floundering in the general election after tacking hard right to win a primary over an establishment Republican.\n\nWith Wiles on board for the campaign's final month, DeSantis narrowly eked out the closest victory of any governor in Florida history. She stayed on to help with the transition effort but soon got crosswise with DeSantis and his inner circle.\n\nDeSantis blamed Wiles after a fundraising memo leaked detailing plans to raise big money by charging lobbyists for golf and other activities with the governor. He pressured Trump to fire her from managing his 2020 campaign in Florida, which he did.\n\nWiles also left her lobbying firm, Ballard Partners, where she was a partner.\n\nThose who spoke to Wiles at the time said she was despondent.\n\nDeSantis “didn’t just have Trump fire her, he tried to ruin her life,” a person who has known Wiles for years said.\n\n“Not only do you get fired, but you basically get publicly … body-slammed where they’re going out and telling everybody 'You can’t hire her, you can’t use her,'” said another person who knows Wiles well. “It was not pretty. It was vicious. They treated her like dirt, and I’m not selling that enough.”\n\nWiles is adamant she didn't leak the memo and said DeSantis never met with her to explain what happened.\n\n“He most definitely tried to make me some sort of a pariah, and I was never able to get an appointment with him or anything after it happened to address it head on,” said Wiles, adding: “Gosh it’s five years ago and a lot of water’s under that bridge. … It is so in my rearview mirror.”\n\nWiles' allies say they believe DeSantis resented the credit she got for his victory and his inner circle grew jealous of her, concerned she was stocking the Florida governor's administration with allies and accumulating too much influence. DeSantis' office didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt wasn’t long before Wiles would have her revenge.\n\n'Left on the environment, left on gay rights'\n\nThe daughter of longtime football broadcaster and former placekicker Pat Summerall, Wiles grew up around fame.\n\nThat may have been part of her appeal to Trump, who has long been drawn to celebrity. It also may be one reason she has successfully navigated Trump's demanding nature.\n\n\"Think about this: Her dad sat between John Madden and Howard Cosell, two of the biggest personalities, pains in the a--, right?\" said a Trump campaign official. \"Really hard thing, and he was the calming center. And it’s genetic. She has that.\"\n\nWiles said her father didn’t have much influence on her political career, beyond ensuring she had the same opportunities as her brothers and encouraging her to follow whatever path she wanted.\n\n“I think the Summerall family is pretty competitive and has been very successful, and I think my dad’s influence was really more that than politics,” she said. “Politics wasn’t his thing. Sports was his thing.\"\n\nWiles' family connections did help launch her into politics, though. She started out working for Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., a football teammate of her famous father. She later worked on former President Ronald Reagan’s campaigns and in his administration.\n\nStone, who got to know Wiles while working on the Reagan and Kemp campaigns, calls her “extraordinarily well organized.”\n\n\"Trump is a free spirit, and Susie both recognizes that but at the same time I think she brings order and structure and organization to the Trump campaign and he trusts her, which is the absolute key element,\" Stone said.\n\nWiles reputation as a top GOP operative was forged in Florida. She and her ex-husband − they have two daughters and a grandson − moved in the early 1980s to Jacksonville, where she has family. She worked in intervals as a consultant and in government, taking 11 years off to raise her daughters.\n\nIn 1995, Wiles helped Delaney become Jacksonville’s first Republican mayor since shortly after the Civil War. She later was Delaney’s chief of staff.\n\nDelaney is a moderate Republican. Among his signature programs was a sales tax increase to pay for infrastructure and an environmental land conservation program. Wiles was instrumental in both.\n\n“She’s a Republican, but she’s not uber-, uber-conservative at all,” Delaney said. “Really you’d be struck more by moderate than anything else. … She’d be left on the environment, left on gay rights.”\n\nRick Mullaney, who worked with Wiles in Delaney’s administration, also described her as “pretty non-ideological.”\n\nWiles takes pride in the Jacksonville land conservation program she helped build, noting she still sits on the group’s board, and said she likes bird-watching, gardening and just being outside.\n\n“If that makes me an environmentalist, that would be so,” she said.\n\nIn 2012, Wiles briefly managed the presidential campaign of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a moderate Republican who ended his White House run that year during the early days of a primary season ultimately won by Mitt Romney.\n\nFour years later, Wiles was eyeing a job managing Trump's Florida operation for 2016 when she sat down to lunch with Delaney, a lifelong Republican. He advised against it.\n\n“I just don’t think that’s what you want on your obituary,” Delaney, who would not vote for Trump in either 2016 or 2020, said he told Wiles. “He just seemed so unlike her. She’s classy and dignified. She doesn’t curse. … She’s an every-Sunday-churchgoing kind of person.”\n\nDespite Wiles’ button-down image and more moderate personal politics, she has a history of championing insurgent, outsider GOP candidates.\n\nRick Scott, Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump\n\nSen. Rick Scott has now spent nearly 14 years in public office, but when he connected with Wiles back in 2010, he was an unknown former hospital company executive who had the entire Florida GOP establishment lined up against him.\n\nWiles helped Scott tap into the tea party wave as he defeated a well-connected GOP opponent and went on to narrowly win the general election.\n\n“Most Republicans were told if they worked on my campaign in the primary they would never work in Republican politics, so I’ll forever be grateful somebody with Susie’s reputation came to work for me,” said Scott, adding Wiles is \"really smart, she’s a hard worker, she’s a team player, I think she gives really good advice.\"\n\nThat 2010 victory was the beginning of a Wiles winning streak that may be unrivaled in the history of Florida politics.\n\nWiles won four statewide races in 10 years, delivering the state for Scott, DeSantis in 2018 and Trump in 2016 and 2020. In the process, she helped shift what was long seen as the nation's largest swing state into more firmly Republican territory.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz worked with Wiles on multiple campaigns and describes her as “one of the most talented political operatives in the country.\"\n\n\"Highly organized ... driven, trusted by the president,\" Gaetz added.\n\nIn the first three Florida races, Wiles achieved narrow victories of a percentage point or less in incredibly competitive contests.\n\n“She’s probably been the most successful political operative in Florida campaign history,” said Brian Ballard, a Trump fundraiser who runs the lobbying firm where Wiles once worked.\n\nDespite her success, the future of Wiles' political career was in doubt in 2019 after her break with DeSantis. Trump gave her a second chance.\n\nBack with Trump\n\nAs the 2020 election grew closer, Trump’s campaign grew nervous about Florida and decided to bring Wiles back despite DeSantis’ opposition.\n\nTrump ended up carrying Florida by more than 3 percentage points, tripling his margin of victory from 2016. Wiles’ reputation as a winner grew.\n\nOverall, though, the 2020 election was a disaster for Trump, one compounded by his refusal to accept the results, resulting in a mob of his supporters storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nYet while many Republicans distanced themselves from Trump after Jan. 6, Wiles drew closer. She helped run his political operations after his presidency.\n\nWiles said she \"didn’t like the Capitol being destroyed, but that was a very small minority of the people that were there,” and she doesn't believe Trump should be blamed for what happened.\n\nTrump asked Wiles to dinner in early 2021 and eventually tasked her with getting his Save America PAC’s affairs in order. That evolved into other tasks, such as coordinating endorsements and rallies for various candidates.\n\n“I was a believer and I had worked really hard in two tough races, and to the extent that I could help I wanted to,\" Wiles said.\n\nThe job ensnared her in one of Trump’s legal cases.\n\nThe office of special counsel Jack Smith interviewed Wiles about Trump's handling of classified documents in the first of two federal criminal cases against the former president.\n\nWiles is believed to be the unnamed individual in Smith’s original indictment to whom Trump allegedly showed a classified map to, according to ABC News. The federal judge in the case recently agreed to strike the paragraph detailing the map incident from the indictment, though. Wiles declined to comment on the case.\n\nHer position has evolved into leading Trump’s 2024 campaign with another senior adviser, Chris LaCivita.\n\nA Republican who is close to Trump world and knows Wiles believes she saw a chance to resurrect her career by helping Trump at his lowest point.\n\n“I don’t want to pretend that everything Susie does is altruistic, I think she saw an opportunity,” the Republican said. “I think she has a good sense of where the political winds are going, and I think she knew that this wasn’t going to be the end of Trump but also that a lot of people are going to run away and be scared and that Trump values loyalty. And so I think she saw an opportunity to sort of get her foot in the door at a time where she could prove herself to him and sort of solidify her position in Trump world, and she did that.”\n\nWiles’ first job as a top Trump 2024 campaign aide was winning the primary. While Trump pummeled DeSantis as “DeSanctimonious,” Wiles worked behind the scenes to outmaneuver the Florida governor's campaign.\n\nShe helped orchestrate a show of political force by getting most of Florida’s GOP congressional delegation to back Trump at a key early moment, before DeSantis had officially announced.\n\n“It was devastating,” Stone said, calling the move “a major milestone on the way to the nomination.”\n\n“She had worked for DeSantis,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. “She knew his weaknesses intimately and she laid out for the president a strategy that would take DeSantis out of the race, and they executed it.”\n\nWiles allowed herself a rare moment of public celebration and knife twisting after it was clear DeSantis would drop out, writing on X: “bye, bye.”\n\nIt is her only post on the social media site this year.\n\n\"It didn't make me sad,\" Wiles said of DeSantis dropping out.\n\nNot everyone was impressed with the primary win.\n\n“Had they lost the primary it would have been pathetic,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump 2016 campaign aide turned critic. “I think they underperformed, and I think they got lucky it was a big field.”\n\nNunberg noted that Trump had a lot of advantages in the primary and still struggled to win a majority of GOP votes in the early contests.\n\n“I don’t judge them on parking a car properly,” Nunberg said. “Let’s see you win the general election and then we’ll see how good you are.”\n\n'Calming presence'\n\nTrump’s 2024 general election campaign got off to a slow and calamitous start with the former president stuck in a Manhattan courtroom for weeks leading up to a conviction on 34 felony counts.\n\nWiles helped coordinate courtroom visits from top supporters and made appearances herself while helping to plot a campaign strategy that included events around New York.\n\n\"In a way, as awful as the trial was, it presented what I think is a good opportunity to do some things that broaden the party and the president’s base a little bit since we were stuck already in New York,” she said.\n\nMore importantly, allies say, she projected calm and never panicked.\n\nIn that way, Wiles is a lot different from Trump campaign leaders of the past, such as Corey Lewandowski, Steve Bannon and Brad Parscale, who were more hot-tempered and aggressive and eventually lost their jobs, in Bannon's case after he joined Trump's White House. Trump’s past campaigns also were filled with much more drama.\n\n“There are no stories this cycle about infighting and backbiting and drama,” Spicer noted.\n\nTrump’s past campaign leaders often have butted heads with him because they tried to manage him too much, Gingrich said. Wiles is more tactful, observers say.\n\n“She’s not confused,” said Gingrich, who in 2016 was among the finalists who didn't ultimately get picked to be Trump's running mate. “She understands that she is in fact his agent, he’s not hers.”\n\nWiles still acts as a gatekeeper at times. She's judicious in her efforts to control access to Trump, though, and how she tries to influence him, observers say. Wiles knows she can’t really control him and doesn’t try, they say.\n\nYet Wiles has enormous influence behind the scenes as somebody Trump trusts. She is now one of his longest-serving advisers, having worked on all of his campaigns, and has served as a top political aide for more than three years.\n\nOn issues such as who will be Trump’s running mate, his campaign likes to say that only Trump will make that decision. Wiles is the one coordinating the search, though. She vetted all the contenders, digging through their records and making sure Trump had “full visibility into all of it,” she said, while noting that the campaign team doesn't try to influence or advocate for anyone.\n\n“Besides the boss,” said a person close to the campaign, \"she has probably the biggest vote.\"\n\nContributing: David Jackson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/02/donald-trump-formally-cancel-nafta-make-way-new-deal/2181399002/", "title": "Donald Trump to formally cancel NAFTA to make way for new deal", "text": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina – President Donald Trump said late Saturday he will formally terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement soon, a move designed to put pressure on Congress to approve a new deal he signed during the G-20 summit.\n\n“I'll be terminating it within a relatively short period of time,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington after a two-day meeting in Argentina with the leaders of other major world economies. “We (will) get rid of NAFTA.

If you were living solo on a deserted island and he showed up, that might be true, but for everyone else, it’s just another one of his delusional claims. In fact, I have met the president myself, and he’s off by one word. He is not the least racist person I’ve ever met — he is the most.\n\nTrump supporters reading this will probably get upset and melt like snowflakes.Yet since October 1973, when Richard Nixon’s Justice Department sued Trump and his father Fred for barring blacks from their apartment buildings, it has been known that the president is a racist — and a congenital one at that.\n\nTrump racism goes back decades\n\nThe least racist person you have ever met? You don’t know the history of the Central Park Five (Trump called for the death penalty for the accused teens), or the history of blacks who worked at his casinos (fine paid for discrimination, and much more) in Atlantic City.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe least racist person you have ever met? “Laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control,” he said in a 1997 Playboy interview.\n\nThe least racist person you have ever met? Mexicans? “they’re rapists.” White supremacists waving swastikas in Charlottesville? “very fine people on both sides.” On and on and on.\n\nBefore we move on, here’s my favorite. Remember when Trump (you know, the least racist person you’ve ever met) said that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS” and that many African nations were “s---hole countries?”\n\nOne country he has singled out is Nigeria; he said once Nigerians have seen the United States, they would never “go back to their huts.”\n\nHis base loves this stuff, but guess what? The joke’s on them. According to Trump’s own Census Bureau, Nigerian immigrants are far better educated than white Americans. For instance, 17% of Nigerians who are here have a master’s degree; just 8% of whites do. And 4% of Nigerians who are here have a Ph.D. Just 1% of whites do.\n\nHolding these figures down are lesser educated white folks like Trump himself and his relatives. None of them have an advanced degree — though Tiffany Trump, a second-year law student at Georgetown, may be the first to earn one.\n\nRacism from Andrew Johnson to FDR\n\nAmericans have survived racist presidents before. Woodrow Wilson, a southerner, opposed postwar Reconstruction because \"the dominance of an ignorant and inferior race was justly dreaded.\" He opposed giving blacks the right to vote, claiming “it was a menace to society,” and as president he oversaw the re-segregation of the federal government. He lived in the White House a century ago.\n\nCalvin Coolidge signed an immigration bill aimed at keeping out “the yellow peril” — i.e. Asians, along with Africans and Arabs. “America must be kept American,” he said in 1923.\n\nTrump's tweets:Bullies told me to go back to my country. At first it silenced me, now it spurs me on.\n\nAnd everyone knows that after Pearl Harbor was bombed, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, leading to the forced relocation of 117,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast to inland internment camps. FDR’s defenders pointed out that we had just been bombed by Japan and were at war.\n\nBut few know that in 1925, Roosevelt wrote that “Japanese immigrants are not capable of assimilation into the American population...Anyone who has traveled in the Far East knows that the mingling of Asiatic blood with European and American blood produces, in nine cases out of ten, the most unfortunate results.”\n\nFDR led us through the Great Depression and World War II. He was one of our greatest presidents. Yet those words cannot be ignored.\n\nVisions of racial superiority\n\nThere are other examples — Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was probably the worst of all — but you get the idea. American history is dotted with presidents who harbored visions of racial superiority.\n\nBut not in the modern era, at least not to the degree that we have seen with Trump. He went from bad to worse just the last few days with his attacks on \"The Squad\" -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-,Minn., Ayanna Pressley D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., all young freshmen congresswomen of color. And then he doubled down Monday, saying they hate America?\n\nActually, Trump seems to hate America himself. After all, he has complained about several amendments to our Constitution. He has complained about our system of checks and balances, our judicial system, our free press, people who are different than him.\n\nWhy does he hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?\n\nDonald Trump is not our first racist president. Let us hope, however, that he will be our last.\n\nPaul Brandus, founder and White House bureau chief of West Wing Reports, is the author of \"Under This Roof: The White House and the Presidency\" and is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

And if you saw some of our email exchanges you’d probably worry about us being in the same room.\n\nMike usually emails when he’s had enough of what I’ve been saying about Donald Trump, and to tell me that I’m wrong about this or that, and, essentially, that I don’t have a clue. I typically shoot back a response that is similar in tone and just as convinced about Mike’s failed logic as he is about mine.\n\nBut the truth is, I like Mike. And I think he likes me. So, Wednesday morning, after too-few hours of sleep, he and I met for coffee to talk about a presidential election he saw as uplifting but I considered heartbreaking.\n\n“I’m just thrilled,” the 71-year-old retired IT worker told me. “Trump always said this was a movement. I think that’s what it turned out to be.”\n\nMike and I first got together for coffee almost a year ago, after I’d written in the paper that Trump was a bully and a bigot and Mike had written an email to let me know what a fool I was. Despite the disagreement, we met and discussed the discontent that was then fueling both Trump’s primary campaign and the belief among many that the political establishment needed the type of reckoning only a blunt outsider could deliver.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn Mike, I found a friendly diehard conservative who generally gets his news from far-right websites like Breitbart News, who questions Fox News’ conservative credentials, and who desperately wants that wall and the political disruption Trump has promised. In Mike, I also found a guy who supports same-sex marriage because of the gay neighbors he’s become friends with, who helps out with programs benefiting at-risk families at his church, and who has taken on the role of homemaker because his wife still works.\n\nWe can survive Trump or Clinton: Matthew Tully\n\nA year after that first meeting, Mike and I got together once again. It was Wednesday morning. Also known as: The morning after. At every table around us, diners were talking about Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton. We were in Broad Ripple so the mood, not surprisingly, was somewhat gloomy. What had seemed hard to imagine a year earlier was now a reality.\n\nMike was smiling.\n\n“I feel great,” he said. “I feel like somebody is finally listening to the regular guy. Not the special interests or the lobbyists (but rather) the guy who works with his hands as much as his mind.”\n\nAsk Mike about the issues that spoke to him this election year and he starts to with Trump’s immigration policies. He wants that wall built; he’ll be quite disappointed if it isn’t. He wants federal funds cut off to “sanctuary cities.” And he wants Trump to “pick up (House Speaker) Paul Ryan and shake him by the shirttails.”\n\nNow, as I said, Mike and I disagree about a lot of things. For instance, I don’t consider Trump much of a conservative and struggle to understand why self-identified conservatives have turned their backs on true conservatives such as Ryan. And while I hate the idea of a wall along the southern border, Mike has supported Trump from the day he announced his candidacy in large part because of it.\n\n“It makes a statement,” he said. “It will make it harder to send heroin here. It protects the property owners on the border. It sends a firm statement that we don’t want you here unless you’re supposed to be here.”\n\nClinton probably never thought she'd be Gored: Column\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nGaskey was a supporter of Sen. Ted Cruz until Trump jumped into the race with a speech that centered on immigration policy. As he told me last year, and again on Wednesday, Trump spoke of the same things he and his wife talked about over dinner, and in the same way. That led Gaskey to start sending Trump’s campaign $50 a month, a figure he doubled as Election Day approached.\n\nAs we talked, Mike dismissed every Trump controversy I mentioned. The leaked tape in which he talked about sexually assaulting women? “Just guy talk,” Mike said. The lack of detailed policy ideas? Trump is a different kind of candidate, he told me. His anti-immigrant rhetoric? He’s just a man who wants law and order, he said.\n\nIn the end, millions of Americans agreed that Trump offered something nobody else could. Every controversy was another reminder that he was not a typical politician, and many loved that. Where a lot of us saw a man unequipped to lead the country, Mike and others saw a much-needed fresh voice and a much-welcomed blunt style.\n\n“I think he fits the model for the way our country was created,” he said. “You have a private citizen who steps up and serves in elected office, and then goes back to the farm, or to his business. He sees problems and says, ‘I’m going to try to fix them.’ I just think he fits the model of what this country initially wanted in its presidents.”\n\nMike compared Trump to Babe Ruth, meaning “someone who calls shots that sound outrageous, and then he hits it over the fence just like he said he would.” I didn’t agree with the comparison — as a Ruth fan, it made me a bit queasy — but I did acknowledge that Trump had indeed achieved a feat many once considered impossible.\n\nWe're sprinting backward on race and gender: Melinda Henneberger\n\nThe bottom line truth is that many of us woke up Wednesday morning terrified and many others awoke as hopeful as they could remember being. Either way, Mike said that those who make up Trump’s base want results.\n\n“He’s got to perform,” he said. “He has to drain the swamp like he said he would. He has to build the wall. We have high expectations. We are expecting him to keep his word.”\n\nAnd then, after 45 minutes of talking about politics, Mike asked me about my life and I asked about his. We talked a bit about baseball and about a park that’s being redeveloped near his Butler-Tarkington condo. And, yes, we both agreed that the other was horribly misguided when it comes to politics. But believe it or not, we also agreed that was OK.\n\nMatthew Tully is a political columnist for the Indianapolis Star, where this piece first appeared.

The survey found about 8% of respondents indicated they might change their mind with approximately 1% saying they are undecided.\n\n\"In a close election, everything matters,\" said Marc Trussler, director of data science at the University of Pennsylvania's program on opinion research and election studies.\n\nDebates don't typically move the needle among partisans, who are the most likely audience to watch Tuesday's broadcast. But even a small number of voters who are skeptical of both candidates might find reasons to choose differently based on this conversation.\n\n\"So there's a little bit of persuasion,\" Trussler said. \"Even more so, it's going to be them talking to their bases and trying to build that enthusiasm to vote, something that has been lacking for the Democratic campaign, but has been gaining steadily since Harris has taken over as the nominee.\"\n\n'Can I call you, Joe?': How Harris and Trump interact\n\nThe debate rules are the same as they were in June: no live audience, no props and (over the Harris campaign’s objections) muted microphones when the other candidate is speaking.\n\nBut rather than a rematch between two candidates who had tussled for more than four years, this is now an eight-week sprint between two people who've never met in-person. Harris and Trump didn't interact during his State of the Union addresses as president, and he didn't attend her inauguration as VP after refusing to accept the 2020 election results.\n\nRepublican consultant Liz Mair, a former spokeswoman for John McCain's 2008 campaign, said the two having no previous interactions could play a role. She said the last time a national debate of this magnitude took place with two candidates who genuinely did not know each other was when then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin faced off against then-Delaware Sen. Joe Biden while both were running for vice president.\n\nAt the start of that debate in St. Louis, Palin asked: \"Can I call you, Joe?\" due largely to fumbling his last name throughout her previous preparations. \"And that did make a big difference,\" Mair told USA TODAY.\n\nPolitical observers will dissect every second of how the two interact in the first few minutes, including how they respond to each other's attacks and the moderators.\n\nMair said she has guided GOP candidates through debates, and will be watching how Trump responds to Harris, who is the second woman to be a major party's nominee for president after Hillary Clinton led the Democratic ticket in the 2016 race against Trump.\n\n\"It's very difficult for male candidates to come off as forceful and authoritative without coming off as being sexist, patronizing (and) condescending,\" she said. \"I think the fact that they haven't met before probably makes that worse.\"\n\nEnding the Harris honeymoon without offending is Trump's test\n\nTrump and his team have an obvious mission: pop Harris' rising balloon without turning off swing voters who have as many concerns about the former president's character as his policy pursuits.\n\nIn the past, the GOP nominee has been known to bring surprise guests to debates and come up with creative insults, but Trump's allies warn against those sort of antics. Instead, he is being urged to focus on the issues that animate conservatives and calling attention to her liberal views rather than vitriolic personal attacks and other ad hominem tangents.\n\n\"If Trump stays on the issues, stays on message – and that's by the way can include criticizing Harris for being a flip flopper – that's OK,\" Gilmore said. \"But he needs to then say, 'We don't know what she's going to do, but this is what I'm going to do.' If he talks about the issues, he's going to be fine.\"\n\nThe trouble is Trump isn't always the most disciplined messenger, and often rambles or revels in slinging personal attacks, which have included questioning Harris' racial heritage. At an August event in Asheboro, North Carolina, Trump said people often advise him to be nicer but, \"sometimes it’s hard when you're attacked from all ends.\"\n\nHarris faces danger in debate too, experts warn\n\nFor some, the televised debate is more perilous for Harris, who is still introducing herself to a large segment of the country who don't fully grasp what she stands for or will do if elected president.\n\nThe VP has reportedly been working on ways to get under Trump's skin by highlighting his repeated false statements while looking for a viral social media moment that could define the race.\n\nBut debate experts warn Harris, who remains a relative blank page to voters compared with her Republican rival, faces a steeper fall should a misstep occur that could halt the momentum her campaign has built over several weeks.\n\n\"The risk for her is that she's still not that well known to a large portion of the American public, and so it is possible she has a weak performance that she undermines the hope that she's brought to Democrats,\" said Robert Rowland, a communication studies professor at the University of Kansas.\n\nHarris has done one sit-down interview, joined by running mate Tim Walz, since winning the Democratic nomination. She has been criticized for giving just a handful of policy-focused speeches on the campaign trail and independent voters in particular will be looking for more details.\n\nHarris could be tripped up by Trump or the moderators on why she's changed positions on a number of issues, specifically hydraulic fracturing, commonly referred to as fracking, which is a big issue in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2019, Harris called for a fracking ban when running for president but told CNN she believes climate change can be tackled without a prohibition on the oil extraction practice.\n\nIt will be telling to see how much time Harris spends jousting with Trump versus speaking directly to voters about her plans and views.\n\n'Best decision I made': Biden's record will be as central as the issues\n\nPresident Biden won't be at this debate, but he's likely to come up for very different reasons Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans will want to tag Harris as the true incumbent and anchor her to every controversial decision or bad outcome over the past four years.\n\nTrump has been relentless, for example, in bringing up the botched 2021 evacuation ending the war in Afghanistan that resulted in 13 U.S. troops being killed. He has posted videos online of those soldiers' relatives who specifically blame Harris for the outcome.\n\nIn other ads, the Trump campaign calls attention to higher grocery costs with clips of her saying, \"Bidenomics is working.\" That, along with Harris' role in dealing with root causes for the crisis at the southern border and what she knew about Biden's capacity, could all be used against the vice president during Tuesday's debate.\n\nOnly 31% of Americans surveyed in the USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll said the country is on the right track versus to 58% who said it is on the wrong track.\n\nAs Harris threads the incumbency needle, she might look to defend her boss, who is seeing better numbers since bowing out.\n\nThe USA TODAY/Suffolk survey found that about 84% of voters think his decision to drop out was right, and 48% of respondents approve of the job he's doing compared to 41% who said the same in late June.\n\nOther pollsters show Biden's numbers relatively unchanged, but as Democrats and their allies revere the president's choice, any improvement benefits Harris.\n\n\"I think that Harris needs to run against Trump, not Biden ... who accomplished a significant amount during his presidency,\" said Harvey, the voting rights leader.\n\nHarvey said instead of playing defense Harris can go on offense Tuesday by reminding voters about the series of controversies and decisions made during the Trump years. She noted how the next president could make multiple appointments to the Supreme Court in the next term.\n\nFour of the nine justices will be in their 70s by the end of next January, which progressive activists say raises the stakes given the high court's 6-3 conservative tilt.\n\n\"They could retire or die or have health issues,\" Harvey said. \"That means that if Trump were reelected, he can ensure MAGA control of the court for decades to come. That would have a huge impact on issues concerning abortion, voting rights and on gun safety.\"\n\n'Prosecutor v. felon' (or reality TV star)\n\nOne thing that infuriated Democrats about the June 27 debate was Biden’s missed opportunity at making a coherent case against Trump on national TV.\n\nWhether it is the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, handling of the COVID-19 pandemic or his various court cases, Harris comes into Tuesday with an expectation by supporters to put Trump's political and personal record on trial.\n\nThe Harris campaign enjoys framing this race as a “prosecutor v. felon.” But a debate stage isn't a courtroom and Trump, a former reality TV star, is experienced in what will be his seventh presidential debate when counting his past White House campaigns in 2016 and 2020.\n\nDebate could break audience records\n\nBiden’s exit, Harris’ entry and Trump's showmanship has given this campaign a cinematic feel that coupled with real world consequences, could make it the most watched presidential debate in U.S. history.\n\nThat title is currently held by the 2016 contest between Trump and Hillary Clinton, who drew about 84 million viewers during their first debate.\n\nThe other top watched debates are roughly 80 million who watched the 1980 debate between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter; and approximately 73 million who viewed the first 2020 debate between Biden and Trump amid the pandemic.\n\nABC News will host the event, but if you include other platforms and streaming services this could break records.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/09/20/trump-visiting-eastern-iowa-as-campaign-plans-increased-stops/70892177007/", "title": "Donald Trump campaigns in Maquoketa, Dubuque, Iowa amid ...", "text": "DUBUQUE, Iowa — Former Republican president Donald Trump took credit for ending Roe v. Wade while campaigning in Iowa Wednesday, but he cautioned that Republicans can't win in 2024 unless they \"learn how to properly talk about abortion.\"\n\n\"You have to follow your heart. You can’t do it for just the election,\" he said at a campaign event in Dubuque. \"But you have to follow your heart. At the same time, you have to win elections, otherwise, we’ll be back where we were.\"\n\nHe reiterated his belief that abortion hindered Republicans' chances in 2022 — comments that have rankled some Iowa faith leaders.\n\n\"This issue cost us unnecessarily but dearly in the midterms,\" he said. \"It cost us dearly, really, and unnecessarily.\"\n\nHis visit comes after he gave a controversial interview to NBC's Meet The Press, where he criticized Florida's six-week abortion ban as \"a terrible mistake.\" That law closely mirrors Iowa's six-week abortion law, which Republicans have cheered.\n\nThe comments have frustrated prominent conservatives, including Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who posted to social media Tuesday that “It’s never a ‘terrible thing’ to protect innocent life.\"\n\nMore:Donald Trump to campaign in Iowa amid Republican backlash to his recent abortion comments\n\nTrump didn't discuss a six-week ban or other policy proposals while campaigning Wednesday. But he said Republicans must be willing to cast Democrats as the \"radicals\" on abortion.\n\n\"Like Ronald Reagan before me, I believe in the three exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother,\" Trump said. \"I believe in that. I think it’s very important. Without the exceptions, it is very difficult to win elections. We would probably lose the majorities in 2024 without the exceptions and perhaps the presidency itself.\"\n\nBut even as some Republicans express concern that Trump may be backtracking on his support for the anti-abortion movement, Democrats have been adamant that his past record should indicate what he's likely to support in the future.\n\nTrump, who appointed three U.S. Supreme Court justices and laid the path for the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, has drawn fire from anti-abortion activists for saying \"I think both sides are going to like me\" on the issue.\n\nOne prominent group has called on Republican presidential hopefuls to support at least a 15-week federal ban on abortion.\n\nCraig Kolwaski of Dubuque, who attended Wednesday, told the Register that he is \"pro-life\" and the former president's comments were concerning but wouldn't be enough to stop supporting him in the caucuses.\n\n\"I'd like to agree with him on 100% of the things,\" said Kolwalski, who is hosting a \"President Trump Unity Rally & 2020 Election Denial Conference\" next week in Wisconsin. \"It's not gonna happen. But on the big ones, you know, in the MAGA base ain't moving.\"\n\nThat was a common sentiment among others who attended Wednesday's events.\n\nMary and Wayne Wagoner, who attended the Maquoketa rally, both said they were hoping to \"hear more\" from him on the issue of abortion, which he did not mention. But he remained their first choice in the caucuses.\n\nDonna Jean Knickrehm of Eldridge, when told about Trump's recent comments, referenced his history on abortion during his first term and said she believed he would remain a leader on the issue.\n\n\"I'm confident that he will be the right man, absolutely,\" she said. \"I mean, he sorted us out previously. He will do the same.\"\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Ronald Horan of Maquoketa, who acknowledged that there was \"room for negotiation\" on the issue of abortion when it comes to exceptions for the mother's health, rape and incest.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident he's still going to do what we want to do,\" said Horan, who supports Iowa's abortion restrictions that start at around six weeks.\n\nDeSantis said in an interview with Radio Iowa on Monday that Trump's remarks on abortion show \"the danger\" in reelecting him — an uncommon instance of direct, named criticism from the governor who has previously closely allied himself with Trump on policy and politics.\n\nThe frontrunner is set to skip the second presidential debate Sept. 27 as he did the first, instead planning to visit Detroit to address auto workers as the UAW strikes against major manufacturers.\n\nAugust's Iowa Poll found that Trump holds a commanding lead over the remainder of the field — a more than 2-to-1 lead over his closest challenger in DeSantis.\n\nAhead of Trump's visit Wednesday, Iowa Democrats criticized Trump, with chair Rita Hart arguing that he was \"facing the reality that his unpopular abortion record isn't defensible.\"\n\n\"In Iowa, we almost saw a near-total ban go into effect because Donald Trump nominated the three justices that realized the MAGA goal of overturning Roe v. Wade and stripping away the constitutional right to abortion that Americans have relied on for nearly 50 years,\" Hart said.\n\nIn Maquoketa, Donald Trump turns his attacks on Joe Biden\n\nEarlier in the day at a Maquoketa campaign stop, Trump criticized President Joe Biden on both policy and personality here Wednesday as he rallied supporters to prepare for what he believed would be a \"historic\" turnout and victory.\n\n\"We want to get through the caucus, we want to get through it right away,\" Trump told several hundred supporters who gathered at an event center on the Jackson County Fairgrounds. \"We're going to win the Iowa caucuses in a historic landslide.\"\n\nTrump's speech, the first of two he was delivering in eastern Iowa Wednesday, showed he remains confident in his frontrunner status in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, continuing to lead the pack over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other rivals.\n\nAnd while he did criticize DeSantis — attacking the Florida governor's record on ethanol and cuts to Social Security and Medicare with the nickname \"DeSanctimonious\" — much of his ire was directed at Biden and the wider Democratic Party. His Republican challengers, he said, had \"crashed and burned.\"\n\nHe lamented the Biden administration's approach to immigration and foreign policy, declaring that Democrats are \"no good at policy, they're no good at borders,\" while promising to bring back \"the greatest economy\" with lower gas prices and a hard line on international affairs.\n\n\"We have stupid people running our country, very stupid,\" Trump said.\n\nAnd he mocked Biden's energy and approach to the press, touting his recent interviews during which Trump said he sat for an hour and took \"32 questions.\"\n\n\"Biden can't do that,\" Trump said, before holding up a binder, squinting at it and reading the ABCs.\n\n\"Isn't it nice when you have a president who doesn't have to read a script?\" he said.\n\nGalen Bacharier covers politics for the Register.

The administration left open the possibility of raising those tariffs if no deal is worked out in coming months.\n\nAs he flew back to Washington from Buenos Aires, Trump issued a statement from Air Force One calling his meeting with Xi \"amazing and productive.\"\n\nThe White House also said China had committed to purchase \"a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial\" amount of products from the United States. In that sense, Trump appeared to be announcing a loose agreement on trade similar to the one he struck with the European Union earlier this year.\n\nDetails of exactly what the two leaders agreed to were sparse. Trump left the dinner with Xi and quickly boarded his plane, declining to speak with reporters. Larry Kudlow, the president's top economic adviser, said only that the meeting went \"very well.\"\n\nThe meeting, the first face-to-face encounter between Trump and Xi in a year, offered the best chance for a truce between Washington and Beijing after the two countries spent months imposing higher tariffs on each other's exports. White House officials sent only guarded signals ahead of time about its chances.\n\nTrump appeared to express cautious optimism as he opened the dinner. Sitting across from Xi at an ornately decorated, rectangular table, Trump told reporters that the two nations would \"probably\" wind up with a deal, eventually.\n\n“We’ll be discussing trade and I think at some point we’re going to end up doing something that’s great for China and great for the United States,\" Trump said, largely echoing the unspecific confidence he has projected for months.\n\nIn his own opening remarks, Xi did not address trade directly.\n\n“Only with cooperation between us can we serve the interest of both peace and prosperity,\" he said through a translator.\n\nThe dinner capped Trump's relatively short trip to Buenos Aires for the G-20 summit, where the White House hoped to highlight the president's efforts on trade. His visit was instead largely overshadowed by the plea deal struck by his former attorney, Michael Cohen, and the death of former President George H.W. Bush.\n\nTrump also signed a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, fulfilling a campaign pledge to renegotiate the controversial NAFTA deal. And his administration appeared to secure a win in a joint statement summarizing the meeting signed by all 20 countries that acknowledged the need for reform of the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe White House had longed argued that the U.S. has been treated unfairly in WTO dispute resolutions.\n\nThe trade dispute with China escalated over the summer when Trump slapped the first round of tariffs on Chinese imports in response to what he and others have said are Beijing’s unfair trade practices, including the theft or forced transfer of intellectual property from U.S. businesses.\n\nTrump had already levied tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods. Some of those tariffs had been scheduled to increase on Jan. 1 to a rate of 25 percent, up from the current level of 10 percent. That increase, the White House, said would be pushed back to give the two sides more time to negotiate.\n\nChina had retaliated by levying tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. products, including farm equipment, soybeans, electric cars, orange juice, whiskey, salmon and cigars.\n\nIn the days leading up to the summit, White House officials appeared to be ratcheting up the pressure on China, or potentially lowering expectations for a deal. Trump and others signaled that they saw little sign Beijing was offering to make substantial changes to its own trade barriers.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said China’s “aggressive, state-directed industrial policies” are causing severe harm to U.S. workers and manufacturers earlier in the week. The U.S. continues to raise those issues with China, Lighthizer said, but so far China “has not come to the table with proposals for meaningful reform.’’\n\nThe potential fallout from a full-blown trade war between China and the United States would almost certainly impact the economy beyond those two nations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who also met with Trump Saturday, encouraged the president and Xi to reach an agreement.\n\n“All of us see that we are affected indirectly when Chinese-American economic relations are not as frictionless as a world order requires,” she said.\n\nContributed: Associated Press\n\nMore: President Donald Trump predicts China trade deal, but aides say nothing imminent\n\nMore: U.S., Mexico and Canada ink new trade agreement, but final ratification remains big hurdle\n\nMore: What's next for stocks?

Who is ...", "text": "Hard-right Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán addressed a crowd of conservatives Thursday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nWell-known for his illiberal populist rhetoric and policy, the Hungarian leader gave a speech titled \"How We Fight\" which reflected many of those values, from re-centering Christian values in American politics to fighting off \"progressive liberals.\"\n\n“You cannot fight successfully by liberal means,” Orbán told the crowd.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Orbán.\n\nWho is Orbán:Viktor Orbán, Hungary's pro-Putin prime minister, claims victory in national vote\n\nWho is Viktor Orbán?\n\nOrbán is the prime minister of Hungary. He was first elected prime minister in 1998 and held that role until 2002. He took power again in 2010 and was reelected to a fourth term in April.\n\nIn April's election, Orbán's Fidesz-led coalition won 53%, while a pro-European opposition coalition, United for Hungary, had just over 34%, according to the National Election Office.\n\nWhy is he controversial?\n\nOrbán gained notoriety after a July 2014 speech in which he described his goal to build an \"illiberal state.\" Since then, he has become representative of a wave of \"illiberal\" leaders across the world who are democratically elected but who use their authority to consolidate their control and subvert the freedoms typically associated with democracies.\n\nIn particular, the Hungarian leader has been criticized for his efforts to quash political dissidents and limit press freedom, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nOrbán faced backlash in July for suggesting that Europeans should not “become peoples of mixed race,” the Washington Post reported. His comments led to the resignation of one of his senior advisers.\n\nTrump and Orbán:Critics deride Trump's decision to meet with 'authoritarian' prime minister of Hungary\n\nWhat is his relationship with Trump?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has been open in his admiration for Orbán.\n\nAt a heavily criticized 2019 meeting with Orbán held in the Oval Office, the former president described the Hungarian leader as “probably like me ... a bit controversial, but that’s OK.”\n\nAhead of CPAC, Trump met with Orbán, who he described as a \"friend\" in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump endorsed Orbán before Hungary's April election, praising the authoritarian prime minister as a \"strong leader\" who \"truly loves his country.\" Orbán was the first European leader to endorse Trump in 2016.\n\nWhat is CPAC?\n\nCPAC, self-described as the \"largest and most influential gathering of conservatives in the world,\" was founded in 1974. The 2022 conference is being held in Dallas from Aug. 4-7.\n\nSpeakers at this year's conference include right-wing Republican lawmakers like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene; conservative media figures like Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck. The former president is headlining the conference.\n\nCPAC chair Mark Schlapp confirmed on Twitter in July that Orbán would speak at the conference.\n\nIn a July statement, CPAC told The Hill that the former president and Orbán share a \"special relationship\" because of the leaders' mutual understanding that \"we should not be controlled by the (United Nations], the [European Union], radical, woke corporatists or the billionaires who think regular people cannot be trusted to make their own decisions.\"\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nIn his speech, Orbán called for American conservatives to “unite forces” against progressive liberals, because “we Hungarians know how to defeat the enemies of freedom on the political battlefield.”\n\nOrbán suggested that to beat out opponents, conservative Americans must rely on “Judeo-Christian teachings.”\n\n“Today’s progressives are trying to separate Western civilization from its Christian roots,” Orbán said. “Once again, they are crossing a line that should never be crossed… Don’t be afraid to call your enemies by their name.”\n\nHe also touched on topics like immigration, abortion, respect for police and gay marriage. His remarks condemning nontraditional marriages received a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}]}

And in New York City, one patient has tested positive for orthopoxvirus, the family of viruses to which monkeypox belongs, NYC health officials announced in a news release Friday.\n\nThe case is being treated as a “presumptive positive” case until confirmed pending CDC testing and the patient is currently isolating, the release states.\n\nNew York City health officials had also tested one other patient for monkeypox, but that case has been ruled out, health officials said. City officials have been working with state authorities from the New York State Department of Health in their investigation of the two cases, both of which were identified Thursday.\n\nNew York State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said in a statement Friday that “the current risk to the public is low.”\n\n“Reports of suspected cases of monkeypox in the United States and elsewhere are concerning. While a possible case in New York State awaits confirmatory testing by our local and federal partners, the Department has alerted health care providers in New York State so that they can consider this unusual diagnosis if their patients present with symptoms,” Bassett said.\n\nMeanwhile, recent monkeypox infections have been identified in several other regions around the world where the virus is not usually common, including Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Northern Ireland and Spain.\n\n“We have a level of scientific concern about what we’re seeing because this is a very unusual situation. Monkeypox is normally only reported in West Africa or Central Africa, and we don’t see it in the United States or in Europe – and the number of cases that are being reported is definitely outside the level of normal for what we would see,” Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology within the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n“At the same time, there really aren’t that many cases that are being reported – I think maybe a dozen, a couple dozen – so, the general public should not be concerned that they are at immediate risk for monkeypox,” she said. “We’re working through the investigations.”\n\nOverall, “we have people who are being monitored for diseases all the time,” CDC spokesperson Christine Pearson wrote in an email, Thursday. That means that if someone might have been exposed to a pathogen, their health is monitored, and they should see physicians if they develop symptoms.\n\nAs for the six people currently being monitored for potential monkeypox, they all “are healthy, with no symptoms and are considered at low risk for monkeypox,” Pearson wrote, adding that none were seated next to the ill passenger and none had direct contact.\n\nAs the CDC’s investigation continues, discussions have started to include the topic of vaccines.\n\nCDC ‘discussing and evaluating’ smallpox vaccine\n\nCDC officials are evaluating whether smallpox vaccine should be offered to healthcare workers treating monkeypox patients and other people who may be at “high risk” for exposure to monkeypox, McQuiston said.\n\n“It’s definitely something that we’re discussing and evaluating, whether offering smallpox vaccine makes sense in the current setting,” she said. “We’ll be closer to making recommendations for that in the next day or so.”\n\nThe variola virus that causes smallpox and the monkeypox virus are somewhat related as they are both members of the Orthopoxvirus genus, belonging to the scientific family of “pox” viruses. Therefore, some of the same vaccines administered to prevent smallpox have also been shown to prevent monkeypox. Even though the viruses are related, monkeypox is less contagious than smallpox and causes less severe disease.\n\n“We have vaccines that are stockpiled and available to be used, and if judged as a way to help manage this outbreak, we have the availability to use them,” McQuiston said.\n\n“I would say that we are in the early days of understanding what is causing this outbreak – and the fact that we’re seeing cases reported in multiple places around the globe suggests that maybe it’s been going on for a couple of weeks,” she said. “As we work to complete our investigations and get our arms around it then hopefully we’ll have much stronger recommendations for folks.”\n\nMonkeypox, a viral disease, is rare in the United States and the virus does not occur naturally in the nation, according to the CDC. But cases have been identified that were associated with international travel or importing animals from areas where the disease is more common. After the virus jumps from an animal to a human, human-to-human transmission of monkeypox can occur when a person encounters the virus through direct contact to: large respiratory droplets, bodily fluids, or lesions on the skin.\n\nMonkeypox symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes. A characteristic of the disease is that it can cause lesions and a rash on the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.\n\n“This is not a disease that is going to sweep across the country,” Dr. Daniel Bausch, president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n“From a public health angle, of course, we need to investigate and respond – I think the general population should just be aware of this – but there’s certainly no reason to panic and I think it’s highly, highly, highly unlikely that we will get any sort of large outbreak of this,” he said. “And if you haven’t had contact in Massachusetts and you’re not related to the person who had disease or in that link at all – until we have any other reason to expect or to understand how this disease got into the United States – your risk of getting monkeypox is really low.”\n\nA monkeypox mystery\n\nIn Massachusetts, physicians donning the same personal protective equipment they wear for Covid-19 patients have been treating the US monkeypox patient at a special pathogens unit within Massachusetts General Hospital, where he originally was diagnosed.\n\n“They were undergoing a workup related to symptoms and the infectious diseases physician seeing the patient, learning about some of the cases in the United Kingdom, decided that the patient could possibly have monkeypox,” Dr. Erica Shenoy, medical director for the Regional Emerging Special Pathogens Treatment Center and associate chief of the infection control unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n“Then we had discussions with our state public health officials. The decision was made that yes, they did meet criteria for testing,” Shenoy said. The patient tested positive.\n\n“I think to the public overall, there really is no clear risk at this point,” Shenoy said. “This is an evolving situation that we’re looking to understand better – why these clusters that have been reported as well in the UK and in Portugal and Spain are happening, and to better understand the epidemiology.”\n\nBoth in the United Kingdom and Canada, health authorities have noted that many of the monkeypox cases were identified in men who have sex with men – but the virus is not typically described as a sexually transmitted infection and investigations into these recent cases continue.\n\nMonkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like illness were seen in colonies of monkeys that were kept for research, leading to the name “monkeypox,” according to the CDC. The first human case of monkeypox was reported years later in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, during a time when intense efforts were underway to eliminate smallpox.\n\nIn the United States, the last outbreak of monkeypox recorded was in 2003, when 47 confirmed and probable cases were reported in six states: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin. “No instances of monkeypox infection were attributed exclusively to person-to-person contact,” according to CDC.\n\nAll of the people infected with monkeypox during that outbreak became ill after having contact with pet prairie dogs, the CDC found. Those pets were housed at an animal vendor’s facilities in Illinois where they may have been infected with the virus. The facilities housed other small mammals imported from Ghana that tested positive for monkeypox virus: two African giant pouched rats, nine dormice and three rope squirrels.\n\n“The prairie dogs got monkeypox from the imported animals and then passed it on to the humans,” Bausch said. “It’s a bit of a misnomer calling it monkeypox. The reservoir for this virus, the natural reservoir in nature is probably certain types of rodents.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nUS Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Thursday that people should not be worried about monkeypox at this point, but that they should be aware of symptoms and when to reach out for help.\n\nMurthy explained on CNN’s New Day that monkeypox is rare in humans, “but when it does come up, it’s a serious one that we should investigate, and we’ve got to make sure that we understand if and how it is spreading from person to person.”\n\nSymptoms generally are similar to the flu, he told CNN’s John Berman and Erica Hill.\n\n“The good news is we have one confirmed case right now. But we should always be on the lookout for more cases,” he said. “At this time, we don’t want people to worry. At this point, again, these numbers are still small – we want them to be aware of these symptoms and if they have any concerns to reach out to their doctor.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/02/19/measles-outbreak-texas-vaccine-symptoms/78974605007/", "title": "Measles outbreaks bring concerns as more cases reported in Texas", "text": "This story was updated to add new information.\n\nCases of measles, a highly contagious virus that primarily affects children, are surging in Texas and several other states.\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services reported Tuesday that an outbreak in northwest Texas escalated from two cases among unvaccinated children in Gaines County to 58 cases across five counties. The majority of the infected children were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.\n\nOn Feb. 14, New Mexico officials declared an outbreak in Lea County, just across state lines from Gaines County.

Measles rash appears three to five days after the first symptoms.\n\nOther signs and symptoms of measles include:\n\nKoplik's spots, tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin\n\nSmall raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots (the spots may become joined together as they spread from the head to the rest of the body)\n\nWhen the rash appears, a person’s fever may spike to more than 104 degrees\n\nCONTRIBUTING John Bacon and Jim Sergent", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/us/payton-gendron-buffalo-shooting-suspect-what-we-know/index.html", "title": "Payton Gendron: What we know about the Buffalo supermarket ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe 18-year-old man who allegedly shot and killed 10 people Saturday afternoon in Buffalo, New York, was motivated by hate, authorities said, targeting a supermarket in the heart of a predominantly Black community.\n\nEleven of the 13 people shot by the White suspect at the Tops Friendly Market were Black, officials said. Among the victims, who range in age from 20 to 86, were people grocery shopping, a heroic former police officer who tried to stop the gunman, a long-term substitute teacher and a taxi driver who “took pride in helping people.”\n\n“This was pure evil,” Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said, calling the shooting a “straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community.”\n\nThe US Department of Justice is investigating the shooting “as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism,” according to Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nPayton S. Gendron of Conklin, New York, has been charged with first-degree murder, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said in a May 14 news release. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nOn June 1, a grand jury returned a 25-count indictment against Gendron. He is facing 10 counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of second-degree murder as a hate crime and three counts of attempted murder as a hate crime, according to court documents. Gendron is also facing a charge of domestic terror and a weapons charge, according to court documents.\n\nGendron pleaded not guilty to the 25-count indictment, his attorney said in court Thursday afternoon.\n\nGendron’s defense attorney told CNN on May 17 he would not issue a statement now.\n\nHere’s what we know about the suspect.\n\nHe planned to ‘continue his rampage,’ police say\n\nWhen the suspect arrived at the store around 2:30 p.m., he was heavily armed, wearing tactical gear – including a tactical helmet along with plated armor, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said – and had a camera that was livestreaming his actions.\n\nHe used an assault weapon, Flynn said during a news conference.\n\nThe suspect shot four people outside of the grocery store, three fatally, Flynn said in his news release. When he entered the store, he exchanged fire with an armed security guard, who authorities said was a retired Buffalo police officer. The security guard died of his injuries. The suspect shot eight more people in the store, six of whom died, the release said.\n\nConfronted by police, the suspected shooter took off some of his tactical gear and surrendered, per Buffalo police.\n\nThe suspect planned to continue his shooting rampage beyond the Tops supermarket, Gramaglia told CNN on Monday, saying there was “some documentation” he allegedly planned to target “another large superstore.”\n\n“There was evidence that was uncovered that he had plans, had he gotten out of here, to continue his rampage and continue shooting people,” he said.\n\nThe suspect made very disturbing statements describing his motive and state of mind following his arrest, an official familiar with the investigation told CNN. Those statements were clear and filled with hate toward the Black community, with the alleged shooter making it known he was targeting Black people, the official said.\n\nThe alleged shooter was “studying” previous hate attacks and shootings, investigators have learned via search warrants and other methods.\n\nThe suspect was in Buffalo on Friday, the day before the shooting, per Gramaglia, who said he was doing reconnaissance at the store.\n\nShonnell Harris Teague, an operations manager at the store, saw him Friday afternoon at the store and told him to leave because it appeared he was bothering customers, she told ABC News.\n\nHarris Teague saw the suspect sitting on a bench outside with a camper bag on his back, wearing the same camouflage clothing he wore Saturday, she told ABC. After being asked to leave, he did so without argument, she said.\n\nHer brother, the Rev. Tim Newkirk, backed up the account, noting the suspect “was in there posing as a beggar and was looking for change,” he told The Buffalo News.\n\n“She had to politely escort him out. They have a no peddling policy in the Tops, no panhandling,” Newkirk said, “so she was just letting him know that this was not the place where you do that.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Buffalo pastor on shooting: We have to resist the impulse to forget 02:59 - Source: CNN Buffalo pastor on shooting: We have to resist the impulse to forget 02:59\n\nHe spent months plotting his attack, social media posts show\n\nGendron is believed to have visited Buffalo in early March, Gramaglia said Monday, citing the suspect’s “digital footprint.” Social media posts analyzed by CNN reveal the suspect visited the Tops store in March and had been extensively planning his attack for several months up until the day of the shooting.\n\nAccording to the posts – which Gendron originally shared on Discord, then on the hate-filled online forum 4Chan – the suspect drove March 8 to the supermarket in Buffalo.\n\nThe posts were made visible to a small group of people about 30 minutes before the shooting began, according to a statement from Discord.\n\nGendron wrote in the posts that he went into Tops Market three times during his visit: at 12 p.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. He wrote about activity inside the store each time he went in – noting how many Black and White people were in the market and also drawing a map of the inside of the store.\n\nDuring his 4 p.m. visit, Gendron was approached by a “Black armed security guard” who asked the suspect what he was doing going in and out of the store, he wrote. The shooter told the security guard he was collecting “consensus data,” according to the posts.\n\n“In hindsight that was a close call,” Gendron wrote.\n\nIn a post on March 10, Gendron wrote, “I’m going to have to kill that security guard at Tops I hope he doesn’t kill me or even hurt me instantly.”\n\nThe shooter wrote about how he planned his attack for March 15 but then delayed it several times.\n\nIn the posts, Gendron cites online research in choosing Buffalo as his site of attack – saying the 14208 ZIP code in Buffalo has a higher Black population than the other locations he was considering.\n\nThe shooter considered attacking a church or an elementary school but ultimately chose the supermarket because of the number of people that go to grocery stores, he wrote.\n\nHe referred to Google’s “popular times” graph for the Tops Friendly Market in determining the time he would plan his attack – so the grocery store would be busiest.\n\nDiscord said that a “private, invite-only server” was created by the suspect and that “approximately 30 minutes prior to the attack,” a small group of people was invited to and joined the server.\n\n“Before that, our records indicate no other people saw the diary chat log in this private server,” it said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families,” the company said. “Hate has no place on Discord and we are committed to combating violence and extremism. We are continuing to do everything we can to assist law enforcement and the investigation remains ongoing.”\n\nCNN asked the Discord spokesperson when the company became aware of Gendron’s posts and if any of the individuals who were invited to view his private server alerted moderators to the content but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nCNN also reached out to 4Chan asking about Gendron’s posts being shared on the platform but has not heard back.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It is White supremacy': CNN speaks to son of Buffalo massacre victim 03:06 - Source: CNN 'It is White supremacy': CNN speaks to son of Buffalo massacre victim 03:06\n\nDocument talks about ‘dwindling size’ of White population\n\nInvestigators are sifting for clues in a 180-page document attributed to Gendron and posted online, Flynn said. The purported “manifesto” allegedly was written by the suspect, officials have said.\n\n“We are obviously going through that with a fine-toothed comb and reviewing that for all evidence that may lead us to besides the manifesto itself,” prosecutor Flynn told CNN.\n\n“All the evidence that we ascertain from that manifesto, from wherever that manifesto leads us, other pieces of evidence we already had, we can then use that and develop more charges potentially,” he added.\n\nThe document, independently obtained by CNN shortly after the attack and before authorities released the suspect’s name, is allegedly written by a person claiming to be Payton Gendron confessing to the attack.\n\nThe author attributes the internet for most of his beliefs and describes himself as a fascist, a White supremacist and an anti-Semite.\n\nThe author bought ammo for some time but didn’t get serious about planning the attack until January, per the document. The author also writes about his perceptions of the dwindling size of the White population and claims of ethnic and cultural replacement of Whites.\n\nThe suspect allegedly chose to attack the Tops store in Buffalo because it was in a majority-Black ZIP code within driving distance of where he lived, and he researched what time it would be busiest, according to the document.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Stelter: Shooting is 'replacement theory' rearing its ugly head again 05:04 - Source: CNN Stelter: Shooting is 'replacement theory' rearing its ugly head again 05:04\n\nHe’s from a town hours away from Buffalo\n\nThe ZIP code that includes the store, 14208, is 78% Black – the highest percentage of Black population of any ZIP code in upstate New York – per the Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey. Conklin, where the suspect is from, is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Buffalo.\n\nGendron’s parents were not known to hold extremist views, according to two New York residents who have worked with his parents at the state Department of Transportation and who shared their views on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\n“I never thought of the family as racist or hateful,” said one coworker, who said she was heartbroken for the victims’ families as well as Payton’s parents, Pam and Paul. “I can’t wrap my head around this tragedy.”\n\nPayton Gendron talks with his attorney during his arraignment Saturday in Buffalo City Court. Mark Mulville/AP\n\nGendron was a worker at the local Conklin Reliable Market for about four months before he left about three months ago, the store’s owner said, adding he was very quiet and left on his own terms, giving two weeks’ notice.\n\nGendron’s mother regularly would walk in the neighborhood, neighbors said. She was a nice woman, one said, adding they “never would have thought that in a million years” Gendron would have racist views. “It’s pretty shocking,” the neighbor added.\n\nWhen you talked to Payton Gendron, “you wouldn’t get more than a word or two” from him, another neighbor said.\n\nGendron’s former classmates said while he could sometimes be a loner and “odd,” he wasn’t known to be violent.\n\n“I just don’t understand what convinced him to do this,” said Bryce Gibbs, who said he attended elementary through high school with Gendron and described him as “nice.”\n\nHe made ‘generalized threat’ at high school\n\nGendron made a “generalized threat” in June while he attended Susquehanna Valley Central High School in Conklin, Gramaglia said Sunday, adding the threat was not racially motivated.\n\nState police took the student for a mental health evaluation, Gramaglia said at a Buffalo news conference. After a day and a half, he was released.\n\nThe suspect was visited last year by New York State Police after he did a high school project about murder-suicides, Garcia told CNN on Monday. Concerns about alleged mental health issues “were brought to light” after he turned in the post-graduation project, the sheriff said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I'm sad, I'm hurt, I'm mad': Buffalo reacts to racially motivated shooting 01:25 - Source: CNN 'I'm sad, I'm hurt, I'm mad': Buffalo reacts to racially motivated shooting 01:25\n\nState police spokesperson Beau Duffy said that on June 8, 2021, state police officers responded to the high school to investigate a report that a 17-year-old student made a threatening statement. The student was taken into custody under NYS Mental Health Law section 9.41 and transported to a hospital for a mental health evaluation.\n\nDuffy confirmed it was an evaluation and not an involuntary commitment – so it would not have prevented the suspected shooter from purchasing or possessing a gun under federal law.\n\nState police were unable to confirm how long the person was in the hospital or the findings of the evaluation. The agency also refused to name the then-17-year-old.\n\nThe suspect addressed the incident in posts on Discord later shared on 4Chan, writing in a post-dated January 30 that he “had to go to a hospital’s ER because I said the word’s ‘murder/suicide’ to an online paper in economics class.”\n\n“I got out of it,” the suspect claims, “because I stuck with the story that I was getting out of class and I just stupidly wrote that down. That is the reason I believe I am still able to purchase guns.”\n\n“It was not a joke,” the post reads, “I wrote that down because that’s what I was planning to do.”\n\nThe suspect goes on to claim his mental health evaluation lasted only 15 minutes after he spent hours waiting in the emergency room. CNN has reached out to New York State police about this account.\n\nBroome County District Attorney Michael Korchak, the district attorney in the suspect’s hometown, is reviewing “all aspects” of last year’s investigation into the threat and also “going back several years” to understand the suspected shooter’s behavior and relationships with family, teachers and other students.\n\nBut it’s “hard to say” whether more should have been done in June, Korchak told CNN.\n\n“Unfortunately this is nothing new in the criminal justice system,” Korchak said. “Individuals that have mental health issues may have it under control for a period of time, and then one day they just snap and things as tragic as this happen.”\n\nInvestigators are talking to the suspect’s parents and they are being cooperative, Korchak said.\n\nGun was legally purchased, governor says\n\nThe gun used in the mass shooting was purchased legally in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN earlier, describing the weapon as an AR-15. It’s believed the high-capacity magazine was purchased out of state, the governor added.\n\nIn addition to the AR-15, Gendron had a rifle and a shotgun in his car, Gramaglia said. The online diatribe attributed to Gendron said he planned to bring those same three types of guns with him that day.\n\nHere’s how the suspect legally obtained guns\n\nThe “main firearm” Gendron planned to use was a Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle that he bought from Vintage Firearms, a gun store in Endicott, New York, before “illegally modifying it,” according to the diatribe. Gendron passed a background check before he bought the gun and he didn’t stick out among his other customers, Vintage Firearms owner, Robert Donald, told The New York Times; no one at the store has responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nGendron also bought a Mossberg 500 shotgun from Pennsylvania Guns and Ammo, a store in Great Bend, about a 10-minute drive across the state border from his hometown of Conklin, the racist document attributed to him states.\n\nThe suspect passed a background check at the store and legally purchased the shotgun in December 2021, the store owner, who did not want his name used, told CNN. The shotgun was not used in Saturday’s shooting.\n\nThe third gun was a Savage Axis XP rifle that Gendron’s father bought for him for Christmas in 2020 “so that I could go hunting without borrowing my cousin’s guns,” the document states.\n\nThe racist statement also says the shooter planned to use the shotgun and rifle to shoot other Black people on the street as he drove away from the supermarket.\n\nCNN obtained a photo of two long guns allegedly brought to the scene. The photo was confirmed by two law enforcement sources.\n\nA photo of two long guns allegedly found in the suspect's car, according to law enforcement sources. CNN\n\nThe image shows the weapons inside a car, which was found by law enforcement after the suspect’s arrest, according to one of the law enforcement sources. The weapons were not used in the shooting. Writing appears all over the weapons, including the phrase “White Lives Matter” and names including what appears to be the name of a victim of a crime allegedly committed by a Black suspect.\n\nOther notations seized by investigators reflect the racist beliefs of the shooter, as well as his obsession with mass killing, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nHe allegedly livestreamed on Twitch\n\nThe shooting suspect used the popular livestreaming platform Twitch to stream a live broadcast during the attack, the company confirmed Saturday.\n\nThe company was “devastated” to hear about the shooting, it said, adding the user “has been indefinitely suspended from our service, and we are taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content.”\n\nCNN obtained a portion of the livestream showing the alleged shooter pulling up to a Tops store.\n\nThe video is recorded from the point of view of the alleged shooter as he drives into the supermarket’s parking lot. The person is seen in the rearview mirror wearing a helmet and is heard saying, “Just got to go for it,” before he pulls into the front of the store.\n\nIn the video, store patrons can be seen walking through the parking lot as the suspect drives up.\n\nThe company removed the livestream less than two minutes after the violence started, a spokesperson for Twitch said. The company did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether the suspect was firing when the livestream was halted.\n\nHe will likely face more charges\n\nThe suspect pleaded not guilty to one count of first-degree murder Saturday evening before Buffalo City Court Chief Judge Craig Hannah, according to the judge and the district attorney’s news release. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, the release said.\n\nGendron’s attorney’s request for a mental health forensic examination was withdrawn, Flynn said. Gendron remains on suicide watch, Garcia said, and in custody without bail.\n\nThere may be more charges coming, officials said.\n\n“My office is working closely with the US Attorney’s Office and our partners in law enforcement into potential terrorism and hate crimes. This is an active investigation and additional charges may be filed,” Flynn said.\n\nGendron is set to return to court Thursday morning for a felony hearing, the release said.\n\nHe is likely the “most highly visible incarcerated individual” in the country, Garcia told CNN on Monday. There are video cameras in his cell, and he remains under a sheriff’s deputy’s watch at all times.", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Christina Maxouris Dakin Andone Samantha Beech Amir Vera", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Samantha Beech", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/us/texas-uvalde-school-officer-investigation/index.html", "title": "Uvalde shooting: School district fires officer after CNN identifies her ...", "text": "Uvalde, Texas CNN —\n\nThe Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District fired a newly hired school officer on Thursday after CNN identified her as one of the officers under investigation for her actions during the Uvalde school massacre in May.\n\nCrimson Elizondo was one of the state troopers who arrived at Robb Elementary within two minutes of a gunman entering the school and opening fire last May.\n\nShe is seen in her Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) uniform, handgun drawn, outside the school building in Uvalde, and then briefly in the hallway on the body camera footage from another law enforcement officer.\n\nLater, she can be heard on body camera footage talking to fellow officers when someone asks if she had children at the school that day.\n\n“If my son had been in there, I would not have been outside,” she said. “I promise you that.”\n\nElizondo was one of the first of the 91 DPS officers to arrive, one of the 376 total law enforcement personnel who went to the school where the shooter was left for 77 minutes – with dead, dying and traumatized victims – before he was stopped. The response to the attack in which 19 children and two teachers were killed has been denounced as an “abject failure” with enough blame to be spread widely.\n\nThe school police chief was fired and now seven DPS officers are being investigated for what they did – or did not – do. CNN has uncovered exclusively that Elizondo is one of those officers being investigated. A source close to the investigation also confirmed that to CNN.\n\nShe no longer works for DPS. During the summer, she was hired as a police officer for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, where her role is to protect some of the very same children who survived the Robb Elementary shooting.\n\nElizondo declined to speak with CNN in person, on the phone or by direct message.\n\nFollowing this CNN report, the school district issued a statement announcing her termination effective Thursday.\n\n“We are deeply distressed by the information that was disclosed yesterday evening concerning one of our recently hired employees, Crimson Elizondo,” the statement from the district said. “We sincerely apologize to the victim’s families and the greater Uvalde community for the pain that this revelation has caused. Ms. Elizondo’s statement in the audio is not consistent with the District’s expectations.”\n\n“Regarding the remaining UCISD Police Department employees, we continue to make personnel decisions based on verifiable information. An independent investigation is underway to evaluate the actions of the current officers on May 24, 2022. Additionally, we are awaiting results of a management and organizational review of the UCISD Police Department that will aid the district in taking informed actions to further ensure the safety and security of our schools,” the statement added.\n\nHowever, the Uvalde School District Police were informed as early as July 28 that Elizondo was subject to investigation by the department’s Office of Inspector General for actions “inconsistent with training and department requirements,” according to documents obtained by CNN in a public records request.\n\nIt is not clear from the letter which actions were subject to investigation.\n\nParents recognized her\n\nCrimson Elizondo was clearly visible on body camera footage from Uvalde police released by the mayor. Much other footage has not been made public. City of Uvalde\n\nUvalde CISD has said it wanted to recruit 10 more officers after the May 24 attack. It did not specifically announce the hiring of Elizondo over the summer, though the names and photos of her and four other police officers, one lieutenant and one security guard are on its website, under the banner “KEEP U.C.I.S.D. SAFE.”\n\nSuperintendent Hal Harrell told a special town hall meeting in August that at least 33 DPS officers would also be deployed around the district’s eight schools. After initial concern by residents that officers who failed to stop the killing would be tasked with school security, parent Brett Cross told CNN he had been assured the deployed DPS officers would not have been responders to the shooting.\n\nIn her new position, that restriction does not apply to Elizondo. Children and parents walked past her as they headed into the school year at Uvalde Elementary, the new home for the younger students who survived the Robb bloodshed.\n\nAnd some parents, including those who lost children in the massacre, recognized her from the body camera footage released by the mayor, family members told CNN.\n\n“We are disgusted and angry at Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District’s (UCISD) decision to hire Officer Crimson Elizondo. Her hiring puts into question the credibility and thoroughness of UCISD’s HR and vetting practices,” according to a statement from family representatives.\n\nIt made them feel uneasy, CNN has learned, yet another reminder of the deadly day in a town that is full of such reminders.\n\nBut they did not know that she was under investigation.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the school district knew of the investigation when she was hired.\n\nThe statement from family representatives calls for all department officers to be suspended pending a third-party investigation, and its results “must be released” to the public as well as families of the victims.\n\n“Our children have been taken from us. We will not stop fighting until we have answers and we ensure the safety of the children in our community is the top priority,” the statement said.\n\nCross, the legal guardian of Uziyah Garcia, one of the children killed at Robb Elementary, says he is “disgusted” by what the district has done.\n\n“I’m absolutely appalled,” he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper and says the school board met with him and offered to pull such officers to off-campus roles. He says he will continue to hold a vigil outside the school board offices until all officers are suspended.\n\nThe district and its staff have not responded to emails and calls and a personal approach from CNN about this story.\n\nSecret scrutiny\n\nTexas DPS, the state body that helps local law enforcement in major incidents, announced an internal review into its employees who responded to Robb.\n\nSources familiar with the investigation confirmed to CNN that Elizondo is one of seven officers whose conduct is being investigated by DPS, but neither their names nor their actions or inactions have been made public.\n\nIn a redacted internal memo to the organization’s director obtained by CNN, DPS cited “actions which may be inconsistent with training and requirements” as the reason for the officers being referred for investigation.\n\nSources familiar with the inquiry told CNN that Elizondo was not properly equipped and said to investigators that she was not comfortable going inside the school without her gear.\n\nElizondo was briefly inside the hallway while the attack was ongoing but was not wearing body armor. City of Uvalde\n\nFootage from police body cameras and those of other officers seen by CNN show Elizondo arriving at the outskirts of the school as one of the first officers to respond to the report of an armed man at Robb Elementary.\n\nShe gets out of her official vehicle but does not retrieve any tactical body armor or her long rifle, as officers are trained to do.\n\nShe does not approach the school but stays with officers from other agencies outside the fence until a call comes over the radio, “Shots fired inside the building!”\n\nElizondo runs with other officers to the eastern end of the building that housed connecting classrooms 111 and 112. Soon after, the responding officers are told that the shooter is contained in a room on the west side.\n\nAfter that, there plays out on the recordings the more than one hour of confusion and delay before anyone goes to help the trapped staff and students in rooms 111 and 112, the catalog of errors that has become part of the Uvalde tragedy.\n\nElizondo walked inside the building briefly but mostly stood outside.\n\nAs officers prepared for what became the final breach, she offered to help a colleague and went to gather supplies for him. She was away from the school when the gunman was shot and killed.\n\nWithin moments, the body camera recordings show, the hallway where so many had stood became a scene of carnage as officers got students out of the classrooms and assessed their injuries.\n\nElizondo was soon there, urging students to “go, go, go” if they were able, and not to look at their injuries or the blood on the floor. She comforted one boy as an officer checked his wounds, telling him time and again that she was there with him, that he would be OK and that his parents would soon be told.\n\nThe footage showed she traveled to the hospital in a school bus with students who were shot and traumatized, again helping to take care of them.\n\nDPS director Col. Steven McCraw said in August: “Every one of our officers will undergo scrutiny by the DA and an internal investigation – just because they didn’t violate the law, doesn’t mean they acted appropriately based on our policy.”\n\nTwo weeks later official notes of a meeting showed McCraw telling captains, “No one is losing their jobs.” McCraw told CNN he had been misquoted in the minutes and vowed “no one gets a pass.”\n\nElizondo, on the right in her new UCISD uniform, declined to talk to CNN. CNN\n\nHe said he would release all the information when he could, but the local district attorney has asked him not to do so until the criminal investigations are completed, a process he has acknowledged could take years.\n\nProsecutor Christina Mitchell Busbee will charge anyone who has committed a crime at Robb Elementary, including law enforcement officers, she’s said.\n\nCNN reached out to the Department of Public Safety, which declined to comment for this story.\n\nA coalition of news organizations including CNN is suing the DPS for records relating to the investigation that have been withheld from the media and public.\n\nSo far, the only person known to have lost their job over the response to the shooting has been school police chief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, who was fired by the school board in August. Arredondo became the figurehead of the failed response, though he has said he did not consider himself the incident commander and has called to be reinstated.\n\nElizondo earned a base salary of $59,715 at DPS, according to a database compiled by The Texas Tribune, reflecting a 12% raise a year ago. She joined the department in 2018.\n\nHer new salary is not known, but a job posting for a similar role has a lower salary range, from $41,584 to $59,158.\n\nThat posting lists mental and physical demands of the position, including an “Ability to effectively deal with personal danger which may include sudden exposure to armed persons … under intense threatening conditions.”\n\nOn May 24, as she rode the school bus back to Robb Elementary from the hospital, she told another officer: “Nothing could prepare you for what they brought out. It was horrible.”", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Matthew J. Friedman Rachel Clarke", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Matthew J.

The deadliest school shooting in modern US history remains the 2007 attack at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, where a 23-year-old student killed 32 people before dying by suicide.\n\nThe shooting at the Charlottesville campus is also one of nearly 600 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN tallies cases in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nShooting prompted immediate lockdowns\n\nThe attack happened Sunday on a bus returning from a class trip to Washington, DC, where the class had seen a play, university officials said. It was not immediately clear if Jones was part of that class or attended the field trip.\n\nPolice responded to a report of shots fired around 10:30 p.m. in an area near a parking garage on Culbreth Road and surrounded by academic buildings, Ryan said.

The school canceled classes Tuesday to “to give “students the opportunity to reflect, mourn and gather with each other,” according to a news release. A family and community assistance center has also been set up on campus to provide UVA community members with mental health services, according to UVA Emergency Management officials.\n\nClasses were also canceled Monday at Charlottesville City Schools, the K-12 district said in a letter to families. A UVA men’s basketball game scheduled for Monday evening has also been canceled, the university said.\n\nIn a statement, an attorney for Perry’s parents thanked the communities in both Charlottesville and South Florida – Perry was originally from Miami, the university said – for “the outpouring of support during this impossibly tragic time.\n\nHappy and Sean Perry would not speak publicly at this time about their son’s death, attorney Michael Haggard said, out of respect for the university community, which “has been terrorized by another mass shooting in the United States.”\n\nSuspect had been known to campus police\n\nJones had come to campus authorities’ attention in September, when authorities found out Jones “had made a comment about possessing a gun” to someone “unaffiliated with the university,” Longo said at Monday’s news conference.

The school’s judicial council took over the case, and the results are pending.\n\nJones was also involved in a hazing investigation on campus that was closed because witnesses would not cooperate, Longo said.\n\nIt is “important to share that information with you,” he said, “to let you know that he had been called to our attention.”\n\nJones is listed on UVA’s athletics website as a football player in 2018 who as a freshman did not participate in any games. He attended Varina High School and Petersburg High School, where he played football as a linebacker and running back, according to his university athletics bio. While in high school, Jones was Key Club president and a member of the National Honor Society and the National Technical Honor Society, the bio says.\n\nA UVA spokesperson told CNN Jones had a pre-existing injury that prevented him from playing on the football team in 2018.

It was just after 10 p.m. when they heard the popping noises, the students said, but they didn’t think anything of it. The bus was going over a speed bump, they said, but then they saw it stop and saw emergency lights turn on.\n\nThe bus doors opened, the students said, and they saw people running out. The students told CNN they saw one fall to the ground.\n\nThe students hid behind a brick wall in front of the nearby band building before calling 911 around 10:17 p.m., they said. The call wasn’t answered, the students said, but they hung up when they heard sirens in the distance and saw law enforcement arrive.\n\nState and federal prosecutors are helping local agencies in the investigation, according to a joint statement from the US attorney for the Western District of Virginia and commonwealth’s attorneys for Charlottesville and for Albemarle County. The officials pledged to support the investigation and “bring possible charges in the appropriate jurisdiction,” the statement said.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday called the shooting a “horrific tragedy” and praised the work of law enforcement for taking the suspect into custody, according to a tweet. “While there are still many details to uncover, let us lift up the entire community in prayer.” The governor earlier had said Virginia State Police were “fully coordinating” with school and local police.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spoke on the shooting shortly after swearing in a new ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago on Monday.\n\n“It’s tragic,” Harris said. “Of course, our prayers are with the families of the victims and it’s just yet a constant reminder that we have to do better in terms of gun safety laws in our country.”\n\nMeantime, another US campus – the University of Idaho – is reeling after police announced a homicide inquiry after officers Sunday discovered four people deceased in a home just outside Moscow campus grounds. The deceased were students, and the cause of their deaths is not yet known, the university confirmed, adding the threat has ended.\n\nSeparately, Charlottesville Police arrested a man in connection to “threatening social media posts” against UVA on Monday, but said they don’t believe the threats were tied to the earlier shooting.\n\n“We understand the fear this caused in our community and acted swiftly to resolve this investigation,” a Charlottesville police news release said.\n\nSunday’s shooting is the University of Virginia’s latest high-profile run-in with violence: White nationalists in August 2017 marched across campus carrying torches and chanting racist slogans.

The other is an infant who is not a US resident. Public health officials are investigating how the children were infected.\n\nBoth have symptoms but are in good health and receiving treatment with an antiviral medication named tecovirimat or TPOXX, which the CDC recommends for children under the age of 8 because they are considered to be at higher risk from infection.\n\nSince the monkeypox outbreak began in May, most of the cases have happened among men who have sex with men. However, anyone can catch the virus through close skin-to-skin contact. In the case of children, the agency said this could include “holding, cuddling, feeding, as well as through shared items such as towels, bedding, cups, and utensils.”\n\nThe CDC says the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine is being made available for children through special expanded use protocols. The agency has also developed new guidance for health care providers about identifying, treating and preventing monkeypox in children and teens.\n\nDr. Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the CDC’s Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, said Friday that the cases in children were not surprising and that the US should be ready to respond to more.\n\n“The social networks that we have as humans mean that we have contact with a lot of different people. And while this outbreak is spreading in a particular social network right now, I think we’ve messaged from the start that there could be cases that occur outside those networks and that we need to be vigilant for it and ready to respond and message about it,” she said.\n\n“I know that in Europe and other places where this outbreak is also expanding, they have reported cases in children, in women. And I think the same thing is happening and expected to happen here in the United States,” she said.\n\n“There is no evidence to date that we’re seeing this virus spread outside of those populations to any degree,” McQuiston said.\n\nVaccine supply improves\n\nThe US government has shipped 300,000 monkeypox vaccines to US states and territories as of Friday afternoon.\n\n“That means hundreds of thousands of Americans are going to be getting vaccinated in a matter of days or weeks,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said Friday. “Jurisdictions, states territories, cities are getting their vaccines typically about 30 hours after ordering them.”\n\nJha said Friday that New York City had received enough monkeypox vaccine to provide at least one dose to about half its eligible population, while DC had gotten enough to provide one dose to 70% of its eligible population.\n\nThe newly released doses increase available supply, but they cover just a small portion of the eligible population. The CDC estimates that more than 1.5 million people are eligible for the monkeypox vaccine.\n\nThe prescribing information for the Jynneos vaccine says a full course is two shots given four weeks apart. The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration have said that people need both doses to fully prevent disease.\n\nBut in New York City and some other places seeing a high degree of viral spread, officials have been giving out a first shot to as many people as they can, even before second doses are available.\n\nThat strategy makes sense, Jha said Friday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“The FDA and CDC clearly believe that people need two doses. And the reason that New York and many other places have been able to move forward with a first dose out to everybody, is because we’ve been able to show them that more doses are coming and that second doses will be able to be given to people,” he said. “So given that, we encourage people to go ahead and use up all their doses as first doses.”\n\nPeople are eligible to be vaccinated for monkeypox if they know that they were exposed to the virus or if they suspect that they were exposed because they had multiple sexual partners or were at an event where monkeypox is known to have spread.\n\n“We continue to see the majority of cases in the United States as being reported among individuals who identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men,” McQuiston said. More than 99% of the US monkeypox cases for which the CDC has information have involved male-to-male sexual contact.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman Deidre Mcphillips", "Brenda Goodman", "Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/us/r-kelly-sentencing-racketeering-sex-trafficking/index.html", "title": "R. Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison for federal racketeering and ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nDisgraced R&B singer R. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison Wednesday following his conviction last year on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from his efforts over years to use his fame to ensnare victims he sexually abused.\n\nProsecutors had asked the judge to sentence Kelly, 55, to more than 25 years behind bars, while his defense attorneys asked for 10 or fewer, saying prosecutors’ request was “tantamount to a life sentence.”\n\nSurvivors of Kelly’s abuse held hands and prayed as US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly began reading his sentence. Kelly – who wore a tan prison uniform, dark-rimmed glasses and a black mask at the hearing in federal court in Brooklyn – showed no emotion.\n\n“You left in your wake a trail of broken lives,” Donnelly told Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly.\n\nIn deciding the sentence, Donnelly said she considered Kelly’s own traumatic childhood, during which his attorneys said he was repeatedly sexually abused by a family member and a landlord.\n\n“It may explain, at least in part, what led to your behavior,” the judge said. “It most surely is not an excuse.”\n\nJovante Cunningham, a former backup singer for Kelly, praised the sentence.\n\n“I started this journey 30 years ago,” Cunningham said outside the court after the hearing. “There wasn’t a day in my life up until this moment that I actually believed that the judicial system would come through for Black and brown girls. I stand here very proud of my judicial system, very proud of my fellow survivors and very pleased with the outcome.”\n\nA jury convicted Kelly last September on nine counts, including one charge of racketeering and eight counts of violations of the Mann Act, a sex trafficking law. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York accused Kelly of using his status as a celebrity and a “network of people at his disposal to target girls, boys and young women for his own sexual gratification.”\n\nThe five-week federal trial in Brooklyn included testimony from witnesses who said they were sexually and physically abused by Kelly. The court also heard from people involved with orchestrating the disgraced R&B singer’s 1994 marriage to the late singer Aaliyah when she was just 15 years old and he was an adult after she believed she’d gotten pregnant.\n\nKelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said he would not address the court, pointing to the other criminal case faced by Kelly, but said before the sentence was read that her client “rejects that he is this monster.”\n\n“He accepts that he is a flawed individual,” Bonjean said, “but he is not this one-dimensional monster that the government has portrayed and the media has portrayed.”\n\nKelly made his only comment in response to the judge after Bonjean said he wouldn’t speak: “Yes, your honor, that’s my wish.”\n\nBonjean said she advised Kelly not to speak at the sentencing because of pending litigation against him, but added, “he has regrets. And he is sad. Nobody wants to hear what he heard today.”\n\nKelly and the judge are seen in a sketch of the sentencing. Sketch by Christine Cornell\n\n‘No one can undo the harm’\n\nPrior to sentencing, the court heard impact statements from seven of Kelly’s victims, including Jane Doe 2, who testified at trial.\n\n“It’s been 23 years since we knew each other, and you’ve victimized a lot of girls since then,” she said, addressing Kelly. She later added: “Now it’s your turn to have your freedom taken from you.”\n\n“No one can undo the harm that has been done to these victims,” attorney Gloria Allred, who represented three victims who testified, told reporters Wednesday outside court. “But at least it’s time for Mr. Kelly to be accountable.”\n\nDefense attorneys and prosecutors argued Wednesday in court over whether Kelly even could pay a fine. The defense said he is “pretty close to indigent” and could not. Prosecutors disagreed, saying money from the sale of some of his music rights and millions of dollars in royalties held by Sony could cover any fine.\n\nIn the nine months since his conviction, Kelly has replaced his entire legal team with Bonjean and her firm. Bonjean is the attorney who helped Bill Cosby get his sexual assault conviction overturned and also represented Cosby in a civil case he lost this month at trial.\n\n“We were prepared for it,” Bonjean said of the sentence outside the court. “We are now prepared to fight this appeal.”\n\nKelly is being held at a federal detention facility in Brooklyn and is expected to be moved back to Chicago, where he faces another federal trial in August on child pornography and obstruction charges.\n\nBonjean will ask for Kelly to continue to be held at the Brooklyn federal detention center as her team prepares for his upcoming trial, she told CNN on Thursday, adding she is based in New York. CNN has sought comment from the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Bureau of Prisons and US Marshals, who would be tasked with moving Kelly.\n\nKelly also has state cases pending in Illinois and Minnesota.\n\nChildhood trauma revealed\n\nIn over 14 hours of interviews with psychiatrist experts, Kelly said his closest relationship growing up was with his mother. His earliest memories were watching his mom perform as a singer in a band called “Six Pack,” and he would often accompany her to McDonald’s where she would drink coffee and they would share a pastry.\n\nKelly had never met his father and described his mother’s death as the most tragic event of his life, saying he would go to McDonald’s frequently to smell the coffee and remember her, according to a letter filed by Renee Sorrentino, a clinical assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\n“To me, the ‘M’ stands for mom. Going to McDonald’s is always being around my mother,” Kelly said.\n\nBut his childhood was also marked by trauma.\n\nKelly saw a childhood sweetheart drown when he was a little boy. And people interviewed by psychiatrist experts say Kelly was repeatedly sexually abused beginning when he was a 6 or 7-year-old boy, his attorney wrote, saying he was abused by his older sister and also a landlord, at times on a “weekly basis.”\n\nSorrentino said in her letter Kelly’s childhood sexual abuse may have contributed to his “hypersexuality,” or difficulty controlling sexual urges, and believes it was a factor in his criminal convictions.\n\nWhile Kelly was convicted of sexual exploitation of a child, Sorrentino refused to diagnose Kelly with pedophilia because he told her his “sexual behavior has never involved prepubescent individuals,” she said.\n\nFaith, another woman who testified at Kelly’s trial, countered that defense argument Wednesday in her victim impact statement, saying her own father had also been sexually abused as a child but “never molested me.”\n\nSupport for the singer\n\nAmong the letters that asked for a shorter sentence for Kelly was one written by Diana Copeland, Kelly’s former assistant who testified as a government witness and said she wrote a letter in support of Kelly because it was the “right thing to do.”\n\n“God doesn’t want us to throw humans away,” Copeland wrote. “If we have the audacity to care for the perpetrators as well as the victims, we can all rise.”\n\nJoycelyn Savage, who was considered a victim of Kelly’s by prosecutors, also remains a supporter.\n\n“Robert and I are deeply in love and it breaks my heart that the government has created a narrative that I’m a victim,” Savage wrote. “I’m a grown woman, and can speak for myself which is why I wanted to provide this letter to the court.”\n\nIn her letter, Savage revealed she is now engaged to Kelly.\n\nProsecutors faced threats\n\nAhead of the sentencing, a Chicago man who had attended Kelly’s trial in Brooklyn was arrested and charged for making threats against the three US attorneys who prosecuted Kelly, a copy of his arrest warrant shows.\n\nChristopher Gunn was arrested Saturday for allegedly posting threats to kill or seriously injure the female prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the arrest warrant, Gunn posted video to his YouTube channel in October, shortly after Kelly was found guilty, that showed an image of the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York where the women work. Prosecutors believe a voice narrating the video is Gunn’s, and he says, “That’s where they at. That’s where they work at … We’re going to storm the office,” saying each of the three prosecutors’ names.\n\n“If you ain’t got the stomach for the sh*t we ‘bout to do, I’m asking that you just bail out,” he allegedly said in the video.\n\nProsecutors also analyzed a CashApp account linked to Gunn that shows multiple transactions from February 26, 2021, to June 1 that indicate Gunn “engaged in the sale of firearm ammunition in relation to the Kelly matter,” they said. Transactions included payments for $20 with descriptions saying “30 rounds.. free R kelly.” CNN has reached out to an attorney for Kelly for comment.\n\nProsecutors believe Gunn was planning to attend Kelly’s sentencing on Wednesday after he posted another video saying he had a “spot” for supporters to meet up near the courthouse.\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for Gunn, who is expected to have a detention hearing Friday.

The statements were clear and filled with hate toward the Black community. Investigators also uncovered other information from search warrants and other methods indicating the alleged shooter was “studying” previous hate attacks and shootings, the official said.\n\nThe revelation comes a day after a gunman killed 10 people and wounded three others at the Tops Friendly Markets store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo. Eleven of the people who were shot were Black, officials said. The victims range in age from 20 to 86, police said. Buffalo police identified all 13 victims Sunday.

Buffalo, my hometown, is the City of Good Neighbors and New York State will be good neighbors for them.”\n\nNew York State’s Office of Victim Services will be in Buffalo throughout the week to help administer funding and assist victims and families in obtaining financial assistance from the state, according to the statement.\n\nIn addition, Hochul announced a partnership with rideshare services Uber and Lyft to provide transport to and from local grocery stores for affected community members.\n\nThe grocery store company, Tops Markets, is also providing free transportation to members of the Buffalo community affected by the shooting “to ensure our neighbors are able to meet their grocery and pharmacy needs,” according to an update on Twitter from the grocery chain.\n\n“While the Tops location at Jefferson Avenue will remain closed until further notice, we are steadfast in our commitment to serving every corner of our community as we have for the past 60 years,” the statement reads. “Knowing the importance of this location and serving families on the east side of the city, we have taken immediate steps to ensure our neighbors are able to meet their grocery and pharmacy needs by providing free bus shuttle service starting today.”\n\nSaturday’s attack bears similarities to a number of mass shootings in recent years that were motivated by hate and intended to be seen online, including the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019.\n\nThe Buffalo attack was the deadliest US mass shooting of the year. There have been at least 198 mass shootings so far in 2022, per the Gun Violence Archive, which – like CNN – defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot, not including the shooter.\n\nThe owner of a firearms shop in New York told The New York Times that the suspect recently bought a Bushmaster assault weapon. A background check on the suspect at the time showed nothing, Donald told the Times.\n\n“I knew nothing about it until I got the call from them. I couldn’t believe it,” said Robert Donald, whose shop is in Endicott, about 200 miles from Buffalo.\n\n“I just can’t believe it. I don’t understand why an 18-year-old would even do this,” he added. “I know I didn’t do anything wrong, but I feel terrible about it.”\n\nSuspect targeted predominantly Black area\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Shooting suspect charged with murder in court appearance 02:17 - Source: WKBW Shooting suspect charged with murder in court appearance WKBW 02:17\n\nInvestigators are reviewing a 180-page purported manifesto posted online in connection with the shooting. The author of the document, who claims to be Payton Gendron, confesses to the attack and describes himself as a fascist, a White supremacist and an anti-Semite.\n\n“We are obviously going through that with a fine-toothed comb and reviewing that for all evidence that may lead us to besides the manifesto itself,” Erie County District Attorney John Flynn told CNN’s Victor Blackwell.\n\nThe manifesto’s author says he bought ammo for some time but didn’t get serious about planning the attack until January.\n\nThe author writes about his perceptions of the dwindling size of the White population and claims White people are being replaced by non-Whites in a “White genocide.” This “replacement theory,” once a fringe idea, has recently become a talking point for Fox News’ host Tucker Carlson as well as other prominent conservatives.\n\n“We continue to investigate this case as a hate crime, a federal hate crime and as a crime perpetrated by a racially motivated, violent extremist,” said Stephen Belongia, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Buffalo field office.\n\nIn the manifesto, the author says the supermarket in Buffalo is in a ZIP code that “has the highest black percentage that is close enough to where I live.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN investigators believe the suspect targeted the busiest place in that area at the busiest time.\n\n“This was targeted by ZIP code,” Hochul said. “This was the highest concentration of African Americans within hours.”\n\nThe ZIP code that includes the store, 14208, is 78% Black, according to the US Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey. That is the highest percentage of Black population of any ZIP code in upstate New York.\n\nHochul said an AR-15 used in the shooting was purchased legally in a gun store in New York state but was modified with a high-capacity magazine, which is not legal in the state.\n\nThe suspected gunman had previously been on the radar of police, officials said.\n\nAs a student at Susquehanna Valley Central High School, he made a “generalized threat” in June 2021, Gramaglia said. The student was brought in for a mental health evaluation and was released after a day and a half, according to Gramaglia. The threat was not racially motivated, he added.\n\nA spokesman for the New York State Police confirmed to CNN it investigated and responded to a report that a 17-year-old student had made “a threatening statement” in June 2021 at the same high school. The student was taken into custody and transported to a hospital in June 2021 for a mental health evaluation.\n\nState police were unable to confirm how long the individual was in the hospital or the findings of the evaluation. They also refused to name the 17-year-old.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Hochul said on ABC’s “This Week” the suspect had previously been under surveillance with medical authorities related to “something he wrote in high school.”\n\nIn his hometown, the suspect worked at the local Conklin Reliable Market for about four months and left about three months ago, according to the store’s owner. The owner described him as very quiet, while a neighbor similarly said “you wouldn’t get more than a word or two” from him.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Mayor identifies hero who engaged shooter 01:34 - Source: CNN Mayor identifies hero who engaged shooter 01:34\n\nAt around 2:30 p.m., the suspect drove to Tops Friendly Markets near the areas of Masten Park and Kingsley. Wearing tactical gear and armed with an assault weapon, the suspect allegedly shot and killed three people in the parking lot and wounded a fourth, according to a statement from Erie County District Attorney John J. Flynn.\n\nThe suspect then entered the store and exchanged gunfire with an armed security guard who was a retired member of the Buffalo Police Department, the district attorney said. The guard was identified as Aaron Salter, Brown said.\n\nBecause the suspect wore heavy tactical gear, however, the guard’s bullets did not have any effect, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said Saturday.\n\n“He was very heavily armed,” the police commissioner said. “He had tactical gear, he had a tactical helmet on, he had a camera that he was livestreaming what he was doing.”\n\nInside the store, nine people were shot before the suspect was apprehended by police, according to the district attorney’s statement.\n\nIn a statement sent to CNN, livestreaming service Twitch confirmed the shooting was streamed and said the user “has been indefinitely suspended from our service, and we are taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content.”\n\nCNN obtained a portion of the livestream which showed the suspect arriving at the supermarket in his vehicle. CNN is not airing the video.\n\nPeople hug near the scene of the mass shooting at the Tops Friendly Markets store Saturday. Joshua Bessex/AP\n\nGrady Lewis said he was outside the supermarket when he heard seven or eight gunshots and saw a White man dressed in tactical gear spraying gunfire at the entry of the store. Law enforcement arrived within two minutes after the shooting began, Lewis told CNN affiliate WKBW. He “heard at least 20 or so shots” before the suspect exited the store.\n\n“He came out, he put the gun to his head, to his chin. Then he dropped it and took off his bulletproof vest, then got on his hands and knees and put his hands behind his back,” Lewis said, describing the moments the suspect was arrested by police. “I thought they were going to shoot him but they didn’t shoot him.”\n\n“I still don’t even believe it happened … that a person would go into a supermarket full of people,” he said. “It was horrible, it was really horrible.”\n\nThe Tops Friendly Markets store released a statement Sunday saying it was heartbroken over the violence. “Tops has been committed to this community and to the city of Buffalo for decades and this tragedy will not change that commitment,” the company said.", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Sarah Jorgensen Polo Sandoval Samantha Beech", "Eric Levenson", "Sarah Jorgensen", "Polo Sandoval", "Samantha Beech"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/politics/nuclear-fusion-energy-us-scientists-climate/index.html", "title": "US scientists reach long-awaited nuclear fusion breakthrough ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor the first time ever, US scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, a source familiar with the project confirmed to CNN.\n\nThe US Department of Energy is expected to officially announce the breakthrough Tuesday.\n\nThe result of the experiment would be a massive step in a decadeslong quest to unleash an infinite source of clean energy that could help end dependence on fossil fuels. Researchers for decades have attempted to recreate nuclear fusion – replicating the fusion that powers the sun.\n\nUS Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm will make an announcement Tuesday on a “major scientific breakthrough,” the department announced Sunday. The breakthrough was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nNuclear fusion happens when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one, a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat. Unlike nuclear fission that powers electricity all over the world, it doesn’t generate long-lived radioactive waste.\n\nScientists across the globe have been inching toward the breakthrough, using different methods to try to achieve the same goal.\n\nThe National Ignition Facility project creates energy from nuclear fusion by what’s known as “thermonuclear inertial fusion.” In practice, US scientists fire pellets that contain a hydrogen fuel into an array of nearly 200 lasers, essentially creating a series of extremely fast, repeated explosions at the rate of 50 times per second.\n\nThe energy collected from the neutrons and alpha particles is extracted as heat, and that heat holds the key to producing energy.\n\n“They contain the fusion reaction by bombarding the outside with lasers,” Tony Roulstone, a fusion expert from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Engineering, told CNN. “They heat up the outside; that creates a shockwave.”\n\nEven though getting a net energy gain from nuclear fusion is a big deal, it’s happening on a much smaller scale than what’s needed to power electric grids and heat buildings.\n\n“It’s about what it takes to boil 10 kettles of water,” said Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College in London. “In order to turn that into a power station, we need to make a larger gain in energy – we need it to be substantially more.”\n\nIn the UK, scientists are working with a huge donut-shaped machine outfitted with giant magnets called a tokamak to try to generate the same result.\n\nAfter a small amount of fuel is injected into the tokamak, giant magnets are activated to create a plasma. The plasma needs to reach at least 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. This forces the particles from the fuel to fuse into one. With nuclear fusion, the fused product has less mass than the original atoms. The missing mass converts to an enormous amount of energy.\n\nNeutrons, which are able to escape the plasma, then hit a “blanket” lining the walls of the tokamak, and their kinetic energy transfers as heat. This heat can then be used to warm water, create steam and power turbines to generate power.\n\nLast year, scientists working near Oxford were able to generate a record-breaking amount of sustained energy. Even so, it only lasted 5 seconds.\n\nWhether it’s using magnets or shooting pellets with lasers, the result is ultimately the same: Heat sustained by the process of fusing the atoms together holds the key to helping produce energy.\n\nNIF's target chamber is where the magic happens -- temperatures of 100 million degrees and pressures extreme enough to compress the target to densities up to 100 times the density of lead are created there. Damien Jemison/LLNL\n\nThe big challenge of harnessing fusion energy is sustaining it long enough so that it can power electric grids and heating systems around the globe.\n\nChittenden and Roulstone told CNN that scientists around the globe now must work toward dramatically scaling up their fusion projects, and also bring the cost down. Getting it commercially viable will take years of more research.\n\n“At the moment we’re spending a huge amount of time and money for every experiment we do,” Chittenden said. “We need to bring the cost down by a huge factor.”\n\nHowever, Chittenden called this new chapter in nuclear fusion “a true breakthrough moment which is tremendously exciting.”\n\nRoulstone said there’s much shows more work needs to happen to make fusion able to generate electricity on a commercial scale.\n\n“The opposing argument is that this result is miles away from actual energy gain required for the production of electricity,” he said. “Therefore, we can say (it) is a success of the science but a long way from providing useful energy.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen René Marsh", "Ella Nilsen", "René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/us/delphi-teen-killings-indiana-state-police-update/index.html", "title": "Delphi murders: A man has been arrested and charged in the 2017 ...", "text": "“The Delphi Murders: Who Killed Abby & Libby?” premieres tonight at 10 ET on HLN.\n\nDelphi, Indiana CNN —\n\nA five-and-a-half-year nationwide search for a suspect in the killings of two Indiana teens ended with the arrest of a local man, authorities said Monday.\n\nHow investigators came to arrest 50-year-old Richard M. Allen, of Delphi, will remain a mystery for now, as a court has sealed charging documents and the investigation remains open, but authorities say Allen is charged with two counts of murder in the 2017 slayings of Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14.\n\nThe pair went for a hike along Delphi Historic Trails in February of that year but never showed up at a previously arranged time to meet Libby’s dad, police said. Their bodies were found the next day in a wooded area near the trail, about a half mile from the Monon High Bridge where they’d been dropped off, according to police. A grainy video of a man walking and a garbled voice recording were among the scant clues authorities publicized over the years.\n\nNeighbors saw police searching Allen’s home two and a half weeks ago, they say. Police arrested Allen on Wednesday, according to a news release, and formally charged him Friday before transporting him to White County Jail. Allen is being held without bail.\n\n“Today is not a day to celebrate, but the arrest … is sure a major step in leading to a conclusion of this long term and complex investigation,” Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter told reporters.\n\nAsked the family’s reaction to news of Allen’s arrest, Carter said, “It was a very sad, yet a very humbling experience.”\n\nAllen pleaded not guilty at an initial hearing, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland said. He is scheduled to return to court for a pretrial hearing January 13. His trial is slated to begin the morning of March 20, the prosecutor said.\n\nSuspect assisted with funeral photos, aunt says\n\nCVS confirmed that Allen worked for the drug store chain but did not specify where. The company is shocked and devastated, it said in a statement, and stands “ready to cooperate with the police investigation in any way we can.”\n\nLibby’s grandmother, Becky Patty, and aunt, Tara German, were informed someone was in custody Wednesday, and on Friday, they learned it was Allen, who police said worked at the CVS in Delphi, they said. Patty does not know Allen, she said, but German is a regular at the CVS and knew Allen from shopping at the store. She recalled a specific encounter with Allen following Libby’s death.\n\n“I went into the store to print photos of Libby for the funeral, and he was the one who helped me,” German said. “I was a mess trying to get the images off my phone. Once they were printed, he looked at me and said, ‘I’m not gonna charge you for this.’”\n\nWhile McLeland said a judge had found probable cause to charge Allen with murder, he declined to elaborate on the reasoning, saying the charging documents and probable cause affidavit were sealed. A court will revisit the decision to seal the documents later, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, tip lines remain open, he said, and investigators are seeking information “not only about Richard Allen, but about any other person you may have.” McLeland declined to elaborate on whether authorities are seeking additional suspects.\n\nLiberty German, left, and Abigail Williams were killed in 2017.\n\n“I know it’s frustrating,” he said. “My goal is to maintain the integrity of this case.”\n\nFollowing Monday’s news conference, Carter told HLN he had “already gotten tips directly since 10 o’clock.”\n\nCarter also declined to provide many details, saying, “We are going to continue a very methodical and committed approach to ensure that if any other person had any involvement in these murders in any way, that person or person will be held accountable.”\n\n“This investigation is far from complete,” he added, “and we will not jeopardize its integrity by releasing or discussing documents or information before the appropriate time.”\n\nWhile details are not yet forthcoming, a couple who lives near Allen and asked not to be named said they saw unmarked police vehicles at Allen’s home October 13. Close to nightfall, a deputy arrived with a sheet of paper, which the deputy showed to Allen before they began searching the house and yard. the neighbors said.\n\nA tow truck took away Allen’s black SUV, they said, and officers exited the home with bundles of cloth or clothing, a stack of books, a shopping bag and a shoebox. They also set up lights in the back yard next to a shed and dug out two small areas, while appearing to use a metal detector, they said. Allen remained outside the home, and his wife left twice, returning the second time after deputies had left.\n\nOne of the neighbors asked a deputy whether he should be worried, and the deputy responded, “Just remain vigilant, especially with your wife and daughters.”\n\nAllen never stood out, the couple said. He lives with his wife and cat and rarely has visitors, they said. They frequently saw him in his driveway smoking cigarettes and drinking beer after work, they said.\n\nLong wait for an arrest\n\nIt’s been 2,086 days since authorities launched their investigation, Carter said. Abby and Libby set out on a hike at the Delphi Historic Trails during a day off from school February 13, 2017. They never returned.\n\nA search began, and 18 hours later their bodies were found in the woods, near an abandoned railroad bridge they’d photographed during their hike. Abby posted to Snapchat a photo of the girls crossing the railroad bridge shortly before they were killed.\n\nAuthorities in 2019 released this sketch of the suspect in Abigail Williams' and Liberty German's killings. Indiana State Police\n\nIt was another image Libby captured that drew headlines across the country – a grainy, pixelated image of a man in a blue jacket and jeans on the bridge. Indiana State Police investigators released the image, saying they believed the man was a suspect in the double homicide.\n\nState police also released audio of the alleged killer saying four words – “… guys … down the hill” – in hopes the public might identify the suspect’s voice.\n\nIn 2019, police released a new sketch and additional video from one of the girl’s cell phones.\n\nThe killings devastated Delphi. Investigators received a dozen or more tips every day, McLeland said in 2019. Libby’s grandparents, Mike and Becky Patty, issued an appeal for help in 2021.\n\n“We are stuck in time looking for a monster that murdered two young girls. We are only asking for one minute out of your day,” they wrote in a letter to the public. “If it was your child or loved one, would you think that is too much to ask?”\n\nIn December, the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office and Indiana State Police asked for the public’s help regarding the social media profile for “anthony_shots,” which they said was used from 2016 to 2017 on Snapchat, Instagram and possibly other social media sites.\n\nThe catfish account “used images of a known male model and portrayed himself as being extremely wealthy and owning numerous sports cars,” a news release said. “The creator of the fictitious profile used this information while communicating with juvenile females to solicit nude images, obtain their addresses, and attempt to meet them.”\n\nTokens sit in the snow at a memorial along the Monon High Bridge Trail in Delphi earlier this year. Nikos Frazier/Journal & Courier/USA Today Network\n\nInvestigators have identified the model, and “he is not a person of interest in the investigation,” they said. Detectives, however, are seeking information about the person who created the profile.\n\nLast week, Cynthia Rossi, a friend of Abby and Liberty who grew up near them, expressed hope that Monday’s announcement would provide closure.\n\n“I’m glad that justice will be served, hopefully, that that’s what the news is, but a part of me will always have died with them that day, and a part of me will never fully find peace and justice,” Rossi said.\n\nAdded Delphi resident Shirley Goyer, “There’s a lot of people that will be there. We’ve been waiting for this, so it’s a good thing that we’re finally getting to the end of it, I hope.”", "authors": ["Emma Tucker Barbara Macdonald Eliott C.

The annual Moundville Native American Festival will be held from Wednesday to Saturday at the University of Alabama Moundville Archaeological Park. This will mark the first in-person festival since 2019, as the event was held online only the past two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of visitors are expected at the festival, which began 34 years ago. “The festival is one the largest events that brings people to the park every year,” said Clay Nelson, director of the UA Moundville Archaeological Park. Holding the festival online was the best option for the past couple of years, but Nelson said there’s no substitute for seeing up close the park’s attractions, which include 29 massive flat-topped earthen mounds. “We can describe the earthen mounds as much as we want, but seeing them in person really helps illustrate what great engineering feats the indigenous peoples of Alabama were doing in the 13th century,” he said. The festival will feature artists, craftsmen and educators from around the nation, who’ll share their knowledge of Native American culture. People will be able to buy Native crafts and food, as well as traditional festival fare.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A fall storm packing strong winds damaged roofs and windows in parts of western and northwest Alaska and resulted in flooding of roads in the far northern city of Utqiagvik, according to damage reports, with a new storm expected to hit the Arctic coast this week. Water levels dropped by midday Saturday across the region, said Jonathan Chriest, a National Weather Service meteorologist. The system forecasters are tracking is expected to bring elevated surf and strong winds to the Arctic coast Tuesday through Thursday, though water levels and winds weren’t expected to be as high as with the last storm, he said Sunday. There commonly are strong storms in northern and western Alaska between September and December, he said. But the storm that just hit parts of western and northwest Alaska and the remnants of Typhoon Merbok, which caused widespread damage in parts of western Alaska last month, were “exceptionally strong” for the areas that each impacted, he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Abortions can take place again in the state, at least for now, after an appeals court on Friday blocked enforcement of a pre-statehood law that almost entirely criminalized the procedure. The three-judge panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals agreed with Planned Parenthood that a judge should not have lifted the decades-old order that prevented the older law from being imposed. The brief order written by Presiding Judge Peter J. Eckerstrom said Planned Parenthood and its Arizona affiliate had shown they are likely to prevail on an appeal of a decision by the judge in Tucson to allow enforcement of the old law. Planned Parenthood had argued that the lower court judge should have considered a host of laws restricting abortions passed since the original injunction was put in place following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that said women have a constitutional right to an abortion. Those laws include a new one blocking abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy that took effect last month. The previous limit was 24 weeks, the viability standard established by now-overruled U.S. Supreme Court cases. “Arizona courts have a responsibility to attempt to harmonize all of this state’s relevant statutes,” Eckerstrom wrote, mirroring arguments made by attorneys for Planned Parenthood.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two deputies who were caught on video violently arresting a suspect outside a convenience store in August have been fired, Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante said Thursday. Damante told Fort Smith television station KHBS that Levi White and Zachary King had been fired but did not elaborate on the decision. A bystander recorded White, King and Mulberry Police Officer Thell Riddle arresting 27-year-old Randal Worcester outside a convenience store in the small town of Mulberry, about 140 miles northwest of Little Rock, near the border with Oklahoma. Mulberry Police Chief Shannon Gregory said Riddle remains on administrative leave. The bystander’s video of the Aug. 21 arrest shows one of the deputies repeatedly punching and kneeing Worcester in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. As that was happening, another officer was holding Worcester down, while a third kneed him over and over. Damante has said Worcester was being questioned for threatening a clerk at a convenience store in the nearby small town of Alma. Damante said Worcester tackled one of the deputies and punched him in the head before the arrest. The deputy suffered a concussion, Damante said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The California Geological Survey has released updated tsunami hazard maps for seven counties to help users determine whether they are in areas at risk for inundation and for planning. The revised interactive maps released Friday cover San Diego, Santa Cruz, Ventura, Marin, Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. The new maps reflect new data and improved computer modeling since an earlier series of maps was published in 2009, as well as threats from tsunamis originating far away and locally, the Geological Survey said in a press release. In one example of the updates, new modeling for Santa Cruz County shows that a subduction zone earthquake off the Aleutian Islands could unleash a tsunami 18-25 feet above the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, more than double the height suggested in 2009, the agency said. The Geological Survey said California’s shores have been struck by more than 150 tsunamis since 1800, and while most were minor, some have been significantly destructive and deadly. On March 28, 1964, a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in Alaska smashed into Crescent City, California, hours later. Much of the business district was leveled, and a dozen people were killed.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A police officer who arrested a woman who was seriously injured when the parked patrol car in which she was placed was struck by a freight train said he did not realize he had stopped the vehicle on the railroad tracks, according to police body camera video. In video obtained by KUSA-TV on Thursday, Platteville Sgt. Pablo Vazquez told another officer he thought he had cleared the tracks when he stopped Yareni Rios-Gonzalez on Sept. 16 in a suspected road rage case involving a gun. He said he pulled up right behind her truck and was focused on her because he was concerned about weapons. Vazquez also said he did not know another officer had put Rios-Gonzalez in Vasquez’s patrol vehicle until after it was hit by the train. He said the “saving grace” was that the other officer put Rios-Gonzalez on the side of the vehicle not usually used for arrested people. Rios-Gonzalez’s injuries included nine broken ribs, a broken arm and a fractured sternum. Her lawyer has said he plans to file a lawsuit against police. Previously released video from Vazquez’s body camera shows he asks the other officer several times over the sound of the train’s rumbling whether Rios-Gonzalez was in the patrol vehicle, and she responds, one hand to her face, “Oh my God, yes, she was!”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Jurors concluded their first full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict Friday in a trial to determine how much conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay for spreading the lie that the 2012 Sandy Hook School shooting was a hoax. Jurors are scheduled to return Tuesday. After deliberating just briefly Thursday afternoon, the panel got back to business Friday with a request for a dry-erase easel, markers, an eraser and a copy of the jury instructions. Last year, Jones was found liable for damages. The jury’s task is to decide how much Jones and his company Free Speech Systems should pay to relatives of eight Sandy Hook victims and to an FBI agent who responded to the massacre. The plaintiffs testified they have been tormented and threatened by people who believed that one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history was a con staged to build support for gun restrictions. Jones repeatedly publicized that false notion on his “Infowars” show. Twenty children and six adults were killed when a gunman stormed Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012. Jones testified in the trial, saying he was “done saying I’m sorry.” His lawyers have argued that he’s not responsible for the deeds of anyone who tormented the victims’ families, and that they are overstating how much harm it caused them.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: New state laws allowing universal voting by mail and Election Day registration are unconstitutional, Delaware’s Supreme Court ruled Friday. In a three-page order, the justices said the vote-by-mail statute impermissibly expands the categories of absentee voters identified in Delaware’s constitution. The same-day registration law conflicts with the registration periods spelled out in the state constitution, they said. The order, which will be followed later by a formal opinion, came after justices heard arguments in the case Thursday. Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook last month upheld the same-day registration law but said the vote-by-mail law, the result of legislation Democrats rammed through the General Assembly in less than three weeks, violates constitutional restrictions on absentee voting. Both bills were passed in June, each receiving exactly one Republican vote, and were signed by Democratic Gov. John Carney in July. Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Jennings appealed Cook’s ruling striking down the vote-by-mail law. GOP attorneys representing voters, a state House candidate and a Department of Elections employee appealed Cook’s decision upholding same-day registration. The Supreme Court upheld Cook’s ruling on the vote-by-mail law but said his decision allowing same-day registration should be reversed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Air and Space Museum will reopen half of its flagship building to the public on the National Mall on Friday, WUSA-TV reports. When the museum partially reopens, visitors can check out eight new and renovated exhibitions, along with the planetarium on the museum’s west end. Highlights include “Destination Moon,” which will display the Apollo 11 space suit; “Kenneth C. Griffin Exploring the Planets Gallery,” which will feature an immersive experience called Walking on Other Worlds; and the “Thomas W. Haas We All Fly” exhibition, which will include the Challenger III and the Lear Jet 23. The museum has been undergoing a seven-year renovation that began in 2018 and includes redesigning all 23 exhibitions and presentation spaces, replacing outdated mechanical systems and other repairs and improvements. “You should be excited to engage with these pieces of history, these real artifacts, these real things,” said Beth Wilson, an educator with the museum. “Come and see them.” Free timed-entry passes are required to visit the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Florida officials began planning to transport migrants to other states in July and told potential contractors their task would be to relocate them on a voluntary basis, according to state documents. The documents released Friday night provide new details about the program that culminated in the Sept. 14 flight of 48 mostly Venezuelan migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha’s Vineyard, an island off Massachusetts. The flight has spawned an investigation by a Texas sheriff and two lawsuits amid criticism that the program was a political stunt by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to appeal to his conservative base. DeSantis is running for reelection this year and is frequently mentioned as a potential 2024 presidential candidate. According to the documents, the program as outlined in July was intended to “assist in the voluntary relocation of Unauthorized Aliens who are found in Florida and have agreed to be relocated” elsewhere in the country. It made no mention of finding migrants in Texas. Ultimately, state officials chose Vertol Systems Co., based in Destin, Florida, and has so far paid the firm $1.56 million for the Martha’s Vineyard flight and possibly for a second flight to Delaware, the home state of President Joe Biden, that didn’t happen. No other flights have been announced.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia prosecutor investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 election filed paperwork Friday seeking to compel testimony from a new batch of Trump allies, including former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis filed petitions in court seeking to have Gingrich and Flynn, as well as former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann and others, testify next month before a special grand jury that’s been seated to aid her investigation. They join a string of other high-profile Trump allies and advisers who have been called to testify in the probe. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump attorney who’s been told he could face criminal charges in the probe, testified in August. Attorneys John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro have also appeared before the panel. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham’s attempt to fight his subpoena is pending in a federal appeals court. And paperwork has been filed seeking testimony from others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Willis has said she plans to take a monthlong break from public activity in the case leading up to the November midterm election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on the planet, is in a “state of heightened unrest” but is not erupting, and there are no signs of an imminent eruption, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Friday. Earlier in the week week, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park closed the Mauna Loa summit backcountry until further notice, calling it a “precautionary measure” amid “elevated seismic activity.” The observatory said the heightened unrest began in mid-September, “as recorded by an increase in earthquakes below Mauna Loa summit.” The volcano, which stands about 13,680 feet above sea level on the island of Hawaii, last erupted in 1984, the observatory said. Since 1843, it has erupted 33 times, with the time between eruptions ranging from months to decades, according to the observatory. The park’s online portal says this is the volcano’s “longest quiet period since written records have been kept.” “Mauna Loa will erupt again,” Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “As long as there is heightened unrest, it is more likely to erupt. But it could be weeks or months – or it could eventually die off.” The latter happened the last time there was elevated seismic activity and summit expansion on Mauna Loa, in early 2021.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court heard arguments in lawsuits over three of Idaho’s abortion laws Thursday, sharply questioning attorneys about the value placed on a pregnant person’s health, the state’s interest in ensuring that pregnancies are carried to term and Idaho’s long history of anti-abortion laws. The high court earlier this year allowed the laws to go into effect, and as a result Idaho is one of several states where abortion is almost entirely outlawed. A final ruling on the laws – including one that criminalizes all abortions but allows physicians to defend themselves by showing the abortion was needed to save the pregnant persopn’s life, one that criminalizes most abortions after about six weeks’ gestation, and one that allows even extended potential relatives of a fetus or embryo to sue an abortion provider – could be handed down sometime in the coming months. “For 50 years, generations of Idaho women have had control over their bodies and lives with respect to the most intimate personal and private decision imaginable whether to carry a pregnancy to term or whether to terminate it,” Alan Schoenfeld, the attorney representing a regional Planned Parenthood affiliate, told the court. “The Idaho Legislature seeks to upend women’s lives and strip them of this fundamental right – one that’s necessary to the exercise of numerous other rights that all Idahoans cherish.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man accused of walking into a Chicago police station and pointing a gun at officers, leading police to shoot and wound him, appeared in court Friday on assault charges, where a judge ordered his bond set at $200,000. The police department said in a news release that 43-year-old Terrick Bland, of nearby Maywood, is charged with five counts of aggravated assault of a peace officer and one felony count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. According to police, Bland walked into the lobby of the Ogden District station in the Lawndale neighborhood on the city’s West Side and began shouting anti-police statements Wednesday. When officers ordered him to drop a gun that he had wrapped in a plastic bag, he pointed it at officers, and at least three of them opened fire. Bland was shot once in the shoulder and was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. According to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, Bland was represented at Friday’s hearing by an attorney with the county public defender’s office. An official from the office said she could not immediately determine who represented Bland. It was the second time in a little more than a week in which Chicago officers shot an armed suspect inside of a police station.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials are warning northern Indiana residents to take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes after detecting a rare and potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus in the region. State public health and animal health officials issued the warning Thursday after determining that the eastern equine encephalitis virus was active in multiple northern Indiana counties, with four horses testing positive for the virus. State veterinarian Dr. Bret Marsh said the virus “is a serious threat to both horses and people in northern Indiana” until the first hard freeze of the fall season occurs. As of Tuesday, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said two horses in LaGrange County and one horse in Kosciusko County had tested positive for the virus. No human cases of the virus disease or mosquitoes infected with the virus have been reported in Indiana this year. But officials said that because northern Indiana contains suitable habitat for mosquitoes that can transmit the virus, “humans and horses in all northern Indiana counties are potentially at risk.” Residents were urged to avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are present and take other steps, including eliminating breeding grounds for the insects. While rare, the virus can cause serious illness with long-term complications and has a fatality rate of around 33% or higher.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: Paddlers on the Cedar River now will be floating on designated waters. The river, from Janesville to around La Porte City – about 46 miles – has been formally recognized as a designated water trail as part of the Cedar Valley Nature Trail. A 14-mile stretch of Black Hawk Creek from Hudson to the Cedar River was also designated as an official water trail. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports members of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Black Hawk County Conservation, Iowa Northland Regional Council of Governments and Partnership for a Healthy Iowa paddled from Washington Park in Cedar Falls to the Waterloo Boat House in celebration of the new identification. Kayla Lyon, director of the Iowa DNR, said there are more than 1,000 miles of designated water trails in the state. The state’s first designated water trail was the Cedar Valley Paddler’s Trail in Black Hawk County, which begins at the Fisher Lake Boat Ramp. The 10-mile trail was recognized in 2005. Peter Komendowski, executive director of the Partnership for a Healthy Iowa, said the waterway was first paddled by 26 eighth graders and adults, and it took them more than six hours. It travels through a chain of lakes, down the Cedar River and through George Wyth State Park before looping back to the start.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A Wichita police officer was arrested early Saturday on suspicion of drunken driving, becoming the city’s third officer to be apprehended within about two weeks. Police said in a release that the officer, who was off-duty, is also facing a charge of possession of a gun while intoxicated. The officer, who has been with the department for two years, has been placed on administrative leave while a criminal and internal investigation is conducted, the Wichita Eagle reports. The incident follows two other arrests of Wichita officers within five days at the end of last month. A detective and 15-year veteran of the force was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence Sept. 23 after she collided with a city bus in downtown. A police recruit was arrested on suspicion of criminal threat Sept. 28 when police responded to a domestic violence call.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Three Jewish women from Louisville filed a lawsuit Thursday to block Kentucky’s laws banning most abortions from remaining in effect, arguing they are a violation of their religious rights under the state constitution. Under current Kentucky laws, the protected human life of “an unborn child” begins when an egg is fertilized by a sperm, with abortion strictly prohibited once fetal cardiac activity is detected at roughly six weeks. Exceptions are only allowed to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or a “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” The plaintiffs in the case say Jewish law, known as Halakha, for millennia has not defined human life as beginning at conception but rather at birth, while the abortion ban passed into law in Kentucky “has imposed sectarian theology on Jews.” Their complaint, filed in Jefferson County Circuit Court, says Kentucky law particularly contradicts their constitutional religious rights when it comes to their past and intended future use of in vitro fertilization, in which a human egg is fertilized with sperm in a laboratory and then implanted in the uterus. “As a mom, as a woman, this directly affects me; it affects my health care,” lead plaintiff Lisa Sobel said. “And then it’s a personal affront to my personal religious views, on top of it.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Democratic challenger to U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise released a campaign ad on social media that includes video of her giving birth. Katie Darling said she was seven months pregnant when she decided to join the congressional race in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that ended constitutional protections for abortion. The 75-second video documents Darling traveling from her family farm in St. Tammany parish in September to a hospital, where she grips the side of a bed while in labor. “I wanted to share that this is real for me,” Darling, 36, said in an interview with the Associated Press. “I am literally the one hooked up to the machines and the IVs in the hospital bed, going through childbirth, and nobody else should be deciding how I handle that.” In a voiceover, Darling highlights her concerns about climate change, Louisiana underperforming in education and the state’s near-total abortion ban – the only exceptions are if there is substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient if they continue with the pregnancy and in the case of “medically futile” pregnancies. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. “Louisiana deserves better than the path it’s on,” Darling says in the video. “I want that better path,” she adds, “for you” – as the ad pans to her husband in the delivery room. “For her,” as a the video shows her 6-year-old daughter. “And for him,” she says directly into the camera from her hospital bed as she cradles her newborn.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Wildlife agencies are finding elevated levels of a class of toxic chemicals in game animals such as deer, prompting health advisories in some places where hunting and fishing are ways of life and key pieces of the economy. Authorities have detected the high levels of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, in deer in several states, including Maine, where legions of hunters seek to bag a buck every fall. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched an effort last year to limit pollution from the chemicals, linked to health problems including cancer and low birth weight. In Maine, where the chemicals were detected in well water at hundreds of times the federal health advisory level, legislators passed a law in 2021 requiring manufacturers to report their use of the chemicals and to phase them out by 2030. The state issued a “do not eat” advisory last year for deer harvested in the Fairfield area, about 80 miles north of Portland, after several of the animals tested positive for elevated levels. The state is now expanding the testing to more animals across a wider area, said Nate Webb, wildlife division director at the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. “Lab capacity has been challenging,” he said, “but I suspect there will be more facilities coming online to help ease that burden.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The office of the state’s attorney general is supporting an appeal by a slain woman’s family after a Baltimore judge overturned a man’s murder conviction in a case chronicled by a groundbreaking podcast. Hae Min Lee’s brother, Young Lee, has asked the Maryland Court of Special Appeals to halt court proceedings for Adnan Syed, whose conviction in Lee’s 1999 killing was reversed by Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn in September. Young Lee is asking the appellate court to suspend an Oct. 18 deadline for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges against Syed or retry him. Lee argues that his family didn’t get adequate notice of the Sept. 19 hearing at which Phinn overturned Syed’s conviction. Attorney General Brian Frosch’s office, which represented the state in opposing Syed’s appeals, said in a court filing Friday that Young Lee has a right to appeal given his status as the victim’s representative, the Baltimore Sun reports. The filing argues that Lee’s appeal should be addressed before any circuit court rulings render it moot. Syed, who has always maintained his innocence, has served more than 20 years of a life sentence. He was convicted of strangling Lee, whose body was found buried in a Baltimore park. Syed and Lee were students at a Baltimore County high school.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Health officials said Friday that they’re concerned about elevated levels of the coronavirus in the city’s wastewater. The concentration of the virus in local wastewater had increased by 3.1% over the prior week and by nearly 100% over the past two weeks, according to new data from last week from the Boston Public Health Commission. New COVID-19 cases in Boston had decreased slightly over the prior week, though the data did not include positive results from at-home tests, the commission said. Boston hospitals had 170 new hospital admissions related to COVID-19 last week. Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the public health commissioner, said the elevated concentration in the wastewater is “very concerning” because increases in COVID-19-related hospitalizations, combined with flu season, will cause “major strain” on Boston’s health care system. Ojikutu said it’s important to try to get ahead of the issue and recommended that people get booster shots and flu shots, wear a mask indoors, get tested for COVID-19 and isolate if they test positive to help reduce transmission. Nearly 79% of Boston residents are fully inoculated against the disease. The commission began noticing elevated coronavirus levels in the wastewater in late September.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has signed another extension of a law that makes people convicted of crimes, typically with low incomes, responsible for a portion of local court expenses. The law, which raises millions of dollars for local governments, doesn’t apply to others who use Michigan’s court system. It has been criticized, even by judges, as unfair at minimum and unconstitutional at worst. The state Supreme Court last spring heard a challenge by a man who was ordered to pay $1,200 in Alpena County. But instead of settling the matter, the court said it would hear more arguments during its 2022-23 term. The Legislature in September voted to keep the law going for an additional 18 months. Only 17 lawmakers opposed it. Whitmer, a Democrat, said she signed the extension last week. Rep. Sarah Lightner, R-Springport, acknowledged it puts another “Band-Aid on this issue” while a long-term court funding solution can be explored. A group called the Fines and Fees Justice Center tracks how states impose fines and fees in courts. Co-director Lisa Foster said Michigan stands out because judges who preside over a criminal case are also given power to order financial penalties that benefit local government. People convicted of crimes can be ordered to pay a portion of staff salaries and building maintenance.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State Attorney General Keith Ellison sued Fleet Farm on Wednesday, alleging the retailer negligently sold firearms to two straw buyers, including one gun that was used in a shootout in a St. Paul bar that left one person dead and 14 bystanders injured. The lawsuit, filed in Hennepin County District Court, alleges that Fleet Farm ignored multiple red flags that should have tipped off chain officials, including sales of multiple guns in single purchases. It alleges that Fleet Farm stores sold the two at least 37 firearms over a 16-month period. Most of the guns have not been recovered, Ellison said. Ellison, a Democrat, is facing a stiff reelection challenge from Republican candidate Jim Schultz, who has made violent crime his top issue. “We comply with all applicable gun laws and devote substantial resources to training and compliance,” countered Fleet Farm spokesman Jon Austin. He said that after the St. Paul shooting Ellison highlighted, “we were told by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that our team members had ‘done nothing wrong’ and had complied with all applicable gun laws.” The Midwestern company has 17 stores in Minnesota that sell firearms. Straw buyers purchase firearms from licensed retailers and resell them to people who can’t legally buy them or on the black market.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city is heading off the threat of a garbage pileup by agreeing to pay its overdue bill for collections the past six months. Even as Jackson struggles with a troubled water system, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the City Council have been feuding over the garbage contract for the city of 150,000 residents. Richard’s Disposal has picked up Jackson garbage since April without compensation. The company said it would stop collections after Saturday unless it receives payment. City Council President Ashby Foote told the Associated Press on Friday that the city will pay $4.8 million, and garbage collection will continue. Lumumba awarded an emergency contract early this year to Richard’s after the council voted multiple times against hiring the New Orleans-based company. Jackson has had water problems for years, and most of the city lost running water for several days in late August and early September because torrential rainfall exacerbated problems with the main water treatment plant. Crews are still making emergency repairs to the water plant, and questions remain about the quality of water in the city where 80% of residents are Black, and a quarter live in poverty.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A mother whose son died less than an hour after he was transported from a jail to a state prison has won a $1.2 million settlement in a case that helped lead to suspensions, firings and reforms. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Angela Malcich claimed in the suit that nurses and guards at the St. Louis County Justice Center repeatedly ignored the serious medical distress of her son, Daniel Stout. He was arrested June 3, 2019, on a parole revocation and spent the next eight days in the county jail. The night before his death, Stout complained of stomach pains but was told he would have to wait until the morning to see a nurse, the suit claims. That morning, though, jail staff told a worsening Stout that he would need to wait for care again until he could be transported more than an hour to the state prison in Bonne Terre. Upon arriving, he was vomiting blood and died before emergency crews could get there. An autopsy blamed complications of an ulcer that perforated his intestine. Four other inmates also died in the county jail in 2019, with an internal report finding that all of them had acted “strangely” beforehand and that most were denied medical care.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A draft report from Gov. Greg Gianforte’s housing task force details a slew of ideas to boost housing supply in an effort to tackle Montana’s affordability crunch, previewing legislation that could be advanced during next year’s legislative session, the Montana Free Press reports. Several of the task force’s recommendations involve scaling back local zoning restrictions such as minimum lot sizes, building height limits and parking requirements to make it easier to develop more dense housing developments in urban areas with existing access to services like water lines, streets and fire departments. The report released last week calls for legislation that places “sideboards” on the development restrictions towns and cities have the power to enact and also suggests providing financial incentives to local governments that implement “key regulatory reforms.” The group also suggests putting some state money toward supporting affordable housing efforts. It generally avoids suggestions that seek to address housing challenges with new government regulations, such as restricting AirBnB-style short-term rentals. The task force, which is set to formally present its recommendations to the governor in the coming weeks, is looking for public comment to consider as it finalizes its initial report by a Saturday deadline.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city will have a new tallest building once Mutual of Omaha completes its planned $600 million headquarters tower downtown in 2026. Mutual CEO James Blackledge told the Omaha World-Herald it recently became clear that the insurance company’s new skyscraper would eclipse the 45-story First National Bank tower. The new Mutual building is projected to be 677 feet tall. That would make it 43 feet taller than the First National building that opened in 2002. Mutual didn’t set out to build the city’s tallest building, but Blackledge said he’s proud of the impact the project will have on Omaha’s downtown and its image. “I think people see skylines, and it does create an impression of all the things we want Omaha to be perceived as – a vibrant, growing, thriving place where people can live and work and prosper,” he said. The new building will be designed to hold roughly 2,400 of the company’s 4,000 headquarters workers at any one time, reflecting the rise of working from home. It will also be a little less than half the size of Mutual current 1.7 million-square-foot headquarters complex in midtown Omaha. In conjunction with the Mutual project, Omaha leaders have pledged to build a $306 million, 3-mile-long streetcar line to connect midtown with downtown by sometime in 2026.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Victims of a quick series of stabbings on the Las Vegas Strip described the shock and horror of the unexpected attack Thursday on a group of showgirls and others outside a casino that left two people dead and six injured. Police arrested Yoni Barrios, 32, after a short chase blocks from where they say he attacked four showgirls and ended up stabbing eight people. An arrest report released Friday said Barrios told police some of the victims had laughed at him, and he “let the anger out.” Prosecutors said he’ll be charged with two counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder. “I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me,” said Victoria Caytano, one of the showgirl impersonators who was released from the hospital Friday after she was treated for a stab wound. “I got up, and I started running,” Caytano told KLAS-TV. “I started yelling, ‘He has a knife!’ ” The coroner’s office identified those killed as Las Vegas residents Brent Allan Hallett, 47, and Maris Mareen DiGiovanni, 30. Hallett was stabbed in the back, and DiGiovanni died from a chest wound, authorities said. DiGiovanni was part of the Best Showgirls in Vegas modeling and talent agency, according to Cheryl Lowthorp, who runs the business. She said two others with the agency were among the wounded, and a third escaped without injury.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former juvenile parole officer has been sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for possession of child pornography and trying to send an explicit image to a child. Jason Ellis pleaded guilty in June. Prosecutors agreed in a plea agreement to drop a third charge of distributing child pornography. Ellis was fired from his job as a juvenile parole officer earlier in the year after he was arrested. An affidavit said Ellis sent online messages in 2020 and 2021 to undercover investigators posing as a 13-year-old girl and her father. Detectives uncovered more than 100 images of child sex abuse material on his phone, WMUR-TV reports.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state would sell off all of its pension fund investments in oil, gas and other fossil fuel companies under a bill approved by a New Jersey Senate committee Thursday. The bill targets any pension money invested in 200 of the largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies based on each of their carbon content in oil, gas and coal reserves. It was passed 3-2 along party lines with Democrats in support and Republicans against. “The clock is ticking, and there is not that much time left,” said state Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, the bill’s sponsor. “We’ve got to get our industry to change and our economy to change.” The pension fund was valued at $92.9 billion as of May 31, but it is not known exactly how much is invested in fossil fuel company stocks. A state Treasury Department spokeswoman did not return a request for that information Thursday. Divest NJ, a group advocating for the measure, estimates it’s between $3 million and $4 million, based on documents it has obtained. The measure had languished in Trenton for almost five years and still has a long road ahead of it. It was moved to the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday and would still need to be approved by the full Senate, the Assembly and Gov. Phil Murphy. It would take effect 12 months after being signed into law.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has asked the federal Department of Justice to assign more FBI agents to the state in response to violent crime. Lujan Grisham said Wednesday in a statement that she wants to replicate the success of a recent surge in FBI resources and agents in Buffalo, New York. The Sept. 15 letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland describes a recent spate of homicides in Albuquerque and says that “additional federal agents are needed to alleviate the current strain on New Mexico’s law enforcement offices.” Lujan Grisham sent a similar request in June to FBI Director Christopher Wray. Lujan Grisham spokeswoman Nora Meyers Sackett said the governor’s office did not receive a response from the Department of Justice as of Wednesday evening. Concerns about crime are a prominent theme in the race for governor ahead of the Nov. 8 general election as Lujan Grisham seeks a second term in office. Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Ronchetti has painted a dire portrait of public safety conditions, railing against the state’s bail system and vowing a different approach to judicial appointments.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state police superintendent resigned Friday, days after Gov. Kathy Hochul said he was being investigated for his handling of internal personnel matters. In a statement, Hochul thanked Kevin Bruen for “his years of public service” and said that First Deputy Superintendent Steven Nigrelli will take over as acting superintendent on an interim basis. Bruen had been in charge of the state police since June 2021. A 20-year veteran of the department, he was appointed superintendent by Hochul’s predecessor, Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Bruen’s resignation is effective Oct. 19, the state police said. Hochul told the Albany Times Union’s editorial board on Tuesday that she had ordered her counsel’s office to investigate allegations against Bruen. Among them, according to the newspaper, is whether he had shielded a senior human resources official from complaints about her own handling of personnel issues.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s two top Democratic officials are urging the Republican-led Legislature to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana in light of President Joe Biden’s pardon Thursday of thousands of Americans convicted of “simple possession” under federal law. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein, the state’s top lawyer who is considering a run for governor in 2024, shared their support for the president’s decision at a Friday task force meeting on racial equity and criminal justice. Established by Cooper in June 2020 after George Floyd’s murder, the 24-member panel of law enforcement officers, attorneys, civil rights advocates and state officials had recommended in a 2020 report that state lawmakers replace the misdemeanor charge for possessing up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana with a civil offense on par with a traffic infraction. The General Assembly did not act on this recommendation. “Conviction of simple possession can mar people’s records for life and maybe even prevent them from getting a job,” Cooper told the task force Friday. “The General Assembly didn’t pass your recommendations on this last session, but I believe they should. North Carolina should take steps to end this stigma.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s five American Indian tribes are seeking exclusive rights to host internet gambling and sports betting in North Dakota – a monopoly worth millions – just a year after legislators turned aside a push by one big national player to allow gambling in the state. The tribes are turning to Republican Gov. Doug Burgum to approve the idea under tribal-state agreements known as compacts, the first of which was signed in 1992. The current compacts expire at the end of this year, and only Burgum can approve them, said Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator. The tribes argue their casinos have been hurt by the explosion of electronic pull tab machines statewide after they were legalized in 2017, with North Dakotans pouring almost $1.75 billion into the machines in fiscal 2022. Their proposal, obtained by the Associated Press, is still in draft form. A public hearing on a final proposal is set for Oct. 21, McDaniel said. DraftKings, a big player in the U.S. mobile gambling market, supported legislation and a failed resolution last year to allow sports betting in North Dakota to join about two dozen other states. The company said at the time that sports wagering already is taking place in North Dakota through illegal offshore markets.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A law banning virtually all abortions will remain blocked while a state constitutional challenge proceeds, a judge said Friday in a ruling that will allow pregnancy terminations through 20 weeks’ gestation to continue for now. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins issued the preliminary injunction from the bench after a daylong hearing where courthouse guards screened spectators, and one abortion provider testified to wearing a Kevlar vest over fears for her safety. In impassioned remarks announcing his decision, Jenkins knocked the state’s arguments that the Ohio Constitution doesn’t ever mention abortion and thus doesn’t protect the right to one. He said a right doesn’t have to be named to be protected. “This court has no difficulty holding that the Ohio Constitution confers a fundamental right on all of Ohioans to privacy, procreation, bodily integrity and freedom of choice in health care decision-making that encompasses the right to abortion,” he said. He said the state failed to prove that the ban on most abortions after detection of fetal cardiac activity is narrowly tailored enough not to infringe on those rights. Rather, Jenkins said, the law is written “to almost completely eliminate the rights of Ohio women. It is not narrowly tailored, not even close.” The state is expected to appeal.\n\nOklahoma\n\nBlanchard: Jody Miller, whose “Queen of the House” won the 1966 Grammy Award for best country performance by a woman, died Thursday at age 80. Miller died in her hometown, Blanchard, of complications from Parkinson’s disease, according to Universal Music Group, owner of Capitol Records, which released most of her hits. “Queen of the House” was released in 1965 as an answer to Roger Miller’s hit “King of the Road.” The hit opened up a crossover career for Jody Miller, who wasn’t related to the “King of the Road” composer and singer. Her 1965 teen protest song “Home of the Brave” was her biggest-selling single, despite being banned from some radio stations’ playlists. Another hit was “Long Black Limousine,” a song about a man’s funeral procession. In the 1970s, Miller moved to Epic Records, where she had hits with “Baby I’m Yours,” “There’s a Party Goin’ On,” “Darling, You Can Always Come Back Home,” and the Grammy-nominated crossover hit cover of “He’s So Fine.” She retired in the 1980s to spend more time with her husband and children. After her husband’s death, she recorded a 2018 single, “Where My Picture Hangs on the Wall,” with daughter Robin Brooks Sullivan and Miller’s two grandchildren.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A serial rapist is set to be released from prison in mid-December after serving nearly 36 years behind bars, almost all of his maximum sentence. Richard Gillmore, arrested in 1986 and called the “jogger rapist” because he staked out victims as he ran by their homes, admitted to raping nine girls in the Portland area in the 1970s and ’80s but was only convicted in one case because of the statute of limitations. In 1987, a jury found him guilty of raping 13-year-old Tiffany Edens, his last known victim, in December 1986. The Associated Press generally does not name people who have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Edens has spoken out about the assault and recently wrote on social media that she received a voicemail in August from the state’s Victim Information and Notification Service telling her of his impending release. “I have been slowly processing the reality of it all,” she wrote. The Oregonian, citing prison officials, reported that Gillmore was transferred in August from Two Rivers Correctional Institution in Umatilla to the minimum-security Columbia River Correctional Institution in Portland to help him prepare for his reentry into the community. He will be 63 at the time of his release in December. KOIN reports Gillmore will remain under supervision until 2034.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: An Italian heritage group has vowed to appeal a judge’s ruling that officials can remove a 13-foot statue of Christopher Columbus from a city park. Attorneys for the Italian Sons and Daughters of America have argued that the mayor doesn’t have the power to override an ordinance passed by the City Council in 1955 that cleared the installation of the 800-pound statue of the explorer. Common Pleas Judge John McVay Jr. ruled about a week ago that because the statue erected in 1958 is in a city-owned park, it represents government speech – citing a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a Utah city rejecting a monument proposed for a city park by a religious group. The Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed the lawsuit in October 2020 after the Pittsburgh Art Commission voted to remove the statue. Then-Mayor Bill Peduto then also recommended its removal. McVay had for two years urged the two sides to work toward a solution, including its relocation to a different location. The statue has been vandalized numerous times and is wrapped in plastic. “Based on the court’s ruling, the mayor can put up or take down any statue he wants on any city-owned property without regard for other branches of the city government,” the Italian Sons and Daughters of America argued. “Obviously, this cannot be correct.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Festival of Children’s Books and Authors returns to an in-person format this year for the first time since 2019, kicking off Friday with a virtual appearance by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor at Lincoln School. Sotomayor, who has written several children’s books in addition to a 2013 memoir, will speak to and answer questions from Rhode Island children. Free signed copies of her books “Just Ask” and “Just Help” will be given to children who attend the 4:30 p.m. event. The festival will continue Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Lincoln School, where participants can listen to 30-minute talks by authors, purchase books and have them signed; make book crafts; and buy lunch from a variety of vendors. Authors and illustrators at the event will be Mary Jane Begin, Gaia Cornwall, Anika Aldamuy Denise, Christopher Denise, Rita Hubbard, Kekla Magoon, Juana Martinez-Neal, Oge Mora, Hayley Rocco, John Rocco, Bob Shea, Melissa Stewart, Chris Van Allsburg and Rhode Island’s poet laureate, Tina Cane, as well as members of Rhode Island Black Storytellers. Admission to the two-hour kickoff event with Sotomayor is free, but space is limited, and advance registration is recommended online. Admission to Saturday’s festival is $5.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Write-in U.S. House candidate Lee Turner rallied in downtown Greenville on Saturday to spread the word about her campaign. Turner had no intention of running for Congress, she said, but after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, details of incumbent U.S. Rep. William Timmons’ personal life went viral online, and Democratic candidate Ken Hill dropped out of the race, Turner said: “I’ve got to do something.” Turner said she’s running a campaign based on finding solutions, common ground and bringing elected officials from across the aisle together. “I became more sure that this district needed someone like me, who was a problem solver, versus somebody like Mr. Timmons, who’s just going to tow the party line,” Turner said. While she has run for office as a Democrat in the past, Turner said she is truly an independent who believes people are more alike than they are different and hopes to create legislation with mutual benefits across political ideologies to help the masses. “Mutual benefit is the strongest glue ever,” she said. “It needs no legislation to even sustain itself, but if you do legislate it, it’s not likely to be overturned by the next party in power because it’s mutually beneficial.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A new free online tutoring program is available for K-12 students in the state, administered by the Board of Regents and funded by the Department of Education. The Dakota Dreams Online Tutoring Program is staffed by college students at Black Hills State University and Northern State University who are preparing to become teachers. The program uses a secure online platform for students and tutors to connect for virtual sessions in English, language arts, math, science and social studies. Secretary of Education Tiffany Sanderson said the program will allow K-12 students to receive individualized support after the school day has ended. “Once a parent has registered their child, students can access a tutor from home, the local library or after-school program, or even their favorite coffee shop,” Sanderson said. “I think parents are going to like this one-on-one support as much as their students.” To access the free service, parents first need to register their students to use the platform. Once registered, sessions can either be scheduled in advance or on-demand, depending on tutor availability. Tutors will be available Monday through Sunday afternoons and evenings. The service will not be available on holidays and during Christmas and spring breaks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Country music icon Loretta Lynn was buried in her family’s cemetery on her Hurricane Mills estate Friday morning. The private ceremony of about 100 guests took place in the unincorporated Humphreys County town she bought in the 1960s after achieving worldwide fame with “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” Lynn died Oct. 4 at the age of 90. She left instructions for her funeral ceremonies, including plans for a large memorial where fans will be invited. “A public memorial is being planned,” family spokesperson Ebie McFarland said. “The family did have a private ceremony Friday with no other details available to share at this time.” McFarland said details about the public ceremony will be released soon. Loretta Lynn’s Ranch is one of the largest campgrounds in the state and draws streams of tourists throughout the year to the rural expanse, where she built an event center and other attractions. Lynn, who owned roughly 3,500 acres in Humphreys County, lived in the estate’s mansion until 1988 before turning it into a tourist center and moving into a smaller house on the property. She also built a museum and replica of the Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, cabin where she grew up for tourists to visit.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: The city’s school district suspended its entire police force Friday amid fresh outrage over the hesitant law enforcement response to the gunman who massacred 21 people at Robb Elementary School. The extraordinary move follows the revelation that the district hired a former state trooper who was among hundreds of officers who rushed to the scene of the May 24 shooting. School leaders also put two members of the district police department on administrative leave, one of whom chose to retire instead, according to a statement released by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District. Remaining officers will be reassigned to other jobs in the district. Uvalde school leaders’ suspension of campus police operations one month into a new school year in the South Texas community underscores the sustained pressure that families of some of the 19 children and two teachers killed have kept on the district. Brett Cross, the uncle of 10-year-old victim Uziyah Garcia, had been protesting outside the school administration building for two weeks, demanding accountability over officers allowing a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle to remain in a fourth grade classroom for more than 70 minutes. Families have said students in the district are not safe so long as officers who waited so long to confront and kill the gunman remain on the job.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A jury found two animal rights activists not guilty on charges of burglary and theft after they allegedly took two sick piglets from an industrial pig farm. Activists Wayne Hsiung and Paul Picklesimer, with the California-based group Direct Action Everywhere, had argued during their trial that nothing of value was stolen because the 3-week old piglets were in poor condition and likely to die. The not guilty verdict was delivered Saturday following a weeklong trial. The group took a 360-degree virtual reality video of the March 2017 incident at Smithfield Food’s Circle Four Farms near Milford and promoted it online, as part of a tactic known as “open rescue” that’s meant to shed light on abusive farming practices. Investigators used the video to identify the defendants and three other activists who were charged and took plea deals rather than go to trial. Hsiung and Picklesimer faced up to 51/ 2 years in jail if they had been convicted, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. In 2017 a federal court struck down a Utah law banning secret filming at farm and livestock sites, claiming the restrictions were an unconstitutional violation of free speech.\n\nVermont\n\nRichmond: Residents of a small community were blindsided last month by news that one official in their water department quietly lowered fluoride levels nearly four years ago, giving rise to worries about their children’s dental health and transparent government – and highlighting the enduring misinformation around water fluoridation. Katie Mather, who lives in Richmond, a town of about 4,100 in northwestern Vermont, said at a water commission meeting last week that her dentist recently found her two kids’ first cavities. She acknowledged they eat a lot of sugar but said her dentist recommended against supplemental fluoride because the town’s water should be doing the trick. Her dentist “was operating and making professional recommendations based on state standards we all assumed were being met, which they were not,” Mather said. Kendall Chamberlin, Richmond’s water and wastewater superintendent, told the Water and Sewer Commission in September that he reduced the fluoride level because of his concerns about changes to its sourcing and the recommended levels. He said he worries about quality control in the fluoride used in U.S. drinking systems because it comes from China – an assertion that echoes unfounded reports about Chinese fluoride that have circulated online in recent years.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: A Civil War reenactor pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he planted a pipe bomb at a battlefield in 2017 and threatened to disrupt additional events. A federal indictment against Gerald Leonard Drake, 63, of Winchester, Virginia, was unsealed Thursday. The indictment accuses Drake of planting a pipe bomb at Cedar Creek Battlefield during an annual reenactment in October 2017. The bomb did not detonate but resulted in cancellation of the reenactment after its discovery. The indictment also charges him with writing letters threatening violence at subsequent Cedar Creek reenactments, as well as an annual Remembrance Day Parade in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. At a press conference Thursday announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said Drake falsely claimed connections to Antifa in his threatening letters not only to hide his actual identity but also to create additional political angst. In reality, according to the indictment, Drake was a Civil War reenactor who regularly participated in events at Cedar Creek until he was expelled from his unit in 2014. The indictment, though, does not explicitly state that bitterness over his expulsion motived his alleged misconduct.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia National Park: Park officials have closed recreational fishing indefinitely because waters have reached historic lows. The National Park Service announced it would halt all recreational fishing starting Thursday on the Ozette, Bogachiel, South Fork Calawah, Sol Duc, North Fork Sol Duc, Dickey, Quillayute, Hoh, South Fork Hoh, Queets, Salmon and Quinault rivers. The Cedar, Goodman, Kalaloch and Mosquito Creeks within Olympic National Park are also closed, The Seattle Times reports. The region for months has seen above-average temperatures and low rainfall. Seattle has had 0.48 inches of rain from July to September, while the average for that period is 3.16 inches, making it the driest such stretch on record. Park officials said they hope the closure will help protect fish, especially those trying to make upstream spawning migrations in the low water levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A West Virginia University fraternity has been cleared of hazing allegations but will be sanctioned separately on other violations, the school said. Pi Kappa Phi and the school agreed to end the fraternity’s interim suspension related to alleged hazing. The chapter will be on deferred suspension through February and lose some privileges through June, the school said Thursday. “In this case, our inquiry found no evidence of hazing, but exposed recruitment and alcohol behaviors which violate our Student Conduct Code,” said Jill Gibson, director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. The fraternity agreed to participate in education, training and harm reduction programs, WVU said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A Dane County judge refused Friday to issue a temporary order that would allow local election clerks to accept partial witness addresses on absentee ballots. A group called Rise Inc. filed a lawsuit in September seeking a judicial order requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission to tell local clerks that they must accept ballots as long as the witness address includes enough information that clerks can reasonably discern where the witness can be contacted. The day after the group filed the lawsuit, its attorneys asked Judge Juan Colas to issue a temporary injunction mandating that the commission issue that guidance to clerks. Colas refused to issue the order during a hearing Friday morning, online court records indicate. The case will continue with a scheduling conference set for Oct. 17. Rise Inc., which encourages students to vote, sued after a Waukesha County judge last month sided with Republicans and said clerks are barred from filling in missing witness information on ballot envelopes. The judge struck down guidance the elections commission put in place six years ago, saying nothing in state law allows clerks to do that. The practice was unchallenged until Donald Trump lost Wisconsin to Joe Biden in 2020. About 1.4 million voters cast absentee ballots in that election.\n\nWyoming\n\nMammoth Springs: Yellowstone National Park is postponing the opening of a renovated road at its north entrance as it continues to repair the damage from this summer’s catastrophic flooding, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The park has pushed back the road’s opening date from Oct. 15 to Nov. 1, according to the newspaper, as park officials said they need more time to ensure that over 5,000 feet of guardrail are properly installed for traffic safety. “We have set incredibly aggressive time frames for these repairs, and our contractors have worked at lightning speed to get this road safely reopened,” Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a news release. “It’s essential that we do not cut corners and we ensure the road meets required safety standards prior to opening.” Unprecedented flooding in June severely damaged roads, swept away homes and forced the park to close as it evacuated about 10,000 visitors. The National Park Service said the most significant damage occurred at the Yellowstone’s north and northeast entrances, where access was cut off. The flooding washed out segments of the roadway between the north entrance and Mammoth Hot Springs. To reconnect the two areas, authorities have paved and expanded an old stagecoach route from the 1880s called Old Gardiner Road.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/02/civil-rights-records-walking-spiderwebs-making-saints-news-around-states/49312225/", "title": "Civil rights records, walking in spiderwebs: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The quest by civil rights pioneer Claudette Colvin to have her arrest record wiped clean nearly 70 years after she protested segregation has raised the possibility of similar bids to clear the names of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., whose convictions remain on the books in the former capital of the Confederacy. Parks, a Black seamstress and activist who refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in 1955, was convicted of violating racial segregation laws. King, who helped lead the resulting Montgomery Bus Boycott, paid a $500 fine after being convicted in 1956 of violating a law banning boycotts. Parks refused to pay her $10 fine, and she and King went on to become icons of racial justice and the modern civil rights movement. Yet their cases remain on the books, said civil rights attorney Fred Gray, who represented both. Montgomery County District Attorney Daryl Bailey said he would generally support a move to expunge the arrest records of King and Parks, but he’d need to see details of any such request before responding in court. Colvin asked a court last week to remove records stemming her from arrest and conviction after she refused to move to the back of a bus in 1955 in Montgomery, before Parks did the same. Now 82, Colvin – who was a 15-year-old high school student when she was convicted of assaulting an officer during her arrest and declared delinquent – isn’t sure such an effort would be possible since there was so much injustice for so long. “That would take a hundred years, maybe 200 years to go through the court system,” she said. “You could never finish it.”\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Twelve bears have been killed in the city this year, including four last week, that were deemed dangers to life and property, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. The southeast Alaska city “has a garbage problem,” Stephen Bethune, a wildlife biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, told the local Assembly recently. “Neither I or any of my agency colleagues like killing bears or the labor that ensues but will continue to do so as necessary,” he said. “However, removing bears from the population only serves to treat the symptom and fails to cure the root problem. ... That problem can be linked directly to Sitka’s current garbage disposal system and the unwillingness or inability of some members of the public to properly store trash.” He urged the use of bear-resistant trash cans and told the newspaper he would encourage the use of electric fences to help deter bears. Teal West owns a car damaged by bears last month. “My back trim and my back bumper were basically ripped off my car,” West said. “I taped the bumper back on, but I’m looking at around $6,000 worth of damage.” Bethune said he hopes the tension with bears in town eases soon. “Hopefully in the next couple weeks they’ll disappear, go up into the hills for the winter,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Conservationists and state officials say the popularity of Oak Creek Canyon, near Sedona, has created some real ecological problems for the corridor. A group of Arizona Conservation Corps members recently completed the second phase of a project that officials hope will rehabilitate many areas hit hard by visitors, improve water quality in the creek, and protect habitat for the threatened narrow-headed garter snake, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. A collaboration among the AZCC, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, the National Forest Foundation and the Coconino National Forest’s Red Rock District, among other groups, the project seeks to close hundreds of unofficial social trails that crisscross the area between the highway and the creek. Large rocks have been stacked under a fence. Guardrails installed along 89A have limited roadside parking spots that led visitors to cut more and more new trails. Teams have installed low fencing and placed thick blankets of cut juniper limbs along the edge of pull-offs. And they’ve improved about 40 trails in an effort to leave direct pathways to the creek, reducing erosion and making them safer. Over the last year, AZCC crews have addressed nearly 200 social trails along the creek corridor, said Ron Tiller, a Department of Environmental Quality scientist. In one area, he said, they cataloged 47 individual trails visitors had cut within just a quarter-mile stretch. The foot traffic increases erosion of sediment into the creek and often contributes to outbreaks of E. coli as human waste left by visitors is swept into the water.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Jim Bob Duggar, whose large family was featured in the TLC reality show “19 Kids and Counting,” has announced he’s running for a seat in the state Senate. Duggar, who previously served in the state House, announced Friday on the family’s Facebook page that he’s running for the northwest Arkansas district that includes Springdale. Last week, Republican state Sen. Lance Eads resigned the seat to take a job in the private sector. A special election will be called to fill the term. TLC pulled “19 Kids and Counting” in 2015 over revelations that Duggar’s son Josh had molested four of his sisters and a babysitter. His parents said he confessed to the fondling and apologized. Josh Duggar has also apologized for his pornography addiction and for cheating on his wife. Josh Duggar is set to go to trial in federal court in November on two counts of downloading and possessing child pornography. He faces up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 on each count if convicted. A longtime family spokesman, Chad Gallagher, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that no family “is immune from tragedy, heartbreak or impact from the decisions of the ones they love.” He added that it’s “important to note that Josh is a grown adult.” Jim Bob Duggar, who was born and raised in Springdale, and his wife, Michelle, have 20 children and 22 grandchildren.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A $650 million plan would give the Los Angeles Zoo a theme park-style transformation over the next 20 years. The city-owned zoo in the city’s Griffith Park area would get exhibit upgrades and new attractions such as a 60-foot-deep canyon for rock climbing and a hilltop building called the California Center in the style of a Yosemite National Park lodge with a sweeping view of a 25,000-square-foot vineyard, the Los Angeles Times reports. Supporters of the zoo’s “20-year Vision Plan” said building the features would increase zoo attenance by 72%, to up to 3 million visitors annually. But the construction would consume 23 acres of native woodlands, drawing opposition led by the historical preservation group Friends of Griffith Park and the California Native Plant Society. Zoo officials were thinking about the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games as they crafted the plan, said Denise Verrett, the zoo’s director and chief executive. The renovation would happen in seven phases starting next year and would be funded by grants and donations raised by the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association, a nonprofit support group, and possibly a bond issue, according to the Times. The next step for the proposal is consideration by the Los Angeles City Council’s Arts, Parks, Health, Education, and Neighborhoods Committee.\n\nColorado\n\nBrighton: Three police officers and two paramedics indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain appeared in court for the first time Monday since being charged. Officers Randy Roedema, Nathan Woodyard and Jason Rosenblatt and fire department paramedic Jeremy Cooper and fire Lt. Peter Cichuniec each took turns standing before Judge Priscilla Loew with their lawyers in a courtroom in Brighton. As McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, watched from the gallery with her lawyers, each waived a reading of the charges and penalties they face. None was asked to speak. McClain, a 23-year-old Black man, died after being put into a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative in a fatal encounter in the Denver suburb of Aurora that provoked a national outcry during racial injustice protests last year. He never regained consciousness and was later declared brain-dead at a hospital. While the former district attorney said he could not file charges because an autopsy could not determine how McClain died, the officers and paramedics were indicted by a grand jury this summer over a year after Gov. Jared Polis ordered state Attorney General Phil Weiser to open a criminal investigation into the case.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: With the legalization of recreational cannabis for adults and the impending start of retail sales in the state next year, several coastal towns are saying no, for now. Guilford, Madison and North Branford recently put in place measures that stop cannabis establishments from opening for nine months to a year from now, and Clinton has made it unlawful for any building, structure or land to be used as a cannabis establishment, producer, retailer or dispensary, the New Haven Register reports. The law signed in June by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont law allows individuals ages 21 and older to possess or consume up to 1.5 ounces of “cannabis plant material” and up to 5 ounces in a locked container in a home or in the trunk or locked glove box in the person’s vehicle. Retail sales of recreational cannabis in Connecticut are not expected to begin until summer 2022 at the earliest. Clinton town manager Karl Kilduff told the Register that at a public hearing in September on the issue, 15 of 17 people spoke against allowing cannabis establishments in the town. The town’s police chief also expressed concern about a “black market” developing alongside the legal market.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The University of Delaware has introduced new safety measures following student protests that criticized the school’s delayed action after a student was charged with attacking his ex-girlfriend, also a UD student, on Oct. 8. The security initiatives, which went into effect last week, include an expanded safety escort program, a new nighttime shuttle service and a reevaluation of the blue light phone system that connects students to police. “The safety of our community is our top concern and we’ll be actively driving improvement of all available resources for our students to address that priority head on,” John Long, the university’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, said in a statement. Long, who oversees the units in charge of campus safety, said he worked with President Dennis Assanis and other campus leaders to develop the new pilot programs. He said they are specifically focused on students going to and from their residences. University police officers will now have a golf cart to drive students to and from on-campus residences, according to the announcement. Those in nearby off-campus housing can take a shuttle from four on-campus locations. Both programs will run from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m., seven days a week. Students can request rides using the LiveSafe app or by calling 831-RIDE.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A George Washington University fraternity house was broken into and vandalized, with a Jewish text desecrated, WUSA-TV reports. George Washington University Police are investigating the incident in which a Torah scroll at Tau Kappa Epsilon was destroyed. The crime happened Saturday and was discovered Sunday morning, according to a police report. “Our entire chapter is outraged and saddened by the blatant act of antisemitism against our brothers,” the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity said in a statement on Instagram. The fraternity said it is cooperating with police and the Anti-Defamation League. In a tweet, the ADL’s D.C. regional office said it was disturbed by the incident and said officials were in touch with students and the campus police. “We expect a full and rapid investigation,” the ADL said. University President Thomas LeBlanc issued a statement late Sunday saying George Washington University Police is working with D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department to find who is responsible. “I want to be clear: I condemn all such acts of antisemitism and all forms of hatred, discrimination, and bias in our community. Any act of antisemitism is an attack on the entire GW community and cannot, and will not, be tolerated,” LeBlanc said in the statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The University of Florida is prohibiting three professors from providing expert testimony in a lawsuit challenging a new law that critics claim restricts voting rights, saying it goes against the school’s interest by conflicting with the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis. Though the decision is being criticized as threat to academic freedom and free speech, the university said in a statement Saturday that allowing professors Dan Smith, Michael McDonald and Sharon Austin to serve as paid experts for plaintiffs challenging the law would be “adverse to the university’s interests as a state of Florida institution.” Lawyers for a coalition of civic groups challenging the law said in court papers Friday that the professors were told by the university that their expert testimony would dissent from the DeSantis administration, creating a conflict for the school. Attorneys for the professors said Saturday that they would take legal action claiming violations of the First Amendment and academic freedom if the school doesn’t reverse the decision. “The university cannot silence the professors on matters of great public importance. These professors are citizens entitled to participate in the marketplace of ideas,” attorneys Paul Donnelly and Conor Flynn said in a letter to a university lawyer. “These unlawful restrictions are shameful, and could very well deter top scholars from joining UF’s ranks.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A large spider native to East Asia has spun its thick, golden web on power lines, porches and vegetable patches all over north Georgia this year – a proliferation that has driven some unnerved homeowners indoors and prompted a flood of anxious social media posts. In metro Atlanta, self-described arachnophobe Jennifer Turpin stopped blowing leaves in her yard after inadvertently walking into a web created by the Joro spider. Stephen Carter has avoided a walking trail along the Chattahoochee River where he encountered Joro webs every dozen steps. Farther east in Winterville, Will Hudson’s front porch became unusable amid an abundance of Joro webs 10 feet deep. Hudson estimates he’s killed more than 300 of the spiders on his property. “The webs are a real mess,” said Hudson, an entomologist at the University of Georgia. “Nobody wants to come out of the door in the morning, walk down the steps and get a face full of spider web.” The Joro – Trichonephila clavata – is part of a group of spiders known as orb weavers for their highly organized, wheel-shaped webs. Common in Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan, Joro females have colorful yellow, blue and red markings on their bodies. They can measure 3 inches across when their legs are fully extended. Hudson is convinced they will spread across the South.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lava continues to pour out of Kilauea’s summit crater, more than a month after the latest eruption began at the Hawaii volcano. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Friday that lava was emerging from a single vent inside Halemaumau Crater. The eruption is contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and isn’t threatening any homes. Nightime aerial video shot from a helicopter shows lava gushing from a vent and spreading across the crater floor. Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It has erupted dozens of times since 1952. The latest eruption began inside the crater Sept. 29. In 2018, the volcano erupted from vents within a residential neighborhood. That episode sent streams of lava across the Puna district of the Big Island, destroying farms and more than 700 homes.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Instances of hoarding, illegal reselling and bad behavior by customers have caused the state agency that sells alcohol to change how it rolls out rare spirits at stores, officials said. The Idaho State Liquor Division late last month announced new rules involving rare but highly sought-after bourbons, whiskeys and other small-batch liquor offerings. That combination has resulted in what the agency calls unsavory behavior by some customers that includes harassment of store workers. The new rules mean the agency will now sporadically allocate rare products across its 67 retail outlets to create what it calls a “treasure hunt” approach. The agency also has stopped listing rare-product inventory on its website and will only sell alcohol visible on store shelves. The changes follow reports of shoppers getting “very aggressive with these products,” Tony Faraca, the Idaho State Liquor Division’s chief financial officer, told The Idaho Statesman. “We know that there is a lot of hoarding going on,” he said. “We know that there are illegal secondary sales going on. Our store employees are being harassed by these whiskey groups. It’s causing a lot of stress and turmoil with our staff.” He said some groups try to buy up rare bottles that have limits of one per customer. Some customers, armed with inventory details, have tried to persuade employees to go into storage and dig through unopened boxes. Now that the agency has stopped sharing inventory details, “our hope is that more people will get to partake in the rare product,” Faraca said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A judge on Monday suspended a Dec. 31 deadline for the city’s police officers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but didn’t interfere with a requirement that they be regularly tested for the coronavirus. Disputes over vaccinations should be handled as a labor grievance with an arbitrator, Cook County Judge Raymond Mitchell said. “The effect of this order is to send these parties back to the bargaining table and to promote labor peace by allowing them to pursue” remedies under Illinois law, Mitchell said. The grievance process could last months, the city said last week. Officers who haven’t been vaccinated still must be tested twice a week under city policy. Officers also can lose work and pay if they don’t disclose their vaccine status. “The principal risk to those who are unvaccinated is to themselves and to others who choose to be unvaccinated,” the judge said. Police Superintendent David Brown last week said 70% had disclosed their vaccination status, and 80% of those officers reported being vaccinated. Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration announced the vaccine policy weeks ago, drawing sharp objections from police union leaders. The judge noted that COVID-19 has killed many officers nationwide. “In light of that terrible sacrifice, the police unions’ request just to have their grievances heard seems a pretty modest task,” Mitchell said.\n\nIndiana\n\nConnersville: A fire that badly damaged a Black City Council member’s home is being investigated by the FBI after a racial slur was found spray-painted at the house. The fire broke out about 3:30 a.m. Friday at the home of Connersville City Councilman Tommy Williams, who is Black, while his wife said the couple and their two sons were away on vacation. The racial slur was painted on the back patio, and FBI agents spent Saturday at the house, Emma Williams said. FBI Special Agent Steve Secor confirmed Monday that the agency was working with state and local authorities investigating the fire in the 13,000-person city about 50 miles east of Indianapolis. Secor said no suspects had been immediately identified. Williams said she had no idea who would attack her family in this way, and she was forgiving whoever is responsible. “I’m grateful for our community,” Williams told WXIN-TV. “We have really good people here, and I don’t want this to be a message that represents our village here because it’s a lie. It’s not what we’re about here.” Tommy Williams, a retired U.S. Postal Service worker and Army veteran, was elected by a Republican caucus last year to fill a City Council vacancy. An online fundraiser had collected more than $30,000 on Monday to assist the family’s recovery.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Beef, chicken, bread, fruit and vegetables, and paper products are among items school districts are struggling to get so they can provide varied and quality meals to students. Schools are making changes to their breakfast and lunch menus “nearly weekly” to account for items that are delayed or unavailable, said Alison Demory, Iowa City schools’ nutrition services director. “If we saw the light at the end of the tunnel, we might feel a little better,” Demory told the Cedar Rapids Gazette. “I’ve heard this isn’t going to go away any time soon.” Staffing shortages at food manufacturers and distributors are making it challenging to make and transport enough products to meet the demand, Demory said. Some items can be ordered only in a limited quantity, which may not meet the needs of the Iowa City district. “If we can only order two cases of a product at a time, that’s a problem,” Demory said. Instead of providing individual bags of chips, the district is purchasing bulk orders and portioning them out to students, which requires more preparation, Demory said, giving an example of how the supply chain shortages can cause more work down the line. Cedar Rapids schools have had to substitute products but are able to offer similar items to “maintain the quality and integrity of our meals,” said Jennifer Hook, Cedar Rapids schools’ food and nutrition department manager.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A first-year state lawmaker, who was reprimanded by his colleagues for abusive conduct before taking office, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. Democratic state Rep. Aaron Coleman of Kansas City remained in custody Sunday afternoon, according to Johnson County Jail records. The 21-year-old was arrested Saturday evening by Overland Park police on a domestic battery charge. Police didn’t immediately respond to messages Sunday, and calls to Coleman’s cellphone rang unanswered Sunday. Coleman is not married, and details of his domestic situation were not immediately available. It wasn’t immediately clear what consequences Coleman might face in the House after his arrest. He was being held without bond ahead of a court appearance scheduled for Monday. “Given what little we know about the situation, I am concerned for everyone involved,” Speaker of the House Ron Ryckman told the Kansas City Star. “I know that law enforcement will thoroughly investigate and assess the situation so that we can take appropriate action.” House Democratic Leader Tom Sawyer said Coleman should resign. “This is extremely disturbing news. We are watching closely to make sure we gather all the facts,” Sawyer said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s workers are taking a cue from country crooner Johnny Paycheck, telling their employers to “take this job and shove it.” And they’re doing so at a rate higher than any other state in the country. In August, 84,000 Kentuckians quit their jobs – a 26,000-person increase from the number who quit in July, according to the State Job Openings and Labor Turnover report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the mass exodus of workers in Kentucky, the commonwealth has the nation’s highest quit rate, the total number of workers who quit during an entire month as a percent of total employment. In Kentucky, the quit rate was 4.5% as of August – a 1.4% increase from the month prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The states with the next-highest quit rates were Georgia and Idaho, with rates of 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively. But there is a glimmer of hope for the commonwealth: 103,000 Kentuckians were hired in August 2021, with a hire rate of 5.5%, the fifth-highest of any state and 1.2% higher than the national average. Gov. Andy Beshear said during a recent press conference that “our challenges in the labor market are complex” but that “there’s some really good things going on right now,” and “people ought to feel more hope than concern.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is continuing its “Shot for $100” COVID-19 vaccine incentive program through November, hoping to persuade more people to get the shots by offering them money. More than 19,000 people have received a Visa cash card through the effort so far. The program aimed at college students started in August. Gov. John Bel Edwards expanded it in October to cover anyone getting newly vaccinated. The state Department of Health said 5- to 11-year-olds will be eligible if federal officials sign off on a vaccine for the children and if their parents give consent for them to get immunized. “Thanks to many Louisianans working together, the fourth surge is behind us, but in order to help avoid another surge we need many more of our people to get vaccinated,” Edwards, a Democrat, said in a statement. “This is how we’re going to put this pandemic behind us and protect our loved ones and our communities.” To be eligible, people must use one of the community-based vaccination sites listed on ShotFor100.com. A person may only participate once in the program. After getting the shot, those participating receive the gift card and must register it online so it will be loaded with $100. More information is available on the website or by calling Louisiana’s vaccine hotline at 1-855-453-0774.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The battle over a 145-mile electricity transmission line is the most expensive ballot-question campaign in the state’s history. More than $90 million from utilities has flowed into the fight over the $1 billion project funded by ratepayers in Massachusetts that supporters say would remove carbon from the environment and provide needed electricity. The high-stakes campaign put environmental and conservation groups at odds and pitted utilities backing the project against operators of fossil fuel-powered plants that stand to lose money. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who supports the project, made a last-minute pitch over the weekend for bold action against climate change. “We just can’t afford just to do nothing,” she said. A ballot question Tuesday will let Maine voters have their say. The project has received all the necessary permits, and construction began 10 months ago. But a court ruling called into question a state lease for a 1-mile section. More litigation is expected regardless of the outcome of the vote. Lewiston Mayor Mark Cayer said he doesn’t understand the opposition, noting that the new sections are being built in working forests that have been logged repeatedly over the years.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The process of recognizing saints in Catholicism can take generations, but the church can accelerate matters when it wants, as it did in the cases of Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Pope John Paul II, waiving a five-year waiting period after their deaths to get the process started. Now a group of Baltimore Catholics says it’s time to expedite the cases of six other heroes of the faith. Parishioners of St. Ann’s Catholic Church, a predominantly African American congregation, and the two other churches in its pastorate, Historic St. Francis Xavier and St. Wenceslaus, seek to make the case that the church should immediately canonize six Black American Catholics. Those include Mother Mary Lange, a Baltimore nun who started and ran a school for Black children during the era of slavery. They supporters planned to use a special Mass at St. Ann’s on Monday night to advocate for the cause, and organizers have said they’ll also use the All Saints’ Day service to launch a national letter-writing campaign to Pope Francis. Also among the proposed candidates are a Haitian American former slave, Pierre Toussaint, who went on to became a successful business owner and philanthropist, and Mississippi-born scholar-evangelist Thea Bowman. They had to overcome so much racism inside and outside the church during their lives that their cases should be viewed as exceptional, said Ralph E. Moore Jr., a St. Ann’s member helping to lead the effort. The church has never made a Black American Catholic a saint.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nOrleans: The Coast Guard and other authorities were searching off the coast of Cape Cod on Monday for a small plane that failed to arrive as scheduled Sunday night, officials said. The Piper PA-28 that departed from Reading, Pennsylvania, was reported missing about 10 p.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. It was headed to Chatham Municipal Airport in Massachusetts. One person was on board the plane, the Coast Guard said in a tweet. The original call was made to the Air Force Regional Command Center by a concerned friend who was waiting for the aircraft in Chatham. The Air Force then contacted the Coast Guard. The aircraft’s last transmitted transponder signal was at 6:49 p.m. descending at 4,000 feet per minute. The search taking place off Nauset Beach in Orleans involved a Coast Guard fixed-wing aircraft and a helicopter and three Coast Guard vessels, as well as area harbormasters and other assets, the Coast Guard said. No information about the plane’s occupant was released.\n\nMichigan\n\nMackinaw City: Business owners on Mackinac Island are celebrating a big rebound in tourism this year after fewer visitors made the journey to the island in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many visitors discovered the iconic carless-island getaway for the first time this year, said business owners on the island, which sits in the Straits of Mackinac separating Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas. Chris Shepler, a third-generation operator of Shepler’s Ferry, which shuttles visitors to Mackinac Island, said the summer “was out of control” for the ferry service. “Absolutely crazy. We set records for our all-time busiest summer in the history of our company,” he said. Through Sept. 1, the island’s overall hotel room revenue for the 2021 season was on pace to smash the record year it saw in 2019, when revenue topped $74.56 million, said Tim Hygh, executive director of the Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau. Final data is still be crunched for 2021, he said. “It came after vaccinations, and people were so eager to travel. The market found us,” Hygh said. As everything closes up for the season on the island known for its hiking, biking and horse-drawn carriage rides, Mackinac Island Mayor Margaret Doud said she’s cautious but hopeful about what 2022 may hold. “I look forward to moving out of the pandemic, but we are still in a pandemic,” said Doud, who is often found at the front desk of the iconic Windermere Hotel.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Those who monitor voting access for people with disabilities say the state generally does a good job on the issue, but it’s not without challenges. Minnesota Council on Disability ADA Director David Fenley said while barriers still persist, the state provides good general access for voters with different disabilities. Polling stations are equipped with an accessible voting machine for people with vision impairments, with many counties using an electronic ballot marker machine called AutoMARK. “Just say, ‘Hey, where’s your AutoMARK? I need an accessible voting machine,’ ” he advised. Grace Gouker Littlefield, executive director at a new Minnesota-based organization called Able to Vote, is working to connect people with voting resources. Littlefield said she wants to see more disabled voters like herself with equal access across the country, starting in her own backyard this fall, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. A chat feature on AbleToVote.org connects staff to people who need assistance finding transportation to the polls, coming up with a voting plan or reporting an accessibility barrier. “Just understand that the lives of people with disabilities can be very complex,” Littlefield said. “And this process should not be political, even though people are voting for political offices sometimes.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city will soon start installing larger water pipes to replace some of the lines that failed during a deep freeze that struck the Deep South in February. WLBT-TV reports 48-inch cast iron water transmission lines have been arriving in south Jackson. City engineer Charles Williams said officials gave the order last week to proceed with the final phase of the project, which involves laying 2 miles of pipes in the area. The work will connect water transmission lines from the O.B. Curtis Treatment Plant to south Jackson. They will replace 24-inch pipes that failed to provide adequate water pressure from the plant during the winter storm. Thousands of Jackson residents lost water service for weeks after the storm, and those with running water had to boil it because of the danger of contamination when pressure is low. “We’re actually placing a new water main service, and then we’ll be taking off some of the existing service lines that are in the area that are smaller and tie it into that 48,” Williams said. “So the improved capacity will help improve water pressure and also limit disruptions of service due to failed water mains.” The $8 million project is funded through federal money. Installation of the new pipes is expected to be complete by March 2023, depending on weather.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: One of the leaders of a St. Louis charter school has been appointed to the State Board of Education by Gov. Mike Parson. Kerry Casey will begin serving on the state board immediately, the governor’s office said Monday. Her term will run until July 1, 2027, if she is confirmed by the state Senate. The State Board of Education oversees Missouri’s 518 public school districts, 37 charter schools, and state schools for the blind, deaf and severely disabled. Casey, of Chesterfield, was a founding board member of the KIPP Charter School and continues to serve on its board. She also is vice president for global sales at Exegy, a financial markets data company. She replaces Victor Lenz of St. Louis, whose term on the State Board of Education expired in July 2019. Missouri law allows board members to continue serving until the governor appoints a replacement. Lenz had been serving as the board’s vice president. Two other board members also are serving on expired terms: President Charlie Shields of St. Joseph, whose term expired in July 2020, and Donald Claycomb of Linn, whose term expired this past July.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s redistricting commission delayed a decision on a map dividing the state into congressional districts after an all-day meeting Saturday. The commission failed to reach a consensus on the map proposals it was considering, instead kicking the decision until after receiving more public comments this week as it speeds toward a Nov. 14 deadline. The two Democrats on the commission pushed to approve a map they had proposed that would divide the state into an eastern and western district and place Kalispell, a Republican stronghold in the northwest corner of the state, in the eastern district. That map would give Democrats a fighting shot at winning in the western district despite the state’s increasingly red political hue. But the map faced opposition from Republican members of the commission, who are against placing the mountain community of Kalispell in an eastern district dominated by prairieland and agricultural communities. Commission Chair Maylinn Smith, who was appointed by the state’s Supreme Court, said she could not break the tie in favor of a proposal by Democrats or Republicans before receiving additional public comment on a new proposal submitted by the Republican members of the commission just two days before the meeting.\n\nNebraska\n\nBridgeport: One small western Nebraska county is using roughly half the federal coronavirus aid money it is set to receive for bonuses of up to $10,000 each for county employees. Morrill County officials approved the bonuses in August as hazard pay for the county’s roughly 50 employees, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The county is set to receive about $900,000 from the federal program. Most of the state’s 92 other counties are still deciding how to spend the roughly $376 million they will share from the American Rescue Plan Act, but the Morrill County attorney and officials with the Nebraska Association of County Officials say using the money for premium pay is allowed. Jon Cannon, the executive director of the counties group, said he’s telling officials not to rush to spend the money because they have until the end of 2024 to decide what to use it for. Morrill County officials said the bonuses were warranted because of the work employees did throughout the pandemic, which included keeping the courthouse in Bridgeport open the entire time. “There were a lot of things you couldn’t use it for,” said Jeff Metz, of Angora, chairman of the three-member Morrill County Board. “We ran across that one of the allowable expenses was hazard pay. We felt that fit with what we were trying to do.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The return this week of a big automotive products trade show is expected to draw as many as 100,000 people to the Las Vegas Convention Center, tourism and event officials said. The Specialty Equipment Market Association show, commonly known as SEMA, opens Tuesday, after being canceled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. It runs through Thursday, followed by a public event Friday dubbed “SEMA Ignited” in the convention center parking area. A companion event, the Automotive Aftermarket Products Expo, will be held at the Sands Expo and Convention Center – part of what the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority dubs Automotive Aftermarket Industry Week. SEMA represents a multibillion-dollar automotive aftermarket industry and has been held in Las Vegas since 1977, when it moved from the Anaheim Convention Center in California. Electric vehicles will be featured this year, and convention attendees will be able to ride Tesla vehicles in the nearly 1-mile underground people-mover built between convention center stops by Elon Musk’s The Boring Co. SEMA executive Tom Gattuso told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the show this year has 51,000 registered buyers and could host 100,000 industry professionals.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLincoln: A company that offers old-fashioned train rides along Lake Winnipesaukee and the Pemigewasset River says it won’t operate its annual Santa Express Trains this season because of rising COVID-19 cases in the state. The Hobo & Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad said in news release Monday that it hopes to offer the holiday trips, during which participants meet Santa and Mrs. Claus, next year. The Santa Express trains run from Lincoln. The railroad still plans to reopen for its regular season next year in mid-May. “The railroad had planned to make Santa Express Train tickets available in early November, but due to COVID-19 positivity rates trending upward, we felt it best to hold off on ticket sales due to the surrounding uncertainty,” railroad manager Benjamin Clark said. Last week, Dr. Benjamin Chan, the state epidemiologist, said New Hampshire continues to have a high or substantial level of community transmission, averaging 500 to 550 new infections per day with a coronavirus test positivity rate around 6%.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Calls for help to a statewide children’s mental health hotline have increased compared to last year as parents seek help, especially during the morning hours, according to the commissioner of the Department for Children and Families. The overall call volume to the Children’s System of Care increased, with the most calls coming from parents as their children experience stress before school hours, Commissioner Christine Norbut Beyer said during a state COVID-19 briefing. “Getting adjusted to something as simple as taking the bus can be stressful,” she said, referring to behavioral and emotional challenges faced by K-12 students returning to in-person school after a year of hybrid or remote learning as “a pandemic of mental health.” It is typical to see a rise in mental health reporting from K-12 students during the month of October, when educators become familiar with their students and are able to assist parents in reporting complaints and concerns. But this year, the uptick in calls occurred in September, with more than 10,000 calls, peaking in the morning, and particularly on Monday mornings, said Jason Butkowski, a DCF representative. Such calls in the morning usually have to do with school-avoidant behavior.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBernalillo: Town officials deny wrongdoing in the installation of a hidden surveillance camera in a police office used by a now-former police sergeant who says her expectation of privacy was violated. An attorney for Monica Torres has formally notified the town that Torres intends to file a lawsuit alleging violation of a state law requiring consent from at least one person in a recording, KRQE-TV reports. Video obtained by KRQE shows a town worker installing the video camera in an air conditioning vent under the direction of Bernalillo Police Department Chief Broderick Sharp and a police lieutenant when Torres was on vacation in November 2020. “I freaked out,” Torres recalled to KRQE about when an office visitor spotted the camera a week or two later. “I had changed (clothes) numerous times in there.” KRQE reports it obtained records of a New Mexico State Police investigation prompted by a complaint by Torres. Video from the hidden camera showed a male sergeant shutting the door to change clothes inside the office, KRQE reports. The State Police investigation ended by concluding that no crime had been found. The matter was submitted to the District Attorney’s Office of the 13th Judicial District for review. That office said a special prosecutor would decide whether to file charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A giant red heart sculpture installed last week in Central Park as a tribute to health care workers and COVID-19 victims has been taken down – an apparent casualty of confusion and red tape. Italian sculptor Sergio Furnari said he was walking by the park Thursday afternoon with friends when he noticed that his “Heroes Heart Monument” was gone. When he went to file a police report, he said, he was bounced from police station to police station until a police officer on Friday showed him video of people removing the 10-foot-tall, 3,000-pound monument and placing it on a truck. “They literally broke my heart,” he said. Furnari conceded he did not have a permit to place the heart in the park but considered a $4,000 grant he received from New York City’s government to be his permit for the temporary installation. He said he considered the removal of his memorial “an abuse of power.” A message seeking comment was left with the Central Park Conservancy, the nonprofit that manages the park on behalf of the city. Furnari said he planned to go to the organization Monday to find out what happened to his heart. Furnari said he wanted the sculpture to be a place for emotional and spiritual solace in the bustling city and not just a popular spot for selfies, though he said he was cool with that, too.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreensboro: Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones has urged supporters of public education to organize to fight “anti-history laws” being promoted by Republican lawmakers. Hannah-Jones said the left hasn’t gotten “mad enough” in opposing the “culture war that has been contrived by the right wing” that has led to laws banning schools from teaching things such as her 1619 Project. She said at an online forum of North Carolina educators last week that people are living in “dark and scary times” in which teachers are “afraid to even teach and talk about the experiences that their children are having.” “We’re being outgunned right now, and I think that’s because this is not an issue that’s getting enough of the people on the left angry,” Hannah-Jones said. “People on the right are very angry, and anger is often what inspires you to organize and to push for laws and to push for these changes.” Hannah-Jones was the keynote speaker Tuesday at the Color of Education Summit, a two-day virtual event drawing 1,600 people “to engage in critical conversations centered on addressing issues of racial equity and education.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Paleontologists have given the name “Beautiful Nightmare” to a rare dinosaur fossil thought to be the only partial skull of its species found in North Dakota. “She is a beautiful example of her species, and she was a nightmare in her day to a lot of other critters,” said Fossil Excavators President Mike Kjelland, an assistant professor of biology at Mayville State University. The specimen, which includes an upper jawbone and lower teeth, is thought to be a Nanotyrannus, closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex. Only five Nano partial skulls have been found in the world, though there is debate about whether the fossils are instead of juvenile T. rex, Kjelland said. Researchers uncovered the Nano and myriad other fossils – some rare and potentially new species – on private land at a remote Badlands canyon Kjelland found two years ago near Bowman while looking for the fossil-rich Hell Creek Formation. The site comprises an ancient river channel and sandbar. The fossils, which date to 66 million to 69 million years ago, represent a diverse array of creatures from the Late Cretaceous, including two notable Triceratops skulls that drew national attention, The Bismarck Tribune reports.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A concealed weapons permit would become optional, and the requirement that individuals “promptly” notify police officers they are carrying a concealed weapon would be eliminated, under proposed legislation in the state House. The bill is similar to a measure pending in the state Senate and one of several GOP-backed proposals in recent years seeking to expand gun rights in Ohio. The concealed weapons bill, dubbed “Constitutional Carry” by its backers, is sponsored by Republican Reps. Tom Brinker of Cincinnati and Kris Jordan of Ostrander. Gun owners could still apply for a concealed weapons permit under the measure, allowing those who obtain it to carry a concealed weapon in states with reciprocity agreements recognizing such permits. The GOP-controlled House Government Oversight Committee approved the bill along party lines last week. The concept has the backing of the Buckeye Firearms Association, which says 21 other states allow people to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Gun control groups such as Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America oppose it, along with law enforcement groups. Rep. Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo, said the bill has been rushed with little time for discussion and would make Ohio less safe.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board on Monday recommended Gov. Kevin Stitt spare the life of death row inmate Julius Jones, whose murder conviction for the 1999 killing of an Edmond businessman has drawn national attention. The board recommended in a 3-1 vote that Stitt grant Jones clemency and commute his sentence to life in prison with the possibility of parole after hearing from Jones, 41, who testified via video link from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Several members of the panel agreed they had doubts about the evidence that led to Jones’ conviction. One board member, Scott Williams, recused himself from the vote because of an existing friendship with an attorney who has advocated for Jones. “I continue to believe there is still doubt in this case,” said board member Kelly Doyle. The lone vote against clemency came from Richard Smothermon, a former prosecutor, who said he believed Jones was not being truthful in his testimony. “To believe in Mr. Jones’ theory of the case, you have to disbelieve every other piece of evidence in the case,” including testimony from law enforcement officers, independent witnesses and physical evidence, Smothermon said. Stitt must now decide whether to grant clemency or commute Jones’ sentence.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: An agreement has been reached between timber and environmental groups to overhaul management of 10 million acres of private forestlands in the state. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the deal, announced Saturday by Gov. Kate Brown’s office, concludes more than a year of negotiations to develop a plan to boost protections for vulnerable fish and wildlife while shielding the timber industry’s ability to log. Friday was the deadline for both sides to either reach consensus, abandon the process or move the deadline. “Today’s historic agreement is a perfect example of the Oregon Way – coming together at the table to find common ground, to the mutual benefit of us all,” Brown said in a statement. Jim James with the Oregon Small Woodlands Association similarly praised the compromise. “We were able to put down the contentious situations that we’ve had in the past, and we had a continuous agreement to move forward,” James said. Speaking on behalf of the timber coalition, Adrian Miller with the Florida-based forest products company Rayonier said Saturday’s agreement gives timber operators a sense of security going forward. “I think we’re all really proud to be part of a new era of forestry in Oregon,” Miller said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration told more than 70,000 state employees Monday that it is offering five days of paid leave for getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of the year, quickly drawing opposition from the state treasurer over the potential cost. The administration told employees that five days of “verification leave” can be used between Dec. 20 and March 31. Employees who don’t use the days by then will be paid for them, and an employee who has verified fully vaccinated status to the administration will automatically receive the days, it said. “This leave will help incentivize the vaccinations that protect commonwealth employees and the Pennsylvanians we serve,” the administration told employees. “It’s one more way we can show our gratitude to employees who step up to help us protect our communities and bring this pandemic to an end.” The administration already offers employees a paid day off to get vaccinated. Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, called on Wolf, a Democrat, to abandon the plan. Her office said the cost to taxpayers for paying employees who do not use the days could amount to more than $100 million.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A federal appeals court has upheld a settlement between Brown University and student-athletes who had challenged the Ivy League school’s decision to drop several women’s varsity sports. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the university and the athletes who originally sued in letting the settlement stand. Twelve athletes on the women’s gymnastics and ice hockey teams had asked the court to reject the settlement in the interests of current and future female athletes at Brown. The settlement, approved by a federal judge in Providence last year, restores the women’s equestrian and women’s fencing teams to varsity status and calls for an end in 2024 to a 1998 legal agreement ensuring gender equity in varsity sports at Brown. The legal challenge centered on the Providence school’s decision to reduce several women’s varsity sports teams to club status. Several men’s sports were also reduced to club status, although some were later restored. The student-athletes alleged that the cuts violated the 1998 pact. The 1998 agreement had stemmed from a legal challenge to Brown’s decision to cut women’s gymnastics and volleyball in the early 1990s. Brown has said the agreement established unique reporting requirements not faced by any other U.S. college or university.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The Historic Columbia Foundation has unveiled a new look at the capital city’s LGBTQ past. Historic Columbia launched its comprehensive online oral history of the capital city’s gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer communities last month at the city’s Famously Hot South Carolina Pride festival. The foundation worked with the oral history department at the University of South Carolina to collect the stories of a diverse range of LGBTQ+ people in Columbia so that the often untold story of those communities in the Midlands can be honored and remembered. “We have to do this now before some of this stuff is lost forever,” said Kat Allen, director of research at Historic Columbia, who worked to put the comprehensive project together. “Every day more stuff gets thrown away. People pass away, and then someone says, ‘Nobody’s going to want this,’ but USC will absolutely take all of this stuff. … There are things we would have never known about without some of this material.” The project maps a timeline of Columbia’s LGBTQ+ history, from early 1900s drag shows and a procession of gay-friendly establishments to the first Pride March to the S.C. State House in 1990 that birthed today’s Pride festival.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Labor shortages in the service industry are high enough that there is now a $1,000 offer for new workers to move to the Mount Rushmore State. A new employee coming from out of state to work a job in retail, restaurants, hospitality, grocery, trades and other needed sectors can receive $1,000 payment through the South Dakota Retailers Association and its “$1,000 Workforce Incentive” push. SDRA, a partner organization for dozens of companies, is launching the $1,000 payment to supplement any hiring bonuses or other incentives straight to new employees, according to a press release Monday. The cash payout would supplement any hiring bonuses or other incentives offered by an individual business. The incentive will be paid directly to an employee hired from out of state to work in a Retailers Association member business. To be eligible, an employee must work at least 30 hours per week for 90 days at a physical location in South Dakota. Additional eligibility details are available at www.sdra.org.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Grand Ole Opry’s broadcast of its 5,000th Saturday show attracted a host of big country music stars to its historic venue. Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, Darius Rucker, Vince Gill, Chris Young and a half-dozen others lined up to celebrate the nearly century-old country music program. The radio broadcast was carried by WSM radio, the same station on which it debuted as the “Barn Dance” program in 1925. Bill Anderson, a 60-year Opry veteran, kicked off the show with the Roy Acuff tune “Wabash Cannonball.” Singer Vince Gill played an acoustic guitar he said was once owned by Opry star Sam McGee. Gill said McGee first played the famed radio program in 1926, months before the barn dance program became known as the Grand Ole Opry. Brooks and Yearwood closed the show with a set of several songs before Brooks ended with his country classic “Friends in Low Places.” “Happy 5,000 to the Grand Ole Opry,” Brooks said. “Can’t tell you how lucky we feel to be a part of it.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The city’s school district is defying a request from a Republican state lawmaker for select school districts to investigate and catalog library and classroom books related to race, gender identity or sexuality. District spokesman Jason Stanford said in an email Friday that district officials “decided that a response is not necessary, especially since anyone can search our library catalogues on this website.” Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, chairman of the Texas House General Investigating Committee, made the request to select superintendents and Texas Education Agency deputy commissioner Lily Laux in a letter with a list of more than 800 books for districts to check against library and classroom collections. The letter appears to have been sent to large urban and suburban school districts across the state, said Joy Baskin, director of legal services for the Texas Association of School Boards. The list includes award-winning books on race and social justice, as well as health books and guides, including “The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine” and titles on sexually transmitted diseases. The letter also called on districts to identify other books or content addressing “human sexuality” and “material that might make students feel discomfort ... or convey that a student, by virtue of their race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously,” mirroring language in a new Texas law targeting classroom discussions of such topics.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city, the 2021 DOCUTAH International Film Festival, and Art Around the Corner are collaborating to bring a mural to life for the public. Artists featured in the films “Alice Street and Prophets” and “Teachers & Kings” will create a mural on the side of the Electric Theatre in real time during the festival, which began Monday. This year’s mural will be a mix of artistry and an ode to filmmakers in the form of Charlie Chaplin filming a Shivwits powwow dancer and a jazz band with an artist using a paintbrush to depict the scene. Artists Desi Mundo and Pancho Peskador will be the featured artists. Initially, the films were set for 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic put them on hold. The artists and films are now back for the 100-film festival and in what DOCUTAH considers an expanded edition of the festival. “This public space mural is intended to remind us that with understanding our past and looking toward our future, St. George continues to be a vibrant and welcoming place for all to enjoy,” said Rhondalon Crawford, Board Chair of the Art Around the Corner Foundation. “The partnership with DOCUTAH and the City of St. George demonstrates the commitment our community has to all of the arts and to providing our citizens and visitors with a wide variety of artistic experiences.”\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: State educational officials will ban spectators from a high school boys soccer state semifinal this week, following alleged racist behavior and overly rough gameplay between two schools’ players earlier this year. The Vermont Principals’ Association said in a statement Monday that “this decision has been made to ensure the physical and emotional safety of all student-athletes involved.” Winooski High School has said that during the first home game of the season, its players were targeted with racial slurs by Enosburg High School’s players and fans. There’s also a separate investigation into Winooski players getting violent with Enosburg players during that Sept. 18 game, which ended in a 3-2 Winooski win. In response to the alleged racial abuse during the game, Enosburg conducted an internal investigation but found no evidence of wrongdoing. However, the school said its report was incomplete without interviewing Winooski players, who declined to participate in the investigation. Winooski’s school officials said they believe what their student-athletes reported about the racial abuse from Enosburg. Winooski Athletics Director Sam Jackson has characterized the school as Vermont’s most diverse high school.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: A schoolhouse where enslaved and free Black children were taught before the Revolutionary War will be moved from the William & Mary campus to Colonial Williamsburg and restored to its original state, officials announced Friday. The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation is buying the building that housed the Bray School, the university and foundation said in a news release. Once modern additions to the building are removed, it will be moved a few blocks to the living history museum’s campus, where it will be restored and incorporated into the foundation’s public history programming. “This nondescript building that was hidden in plain sight for decades is taking the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and William & Mary in a new and exciting direction,” Colonial Williamsburg President and CEO Cliff Fleet said. “This important work will expand our understanding of 18th-century America and add to our body of knowledge about this important time in our nation’s history.” The university says the building is likely the oldest surviving schoolhouse for African Americans. It will be the first addition to Williamsburg’s collection of historic buildings since the 1960s. The foundation expects to restore the building by 2024, the 250th anniversary of the school’s closure just before the Revolutionary War.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The former Spokane County health officer who believes he was fired last year due to unpopular decisions he made to try to contain COVID-19 has filed a claim with the health district, which could lead to a lawsuit. The Spokesman-Review reports Dr. Bob Lutz filed the administrative claim Oct. 8. Robert Carlson, Lutz’s attorney, said the hope is that the district determines Lutz’s claim has merit and works to resolve the issue out of court. Lutz is claiming at least $1.4 million in damages for wrongful termination in addition to “defamation, emotional distress, mental anguish and injury to professional reputation” as a result of his firing in October 2020. The health district has 60 days to respond to Lutz’s claim, at which point Lutz could proceed with a lawsuit. The claim details several examples of alleged political pressure and tension between Lutz and certain Board of Health members throughout 2020, especially when the county was stuck in limited phases due to COVID-19 case rates. “I took a stand for Public Health. It cost me my job,” Lutz said in a statement released through his attorney. “As a public health physician, it has been my responsibility to protect the public’s health and safety.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University has launched its newly formed Institute for Cyber Security. Marshall President Jerome Gilbert said the institute is an academic and research cluster that will support cybersecurity-related programs across the campus. “We can do research and teaching to expand our presence in the cyber arena,” Gilbert said. The new center will work to address emerging needs in cybersecurity, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. David Dampier, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Sciences, said it is designed to tap into a new mix of students and early-career professionals and connect those learners with top cybersecurity talent in the region. The institute is housed in the university’s Applied Engineering Complex.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gun dealers in the state are struggling to keep shelves stocked with ammunition. Supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic and increased demand for guns and ammunition have left shelves empty in some cases. And when a shipment does arrive at local gun stores, ammunition is quickly snapped up. Tony Blattler, of Phillips, watched as employees unloaded a shipment of .270 Winchester hunting cartridges recently at the Fleet Farm in Marshfield. Not long after, about two dozen people had filed into the store, grabbing ammunition as fast as workers could unload it, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “Probably by within an hour or two, they were sold out of that ammunition just by word of mouth,” Blattler said. Pat Kukull, owner of Superior Shooters Supply, said the store had a shortage of shotgun ammunition for trap shooting over the summer, with vendors sending maybe 2% of the usual 500 cases it might receive. She said there’s been “absolutely nothing” for those hunting pheasant, grouse or waterfowl. “Now, we’re moving into rifle season, and we haven’t had any .30-30 shells in a year to speak of, really,” Kukull said. Across Wisconsin, background checks for handguns surged 174% last year from 2019, according to the Wisconsin Department of Justice.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Employee transition efforts are ramping up with just a few weeks left before the state’s last underground coal mine shutters. The long-anticipated closure of the Bridger Underground Coal Mine was originally expected to affect 94 mine workers, according to the layoff notice sent to the Rock Springs City Council a month ago. The number of affected staff has since fallen to 89 and is continuing to shrink as staff leave to start new jobs, the Casper-Star Tribune reports. Rocky Mountain Power, whose subsidiary Bridger Coal Company owns the mine, hosted a job fair last month at which the workers it’s not retaining were able to interview with other mining companies. Two of the five companies were from out of state, meaning new hires would have to leave Rock Springs for work. But Rocky Mountain Power is also collaborating with Western Wyoming Community College in an effort to help underground mine workers access vocational training programs. Many will qualify for federal retraining funds targeting displaced coal workers. Employees’ existing skills also translate well to other mining jobs, including in the trona industry, which produces a source of soda ash, said Rick Lee, CEO of the Rock Springs Chamber of Commerce. The Green River Basin trona patch is about 40 miles from Rock Springs.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/history/2015/05/15/125-republic-anniversary-climate-fry-bread-reasons-love-arizona/27240867/", "title": "Arizona's birthday: Arizona became a state on Valentine's Day ...", "text": "Scott Craven, Kerry Lengel, Weldon B. Johnson, Karen Fernau and Connie Cone Sexton\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nThis list was originally published May 18, 2015, to celebrate 125 years of The Arizona Republic. We've brought it back to help mark Arizona's 106th birthday!\n\nThere are endless reasons to love Arizona, from the universal (diverse scenery, great weather) to deeply personal (met your romantic partner here).\n\nRegardless of whether you're a native or a recent transplant, here are our top 25 reasons -- plus 100 more -- to love Arizona.\n\n1. Grand Canyon\n\nThis is the Grand Canyon State, and we have the license plates to prove it. Mention \"Grand Canyon\" in any corner of the Earth and people will likely say, \"Arizona.\" (If they say \"Las Vegas,\" straighten them out.) Any Arizona-based list has to start with one of the greatest natural wonders.\n\n2. Native American culture\n\nThe state is blessed with museums, villages and natural wonders that reflect the lives and cultures of people who have lived here for centuries. It's a shame \"casinos\" come readily to mind.\n\n3. Sedona\n\nWith red-rock formations rarely found outside Mars, Sedona would be voted \"Best Landscape\" in most states, but not in one featuring the Grand Canyon. Still, Sedona is a beautiful runner-up.\n\n4. Xeriscaping\n\nIt's just another word for trees and shrubs that require comparatively little care. Combine gravel with drought-tolerant plants and you've just freed up a few weekend hours to watch TV instead of mowing and pruning. Unless you're into that sort of thing.\n\n5. Sunrise, sunset\n\nThe hues to be seen when the sun says hello and goodbye are almost always Instagram-worthy. Sure, some of the most incredible -rises and -sets are the result of pollutants, but if you are going to breathe air you can see, it might as well look like this.\n\n6. Decent amount of water for a desert\n\nWhat with all the lakes, pools and water parks in and around the Valley, the ability to escape the heat is never far away. And based on the number of state residents who descend on San Diego each summer, Arizona could probably annex Mission and Pacific beaches.\n\n7. Unpretentiousness\n\nWith a lack of scientific research to prove otherwise, we say Arizona is one of the 10 most easygoing, modest states (excluding time spent in trendy Scottsdale clubs). Shorts, T-shirts and a friendly vibe dominate among people who rarely take themselves too seriously (unless they're trying to be trendy in a Scottsdale club).\n\n8. Pro sports\n\nThe Phoenix metropolitan area boasts teams in seven professional sports — baseball, basketball, football, hockey, women's basketball, arena football and soccer. You know who doesn't have all these options? San Diego. Los Angeles. San Francisco. Seattle. Ha!\n\n9. Climate diversity\n\nArizona is in a continental sweet spot featuring everything from low desert to alpine meadows. We can enjoy a vast carpet of wildflowers in the spring, and a leafy canopy of golds and oranges in the fall. A different weather pattern is always just a couple of hours away. You know what's a couple of hours away during a Northeast winter? More snow.\n\n10. Birdwatching\n\nThose who visit southeast Arizona will be greeted by a bevy of birds, from sandhill cranes to all kinds of hawks, robins and sparrows. Not only is the area home to native species, but it sits along a migratory path that's often busier than Interstate 10, only with chirping, not road rage.\n\n11. Monument Valley\n\nThe Western landscape does not get more iconic than this. Name one other place that's equally associated with John Wayne and the Roadrunner. Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park straddles the Utah state line, but the visitor center, scenic drive and View Hotel are all in Arizona.\n\n12. Predictable politics\n\nClose races in which opposing parties nearly split seats can lead to ineffectiveness (case in point: the federal government). That doesn't happen here, where an \"R\" by a name all but guarantees victory. It's so much easier to pass laws without any opposing views getting in the way.\n\n13. Brief state history\n\nArizona became a state on Feb. 14, 1912, and is the youngest of the 48 contiguous states. Imagine being a high school student in, say, Virginia, where the state history encompasses nearly 240 years. That's going to take several semesters. Arizona's history can be wrapped up in one, leaving other semesters for photography and culinary arts.\n\n14. Counties bigger than states\n\nArizona's largest county by area (Coconino) is bigger than nine states. Maricopa County is larger than eight states. Even Arizona's smallest county, Santa Cruz, is larger than Rhode Island.\n\n15. Hispanic roots\n\nArizona's culture and history are richer for the strong ties to Mexico and Central America. From art to food to fashion, Latino traditions have given the state much to honor and celebrate.\n\n16. Frank Lloyd Wright\n\nHomes and structures built or inspired by the famed architect draw attention and tourists. Taliesin West in Scottsdale is a mecca for fans and students, and it stands out in a region where tile and stucco are so omnipresent that you'd expect to find the materials on the state emblem.\n\n17. Old West image\n\nTourists, especially those from overseas, still expect to see gun-toting cowboys on horseback rounding up cattle on a cactus-studded plain. And dude ranches offer just that. As well as air-conditioned cabins and Wi-Fi. Even the Old West has to keep up with the times.\n\n18. Pope scope\n\nThe Vatican loves to look to the heavens as much as anyone, and its Observatory Research Group is hosted by Steward Observatory on the University of Arizona campus. The state's weather lends itself to optimal nighttime viewing.\n\n19. Hoover Dam\n\nRetaining as much water as it does puns, this dam landmark is a monument to man's hubris toward nature. Take the dam tour to hear about the dam history, dam power generation and other dam facts. So many dam puns. (Note: Hoover straddles the Nevada state line, but the cool activities are in Arizona.)\n\n20. Sandra Day O'Connor\n\nThe former U.S. Supreme Court Justice is the embodiment of Arizona's pioneering spirit. Her strength and determination made her a force in the male-dominated legal profession, and her name fittingly graces Arizona State University's law school.\n\n21. John McCain\n\nOne of the nation's leading conservative voices, the Republican U.S. senator is synonymous with Arizona. With frequent appearances on national TV talk shows, his authoritative voice is more familiar than most political leaders'. Sure, there was that little slip with Sarah Palin, but all is forgiven.\n\n22. London Bridge\n\nThe British may laugh at how chain-saw tycoon Robert McCullough paid $2.4 million for a sinking bridge (shipping not included) and reassembled it in a small lakeside town. Now the bridge stars in every \"You won't believe what's in Arizona\" list, bringing more than $2.4 million worth of tourist attention to Lake Havasu City. Now who's laughing?\n\n23. Fry bread\n\nKeep your cronuts and your doughscuits and your cup-pies. The simple deliciousness of fry bread is far more satisfying than any trendy pastry hybrid. Sprinkled with powdered sugar or drizzled with honey, fry bread is the perfect dessert. By the way, there are no such things as cup-pies. Yet.\n\n24. Personalized license plates\n\nHave an opinion or cause you want to support on your bumper? There's a personalized plate for you. Arizona offers 51, from Alternative Fuel to Women Veterans. In the unlikely event that you are a veteran who enjoys watching the Phoenix Suns and has kids in the Boy and Girl Scouts who love pets and the Thunderbird School of Global Management, you have six plates to choose from. Decisions, decisions.\n\n25. No daylight-saving time\n\nWhile America springs forward and falls back, Arizona sticks to its time guns. We like our sunrises and sunsets right where they are on the clock, so you can keep your time ambivalence.\n\nExploring\n\nHere are some reasons to love exploring Arizona.\n\n26. Apache Trail\n\nThis winding road into the Superstition Mountains was built in the early 1900s to move workers and supplies to the Roosevelt Dam construction site. It is still unpaved for many miles. You'll pass desert vistas, three lakes and the Old West-style town of Tortilla Flat. In 1911, President Theodore Roosevelt noted the route's beauty: \"The Apache Trail combines the grandeur of the Alps, the glory of the Rockies, the magnificence of the Grand Canyon and then adds an indefinable something that none of the others have.\"\n\n27. Saguaro National Park\n\nYou expect cactus. What you might not expect are ponderosa pines, aspens and fir trees. Yet they all exist in the 92,000-acre park that straddles Tucson like saddlebags. Elevation ranges from 2,300 feet on the west side to 8,482 feet at the summit of Rincon Peak on the east side. Take your pick of scenic drives and hiking trails. There's plenty for cyclists and equestrians to like, too.\n\n28. Antelope Canyon\n\nWho hasn't admired a photo of this canyon, where ethereal light teases rich reds, bright yellows and warm oranges into mind-bending shapes and patterns? The canyon, about 3 miles southeast of Page, has upper and lower portions, with tours available for both. The upper section is a short, flat walk; ladders get you into and out of the lower portion.\n\n29. Schnebly Hill Road\n\nIn a state packed with scenic drives, how do you narrow the choices? If your wish list includes huge views, red-rock scenery and a twisty dirt road, head for Schnebly Hill Road in Sedona. For maximum thrills, start at the top. Snake your way down, stopping at the overlooks so the driver can get a break from concentrating. If you don't want to beat up your vehicle, several companies in Sedona offer four-wheel-drive tours.\n\n30. Prescott lakes\n\nThe otherworldly rock formations of the Granite Dells make Watson Lake one of the coolest day trips you can take from the Valley. Rent a canoe or a kayak to explore the coves, or just sit on a rock at sunset. Nearby Willow Lake has the same attractions. Goldwater Lake, nestled in the pines just south of Prescott, also has a playground, volleyball court, horseshoe pits and picnic ramadas.\n\n31. Wupatki/Sunset Crater Volcano\n\nIt would be impossible to drive the 36-mile road that links these national monuments north of Flagstaff and not imagine what it must have been like when the volcano blew. The impressive Wupatki Pueblo and other ruins indicate that this was a thriving community. The eerie Bonito Lava Flow shows the power of the eruption of Sunset Crater nearly 1,000 years ago.\n\n32. Mogollon Rim scenic drive\n\nForest Road 300 meanders nearly 45 miles atop the Mogollon Rim between State Route 87 and Woods Canyon Lake, providing vistas that range from nice to gorgeous to stunning. You'll pass meadows, thick stands of conifers and a few aspens. There's a good chance of spotting elk, deer and other wildlife. There are several trailheads along the way. FR 300 isn't paved, but it is in generally good shape. Drive with care and you won't need a high-clearance vehicle.\n\n33. Tombstone\n\nTombstone lures Old West buffs like the Louvre attracts art lovers. It is a pilgrimage that everyone who loves Western movies or history — they are seldom the same — needs to make. You can witness shootouts, ride a stagecoach, dress up like a gunfighter or saloon girl, take a Jeep tour into the Dragoon Mountains and listen to the voice of actor Vincent Price describe the origins of the town at the Historama.\n\n34. Japanese Friendship Garden\n\nJapanese Friendship Garden: It's near downtown Phoenix but you might drive right past this tranquil spot. The garden, named Ro Ho En, is designed to be an authentic Japanese Stroll Garden with tea garden and tea house. Set among 3.5 acres near 3rd Avenue and Roosevelt Street, the site offers more than 1,500 tons of hand-picked rock, stone footbridges, lanterns and dozens of varieties of plants. Take a walk, and you'll go past flowing streams, a 12-foot waterfall, and a Koi pond with more than 300 colorful Koi fish.\n\n35. Pipe Spring National Monument\n\nPerched in the desolation of the Arizona Strip, this monument is an intriguing window into pioneer life. Pipe Spring is a water source used by humans for thousands of years and the site of a cattle ranch established in 1870. Guided tours are offered through a ranch house known as Winsor Castle. A museum contains pioneer and Native American exhibits.\n\nArts and culture\n\nHere are 10 things we love about Arizona's arts and culture. Faves range from the Musical Instrument Museum to the acclaimed Childsplay theater troupe.\n\n36. Musical Instrument Museum\n\nSee more than 6,000 instruments from every corner of the globe, from South African guitars built of oil cans to a giant self-playing \"organ\" made of drums, accordions and saxophones. The Artist Gallery shows pop-culture icons ranging from a Vegas-era Elvis jumpsuit to the piano John Lennon used to compose \"Imagine.\" And you can hear music from around the world on Wi-Fi headphones that tune in to the nearest exhibit.\n\n37. Center for Creative Photography\n\nLocated in Tucson, the center aims to offer the \"finest academic art museums and study centers for the history of photography.'' The center opened in 1975 and began with the archives of five master photographers—Ansel Adams, Wynn Bullock, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind, and Frederick Sommer. The collection has grown to include more than 230 archival collections. There are more than five million archival objects at the center, including negatives, work prints, contact sheets, albums, scrapbooks, correspondence, writings, audiovisual materials and memorabilia.\n\n38. ASU Gammage\n\nThis 50-year-old Tempe icon designed by Frank Lloyd Wright is the Valley's home to touring Broadway shows such as \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" \"Wicked\" and \"The Book of Mormon\" — all on the marquee in the coming months. The university-owned venue also hosts cutting-edge dance troupes and concerts by the likes of Philip Glass, who performed his cycle of piano etudes there this year.\n\n39. Ballet Arizona\n\nThe arrival in 2000 of artistic director Ib Andersen, one of the last proteges of the great choreographer George Balanchine, put Ballet Arizona on the national map. In addition to classic story ballets such as \"Swan Lake\" and \"Giselle,\" Andersen has earned acclaim for his annual program of Balanchine's modernist dance.\n\n40. Phoenix Chorale\n\nFormerly known as the Phoenix Bach Choir, the chorus has blossomed into one of the finest in the country under maestro Charles Bruffy. It won a 2009 Grammy Award for best small-ensemble performance for \"Spotless Rose: Hymns to the Virgin Mary,\" and its \"Northern Lights: Choral Works by Ola Gjeilo\" was named best classical vocal album of 2012 by iTunes.\n\n41. Phoenix Art Museum\n\nIt has hosted blockbuster exhibits ranging from Monet and Frida Kahlo to \"The Art of Video Games,\" but the best thing about this museum is the diversity of its offerings. It boasts a fashion-design gallery, an excellent collection of Asian art and a curatorial partnership with the University of Arizona's Center for Creative Photography. It also has a movie theater for screenings such as the National Theatre Live series, beamed over from London.\n\n42. Heard Museum\n\nOne of the Valley's top tourist attractions, the Heard showcases Native American art and culture of the Southwest, from historical relics to contemporary art. It hosts popular events such as the Hoop Dancing Championship, Heard Museum Guild Indian Fair & Market, Katsina Doll Marketplace and Christmas Ornament Marketplace.\n\n43. Childsplay\n\nTempe's professional theater for young audiences has made its name developing new works that have been produced by other companies around the country. Its most recent triumph was the dynamically staged heartbreaker \"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,\" based on the novel by Kate DiCamillo. Because this company employs full-time actors, it draws its strength from its sense of ensemble — and company artists such as Jon Gentry, Debra K. Stevens and Katie McFadzen enjoy celebrity status among young theatergoers.\n\n44. 'Arizona Bold'\n\nArizona Opera's recently announced initiative aims to bring contemporary works that speak to Arizona's diverse audience. The series kicked off last year with the world's first mariachi opera, \"Cruzar la Cara de la Luna\" (\"To Cross the Face of the Moon\"), and continues in coming seasons with \"Arizona Lady,\" \"The Last Dream of Frida and Diego\" and the world premiere of \"Riders of the Purple Sage,\" adapted from the Zane Grey novel.\n\n45. Taliesin West\n\nArizona's most famous snowbird was the legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who began building Taliesin West, his winter home (and a colony for his acolytes), in 1937. Now a National Historic Landmark, it offers guided tours that show how the desert inspired the design of the estate. A Lego model of Taliesin West was unveiled this year in the pavilion room, built of nearly 200,000 toy bricks worth more than $100,000.\n\nHistorical icons\n\nHere are 10 Arizona historical icons we love.\n\n46. El Tovar\n\nEl Tovar hotel at Grand Canyon opened in 1905. Architect Charles Whittlesey wanted to create a dramatic structure reminiscent of a Swiss chalet, then considered very elegant. The hotel was regarded as one of the finest west of the Mississippi. El Tovar has been updated since then, but the expansive porches are the same, and the log walls in the lobby and dining room feel timeless.\n\n47. Canyon de Chelly National Monument\n\nIn the 1800s, Navajos sought refuge from U.S. soldiers in the distant reaches of Canyon de Chelly in northeast Arizona. Pueblo structures still stand under red cliffs, while modern-day Navajos farm the bottomlands. Visitors can drive along the canyon rim and stop at overlooks or take a short hike to White House Ruin. Tours into the canyon, led by Navajo guides, give a better understanding of its past and present.\n\n48. Jerome\n\nThis town was built on the side of Cleopatra Hill during the copper boom in territorial days. Today, it is a funky, friendly place to explore. Don't miss Jerome State Historic Park — the mansion doesn't just tell the story of mining magnate James Stuart Douglas. It also describes the boomtown his mine created, how everything evaporated so quickly and how the city found new life.\n\n49. Tovrea Castle\n\nItalian immigrant Alessio Carraro built the Phoenix \"wedding cake\" castle from 1928 to 1930 with hopes of turning it into a hotel and housing subdivision. His dreams were short-lived; a feedlot expanded next door. Cattleman E.A. Tovrea purchased the castle in 1932 and moved in with his wife, Della. He died within a year but his widow lived there until 1969. The city bought it in 1993 and recently opened it for tours.\n\n50. Orpheum Theatre\n\nThe nearly 1,400-seat theater in downtown Phoenix started as part of the national Orpheum Circuit chain, which presented vaudeville acts. The theater, designed with Spanish medieval and Baroque touches, opened in 1929. Through the Great Depression and World War II, residents stayed up to date via newsreels shown at the theater. Later, it operated as a movie theater and then a venue for plays and musicals. The building fell into disrepair and demolition was considered until the city bought it in 1984. It underwent a 12-year, $14 million renovation and now hosts a variety of arts productions.\n\n51. Hubbell Trading Post\n\nPart museum, part art gallery and part grocery store, Hubbell Trading Post on the Navajo Reservation is a portal through time. High counters and shelves are stocked with everything from blankets and baskets to clothing and kitchen utensils. Wood floors creak delightfully with every step. The 160-acre national historic site also includes barns, corrals, farm machinery, wagons and animals, including Churro sheep and their prized wool.\n\n52. Whiskey Row\n\nThe heart of Prescott is bustling Courthouse Square, where the Old West's architecture and spirit are still intact. Whiskey Row makes up the square's western edge. Most of the buildings were constructed between 1900 and 1905, after a massive fire leveled the original block. Locals and visitors takes advantage of pub crawls, festivals and art walks nearly every weekend of the year.\n\n53. Bisbee\n\nThis southeast Arizona community, once a booming copper-mining town, has reinvented itself as a quirky arts community. Most of the lodging offerings are in cool historical buildings downtown or renovated homes and cottages on side streets.\n\n54. Pueblo Grande\n\nThis museum and archaeological site in Phoenix is home to a 1,500-year old Hohokam village. Walk the outdoor trail and explore the structures, and then learn about the Hohokam people in the main gallery. The museum features a gallery and museum store, and provides educational programs.\n\n55. Heritage Square\n\nThe square in downtown Phoenix dates to the late 1800s, shining a light on the city's Victorian past. The Rosson House Museum gives a glimpse of family life in those days. Also in the square are the famous Pizzeria Bianco, high-end Japanese restaurant Nobuo at Teeter House and the Rose & Crown Pub. Concerts, festivals and weddings regularly take place in the square.\n\nGetting out\n\nHere are some reasons to love getting out in Arizona.\n\n56. Phoenix Zoo\n\nVoted a top zoo for kids, the Phoenix Zoo features 125 acres of family-friendly entertainment. Visitors enjoy a variety of interactive experiences, from the Giraffe Encounter to Stingray Bay to the Monkey Village. The Safari Train circles the park as guides offer tips. The zoo also hosts such popular special events such as the ZooLights holiday display.\n\n57. Desert Botanical Garden\n\nLearn about Sonoran Desert plants, trees and flowers as you stroll pathways through cactuses and succulents. There's always something going on, such as the Music in the Garden series, art exhibits, plant sales, workshops and special events such as the holiday luminaria display. Gertrude's restaurant is popular.\n\n58. Pat's Run\n\nThis fundraiser started in a way that almost surely would have met with its namesake's approval — three friends kicking around ideas over beers. Pat Tillman's friends wanted to raise money for the foundation created after Tillman, the former Arizona State University and Arizona Cardinals defensive standout, was killed while serving with the Army Rangers in Afghanistan. Pat's Run now is the largest timed running event in the Southwest U.S. Nearly 30,000 people run and walk 4.2 miles each April to celebrate his spirit and remember his sacrifice.\n\n59. Deer Valley Rock Art Center\n\nMore than 1,500 petroglyphs are scattered around the center in north east Glendale, offering a multifaceted view of the past. The drawings, most made with stone tools thousands of years ago, are open to interpretation. The rock art symbols are found as you walk along the quarter-mile path, which has signs pointing out some of the symbols among the outcroppings of dark andesite.Rock art is a collective name for the types of images created on stone: petroglyphs and pictographs. Petroglyphs are pecked, engraved or polished designs on rock; pictographs are painted or drawn designs on rock.\n\n60. Downtown Phoenix arts scene\n\nThe First Friday art walk has been giving life to galleries and opportunity to artists since 1994. Phoenix's artsy neighborhoods are spread about in typical Valley fashion, with popular areas including the Phoenix Art Museum and Heard Museum; the Roosevelt Row Arts District; and the Lower Grand Avenue Arts and Small Business District. You also will find a vibrant Latino-art scene and skillful graffiti.\n\n61. Sahuaro Ranch\n\nDid you know date-palm trees can live for more than 100 years? They do, and you can see many fine specimens at the Sahuaro Ranch Park Historic Area in Glendale, which also features historical buildings, barnyard and fruit orchards. Tour the historic Main House Museum, built from 1891 to 1898, and learn about the history of the pioneers who lived there.\n\n62. Mystery Castle\n\nThe home at the base of South Mountain was built by Boyce Gulley in the 1930s. He moved from Seattle to Phoenix with a fond memory: building sand castles with his daughter, Mary Lou. He set out to build her a \"permanent sand castle\" using cheap and found materials, including salvaged rail tracks, telephone poles, adobe, automobile parts and stone. Gulley died in 1945; Mary Lou died in 2010. Tours are offered October through May.\n\n63. Scottsdale nightlife\n\nDowntown Scottsdale draws locals and tourists with its Western boutiques, great dining and walkable area. And when the sun goes down, it turns into a partier's paradise. You can drop into a Vegas-style pool club where a top international DJ is performing, walk a couple of doors down to a modern country bar owned by Dierks Bentley, hear a band at an old cowboy saloon, then play arcade games while drinking craft beer.\n\n64. Car auctions\n\nNumerous auctions draw big wheels to the Valley every January. The largest and best known is the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction, which brings in a diverse crowd ranging from international buyers to families looking for a fun day out. Other major auctions include Russo and Steele, Gooding & Co., Bonhams and RM.\n\n65. Waste Management Phoenix Open\n\nThis is the largest tournament on the PGA Tour and known for its rowdy atmosphere. Thousands of fans descend on TPC Scottsdale to sip beer in the sun, show off goofy golf attire and cheer or heckle at the infamous 16th hole. At night, visitors make their way to the Coors Light Birds Nest to party as top bands perform.\n\nHiking\n\nNeed more reasons to love this state? Check out these 10 hikes\n\n66. Camelback Mountain\n\nThe wildly popular Echo Canyon Trail is loved by locals and tourists alike. Any day of the week you can see fitness-minded hikers powering their way around those making their way up for a panoramic view of the Valley. It's a tough hike, with about 1,200 feet of elevation gain over 1.3 miles.\n\n67. Piestewa Peak\n\nThere are several trails in the Phoenix Mountains Park and Recreation Area. The most popular — and most difficult — is the Summit Trail up Piestewa Peak. It's about 1.2 miles to the top and an elevation gain of nearly 1,200 feet.\n\n68. Shoshone Point, Grand Canyon\n\nOn most days, this easy walk through the woods might be the most peaceful place on the South Rim. The flat hike is about a mile along an old Jeep road to a gobsmacking overlook. The small parking area is unmarked, so a lot of people don't realize the trail is there. The point can be reserved for weddings and other events, so if a group has reserved the site you might encounter a crowd.\n\n69. Humphreys Peak\n\nArizona's highest mountain — it tops out at 12,633 feet — offers a lung-searing, heart-pounding hike with amazing views. The trail to the summit winds up the aspen-covered mountain. The last mile, above tree line, is especially challenging as it grows windy, steeper and rockier.\n\n70. Thunder River-Deer Creek Loop, Grand Canyon\n\nThis 28-mile North Rim trek has it all. First, a leisurely walk through the woods and then a skid down a steep gravel slope. Then — ahh — the flat, otherwordly rockscape of the Esplanade. Then — ugh — the Redwall descent. Then Surprise Valley, another reasonably flat and pleasing stretch. Then more downhill until you reach Thunder River, where the water roars out of the Canyon wall and creates a lush microclimate. Soak your feet, because there's still another mile of grinding downhill to the Upper Tapeats campsite. From here to the Colorado River you'll cross Tapeats Creek several times, scramble across a stretch of trail with a sheer drop-off, then pick your way down a rock fall. Good times. The next day it's a few easy miles to Deer Creek Narrows, a fantastic slot canyon. You hike along a ledge near the top of the slot, so watch your step. And get a good rest. Because it's all uphill from here.\n\n71. Aravaipa Canyon\n\nThis peaceful getaway southeast of Globe shows how fertile the desert can be when you add water. A creek waters a canopy of trees, creating a cool, shady ecosystem. Trails vanish into thickets, pushing hikers into the creek. To keep the canyon special, the Bureau of Land Management limits visitation and requires a permit.\n\n72. Superstition Mountains\n\nGrisly murders, strange disappearances and legends of lost mines have given the Superstition Mountains an ominous reputation. But the 160,000-acre wilderness holds some of the best hiking in Arizona, with everything from jagged cliffs and deeply shadowed canyons to rolling, pine-covered hills and seasonal creeks. And its 200 miles of interconnecting trails make it easy to plan a hike for every skill and adventure level.\n\n73. Cathedral Rock\n\nAs you approach Sedona from the south, this dramatic cream- and salmon-colored formation stands as a sort of gateway to the backcountry marvels beyond. See for yourself by hiking the Cathedral Rock Trail up to the base of the cliffs and pillars at the center of the formation. Although it's only about three-quarters of a mile long, the trail gains more than 700 feet of elevation.\n\n74. Wind Cave Trail\n\nThis trail begins in Usery Mountain Regional Park and enters Tonto National Forest. The wide, sandy trail zigzags through lush desert, steadily gaining elevation. As it steepens, it leads along the base of lichen-stained cliffs to the cave. A handful of plants cling to the ceiling, where water seeps through the rock.\n\n75. Arizona Trail\n\nThe Arizona National Scenic Trail is like an 800-mile sampler of everything Arizona has to offer. The trail's 43 \"passages\" range in length from 8.3 miles to 36 miles and link the Mexican border south of Parker Lake in the Huachuca Mountains to the Utah state line beyond the Grand Canyon. They traverse mountain ranges, grasslands, desert, forests, wilderness areas and canyons.\n\nWeather\n\nFrom summer storms to fair winters, here are 10 reasons to love Arizona weather.\n\n76. Beauty in the skies\n\nWhile summer storms can be dangerous (and should be viewed from indoors), there is beauty there, too. Monsoon clouds appear heavenly and white as they build over the eastern mountains, then transform to dark and menacing with angry flashes of lightning that paints electrifying pictures across the summer sky. And then, when the night sky clears, you don't have to travel far from the Valley for breathtaking views of the heavens.\n\n77. Dining al fresco in winter\n\nDuring the heat of summer, most Valley residents want to spend as much time in air-conditioned spaces as possible. But during the rest of the year, conditions are great for dining outdoors. Metro Phoenix has a great variety of eating establishments small and large that feature outdoor dining, some with incredible city, mountain and desert vistas.\n\n78. Experiencing all 4 seasons\n\nArizona residents can experience all four seasons, sometimes in just a few hours. Traveling from the desert floor to Arizona's \"sky islands\" can take you from searing heat to snowy peak in the time it takes to drive to Flagstaff, which is the place to be for vibrant fall colors as well as snowball fights in the winter. In spring, the wildflowers near Picacho Peak can't be beat, but if it's summer you want, well, welcome to Arizona, because we've got plenty of that.\n\n79. Fall and winter festivals\n\nDuring the fall, winter and early spring, Arizonans like to get outdoors to participate in fairs, festivals and other special events. Nearly every weekend during the cooler months features some sort of outdoor event, whether its food, or music or even medieval jousting at the Renaissance Faire.\n\n80. Creosote bush\n\nRepublic columnist Clay Thompson was once asked about the \"pleasantly sweet smell\" that comes from the desert after a rain. His guess was the Creosote bush. Its stems and leaves are covered with a waxy substance that includes naphthalene, which protects the plant from ultraviolet rays and helps it hold in water. \"Moisture activates the waxy coating and produces that wonderful smell,\" he explained.\n\n81. 90 degrees\n\nHave you ever noticed how 90 degrees in the summer doesn't feel the same as 90 degrees in spring? After suffering through temperatures of 105-plus during July and August, it's almost blissful when the day comes that it only gets as high as 90. But head from winter into spring with temperatures suddenly spiking to 90 degrees and, it's starting to feel pretty warm.\n\n82. It really is a dry heat\n\nThen again, so is a sauna. Still, it's nice to be able to hang your laundry on the line and have it dry in 20 minutes.\n\n83. Skiing\n\nWater. Downhill. Cross-country. You can do all three kinds of skiiing in Arizona, sometimes on the same day if you're willing to do a little driving. Arizona Snowbowl and Sunrise Park Resort are popular ski destinations, along with Mount Lemmon Ski Valley near Tucson. You can cross-country ski along the Mogollon Rim near Payson, and the major lakes on the Salt and Verde rivers offer water skiing year-round.\n\n84. Swimming season never ends\n\nDespite the way it may look when you fly into Sky Harbor International Airport, everyone in Arizona does not have a swimming pool. But they probably know someone who does. If not, they can take advantage of the dozens of resort pools that are open year-round or splash in one of the Valley's famous water parks. Back in the old days, kids used to swim in the canals that provide water to the Valley, but these days that's frowned upon. Still, if you can't find a cool place for a dip on a summer day, you're not trying very hard.\n\n85. Backdrop for big events\n\nPleasant fall and winter temperatures draw people to Arizona from across the world. That climate is also an important lure for big-time sporting events such as the Super Bowl or the Phoenix Open professional golf tournament and spring-training baseball.\n\nEating and drinking\n\nThe Arizona Republic has been helping Arizonans for the past 125 know where and what to eat and drink.\n\nHere are 10 reasons worth toasting:\n\n86. Mexican food\n\nThere's no need to travel south of the border for authentic Mexican food. We serve it right here. For decades, Arizona restaurants have been dishing up Mexico's signature dishes. From guacamole, tacos, New Mexican-style adovada pork to Veracruz snapper, we've adopted the food from Mexico as our own. Try one of these Valley favorites:\n\n•Carolina's: 1202 E.

McDowell Road, Phoenix. 602-340-0892.\n\n87. Boutique farmers\n\nA small farmer in Arizona braves months of scorching heat, random gushes of damaging rain and soil as hard as cement. Yet a devoted band of farmers is turning swatches of desert into bountiful gardens, proving that, yes, locally grown fruits and vegetables are better. Our farmers sell their harvest to chefs and at nearly 30 farmers markets Valley-wide. Here are three operations hard at work:\n\n•McClendon's Select, 15888 N. 77th Ave., Peoria. 623-979-5279, mcclendonsselect.com.\n\n•Maya's Farm, 6106 S. 32nd St., Phoenix. 480-236-7097, mayasfarm.com.\n\n•Singh Farms, 8900 E.

Today, we're loaded with talented chefs. As proof, check out the eight Arizona chefs who have won the James Beard best chef-Southwest award, the culinary version of an Academy Award.\n\nThe chefs are: Chris Bianco, Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, 2003; Nobuo Fukuda, Nobuo at Teeter House in Phoenix, 2007; Christopher Gross, Christopher's of Christopher's Restaurant & Crush Lounge in Phoenix, 1995; Vincent Guerithault, Vincent on Camelback in Phoenix, 1993; RoxSand Scocos McCreary, formerly of RoxSand Restaurant in Phoenix, 1999; Robert McGrath, formerly of Roaring Fork in Scottsdale, 2001; Bradford Thompson, formerly of Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician in Phoenix, 2006; Janos Wilder, Janos, Tucson, 2000.\n\n89. Craft beer\n\nMove over citrus, copper and cotton. There's a new industry in the state, and it's booming. Arizona has more than 60 licensed craft breweries, ringing up an estimated $650 million in sales a year, according to the Arizona Craft Brewers Guild.

Wine\n\nArizona's wine industry was small and sleepy — until 2001. Since then, winemaking has soared. Production has increased nearly 700 percent in the past 14 years, well above the national average. At the same time, the state's reputation for quality wines has skyrocketed.\n\nThere are 75 licensed wineries in Arizona, many offering tasting rooms at the vineyards. Check out arizonawine.org for locations. Here are three top winemakers:\n\n•Arizona Stronghold Vineyards: 1023 N. Main St., Cottonwood. 928-639-2789.\n\n•Page Springs Cellars: 1500 N. Page Springs Road, Cornville. 928-639-3004.\n\n•Callaghan Vineyards: 336 Elgin Road, Elgin. 520-455-5322.\n\n91. Native American cuisine\n\nThe state's first cooks were Native Americans. Thankfully, a handful of restaurants are working hard to keep the cuisine of Native American forebears alive:\n\n•White Mountain Apache Tribe's Sunrise Park Resort: Chef Nephi Craig and his all-Native American kitchen staff host dinners to showcase the cuisine of their ancestors. Reservations for the indigenous-food chef-table dinner: 928-735-7669, ext. 2288.\n\n•Fry Bread House: Credit Army rations for Navajo fry bread. These flour-and-grease creations were created by enterprising Native American women in the 19th century with the rations the Army handed out to those relegated to reservations. To make money, women of various tribes sold tourists fried bread, made with flour and lard from the rations. Located at 1003 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. 602-351-2345.\n\n•Kai: The menu at this award-winning, fine-dining restaurant on the Gila River Reservation showcases tribal and regional bounty. Located at 5594 W. Wild Horse Pass Blvd. (Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort & Spa), Gila River Reservation. 602-225-0100, sheratonwildhorsepass.com.\n\n92. Sam Fox\n\nWhen it comes to opening new restaurants, Sam Fox has the Midas touch. Today, he oversees 44 restaurants in Arizona and seven other states. His restaurants are divided among 15 concepts, each with its own menu, identify and brand.\n\nFox, named last year in Nation's Restaurant News as one of the 50 most influential people in the restaurant industry, is Arizona's most prolific restaurateur. His burgers, wood-fired pizza and organic rice bowls at Fox Restaurant Concepts have given us more dining choices than ever before. Check out foxrc.com for restaurants and locations.\n\n93. Ethnic markets\n\nFrom Middle Eastern to African, from Asian to Latin American, an impressive collection of specialty markets makes it easy to sample food from another country without leaving the state.\n\nLoad up on nopales, bitter melon, Ukraine beer, halal goat, pink lentils, ghee and pickled green tomatoes at markets that reflect our diversity. Start with these three:\n\n•Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket, 7575 W. Cactus Road, Peoria, 623-773-3345; 2025 N.

Food trucks\n\nEating tasty food on the street has never been easier. Nearly 60 food trucks are selling such fashionable dishes as duck-confit tacos, foie-gras sandwiches, Cajun burritos, Asian tacos and creme brulee.\n\nFood trucks are always on the move, so where can you find them?

Food makers\n\nIn the past five years, Arizona has embraced the artisan-food revolution, a culinary push-back against industrial bland and boring.\n\nLocal food makers are selling grass-fed beef, hand-crafted caramels and honey from desert hives. Their goods are available at specialty stores, AJ's Fine Foods, a local grocery chain that stocks the largest inventory of Arizona-made foods, and at farmers markets. Here are a few favorites:\n\n•Goldwater's salsa: For the past two decades, the family of the late Sen.

Learn where to buy at noblebread.com.\n\nSports\n\nHere are 10 things to love about Arizona sports.\n\n96. Cactus League baseball\n\nOn March 30, 1909, the Chicago White Stockings became the first major-league team to play a barnstorming game in Arizona. The concept of spring training here didn't really take off for another 40 or so years, but from those first roots blossomed an experience that includes half of Major League Baseball and sets annual attendance records across the Valley.\n\n97. The big four play here\n\nThe Phoenix area is home to all four men's major pro sports leagues, making us one of only a dozen markets in the country that can make that boast.\n\n98. You're covered\n\nThere is no such thing as a rainout or bad weather when it comes to our pro sports franchises. Domed stadiums, a necessity given Arizona's challenging summers, not only guarantee fan comfort but also that the games will go on. Added bonus: Fans don't have to get bundled up and trudge through snow to watch hockey here!\n\n99. Golf mecca\n\nClimate is one of the Five C's of Arizona that built our economy and why we are a year-round golfing destination. Try this formula as an example: 50 or so golf courses in Scottsdale and another 150 in the surrounding area, times 330 days of sunshine, equals an estimated 8.28 million rounds of golf per year on those tracks, per City of Scottsdale data.\n\n100. The great outdoors\n\nMuch of the Arizona sports experience doesn't take place in a stadium or arena, but happens all year long under our sunny skies. If you are a water enthusiast, pilot your boat on one of more than three dozen lakes and reservoirs, plus the Colorado River, or float in an inner tube down the Salt River. Hunters can go for game big or small in the deserts, mountains and forests; fishing opportunities are too numerous to mention here. And hiking and camping experiences offer plenty of diverse terrain, vistas and wildlife encounters.\n\n101. Mega events call Arizona home\n\nSuper Bowls. National championship football. All-star games. And now the Final Four around the corner. The Phoenix area, simply, is where America comes to put on its biggest sports events.\n\n102. Pickleball\n\nParticipants use paddles to hit a ball over a low net on a badminton-sized court. Pickleball is touted as one of the fasted growing sports in the country. The USA Pickleball Association, organized to promote the growth and development of the sport, has its home in Surprise. Although the sport has captured the hearts of those living in retirement communities and RV Parks, a younger crowd is getting in on the action.\n\n103. We're World Series champions\n\nArizona Diamondbacks win the 2001 World Series: The seven-game series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the New York Yankees included two extra-inning games and three late-inning comebacks. It ended on a Game 7, bases-loaded walk-off single from Luis Gonzalez. Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling were co-MVPs.\n\n104. Weather, or not\n\nIf you have a hankering to play outside, you don't have to let a little thing like Mother Nature interfere. Valley residents enjoying 80-degree winter days can drive two hours to find snow skiing; Flagstaff-area folks can shake off the cold by driving two hours the other way to find a sunny golf course waiting.\n\n105. Go bowling\n\nSince 1971, there has been at least one college football bowl game in Arizona every season, with a second game added in 1989 and a third on Tucson's wish list. If that happens, the state will host four bowls this winter, capped by the second College Football Playoff title game in Glendale on Jan. 11.\n\nPeople and innovations\n\nMade in Arizona. From a young state isolated from the outside by mountain, canyon and desert have grown remarkable ideas, people and innovations.\n\nHere are 10 people and innovations to love that have come from Arizona.\n\n106. Carl Hayden\n\nHayden represented Arizona for 57 years in Congress, 42 of them as a senator. He was instrumental in passing landmark legislation, including a constitutional amendment assuring the right to vote for women and creation of Social Security.\n\n107. Pima cotton\n\nPima cotton, known for its elegance and durability, was developed on experimental farms near Sacaton. During World War I, the U.S. military liked Pima cotton because of its industrial strength: It was used in airplane wheels, uniforms and wing fabric, among other uses. Now Pima cotton is a go-to material for shirts, towels and sheets.\n\n108. John F. Long\n\nValley developer John F. Long created the affordable housing community, Maryvale, in the 1950s. Long donated land for schools, community centers and parks and had a profound effect on West Valley growth. He died Feb. 29, 2008 at age 87.\n\n109. Navajo Code Talkers\n\nDuring World War II, Japanese intelligence officers kept intercepting and deciphering coded messages, allowing enemy troops and sailors to anticipate attacks. The Pentagon turned to the Navajo Nation. Twenty-nine young men were recruited into the Marine Corps and developed a code using their native tongue, Diné. Its unusual syntax and rules of grammar baffled the Japanese, and America finally gained the advantage of surprise in combat.\n\n110. Active retirement communities\n\nThe new concept of a senior-living community and Arizona's reputation as a retirement haven were spurred by the opening of Sun City by the Del Webb Corp. in 1960. The new community was a hit from the start, as thousands thronged to tour model homes in a community with a host of recreational amenities that redefined the lifestyle of older Americans.\n\n111. Cesar Chavez\n\nBorn near Yuma, Chavez saw his family lose their farm when he was a young child. His parents became migrant workers, and he grew up to become co-founder of the United Farm Workers Union in 1962. Committed to non-violence, he organized boycotts and strikes of agricultural products to bring national attention to the cause of farmworkers' rights.\n\n112. Jet Skis\n\nNext time you're at the lake, take a moment to remember Clayton Jacobson II. In the 1960s, the man who spent many years living in Parker came up with the idea for a personal watercraft powered by internal pump jets. His invention would later be manufactured and trademarked as Sea-Doos and Jet Skis, with sit-down and stand-up models.\n\n113. Tree-ring dating\n\nShort of jumping in a time machine, in the 1800s there was no method to pinpoint dates in archaeology and paleontology — until an Arizona scientist got involved. Lowell Observatory astronomer A.E. Douglass began developing the system of dendrochronology — the science of using tree rings, the growth patterns formed in a cross-section of the trunk — in Flagstaff in the 1890s. Almost 50 years later, he founded the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. Tree-ring dating is still used today, and has become a key tool in studying climate change.\n\n114. America West Airlines\n\nThis startup low-fare airline founded after industry deregulation began flights in 1983 with three aircraft, but its expansion was derailed by a 1991 bankruptcy. It was the first airline to apply for and receive a federal loan after the Sept 11 terrorist attacks. America West purchased carrier US Airways out of bankruptcy in 2005. The renamed US Airways completed a long-sought merger with American Airlines and moved its headquarters to Fort Worth in 2013.\n\n115. Star-gazing discoveries\n\nArizona has been at the forefront of space discoveries and NASA missions. Clear skies and low humidity make the state an ideal site for stargazing, drawing scientists and researchers from around the world. Kitt Peak National Observatory, which is 56 miles southwest of Tucson, has contributed to numerous scientific discoveries, including galaxy rotation curves, galaxy evolution and environment, and research about star formation. According to its website, KPNO has the world's largest collection of optical telescopes.\n\nPoints of Pride\n\nArizona can boast of many attractions, moments of pride and sons and daughters of accomplishment. Next time you want to exercise bragging rights, think Grand Canyon. That big hole in the ground drew more than 4.7 million visitors in 2014. As for manmade attractions, there's the mammoth Hoover Dam or that bridge from London that was torn apart and reassembled in Lake Havasu City. We have plenty of folks to admire, including one who spent decades on the Supreme Court.\n\nHere are 10 points of pride in Arizona:\n\n116. Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum\n\nThe 98-acre Desert Museum, which was founded in 1952, is billed as a fusion experience: zoo, botanical garden, art gallery, natural history museum, and aquarium. It is considered a model for innovative presentation and interpretation of native plants and animals in ecological exhibits. Visit and you can go along two miles of walking paths that take you through various desert habitats. At the museum, you may spot 230 animal species and 1,200 types of plants.\n\n117. Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center\n\nCutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center: From 1922 to 1949, this cluster of white buildings at First and Culver streets was home of Congregation Beth Israel. It then become Phoenix's first Chinese-speaking Christian church and then was sold to a Hispanic church. Today it is owned by the Arizona Jewish Historical Society, which operates it as a museum, gallery and cultural center.\n\n118. Miss Arizona becomes Miss America\n\nIt happened not once but twice. It was a banner front page headline on Sept. 11, 1949. A photo showed the winner, Jacque Mercer, with a parasol, her hoop dress puffed around her. Arizona won the 1965 Miss America title with Vonda Kay Van Dyke.\n\n119. Canal system\n\nDesert dwellers need water to survive, and the Valley might never have been created without the dedication of the Hohokam Indians. Salt River Project officials say the Hohokams set the groundwork for today's extensive canal system, which follows many of the same routes.\n\n120. London Bridge\n\nIn 1968, Lake Havasu City founder Robert P. McCulloch paid $2.4 million to buy the 137-year-old London Bridge, which was sinking and had to be replaced. The bridge was dismantled and shipped via the Panama Canal to California, then trucked to Lake Havasu City and reassembled.\n\n121. Arizona Highways magazine\n\nThe magazine was started in April 1925 to attract tourists. Over the years, the beauty and stories of Arizona have drawn tourists to discover in person what they found among the pages. It has more than 1 million readers today.\n\n122. Women's suffrage\n\nEight years before the nation, Arizona men voted to allow Arizona women the right to vote. The initiative won by a healthy margin and was decided in fall 1912, during the state's first election after obtaining statehood.\n\n123. Old Tucson\n\nIf you have a hankering to visit the old West, Old Tucson should be on your bucket list. Even if you've never been there in person, you may well have seen it in movie or television show. In 2014, the attraction celebrated its 75th anniversary of the building of the original Old Tucson sets in 1939 by Columbia Pictures for the movie, \"Arizona.\" Over the years, millions of people have come to wander into the general merchantile store and other businesses in town, catch a gunfight on the dusty streets and or watch a can-can or two in the saloon.\n\n124. Buffalo Soldiers\n\nIn 1913, a fort in the Huachuca Mountains of southeastern Arizona became home to the Army's 10th Cavalry, one of two African-American cavalry units Native Americans referred to as Buffalo Soldiers. The units were formed in 1866, while the Army was segregated, to help control the frontier.\n\n125. Mission San Xavier del Bac\n\nIf you are headed to Tucson, why not include in your visit, this mission. It's just 9 miles south of downtown Tucson. Another plus: no admission charge but many people will leave a donation after seeing what some say is the finest example of Spanish Colonial architecture in the United States. The mission, which is designated a National Historic Landmark, was founded as a Catholic mission by Father Eusebio Kino in 1692. Construction of the current church began in 1783 and was completed in 1797. Its interior is filled with original statuary and mural paintings. Today, it continues to minister to the religious needs of its parishioners.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/23/governors-vaccinated-christmas-precautions-medical-worker-shortage-news-around-states/115208798/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Gov. Kay Ivey became one of the first governors on Monday to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, bidding to build public confidence in the vaccinations that will have to be widely administered to ease the pandemic. “We want to send a clear message to all Alabamians that we can have confidence in this vaccine and its effectiveness. I want to assure people it is a safe thing to do and if everybody will take the vaccine voluntarily we’ll have good strong immunity and it will stop COVID-19,” Ivey said at a news conference. She spoke after getting the first of the two-shot Pfizer vaccine at Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery. State Health Officer Scott Harris and State Chief Medical Officer Mary McIntyre also received the vaccine. The 76-year-old Republican governor, a lung cancer survivor, said she had no hesitation about taking the vaccine and urged others to take it as it becomes available. “Shoot, a sore arm for a few days is a lot better than three months on a ventilator,” Ivey said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A mask mandate in Juneau has been extended for at least six months. The ordinance passed by the City and Borough of Juneau Assembly upholds the requirement for masks to be worn in all indoor public settings and outdoors when within 6 feet of other people. Alaska is one of 12 states without a statewide mask mandate. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has said that although he acknowledged the efficacy of masks, which has been corroborated by studies from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization, the issue is best delegated to local governments. But many local officials in the state have said they do not have the power to implement mask mandates or that they would let businesses decide for themselves. In Juneau, where a mask mandate was imposed when the state was experiencing roughly 10% of the cases it has reported in December, some business owners said they have embraced the policy change.\n\nArizona\n\nWindow Rock: The Navajo Nation reported 158 new coronavirus cases on Monday and two more deaths from COVID-19. The latest figures from the Navajo Department of Health bring the total number of cases on the reservation that extends into Arizona, New Mexico and Utah to 21,177. The Navajo Nation has reported 748 deaths since the pandemic hit. Tribal officials are urging residents of the vast reservation to stay vigilant to help stop the spread of the coronavirus amid the holiday season when families usually gather to celebrate. “We saw a spike in new COVID-19 cases following Thanksgiving, so we want to avoid that happening again,” said Navajo President Jonathan Nez. He encouraged everyone to spend Christmas with only the people in their household. A stay-at-home order is in effect until Dec. 28, along with a weekend lockdown where business hours are limited. The tribe also requires masks to be worn in public.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas received more doses Monday of coronavirus vaccines as the number of virus-related deaths continued to mount in the state, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said.The state reported 58 deaths from COVID-19 on Monday, though about one-third of those were delayed reports, Hutchinson said. The state saw 1,457 new cases of the virus, and more than 1,000 people remained hospitalized. Also Monday, Arkansas began receiving shipments of the newly approved coronavirus vaccine from Moderna, with 5,900 doses and additional shipments planned for Tuesday and Wednesday, Hutchinson said. The state also received 18,575 doses of Pfizer’s vaccine. “While this news provides hope for many, it is a continued concern to see the loss of 58 additional Arkansans … We must steel our resolve to take every precaution to keep everyone safe,” Hutchinson said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Much of California has exhausted its usual ability to staff intensive care beds, and the nation’s most populated state is desperately searching for 3,000 temporary medical workers to meet demand during a recent surge of coronavirus cases. State officials are reaching out to foreign partners in places like Australia and Taiwan amid a shortage of temporary medical workers in the U.S., particularly nurses trained in critical care. California hospitals typically turn to staffing agencies during flu season, when they rely on travel nurses to meet patient care needs. It is the only state in the nation with strict nurse-to-patient ratios requiring hospitals to provide one nurse for every two patients in intensive care and one nurse for every four patients in emergency rooms, for example. However, those ratio requirements are being waived at many hospitals as virus cases surge. But the pool of available travel nurses is drying up as demand for them jumped to 44% over the last month, with California, Texas, Florida, New York and Minnesota requesting the most extra staff, according to San Diego-based health care staffing firm Aya Healthcare. It is one of two companies contracted by California to fulfill hospitals’ staffing requests.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Lawmakers will pause their upcoming new legislative session soon after convening in January as they wait for COVID-19 cases to subside, Democratic leaders said Monday. Lawmakers will begin the new session Jan. 13 and address any urgent business and required actions, like swearing in new members, as quickly as possible before temporarily going into recess, Senate President Leroy Garcia, incoming House Speaker Alec Garnett and others leaders said in a joint announcement. The tentative plan is to reconvene Feb. 16 when leaders hope the peak of the coronavirus pandemic will have subsided and there will be less of a health risk for those at the state Capitol. However, they said that lawmakers would resume work earlier that if there is an emergency that requires immediate attention. Earlier this month, lawmakers wrapped up a short special session to approve assistance to restaurants and food pantries struggling to keep their doors open during the pandemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The second approved vaccine to fight COVID-19 began arriving in Connecticut on Monday as a state advisory panel met to discuss who gets vaccinated next. Workers at Hartford Hospital began unloading 8,800 doses of the Moderna vaccine shortly after 10:30 a.m. to the applause of health care workers. Critical care nurse Mandy Delgado was the first at the hospital to get a Moderna shot, saying she was hopeful vaccinations will lead to fewer patients being admitted with the virus. “Working in critical care, I’ve been exhausted, overwhelmed, seeing patients come in needing more oxygen and able to talk and progressively getting worse, then actually dying, and families not being there,” she said. Gov. Ned Lamont said the state expects to receive 63,300 doses of the Moderna vaccine this week, as well as 24,375 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. That is in addition to the 31,200 doses of the Pfizer vaccine the state received last week, Lamont said. The doses arriving this week are targeted for front-line health care workers and those in nursing homes.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Those who plan to attend Mass on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day in one of the 74 Catholic parishes or mission churches in Delaware or Maryland’s Eastern Shore are urged to check their parish’s website or bulletin before heading out, as some are requiring advanced reservations in order to comply with state mandated attendance limitations because of the recent uptick in area COVID-19 cases. “We want to avoid having to turn people away at the door,” said the Most Reverend W. Francis Malooly, bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington. “Parishes are following government guidelines to make sure everyone stays safe and healthy during Christmas and beyond. Limiting attendance, social distancing, wearing masks and other requirements will be in place to assure that we will all be around when our Christmas Masses are once again standing room only.” The dispensation from the obligation to attend Sunday and Holy Day Masses that Malooly instituted in March remains in place in the Diocese of Wilmington. Many parishes are livestreaming or posting prerecorded Masses on their YouTube, Facebook or web pages. Catholics are encouraged to check their parish website or bulletin to find out if and when their Christmas Mass will be available online. Christmas Eve Mass with Malooly will be livestreamed from the Cathedral of Saint Peter in Wilmington at 2 p.m. Wednesday. Viewers can watch it live or recorded at youtube.com/dioceseofwilm.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Dr. Ankoor Shah, interim principal deputy director of DC Health, said the District is expecting to get 12,600 doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4,700 more doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week, WUSA-TV reported. D.C. will also be getting more than 16,000 additional doses of vaccine through an agreement with Maryland and Virginia to help vaccinate DC health care workers who live in those states. Shah said the District was allocated vaccine doses from the federal government based on its population, not on the size of its health care workforce, which has put it below where it needs to be. “We are getting less than what we deserve, and that is a simple fact,” Shah said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:A former Florida Department of Health employee sued the state on Monday over a search warrant executed on her house after investigators said they identified a message sent from a computer at the address to health department employees. Rebekah Jones, who was fired in May for insubordination after repeatedly violating department policy about communicating with the media, helped create the state’s coronavirus dashboard. She contended that she was fired for not falsifying data. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement served the search warrant earlier this month. Jones posted a 31-second video of officers entering her home, and the department later released more than 20 minutes of bodycam video that showed she refused to respond to phone calls and knocks on her door. The message that led to the search warrant implored employees still at the Health Department “to speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don’t have to be a part of this. Be a hero.” Jones has had several run-ins with law enforcement over personal issues, but has gained international attention by disputing Florida’s COVID-19 statistics. She was paid almost $48,000 a year as a Department of Health employee, but since May has raised nearly $260,000 on a GoFundMe account after criticizing Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. No charges have been filed in the investigation.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta:Georgia K-12 public schools have the option not to count year-end tests toward students’ final grades this year because of schooling hardships from the COVID-19 pandemic following a vote Monday by the state Board of Education. State law requires scores on the annual Georgia Milestones tests to account for 20% of the cumulative grades for most of the state’s public-school students, from the third grade up to their senior year of high school. But this year, the Milestones scores can be counted essentially zero after State School Superintendent Richard Woods won approval for his proposal to water down the tests so students and teachers can have some relief as they continue working through tremendous challenges due to the virus. School districts now have leeway to recalculate final course grades for the fall semester and count the tests as 0.01% if they want, a state Department of Education spokesperson confirmed. The same 0.01% weight can also apply for year-end tests in the upcoming spring semester.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii’s rural island of Kauai had only 61 known coronavirus cases from March through September. But after Oct. 15, when the state launched a pretravel testing program to reignite its decimated tourism economy, Kauai had at least 84 new cases in the ensuing seven weeks. The surge seeded community transmission and led to the island’s first – and so far only – COVID-19 death: Ron Clark, who worked for decades as a tour driver. Despite Hawaii’s cautious effort at reopening that allowed travelers who tested negative for COVID-19 before they flew to the state to sidestep quarantine rules, the Kauai spike illustrates the difficulty of preserving public health – even on an isolated island – when economic recovery relies on travel. Kauai officials have decided the cost of vacationing in paradise, for now, is too high. Clark got COVID-19 in November and died about 10 days later. The day after Clark’s death, Kauai officials said they would opt out of the state’s testing program and require visitors to again quarantine for two weeks whether they test negative for COVID-19 before arriving. Kauai officials say the single-test scheme did not do enough to protect the people who live there. With only nine ICU beds and 14 ventilators, the island’s health care system could quickly become overwhelmed by a large outbreak, said Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami. After the Kauai surge, the state Department of Health traced most of the island’s October and November cases to returning residents and tourists who brought the virus in despite the pre-flight testing program.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Life could be back to normal in about four months with coronavirus vaccinations now being administered, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican late last week said health care workers and long-term care facility residents should have their vaccinations by the end of January. He said the next wave of vaccinations to essential workers such as firefighters and police could be done by June. But he said it will be longer than that before everyone who wants a vaccination can get one. “With the vaccines coming, we are maybe 120 days away from, for the most part, life back to normal,” Little said, the Post Register reported. “And it will be longer than that before everyone gets vaccinated.” About 3,500 people have been vaccinated since the initial shots started last week. Little said he expects vaccinations to pick up in the coming weeks as federal authorities have now approved two different vaccinations. “It’s going to be my responsibility to help make the point, and have our public health officials make the case to people to choose to get that vaccine,” Little said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An Illinois woman who ordered flags for her grandmother’s garden got a surprise when the package arrived – someone’s apparent coronavirus test specimen. Andrea Ellis was wrapping Christmas gifts at her aunt’s house in East Moline, in northwestern Illinois, when she opened a padded envelope containing the flags she ordered weeks ago from the department store chain Kohl’s, according to The Quad City Times. “I pulled out the flags and I told my aunt, ‘Look how cute these are,’ ” she said. “I pulled out the packing slip and then noticed something deeper inside the envelope and pulled that out. It was a biohazard bag containing someone’s COVID-19 test specimen.” Ellis, who didn’t immediately reply to a phone message from the Associated Press, called the police, who referred the issue to the county health department, according to East Moline police Chief Jeff Ramsey. Janet Hill, the chief operating officer at the Rock Island County Health Department, told the AP that she picked up the biohazard bag over the weekend and that it appeared to contain a used nasal swab and identifying information of a person from Virginia. She said she was figuring out what to do next, including contacting health officials in Virginia and trying to determine if the specimen was still viable. Wisconsin-based Kohl’s issued a statement apologizing for “this very unusual and inexplicable experience” and saying the package was sent from an “outside direct ship vendor” and not directly from the retail chain. The company said it launched its own investigation, but it declined to give further details, including the name of the vendor.\n\nIndiana\n\nKokomo: Fiat Chrysler has pushed back the reopening of a shuttered Indiana factory until late 2021, blaming delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Company officials had announced in March a $400 million plan to convert a Kokomo transmission factory so that it could begin engine production within the first three months of 2021. That reopening has been delayed until 2021’s last quarter, in part because of the company’s eight-week shutdown earlier this year, Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman Jodi Tinson told the Kokomo Tribune. Older equipment has been removed from the factory and interior walls and offices torn down as part of the conversion project, Tinson said. Steel is being raised to add a 30,000-square-foot addition to provide more manufacturing space. Fiat Chrysler said it plans to make the factory into the U.S. production site for the Global Medium Engine Turbo 4 for Jeep Wranglers and Cherokees, which is now built in Italy. Officials said the project would retain about 1,000 jobs and add nearly 200, bringing the total Fiat Chrysler workforce at its Kokomo-area factories to more than 8,000.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Iowans are heading into the winter holidays with few restrictions on gathering or social activities despite significant numbers of recent COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations in the state. The state Health Department on Monday reported 600 new confirmed cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus but no new deaths from it, though fewer tests were conducted in the past few days and there was a delay in the reporting of deaths. The state reported 138 deaths on Sunday after listing none in the previous two days. Public health officials revised the state’s method of calculating deaths earlier this month and said the new system would likely delay the reporting of COVID-19 deaths by up to a week. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in Iowa has risen slightly, from nearly 44 per day in the two weeks that ended Dec. 5 to nearly 46 per day during the two weeks that ended Dec. 19, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas will need far more doses of coronavirus vaccines than it’s set to receive in the coming days to start giving shots to all residents 75 or older, officials at a major health care system said as the state reported its worst seven-day spike in COVID-19 deaths of the pandemic. State officials expect Kansas’ 49,000 doses of a vaccine made by Moderna set to arrive this week to go to local health departments and community health care centers, so that they can vaccine health care workers, said Ashley Jones-Wisner, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The state’s first vaccine shipments last week, 23,750 doses made by Pfizer, went to hospitals for at-risk health care workers. The state’s vaccine distribution plan calls for vaccines first to go to health care workers, workers in nursing homes and nursing home residents, though Jones-Wisner said another shipment of Pfizer’s vaccines, expected to be 17,550 doses, will be used to start those shots. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses. “Somebody’s going to feel left out, because there’s not enough,” said Dr. Steve Stites, the chief medical officer for the University of Kansas Health System. “We just have to have a lot more of the vaccine.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Together with top state lawmakers, Gov. Andy Beshear and first lady Britainy Beshear received COVID-19 vaccinations Tuesday. The Democratic governor thanked the top two Republican legislative leaders, House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers, for joining him in “setting the right example for the people of Kentucky.” The head of the Kentucky National Guard, the lieutenant governor and state police commissioner will receive vaccines on Wednesday, Beshear said. “As more quantities become available, we will be providing them to more officeholders and or critical physicians,” he said. “Again, we’re doing this in a way that preserves 99.99% of these for front-line workers and for long-term care but builds confidence as we go.” About 7,000 Kentuckians, the vast majority of them health care workers in hospitals, have been vaccinated since Dec. 14.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Louisiana Supreme Court on Monday sent a legal feud between Gov. John Bel Edwards and House Republicans over coronavirus restrictions back to district court, saying the judge ruled too quickly that the state law the GOP used to try to nullify the restrictions was unconstitutional. The justices wrote in their opinion that Baton Rouge Judge William Morvant should have held a full hearing on other issues raised in the lawsuit over the Democratic governor’s statewide mask mandate, business restrictions and crowd size limits aimed at fighting the spread of COVID-19. “We find the district court acted prematurely in reaching the issue of constitutionality,” the justices wrote. The high court’s decision requires Morvant to hold another hearing in the case. The Edwards administration intends to continue enforcing its COVID-19 rules while the case is pending. The governor has since issued tougher restrictions than those that drew objections from House Republicans, as Louisiana sees a spike in coronavirus cases.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The bishop of Maine’s Roman Catholic diocese called on Catholics in the state to observe social distancing and other precautions this Christmas. Bishop Robert Deeley said 2020 is a year for “a different Christmas” because of the coronavirus pandemic. He said he plans to stay home and celebrate livestreamed Masses on Christmas morning at midnight and 10 a.m. this year. Deeley said it’s a good year to “put more lights up outside the house but bring less people into the house.” He also encouraged the use of facial coverings in any gatherings that involve people from different households. Deeley previously called on the state’s Catholics to use the coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available to them\n\nMaryland\n\nWilliamsport:The town has announced plans to line Byron Memorial Park with luminarias Saturday night to honor those who have died from COVID-19 and those who have contracted the disease, as well as others who have been impacted by the pandemic. Williamsport Main Street Manager Kathyrn Gratton said in a news release that living through 2020 has been challenging but strength has been found in those challenges. The luminarias that will placed throughout the park will be meant to shine a light on that strength, Gratton said. The event, made possible by a partnership between the town and the Williamsport Lions Club, will involve the lighting of the luminarias starting at dusk, according to the release. The luminarias will remain lit through the night and will coincide with ongoing holiday displays in the park. The event is also meant to honor the business community, all first responders who have been on the front line in the pandemic and the community as a whole, according to the release. Those coming to the park to view the lights are being asked to practice safe measures such as social distancing and use of masks. For those who wish to remain home, a Facebook Live video will be shown on the Town of Williamsport and Main Street Williamsport Facebook pages.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art has temporarily closed again in response to the latest statewide spike in COVID-19 cases. The closure that began Monday is precautionary, Alexandra Kennedy, executive director of the museum told The Daily Hampshire Gazette. Staff will continue to go into the museum on an as-needed basis and the museum’s bookshop will offer curbside service, she said. “We are hoping we can reopen to visitors early in the new year,” Kennedy wrote in an email. Museum officials said they will monitor state health data and reopen as soon it’s safe for staff, visitors and the community. Everyone who has purchased advanced tickets will be issued a refund. The museum closed in March at the start of the pandemic and reopened in August with strict protocols in place, including advanced registration for most visits and limited capacity.\n\nMichigan\n\nDeWitt Township:Hundreds of toys were distributed Tuesday in honor of a Lansing-area police officer who died of COVID-19. The toys were donated to DeWitt Township by the First Responders Children’s Foundation, the Lansing State Journal reported. Sgt. Bill Darnell died in November at a time when COVID-19 was having a major impact on the community of 15,000 people, north of Lansing. The DeWitt Township police department had to close for a week and get help from other police agencies because of the virus. “We want to get these (toys) to kids and families who need them, who want them,” said Police Chief Mike Gute. “We just want to do a good thing in honor and memory of Bill.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials are encouraging high school students who lost their jobs because of the pandemic to apply for unemployment assistance, hoping to get the help to more people who might not be aware of a recent state Court of Appeals ruling that made them eligible. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and other state officials held a virtual roundtable with several youth activists on Monday to get high school workers across the state who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic to apply for an estimated $14 million to $28 million in unemployment insurance funds provided by the federal CARES Act, for which they are now eligible. “Those first few months were extremely challenging for my family and if I had been allowed benefits at the time, it would have taken an immense amount of stress off of my shoulders,” said Rahma Farah, a 17-year-old high school student from south Minneapolis and one of the teens who helped with the effort.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state surpassed its previous record for the highest number of coronavirus deaths reported in a day Tuesday with 79. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said the state is on track to surpass 1,000 deaths in the month. Close to 4,500 people with the coronavirus have died in Mississippi since the start of the pandemic, according to the state Department of Health. “We’re all going to suffer,” Dobbs said during a virtual briefing Tuesday. “I think more and more people are seeing the impact on our families from personal experience.” The 79 deaths were reported as of Monday night. Fifty-six of the people died at different times within the last 10 days and were identified as coronavirus-related fatalities later using death certificates, according to the Department of Health. Dobbs, the state’s top health official, said he could not share the names of the dead because of privacy laws. But he took a moment at the start Tuesday’s briefing to honor some of those 79 who died. He listed individuals by age, sex and race: A Black woman in her late 30s, an 84-year-old white man and a 52-year-old Black man among them. “These are people, but for COVID, would be with us for next Christmas,” Dobbs said. “These are people who didn’t have to die.”\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: CVS Health said it plans to administer about 100,000 coronavirus vaccinations next week at Missouri long-term care facilities as the vaccination roll-out expands beyond health care workers, the company said Monday. The pharmacy chain will vaccinate residents and staff at more than 40,000 long-term care facilities across the U.S. The first of those vaccinations have begun, but Missouri facilities will see their first vaccinations starting Monday, CVS Health spokesman Charlie Rice-Minoso said. CVS and its competitor, Walgreens, are facilitating the inoculations at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Walgreens didn’t immediately reply to a Monday email seeking further information about that company’s plan in Missouri.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov.-elect Greg Gianforte signaled he won’t continue a statewide mask mandate in place since July, though he said he plans to wear a mask himself and get vaccinated against COVID-19. If Gianforte, a Republican, reverses outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock’s mask order, Montana will be just the second state after Mississippi to lift its mandate. Thirty-eight states now have statewide mandates. “I trust Montanans with their health and the health of their loved ones,” Gianforte said in a recent interview with KHN. “The state has a role in clearly communicating the risks of who is most vulnerable, what the potential consequences are, but then I do trust Montanans to make the right decisions for themselves and their family.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said masks help prevent transmission of COVID-19. At least one study has found that states with mask requirements have had slower COVID growth rates compared with those without mandates. “We’re going to encourage people to wear masks,” Gianforte said. “I’m personally going to lead by example, wearing a mask in the Capitol.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials said it’s important to remain vigilant about social distancing to limit the spread of the coronavirus, even though vaccines have started to be administered and the state’s virus numbers have improved recently. Douglas County Health Director Adi Pour said the arrival of vaccines this month offers hope, but it will be some time before enough people have been vaccinated to make a difference in the pandemic. “Until 60% to 70% of the community is vaccinated, you still need to wear the mask, you still need to have social distancing, you still need to take all of those precautions,” Pour said. Over the past several weeks, the virus numbers have been improving in Nebraska. The rate of people being infected with the virus went from the fifth-highest in the nation early this month to the 29th-highest rate on Monday. The state said the number of people hospitalized with the virus remained unchanged Monday at 582. That is significantly lower than the peak of 987 set on Nov. 20 although it is still more than 2.5 times higher than it was on Oct. 1.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada is open for visitors with precautions in place, tourism and coronavirus response leaders said Monday, despite a weekend where the state passed the 200,000 mark in known COVID-19 infections and totaled 73 new deaths. In Las Vegas, where New Year’s fireworks that typically draw 300,000 people to the resort-lined Strip have been canceled, casinos are “open within the limits of the capacity determined by the governor,” Nevada tourism promotions chief Brenda Scolari said in a media call with state COVID-19 response leaders. Gov. Steve Sisolak in November tightened occupancy limits for restaurants, bars, casino floors and gyms, and set capacity at 25% for many businesses in a bid to stop a surge of coronavirus cases that are driving up hospitalizations. “We are very much promoting that properties in Las Vegas are acting with safety of visitors in mind and have every measure in place that’s necessary to make New Year’s Eve safe and memorable,” Scolari said. But a handful of Las Vegas Strip resorts have announced midweek closures because of a lack of demand. The Mirage said that starting in January, it will only be open from noon on Thursdays through noon on Mondays. Although some casino-resorts have only announced weekday closures for hotel reservations, the Mirage plans weekday closures of all of its operations, including its casino floor, restaurants and volcano show out front that erupts four times a night.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: New Hampshire’s largest art museum has closed until at least mid-January because of the coronavirus pandemic. Officials at the Currier Museum of Art said they will reopen the museum when COVID-19 infection rates start to decrease, and noted that many museums across New England have taken similar steps. “Our region has recently experienced an alarming spike in cases and the Currier Museum is doing all it can to contain the spread of COVID-19 and avoid burdening local health resources,” officials said. In the meantime, the museum will expand its online programs, including the family-friendly “Noon Year’s Eve” event.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:The Murphy administration defended itself Monday and seemed to shift some blame to the federal government after missing a deadline to start vaccinating staff and residents of nursing homes this week against COVID-19. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy dismissed a top Republican's call for Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli to resign over the delay, saying \"the last thing we need is people who don't know what they're talking about from the cheap seats.\" Murphy did not say where the responsibility lies for the Department of Health's failure to submit the required paperwork to the federal government in time to begin vaccinating staff and residents in the locations hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, he urged patience and understanding as his administration rolls out a vaccine that was developed in record time and on a massive scale. \"This is not an easy, straight-line process,\" Murphy said. \"It is one of the most ambitious federal government initiatives ever undertaken, and folks have to understand that.\" The Department of Health missed by a day a federal deadline that would have allowed the pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens to begin vaccinating in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities Monday. In order to start vaccinating, the agency needed to submit information on more than 650 long-term care facilities throughout the state by Dec. 7. Now the vaccines should start being distributed Dec. 28.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Health officials said Tuesday they are hoping to boost the number of people getting tested for COVID-19 through a new program that will provide free, at-home test kits to anyone who requests one. Through a partnership with Vault Medical Services, the saliva tests can be ordered online. All that’s needed is an internet connection, an email address and photo identification. State officials acknowledged the lack of broadband access across New Mexico and said the new at-home option expands what they described as one of the most wide-reaching testing programs in the nation. The state Health Department has been operating in-person testing locations in every county since early in the pandemic, including in spots that have connectivity issues. The state is now averaging more than 14,000 tests a day and that’s expected to grow with the new program. In all, more than 1.8 million tests have been done since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city’s public school system will conduct special social, emotional and academic behavioral screenings next year for students in 27 neighborhood hard hit by the coronavirus, officials said. Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza said the screenings, beginning in September, will allow educators to get a jump-start on treating mental health issues related to the virus or the disruption of schooling that might linger into adulthood. The city is hiring 150 additional social workers for the effort and will expand a partnership between schools and the city’s public hospital system. Carranza said he would like to bring such services to all city schools, but can’t afford it without outside funding. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, heads up the city’s mental health initiatives. She described the new screenings as an important extension of a child’s annual pediatric exam.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper signed an executive order Monday making it easier for businesses to sell alcohol without customers having to show up in person for their purchase. The order, in effect through the end of January, lets restaurants, hotels, clubs, bars and some distilleries holding certain permits from the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission to sell alcoholic products for delivery or curbside pickup. The move is intended to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. “This order will help people avoid settings that can contribute to increased viral spread while giving restaurants and bars a financial boost that they need right now,” Cooper said in a statement. “With cases and hospitalizations high around the country, let’s all do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19 while supporting local, small businesses safely.” The 10-member Council of State approved Cooper’s action. Members include the Democratic governor and several other statewide elected officials.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum signed an amended executive order that paved the way for bars and restaurants in North Dakota to return to regular hours of operation on Tuesday, as the active number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have declined in the state. The food service establishments had been closed to in-person service between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m. since Nov. 16. The order Burgum signed Monday allows them to return to normal hours, consistent with any local requirements. But to keep the virus in check, the bars and restaurants must follow other state and local rules, including limiting capacity to 50% and allowing no more than 150 people inside until Jan. 8. Social distancing, mask wearing and other precautions also remain in place. A state order requiring masks to be worn in indoor businesses, indoor public settings and outdoor public settings where physical distancing isn’t possible remains in effect until Jan. 18. Banquet, ballroom and event venues also remain limited to 25% percent of maximum occupancy until Jan. 8.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:From TV commercials to a new mailing of masks to seniors, spending on a state public awareness campaign to persuade residents to play it safe in dealing with the coronavirus now totals more than $24 million. The state aging and health departments in recent days began a $13.5 million program to mail masks and COVID-19 precaution information to more than 2 million Ohioans age 65 and older. Including a new spot last week featuring four of the front-line nurses tending to virus patients, the Ohio Department of Health had spent $8.3 million with federal aid to produce and air an ongoing series of TV commercials counseling COVID caution.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: CVS Health said it plans to begin administering vaccines to more than 27,000 patients at 176 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities across Oklahoma. Those workers are in the first phase of the state’s vaccine distribution plan. More than one-third of the COVID-19 deaths in Oklahoma, or about 685 people, have been residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities, according to the most recent data from the State Department of Health. Oklahoma health officials reported 2,596 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday and six additional deaths, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 263,434 and the statewide death toll to 2,218.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:As protesters and police clashed outside, lawmakers met in a special session Monday to pass measures to deal with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s the third time lawmakers have met for an emergency session in what has been an extraordinary year, marked by the pandemic, widespread protests and blistering wildfires. Lawmakers extended a statewide ban on evicting renters until the end of June, narrowly managing to stave off a major crisis for thousands of Oregon renters. Between 27,700 and 56,100 Oregon households risk getting evicted on Jan. 1, the day after the current moratorium ends, according to a legislative analysis that cited data from the National Council of State Housing Agencies. “Now more than ever, preventing evictions is an investment in the well-being of every Oregonian,” said Rep. Julie Fahey, D-Eugene, who carried the bill on the floor. Rep. Mark Meek, D-Clackamas County, said that although he supported extending the state’s moratorium on evictions, he didn’t support the bill, which he said doesn’t provide “meaningful relief to housing providers” through a fund set up to compensate landlords.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf on Tuesday delivered a mixed review of Congress’ newly passed pandemic relief package, as Philadelphia extended its coronavirus restrictions affecting indoor dining, in-person instruction at colleges and other activities. Wolf, a Democrat, said the $900 billion in federal aid package will provide vital support for people, small businesses and efforts to fight the virus. But, he said, it lacked direct aid to state and local governments trying to prop up crucial services, and more aid is needed for a hard-hit service industry – such as restaurants and bars – and in direct payments to individuals and families. The bill would establish a temporary $300-per-week supplemental jobless benefit and a $600 direct payment to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, plus money for schools, health care providers and renters facing eviction. In Philadelphia, city officials extended restrictions on indoor dining, indoor events, theaters, casinos, colleges and indoor organized sports for two more weeks, through Jan. 15. Museums, outdoor sports, gyms, in-person instruction in high schools and outdoor catered events can resume Jan. 4, with capacity limitations, unless state restrictions set to expire that day are extended by Wolf, city officials said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Providence Public Schools and its food vendor are making sure the city’s children don’t go hungry over the holidays amid the pandemic. The schools and Sodexo on Tuesday as part of the grab-and-go program are offering students 13 days’ worth of meals, enough to cover the holiday break, at its eight meal sites across the city. The grab-and-go meal sites will not be active during the break. The Home for the Holiday meal pack includes a turkey or pork roast, potatoes, mandarin oranges, macaroni and cheese, cereal, milk, juice and other items. Parents and guardians may pick up a student’s meal pack, provided they have the student’s school ID number.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s health board selected a retired military doctor to head the state’s health and environmental department, which has been overseeing South Carolina’s coronavirus response. The Department of Health and Environmental Control board unanimously voted Tuesday to hire Dr. Edward Simmer, who previously oversaw civilian medical and dental care for the Defense Health Agency in Virginia and served three decades in the Navy. The board-certified psychiatrist also holds a master’s degree in public health.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Monument Health, the largest hospital system in the western part of South Dakota, began administering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to hospital workers and staff at long-term care facilities in several locations. Meanwhile, the largest hospital systems in the eastern part of the state planned to distribute the vaccine in the coming days. The state’s distribution plan calls for medical workers in hospitals and long-term care facilities to receive the vaccine first, followed by residents of long-term care facilities. The Department of Health reported that 7,844 people have received the first dose of the vaccine manufactured by Pfizer and expects to receive enough doses of the Moderna vaccine for 14,600 people.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Democratic U.S. Rep. London Lamar said Tennessee is “setting a world example of how to kill people during a pandemic” by not requiring masks and other measures. Dr. Jason Martin of a physician’s group said Gov. Bill Lee has “betrayed your oath and abandoned the people you were elected to serve,” and has rebutted Lee’s contention that there’s argument and dissention about “what’s the right tactic” among health professionals. The president of the Tennessee Medical Association, Dr. Kevin Smith, said his group hasn’t heard from any of its 9,000-plus physician members who oppose mask requirements now. The association is calling for mask mandates in counties that top 10 new cases per 100,000 people a day – currently, the whole state, since the best county was eight times worse in the last week, Smith said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday joined the ranks of governors receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in hopes of assuring the public that the inoculations are safe. Abbott, a Republican, said after getting the vaccine at a hospital in the state capital that federal health officials have urged governors to set an example. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey also received the first dose this week, and other governors have said they will wait. A resurgence of the virus in Texas has put the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients back over 10,000 for only the second time during the pandemic. Nearly 11,000 people were hospitalized in July during a deadly summer outbreak. Abbott has said he won’t impose new lockdown measures as cases climb.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Thirty-seven of the 128 deaths of southwestern Utah residents attributed to COVID-19 have come since Dec. 1, making it the deadliest month since the pandemic began, according to new state figures released Monday. Two more deaths were added to the count Monday, including a Washington County man between the ages of 45 and 64 and another between the ages of 65 and 84. The numbers have accelerated in recent weeks. There were a total of 57 deaths by the end of October, and then 35 in November before the increase in December. In addition, another 40 people were hospitalized with the disease as of Monday, according to the Southwest Utah Public Health Department.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott said he is relaxing restrictions on gatherings over the holidays to allow two trusted households to gather as Vermont’s coronavirus case numbers have stabilized, although they are still higher than the administration would like to see. “It’s been a little over a month since we took significant steps to slow the rising spread of the virus. And it’s clearly working,” Scott said. The state has seen several days of fewer than 100 cases, which is still high but shows vast improvement, he said. Gathering with only one trusted household will be allowed from Wednesday to Jan. 2, with other stringent measures still in place, Scott said. Gathering with more than one trusted household on different days is not permitted, he said. And if one of the two households is from out of state, everyone must quarantine for seven days and get a negative test or quarantine for 14 days afterward, he said. Scott also announced that residents can participate in outdoor recreation with others outside of their households provided that they can physically distance and wear a mask. Starting Friday, school-based and youth recreational sports teams may begin practices with skills, strength and conditioning drills with no contact and physically distancing and mask-wearing at all times.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials announced a temporary policy change Tuesday that will provide about $200 million in payroll tax relief next year to Virginia businesses that laid off workers amid the pandemic. Under an executive order from Gov. Ralph Northam, the Virginia Employment Commission won’t be counting layoffs that took place in April, May or June against businesses when calculating unemployment insurance tax rates for 2021, Northam’s office announced. Without the change to what’s called the experience tax, about 10,000 more businesses than last year would have had to pay the full amount of about $600 per year per employee, according to Megan Healy, Northam’s chief workforce development advisor. She said the tax relief will be offset by about $210 million in federal stimulus money that lawmakers directed to the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund during the special session. Nicole Riley, Virginia state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, said Northam’s decision would relieve some of the financial pressure on employers and ultimately make it easier for them to put people back to work.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee has announced new travel restrictions for people arriving from the United Kingdom and South Africa where a new and seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus is circulating. Inslee said Monday he would issue a proclamation requiring passengers who arrive from the United Kingdom and South Africa to quarantine for 14 days, including passengers who have arrived from those countries in the past few days. It also encourages those people to get tested for the virus. “Today’s action is a commonsense public health measure and … is another attempt to keep Washingtonians safe,” Inslee said. The quarantine measures are precautionary and meant to stem a possible surge in cases that could overwhelm hospitals, he said. The quarantine is mandatory and although it’s legally enforceable, Inslee said no one will be taken into custody over it. Dozens of countries have restricted travel from Britain in recent days because of the new strain. Inslee said he wasn’t aware of other states issuing restrictions. British Airways canceled the only nonstop flight from London to Seattle on Monday, according to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport spokesperson Perry Cooper, but he said the reason behind it wasn’t immediately known.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a single-day record of 42 deaths linked to the coronavirus on Tuesday, with victims ranging in age from 48 to 100. The state reported 787 confirmed coronavirus cases, down from a high of 1,257 last week. There are 22,864 active cases in the state. West Virginia has received nearly 21,100 doses of a coronavirus vaccine so far, administering more than 15,900. Gov. Jim Justice said Monday a combined 44,300 doses of vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech will arrive this week. Officials expect to administer doses at all nursing homes and long-term care centers by the end of the month.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin System paid out nearly $70 million in coronavirus-related refunds to students in the last year, according to a report released Tuesday. The Legislative Audit Bureau released findings that show the system paid out $68.5 million in housing and food service refunds to students after campuses closed in March as the pandemic was taking hold in Wisconsin. The report didn’t say how much the system might have saved by closing down dorms and food services. State Auditor Joe Chrisman didn’t respond to a message seeking further information. Auditors also found that the Board of Regents approved reductions in other student fees at four two-year schools and at UW-Milwaukee heading into the fall semester to reflect a lack of athletics and performing arts programming. Student fees support both areas. The fee reductions ranged from $36 per student at UW-Milwaukee’s Waukesha branch to $187 per student at UW-Milwaukee. The report went on to say that the system received $94.2 million in federal pandemic relief funds. Half of that money had to go for financial aid for students for pandemic-related expenses; the rest had to be used to cover changes in instruction delivery or student aid.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The 70 new confirmed COVID-19 cases recorded in Campbell County on Monday afternoon pushed its total to 3,646 since the pandemic began, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. Campbell County Memorial Hospital continues to feel the strain of its resources as its COVID-19 hospitalizations remain high, despite a noticeable decrease at other hospitals throughout the state, the Gillette News Record reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/10/coronavirus-covid-19-small-nations-iceland-big-data/2959797001/", "title": "Coronavirus: Tiny Iceland has a lot of big COVID-19 data", "text": "Iceland has achieved something no other country has: tested 10% of its population for coronavirus, a figure far higher than anywhere else in the world.\n\nNo country or scientist or doctor has all the answers about the pandemic that has swept the globe, infecting more than 1.6 million people and killing at least 95,000.\n\nBut some places, such as tiny Iceland, Europe's most sparsely populated country – pop. 364,134, broadly equivalent to the number of people in Tulsa, Oklahoma – may be better placed to deliver some types of coronavirus information, and even answers than most, at least in the short term, according to public health experts, international government officials and others involved in responding to the outbreak.\n\nFacing a crisis to rival Pearl Harbor:World's superpower pleads for coronavirus aid\n\n\"The size of a place matters. It tracks with the number of introductions of the virus. It is no coincidence the places now doing (the best work) share this feature,\" said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University's T.N. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nTo be clear, Iceland has not yet been able to provide definitive explanations for the most pressing coronavirus questions vexing scientists, politicians and publics the world over. Among them: its transmissibility; why it hits some people exceptionally hard and affects others only mildly; the most promising vaccines and treatments; actual mortality rates; and whether lifting lockdowns will later usher in a deadly second and third wave of new infections – if the so-called coronavirus curve, in fact, looks more like a loop.\n\nHanage said in terms of lasting analysis models for our understanding of the virus it's also not clear for how long size will matter to health experts probing the disease.\n\n‘Afraid and overwhelmed’:A look inside one hospital on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic\n\nStill, for now, Iceland may be one of best live coronavirus laboratories we have, according to Kari Stefansson, an Icelandic neurologist and chief executive officer of Reykjavik-based biopharmaceutical company deCODE genetics, which has partnered with Iceland's government to carry out its massing testing efforts.\n\nIceland's 10% figure, confirmed by Stefansson, was achieved on April. 11.\n\nIt is not just about bragging rights.\n\nAmong the Nordic nation's findings: about half of its citizenry at any given time who have coronavirus but don't know it, will be asymptomatic – a large percentage many experts studying the virus have suspected, but have had little firm data to corroborate.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control has previously estimated that about 25% of people infected with coronavirus may be asymptomatic.\n\n\"That's a bit scary,\" said Stefansson, who noted that Iceland is testing its citizens at random by selecting names out of the country's main telephone directory, another large-scale testing strategy that has not been adopted elsewhere.\n\n\"They could be spreading it and not knowing it,\" he said.\n\n'It means the containment efforts of the authorities are working'\n\nIceland has not imposed a full national lockdown.\n\nIts restrictions are largely based on trust. Most shops and businesses are still open.\n\nHowever, the country has banned gatherings of more than 20 people. Of Iceland's more than 1,600 coronavirus infections as of April 11, seven have ended in deaths.\n\nLike other localities such as Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong that have moderately sized populations and relatively diminutive geographies, Iceland has proved successful at \"flattening the curve\" – keeping the number of coronavirus infections at a manageable level for medical workers who would otherwise be overwhelmed with sick patients.\n\nIn Iceland's case, it has done this through a combination of rigorous testing and tracing. Authorities say Icelanders are heeding social distancing recommendations.\n\nStefansson said Iceland's randomized tests revealed that between 0.3%-0.8% of Iceland's population is infected with the respiratory illness, that about 50% of those who test positive for the virus are asymptomatic when they are tested, and that since mid-March the frequency of the virus among Iceland's general population who are not at the greatest risk – those who do not have underlying health conditions or signs and symptoms of COVID-19 – has either stayed stable or been decreasing.\n\nThis data has yielded, he said, yet more knowledge.\n\n\"It means the containment efforts of the authorities are working,\" he said.\n\nWhile many countries publish daily and cumulative infection and death rates, there don't appear to be comparable statistics for other nations available that give an overall sense of how deep-rooted the virus is, or how many carriers of the disease, at any given time, may have no symptoms. Iceland has not yet been able to determine how many asymptomatic infections, once confirmed, will later go on to develop symptoms.\n\nJohn P.A. Ioannidis, a professor biomedical data science and epidemiology at Stanford University, said that the \"best data\" on coronavirus is currently coming from Iceland. But that may be partly because Iceland is the only country that has so much data, even if it's too early to draw unequivocal conclusions about what the data are saying and Iceland's relatively small sampling size could impact the results.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on April 6 in a press briefing that almost two million Americans have been tested – 0.6% of the population – but it's not clear what metrics the White House is relying on and hundreds of hospitals have complained about severe shortages of testing supplies and long waiting times, according to a report from the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services. Although access to testing in the U.S. does appear to be improving in some areas.\n\nAccording to Worldometer, an online statistics website run by an international team of developers and researchers that collates public health information published directly by each state, the U.S. has conducted about 2.5 million tests as of April 11. That equates to about 7,600 tests per one million people. Using that same scale that accounts for Iceland's population, Iceland has undertaken 100,000 tests per million people.\n\n'Scale is important but for reasons you might not initially think'\n\nSome countries, such as Germany, have predicted that up to 70% of their nationals could eventually contract coronavirus. And officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said that under a worst-case scenario, between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. – 48% to 64% of Americans – could be become infected over the course of the epidemic, although those numbers don't account for various social-distancing measures underway aimed at slowing transmission rates.\n\nCOVID-19:These countries are doing the best and worst jobs fighting coronavirus\n\nGestur Palmason, a police detective deployed as a coronavirus \"contact tracer\" at Iceland’s National Crisis Coordination, said few other places would have the resources or serendipitous combination of factors to carry out Iceland's preliminary research.\n\nThese include the island-nation's remoteness, the high regard its nationals have for scientific expertise – medical experts, not politicians, are leading its response – its tech-savvy government infrastructure, a relatively tried and tested emergency agency that is used to dealing with volcano eruptions and avalanches, and yes, fewer people.\n\n\"Scale is important but also for reasons you might not initially think,\" Palmason said.\n\n\"The smaller the population you have the more chance there is you will know someone who is affected. Whatever your government or law enforcement may be saying, you are much more likely to want to play a part and take recommendations seriously because of that personal connection – compared to places where there are tens of millions of people and you may not have been to parts of the country or know people there.\"\n\nA bridge between life and death:Most COVID-19 patients on ventilators won't survive\n\nStill, Wang Ting-yu, a Taiwanese lawmaker who has been active in the East Asia island-state's much-admired response to its coronavirus outbreak, said that while he was watching Iceland's experiment with mass testing and data with interest – noting that Taiwan has also rolled out islandwide coronavirus screening – he thought that other western countries in Europe and North America would be better off at this stage of their fight with the disease by adopting a \"war time\" mentality to combat the outbreak.\n\nThis means, Wang said, strictly enforced quarantines, protecting frontline workers with the most advanced personal protective equipment and a whole-of-government approach to keeping the public informed about lockdowns, setbacks, any changes in tactics and, crucially, developing tailored technology to deliver this information.\n\nU.S. technology companies Apple and Google announced April 10 that they have teamed up to develop technology that can help people figure out if they've been exposed to COVID-19, via apps and the Bluetooth wireless standard.\n\nTaiwan has a similar population to Australia – about 24 million people. Both are islands, although Taiwan's population density is far higher. As of April 11, Australia has recorded more than 6,200 coronavirus cases and 56 deaths. Taiwan has 385 cases and 6 deaths.\n\nIn New Zealand, another small island-nation – pop. 4.7 million – that early on in the global pandemic imposed a tight lockdown strategy aimed at totally eliminating the virus rather than just containing it, there has been just 4 deaths amid more than 1,300 cases.\n\n\"Our message to our friends abroad is: centralize your response,\" Wang said. \"If you don't move quickly, or with enough purpose, then the price is peoples' lives.\"\n\nCOVID-19:Almost all of the federal stockpile of personal protective equipment is depleted, new documents show\n\n'We now seem to be the safest place on the planet'\n\nGovernments from Rome to Berlin have indicated that daily new coronavirus infections and death tolls may be on the verge or even already be starting to plateau or fall as a result of social distancing measures. The White House has made similar claims.\n\nNew York state has actively flattened its curve with social distancing regulations, Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a press briefing on April 8.\n\nSingapore, Hong Kong and even China, where coronavirus originated in December last year and authorities have all but claimed total victory over COVID-19, have meanwhile seen rising clusters of new infections in recent weeks. While most of these cases are imported, it remains unclear whether by lifting restrictions authorities around the world will be forced into a game of coronavirus whackamole with no obvious end date. In the last few days Japan, which initially held off on a lockdown, has fortified its restrictions.\n\nEnforcing shutdowns::Officials grapple with policing stay-at-home orders, social distancing, quarantines\n\nThe U.S. has largely relied on a patchwork of social distancing measures and lockdowns dictated at state level, while the Trump administration has offered federal guidance that is not mandatory to follow. More than 500,000 people in the U.S. have been infected with coronavirus and the number of deaths – almost 19,000 – is about the same as in Italy, the worst-affected place in Europe along with Spain.\n\nStill, in terms of collecting actionable data about coronavirus, Hange, the Harvard epidemiologist, questioned whether Iceland would be better off focusing on serological tests that could determine whether a person had developed certain antibodies in the blood indicating that they were infected by the virus without knowing it, and recovered.\n\nKnowing whether these antibodies exist in someone's blood could, potentially, enable tens of millions of people around the world to reenter the workforce at a time economies are reeling because they are under orders to stay home to prevent the virus' spread.\n\nWhen will life return to normal?:Expert says US testing is too far behind to know\n\n\"Random testing for ongoing infections helps but runs into a lot of issues,\" Hanage said.\n\n\"If you find someone is positive and asymptomatic now, you still have to wait until they have recovered to know the course of their illness,\" he added, noting that some reports out of Italy indicate that the most seriously affected towns in the nation's Lombardy region show a large portion of the population with signs of immunity.\n\n\"If true this is obviously a very good sign, but it has come at an appalling cost,\" he said.\n\nFDA authorizes first coronavirus blood test: A key step for showing immunity and testing for vaccines\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun preliminary studies into serological tests – called sero-surveys – to try to determine what proportion of Americans caught the disease but evaded detection. No results have been published.\n\nVarious U.S. cities are launching their own antibody studies.\n\nStefansson, the CEO of deCODE genetics, which is doing Iceland's testing in coordination with the government, said it started screening for antibodies on April 8.\n\nGermany has started Europe's first large-scale coronavirus antibody testing effort to help researchers assess infection rates more effectively.\n\nStill, one place where the coronavirus data are especially pure, and small, is Antarctica.\n\nWhile more than 100 people from Australia, Europe and the U.S. on board a cruise ship traveling to Antarctica and South Georgia tested positive this week for coronavirus, the ice-covered landmass is the only continent that remains untouched by the outbreak.\n\nNew York, Gilpin:The places a COVID-19 recession will likely hit hardest\n\n\"We now seem to be the 'safest' place on the planet,\" said Stijn Tholen, a European Space Agency medical research doctor who is spending a year on the ice investigating how humans adapt to living in extreme environments, in an email.\n\n\"The increasing darkness and cold here already feel so otherworldly, and to see what is happening in the rest of the world makes me feel even more distant,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/10"}]}

Here's a look at the pontiff's long ...", "text": "AI-assisted summary Pope Francis, 88, was hospitalized Feb. 14 for a respiratory infection and diagnosed with double pneumonia.\n\nThe pope has a history of respiratory problems, having part of his lung removed in 1957 due to infection.\n\nFrancis has also experienced other health issues in recent years, including sciatica and colon surgery in 2021.\n\nPope Francis remains hospitalized as the 88-year-old has been diagnosed with double pneumonia, the Vatican said on Tuesday. The pontiff has been susceptible to lung infections much of his life.\n\nFrancis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli University Hospital on Friday, Feb. 14 for a respiratory infection. On Monday, the Vatican announced that doctors were treating Francis for a \"polymicrobial infection,\" which is caused by multiple pathogens and can lead to chronic and short-term diseases.\n\nDouble pneumonia, also known as bilateral pneumonia, is an infection that affects both lungs and can make breathing difficult. The Vatican has canceled the pope's weekend engagements as he continues treatment.\n\nHere's a look back at Pope Francis' medical history over the years.\n\n1957: Portion of lung removed due to respiratory infection\n\nIn his early 20s, Pope Francis underwent surgery to remove part of his lungs affected by a severe respiratory infection in his native Argentina, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. This has made the pope more susceptible to colds and respiratory illnesses.\n\nDecember 2020: Notable sciatica pain\n\nAt the end of 2020, Pope Francis had to cancel his appearance at several end-of-year celebrations due to \"painful sciatica,\" Vatican News reported. In several videos that circulated online, Francis was seen struggling to stand with the help of assistants during public appearances.\n\nSciatica is a pain that moves along the sciatic nerve − starting in the lower back and extending down a leg.\n\nJanuary 2021: Continued sciatica\n\nAt the end of January 2021, Pope Francis once again cancelled a few appearances due to another bout of painful sciatica, according to the Holy See Press Office.\n\nJuly 2021: Narrowing of the colon\n\nIn 2021, Pope Francis underwent surgery for a diverticular stenosis of the colon in which 13 inches of his colon was removed, per previous from Vatican News and USA TODAY. He spent 10 days at the Gemelli University Hospital for the procedure.\n\nColonic diverticulitis, according to the medical journal Cureus, is a common gastrointestinal disease. It occurs when the colon's diverticulum, a small, pouch-like structure in the wall of the colon, becomes inflamed. Stenosis, a rare complication of colonic diverticulitis, can cause bowel obstruction and must be taken care of immediately.\n\nFrancis recovered soon after but shared at the start of 2023 that his diverticulitis had returned.\n\n2022: Recurring knee pain\n\nThroughout much of 2022, Pope Francis publicly companied of knee pain and was seen using a walker or wheelchair. A few times he had to cancel appearances, Vatican News reported.\n\n2023: Bronchitis, abdominal surgery and the flu\n\nPope Francis visited the hospital several times throughout 2023.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, the pontiff spent three days at the Gemelli University Hospital with bronchitis, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. A few months later he returned to the hospital for follow-up tests.\n\nIn June 2023, Pope Francis was admitted back to the Gemelli University Hospital for abdominal surgery, according to Vatican News. The pontiff underwent a laparotomy and abdominal wall surgery due to an incisional hernia. Through the procedure, the hernia was repaired and reinforced with mesh. Francis remained in the hospital for nine days.\n\nIn November 2023, the pontiff underwent a CT scan of his lungs due to flu-like symptoms, Vatican News reported. The tests showed negative results of any respiratory complications.\n\n2024: Flu-like symptoms, bruised chin from fall\n\nAbout a year ago, Pope Francis visited the Gemelli University Hospital to undergo diagnostic tests as a result of flu-like symptoms, according to Vatican News.\n\nThen in early December 2024, Catholic News Agency reported that Francis had fallen, hitting his chin on his nightstand.

In an open letter shared last week, Francis said the criminalization of migrants and mass deportation \"will end badly\" and that the United States should be weary of entering a \"major crisis.\" The pope also questioned Vice President JD Vance's use of the theological concept \"ordo amoris\" to defend mass deportations, which Francis clarified means to encourage compassion for all people.\n\nAs the Catholic leader remains in the hospital, here's what to know about Pope Francis.\n\nWhy is Pope Francis in the hospital?\n\nPope Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli University Hospital on Friday due to a respiratory infection.\n\nInitially, Francis was treated for bronchitis, but on Monday the Vatican announced that doctors changed their treatment, as tests demonstrated Francis has a \"polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract.\" Francis will remain at the hospital for as long as necessary, the Vatican said.\n\nAccording to the medical journal The Lancet, polymicrobial infections are acute and chronic diseases caused by a combination of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.\n\nHow old is Pope Francis?\n\nPope Francis is 88 years old. He is the second oldest pope.\n\nWho was the oldest pope?\n\nPope Leo XIII was the oldest pope to serve the Catholic church. He served until his death in 1903 at the age of 93.\n\nWhere is Pope Francis from?\n\nPope Francis was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He is the first Argentinean to become pope.\n\nWhen did Pope Francis become pope?\n\nPope Francis became the pope of the Roman Catholic Church on March 13, 2013. Francis is the 266th successor from the very first pope, Saint Peter.\n\nDoes Pope Francis have a wife or children?\n\nNo, Pope Francis does not have a wife or children because the Catholic Church requires popes to practice celibacy − the abstinence of sexual relations and marriage.\n\nWho will be the next pope?\n\nIt is unknown who will succeed Pope Francis.\n\nFollowing a vacancy in the papacy, the College of Cardinals (bishops and Vatican officials chosen by the pope) gather to prepare for an upcoming papal election, which is called a conclave, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nIn the past, 15 to 20 days after a papacy vacancy, the College of Cardinals meet in St. Peter's Basilica to invoke guidance from the Holy Spirit in electing a new pope, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The cardinals vote by secret ballot, and four rounds of voting are conducted each day until one candidate receives two-thirds of the vote. If no one candidate receives the necessary votes, the ballots are burned with a mixture of chemicals in a stove near the chapel to produce black smoke.\n\nOnce a candidate is selected, the candidate is asked if he would like to accept the position. If he accepts, he chooses a papal name and is dressed in papal attire before processing out to the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. Additionally, the ballots of the final round of voting will be burned with chemicals near the chapel to produce white smoke.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

Is it a federal holiday? Everything to know", "text": "Presidents Day is fast approaching, which may signal to many a relaxing three-day weekend and plenty of holiday sales and bargains.\n\nBut next to Independence Day, there may not exist another American holiday that is quite so patriotic.\n\nWhile Presidents Day has come to be a commemoration of all the nation's 46 chief executives, both past and present, it wasn't always so broad. When it first came into existence – long before it was even federally recognized – the holiday was meant to celebrate just one man: George Washington.\n\nHow has the day grown from a simple celebration of the birthday of the first president of the United States? And why are we seeing all these ads for car and furniture sales on TV?\n\nHere's what to know about Presidents Day and how it came to be:\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2024?\n\nThis year, Presidents Day is on Monday, Feb. 19.\n\nThe holiday is celebrated on the third Monday of every February because of a bill signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Taking effect three years later, the Uniform Holiday Bill mandated that three holidays – Memorial Day, Presidents Day and Veterans Day – occur on Mondays to prevent midweek shutdowns and add long weekends to the federal calendar, according to Britannica.\n\nOther holidays, including Labor Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day, were also established to be celebrated on Mondays when they were first observed.\n\nHowever, Veterans Day was returned to Nov. 11 in 1978 and continues to be commemorated on that day.\n\nWhat does Presidents Day commemorate?\n\nPresidents Day was initially established in 1879 to celebrate the birthday of the nation's first president, George Washington. In fact, the holiday was simply called Washington's Birthday, which is still how the federal government refers to it, the Department of State explains.\n\nFollowing the death of the venerated American Revolution leader in 1799, Feb. 22, widely believed to be Washington's date of birth, became a perennial day of remembrance, according to History.com.\n\nThe day remained an unofficial observance for much of the 1800s until Sen. Stephen Wallace Dorsey of Arkansas proposed that it become a federal holiday. In 1879, President Rutherford B. Hayes signed it into law, according to History.com.\n\nWhile initially being recognized only in Washington D.C., Washington's Birthday became a nationwide holiday in 1885. The first to celebrate the life of an individual American, Washington's Birthday was at the time one of only five federally-recognized holidays – the others being Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July.\n\nHowever, most Americans today likely don't view the federal holiday as a commemoration of just one specific president. Presidents Day has since come to represent a day to recognize and celebrate all of the United States' commanders-in-chief, according to the U.S. Department of State.\n\nWhen the Uniform Holiday Bill took effect in 1971, a provision was included to combine the celebration of Washington’s birthday with Abraham Lincoln's on Feb. 12, according to History.com. Because the new annual date always fell between Washington's and Lincoln's birthdays, Americans believed the day was intended to honor both presidents.\n\nInterestingly, advertisers may have played a part in the shift to \"Presidents Day.\"\n\nMany businesses jumped at the opportunity to use the three-day weekend as a means to draw customers with Presidents Day sales and bargain at stores across the country, according to History.com.\n\nHow is the holiday celebrated?\n\nBecause Presidents Day is a federal holiday, most federal workers will have the day off.\n\nPart of the reason Johnson made the day a uniform holiday was so Americans had a long weekend \"to travel farther and see more of this beautiful land of ours,\" he wrote. As such, places like the Washington Monument in D.C. and Mount Rushmore in South Dakota – which bears the likenesses of Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt – are bound to attract plenty of tourists.\n\nSimilar to Independence Day, the holiday is also viewed as a patriotic celebration. As opposed to July, February might not be the best time for backyard barbecues and fireworks, but reenactments, parades and other ceremonies are sure to take place in cities across the U.S.\n\nPresidential places abound across the U.S.\n\nOpinions on current and recent presidents may leave Americans divided, but we apparently love our leaders of old enough to name a lot of places after them.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau pulled information from its databases showcasing presidential geographic facts about the nation's cities and states.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the census data shows that as of 2020, the U.S. is home to plenty of cities, counties and towns bearing presidential names. Specifically:\n\n94 places are named \"Washington.\"\n\n72 places are named \"Lincoln.\"\n\n67 places are named for Andrew Jackson, a controversial figure who owned slaves and forced thousands of Native Americans to march along the infamous Trail of Tears.\n\nContributing: Clare Mulroy\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Here's who gets the federal holiday off.", "text": "Presidents Day comes as the winter drags on, offering a celebratory three-day weekend after the rush of the holiday season and the January observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nAfter Presidents Day, there are no federal holidays until May, so you'll have to wait a while for another three-day weekend. Aside from the name, an obvious homage to Presidents of years past, you might not know the significance of the holiday.\n\nHere’s when Presidents Day falls in 2024 and a history lesson about the federal holiday.\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2024?\n\nPresidents Day is on Monday, Feb. 19 this year. Presidents Day is celebrated on the third Monday of February every year.\n\nThe date of Presidents Day changes every year because of the Uniform Holiday Bill signed in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Uniform Holiday Bill mandated that three holidays, including Presidents Day, occur on Mondays to prevent midweek shutdowns and add long weekends to the federal calendar.\n\nWhat is Presidents Day?\n\nPresidents Day is also called \"Washington’s Birthday\" as a celebration of the nation’s first President. But George Washington’s birthday is not on Feb. 19 – it is Feb. 22. Or it might be Feb. 11.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting.\n\nGeorge Washington was born on Feb. 11, 1731, at a time when Britain and its colonies used the Julian calendar, a product of the Roman Republic that went out of popular favor in 1582. The Brits still used it until 1752. The country celebrated Washington’s birthday as a sign of respect long before it became a federal holiday in 1879.\n\nAfter Johnson’s Uniform Holiday Bill, it was celebrated on the third Monday of February. Around this time, the country also began using the holiday to honor not only Washington but Abraham Lincoln, whose birthday is February 12.\n\nRepublican Rep. Robert McClory spearheaded the bill, which caused outrage from some who objected to changing the date we celebrate Washington’s birthday.\n\n\"We are not changing George Washington's birthday,” McClory said. “We would make George Washington's Birthday more meaningful to many more people by having it observed on a Monday.\"\n\nHe also proposed changing the name of the new shared holiday to Presidents Day. As a Congressmember from Illinois, McClory came from the state where Lincoln spent much of his life.\n\nMany opposed this as well. Tennessee representative Dan Heflin Kuykendall said, \"If we do this, 10 years from now our schoolchildren will not know or care when George Washington was born. They will know that in the middle of February they will have a 3-day weekend for some reason.”\n\nThe measure failed to pass. While we know the holiday more popularly as\"Presidents Day,\" the federal government still officially calls it Washington’s Birthday.\n\nPresidents Day in November?Why states celebrate so differently\n\nWho gets Presidents Day off?\n\nFederal holidays are those observed by the federal government, so anyone who works for the federal government generally has the day off. Federal holidays may also be observed on Monday or Friday if they fall on a weekend.\n\nHolidays currently recognized by the federal government:\n\nNew Year's Day: January 1\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. Day: Third Monday in January\n\nWashington's Birthday, or Presidents Day: Third Monday in February\n\nMemorial Day: Last Monday in May\n\nJuneteenth National Independence Day: June 19\n\nIndependence Day: July 4\n\nLabor Day: First Monday in September\n\nColumbus Day and Indigenous Peoples’ Day: Second Monday in October\n\nVeteran's Day: November 11\n\nThanksgiving Day: Fourth Thursday in November\n\nChristmas Day: December 25\n\nEmployees who work elsewhere may not get these holidays off. According to the Fair Labor Standards Act, federal holiday time off is a benefit agreed upon by employer and employee. In other words, your employer does not have to give you a paid day off on federal holidays.\n\nJust Curious for more?

Columbus Day commemorates Christopher Columbus’s arrival in North America in October of 1942. But in more recent history, many choose to celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ Day instead, which aims to take the attention off of colonizers and place it on the colonized.\n\nWhat is Indigenous Peoples' Day?\n\n“Indigenous Peoples' Day has been gaining popularity as a replacement for Columbus Day since the late 1980s. Indigenous Peoples' Day is celebrated on the second Monday of October and honors the Indigenous communities that have lived in the Americas for thousands of years,” According to U.S. News and World Report.\n\n“It celebrates Native American culture, history, and contributions to American society.

With all of the efforts against diversity programs and the Department of Defense saying it would no longer acknowledge the holidays, many people are wondering what will become of the holiday.\n\nHere's what to know about whether Black History Month is still happening.\n\nPresident Trump's Black History Month proclamation\n\nOn Friday, Jan. 31, Trump issued a proclamation declaring February Black History Month. In his proclamation, Trump mentions abolitionist Frederick Douglass, abolitionist Harriett Tubman, economist Thomas Sowell, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and professional golfer Tiger Woods.\n\n\"This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a historic Golden Age, I want to extend my tremendous gratitude to black Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment, and for the many future contributions they will make as we advance into a future of limitless possibility under my Administration,\" the proclamation read.\n\nWhat agencies got rid of Black History Month celebrations, why?\n\nThis proclamation comes on the heels of the Department of Defense announcing it would no longer recognize or celebrate months dedicated to specific cultural or gender identities.\n\n\"Identity Months Dead at DoD,\" a memo issued Friday read.\n\nMonths that will no longer be recognized are:\n\nWomen's History Month\n\nPride Month\n\nHispanic Heritage Month\n\nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month\n\nComponents of the DoD and military are no longer allowed to use \"official resources, to include man-hours, to host celebrations or events.\" Service members will be able to observe holidays on their own time.\n\nBlack History Month history\n\nAccording to History.com, the story of Black History Month was started in 1915 by two men and later evolved into what we recognize today.\n\nIn September 1915, historian Carter G. Woodson and minister Jesse E. Mooreland founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History to research and promote achievements made by Black Americans and peoples of African descent.\n\nIn 1926, the group sponsored a national Negro History Week during the second week of February to coincide with Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass' birthdays. Nationwide, schools and communities joined in and organized local celebrations, established history clubs and hosted performances and lectures.\n\nThese celebrations continued for decades, and by the late 1960s, thanks to the Civil Rights Movement and Black identity awareness, Negro History Week evolved into Black History Month. President Gerald Ford was the first president to recognize Black History Month in 1976.\n\nThough the celebration has a longstanding history in the United States, it is not associated with a federal holiday.\n\nTrump takes on DEI\n\nWhen Trump first entered office in January, he signed numerous Executive Orders which included rescinding orders from the Biden administration that promoted diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, efforts.\n\n\"The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government. The injection of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' (DEI) into our institutions has corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy,\" the order reads.\n\nA number of companies announced rollbacks on DEI efforts in 2024, and that number has grown with several companies joining in Trump's efforts to get rid of DEI. These companies include:\n\nMcDonald's\n\nWalmart\n\nFord\n\nMeta\n\nTarget\n\nAmazon\n\nLowe's\n\nHarley-Davidson\n\nJohn Deere\n\nTractor Supply\n\nTrump's efforts against DEI prompted the city of Baltimore to sue the administration over program cuts. The city filed a lawsuit on Monday, Feb. 3, joining a group of organizations challenging orders which rescinded federal support for DEI efforts.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the city is in trouble as it relies on hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants, many of which could be at risk under the Executive Order.\n\nOther heritage and recognition months\n\nIn the United States, there are seven primary months where people around the country take time to honor and celebrate certain heritages. These months include:\n\nBlack History Month: February\n\nWomen's History Month: March\n\nAsian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month: May\n\nLGBTQ+ Pride Month: June\n\nHispanic Heritage Month: Sept. 15 to Oct. 15\n\nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month: October\n\nNative American Heritage Month: November\n\nAside from Pride Month, the LGBTQ+ community has two other monthlong celebrations which include Bisexual Health Awareness Month in March and LGBTQ+ History Month in October. All other observances for identity recognition take place over either a week or on a single day.\n\nUSA TODAY contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/01/17/mississippi-alabama-honor-robert-e-lee-on-martin-luther-king-day/77724322007/", "title": "Mississippi, Alabama honor Robert E.

Lee\n\nWhen the federal holiday was adopted in the 1980s, Mississippi and Alabama lawmakers opted to add it to an existing holiday honoring Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Many states in the South initially adopted this approach. Most, including Lee's home state of Virginia, have since dropped celebrating Lee, who was born on Jan. 19, 1807.\n\nAttempts to separate the holidays through legislation have failed. Mississippi State Rep. Kabir Karriem, D-Columbus, introduced bills that failed in 2023 and 2024. He submitted a new bill to separate the holidays on Wednesday, Jan. 15.\n\nThe only other state celebrating Robert E. Lee Day and King together is Alabama. Similar bills to separate the celebration of Lee or strike it from the state holiday calendar completely have also failed to pass.\n\nWhat other Confederate holidays are celebrated?\n\nConfederate Memorial Day is still celebrated across the South, though not all places treat it officially and give state workers the day off. In Mississippi, it's an official state holiday on the last Monday in April. In Alabama and Florida, it's on the fourth Monday in April. Alabama treats it as an official holiday. Texas celebrates it as a state holiday on Jan. 19. North and South Carolina celebrate on May 10, but state offices close only in South Carolina. June 3 is when Kentucky and Tennessee honor the dead from the Civil War, and Tennessee calls it Confederate Decoration Day.\n\nAlabama has a state holiday for Confederate President Jefferson Davis on the first Monday in June, but Mississippi pairs it with Memorial Day on the last Monday in May. (He was born June 3, 1808.)\n\nLearn more:Mississippi one of only four states that still celebrates Confederate Memorial Day. Why?\n\nWill I get mail? Will banks be open? Will schools be closed?\n\nMail will not run for MLK Day, and post offices will be closed. UPS also will be closed, and FedEx will have modified FedEx1 service but be open otherwise.\n\nBanks will be closed.\n\nPublic schools usually close. Check your child's school calendar to be sure.\n\nWill flags be half-staff on MLK Day?\n\nU.S. flags are lowered in mourning. President Joe Biden announced Monday, Dec. 30 that all U.S. flags will fly at half-staff for 30 days to honor the death of former President Jimmy Carter. Carter, who was also a former governor of Georgia, died at 100 on Sunday, Dec. 29, at his home in Georgia.\n\nThat's set to end Jan. 28. The length of time flags should be at half-staff after the death of a former president was set in 1954.\n\nPrivate companies and citizens can choose to display flags at half-staff.\n\nTrump complained about the flags being at half-staff on Truth Social.\n\n\"The Democrats are all 'giddy' about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at 'half mast' during my Inauguration,\" Trump said in a post. He used the term for flags being halfway up the mast of a ship, not a flagpole. \"They think it’s so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don’t love our Country, they only think about themselves.\"\n\nPhotos show the flags were at full-staff as of Monday, Jan. 13, at Trump's Florida home, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Speaker Mike Johnson announced that flags at the U.S. Capitol will be flown at full staff for the inauguration.\n\nOn Thursday, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves ordered that flags in Mississippi will be flown at full height Monday for the inauguration.\n\n\"This is a historic day for America, and Mississippi looks forward to celebrating it,” Reeves said in a press release on Thursday. “Our state is excited for Donald J. Trump to be sworn in as president, and we look forward to supporting his America First agenda.

Here's how it could happen", "text": "The hype continues to build for Super Bowl Sunday and the big game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers. Would it be even more fun if the day after the big game was a day off?\n\nThis isn't a new concept. The idea of the Monday after the Super Bowl becoming a national holiday has been around for a while, but it hasn't gathered enough momentum to advance. This year, ice cream treat maker Drumstick is promoting a petition to make post-Super Bowl Monday a national holiday.\n\nSince 2017, Change.org has hosted more than two dozen petitions asking Congress, the president or the NFL to make the Monday after the Super Bowl a national holiday. One suggests moving Presidents Day to the day after the Super Bowl and others suggest no school the day after the game. Some schools have canceled classes the day after the Super Bowl when a local NFL team was involved.\n\n49ers vs. Chiefs preview:Predictions, odds, how to watch Super Bowl 2024\n\nSuper Bowl Monday already an unofficial holiday\n\nSince none of these petitions have paid off, many just unilaterally make the Monday after the Super Bowl a holiday. An estimated 16.1 million employees across the U.S. plan to miss work Monday, Feb. 12, the day after Super Bowl 58 is played, according to a survey of 1,192 Americans, conducted Jan. 10-12, 2024 by The Harris Poll for The Workforce Institute at UKG.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe expected absences – \"Super Bowl flu\" as the workplace management company calls it – are down from last year when 18.8 million employees said they planned to miss work on Monday after the Super Bowl, according to UKG. And in more good news for managers, an estimated 10 million workers have already requested the day off.\n\nAs many as 14.5 million employed U.S. adults have called in sick to work when they weren't actually sick on the Monday after the Super Bowl, the survey found. An estimated 28% of employees say they will be less productive on that day. In the past, outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas has estimated lost productivity from absent and distracted workers on Super Bowl Monday at $6.5 billion.\n\nMore than one-third (37%) of employees said the day after the Super Bowl should be a national holiday. \"It's a national cultural phenomenon, for sure, and it's a day when people are with family and friends and neighbors and groups (and) in bars, for hours. And on the East Coast, in particular, the game ends really late,\" said Chris Todd, CEO if UKG.\n\nSo the next day, \"everyone treats it like a holiday, even though it's not a holiday,\" he said.\n\nGood managers will treat the Monday after the Super Bowl \"like a holiday, even if it's not a holiday,\" and begin discussing \"the impact that's going to have\" on the workplace ahead of time, Todd said.\n\nSome offices may start work a few hours late or allow some to take the day off. \"We actually think if you manage this well, this is an opportunity for businesses to make themselves better … (with) an open conversation with employees about the fact that we all have lives outside of work,\" he said.\n\nSuper Bowl Monday: Ice cream maker starts petition to make it a national holiday\n\nThis year, Drumstick has created its own new Change.org petition to, uh, change things. \"Our vision for the future after every Big Game is a Monday where the whole country hits pause on the grind,\" the petition reads. \"But if we don't speak up, the day after Big Game is just another morning alarm, another day lost to the same ol' routine.\"\n\nSo far, nearly 5,000 have signed the petition. By signing, you can also enter a sweepstakes to win your ideal Monday ever. (Examples: Want to learn to surf? Helicopter over the Grand Canyon? Dogsled in Alaska?)\n\nOnce, you've signed the petition, go to Drumstick’s Instagram and find the #DrumstickMonday sweepstakes post, and comment with your ideal #DrumstickMonday.\n\nWhat would it take to make Super Bowl Monday a holiday?\n\nCongress would have to pass a bill in order to make Super Bowl Monday a reality.\n\nThe last time that happened was in June 2021 when Juneteenth (June 19) become a federal holiday commemorating the symbolic end of slavery in the United States. President Joe Biden signed the bill.\n\nIt was the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created in 1983. Over the years, Congress and the president have enacted 12 federal holidays, including New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Christmas.\n\nFederal holidays, however, are not \"national holidays,\" and only apply to federal employees and the District of Columbia, notes a Congressional Research Service report updated in July 2021. Each state gets to determine its legal holidays, the report states.\n\nFor instance, at least 28 states and the District of Columbia recognized Juneteenth as a public holiday in 2023, according to the Pew Research Center. Some other states may observe the date, but not have a day off.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

One of those holidays falls in February.\n\nWhile there's only one holiday that actually gives people the day off (unless your boss is really cool or super into groundhogs), make sure to mark your calendars so you don't forget to order extra wings and tortilla chips for Super Bowl Sunday or flowers and sweets for someone special on Valentine's Day.\n\nFebruary is also Black History Month.\n\nHere is what to know about this month's important dates.\n\nGroundhog Day:What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather\n\nFebruary's federal holidays\n\nThere's only one federal holiday in February, according to the OPM:\n\nPresident's Day/ George Washington’s Birthday- Monday, Feb. 17\n\nWill banks be closed on President's Day?\n\nPresident's Day is a bank holiday, so some organizations will likely be closed.\n\nThe United States Postal Service, schools, and most banks, like Wells Fargo, Citibank, Bank of America, Truist, and others, will also be closed on Feb. 17.\n\nOther special dates\n\nUnfortunately, the only extra day off in February is President's Day, but here are a few more significant dates:\n\nNational Freedom Day - Saturday, Feb. 1\n\n- Saturday, Feb. 1 Imbolc - Saturday, Feb. 1\n\n- Saturday, Feb. 1 Groundhog Day- Sunday, Feb. 2\n\nSunday, Feb. 2 Superbowl Sunday - Sunday, Feb. 9\n\n- Sunday, Feb. 9 Valentine's Day- Friday, Feb. 14\n\nWhen is Black History Month?\n\nBlack History Month takes place throughout the entire month of February. It starts on Saturday, Feb. 1.\n\nThis year's theme is African Americans and Labor, and \"focuses on the various and profound ways that work andworking of all kinds – free and unfree, skilled, and unskilled, vocational and voluntary – intersect with the collectiveexperiences of Black people,\" according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, ASALH.\n\nWhen is National Freedom Day?\n\nNational Freedom Day kicks off Black History Month on Saturday, Feb. 1, according to Awareness Days.\n\nThe day commemorates the anniversary of Abraham Lincoln signing the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution on Feb. 1, 1865, according to the California African American Museum.\n\nThe amendment abolished \"slavery across the United States and in every territory under its control, except as a criminal punishment,\" the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum stated on its website.\n\nWhile it isn't a federal holiday, the president of the United States can issue a proclamation every year that designates the day as National Freedom Day, according to the United States House of Representatives.\n\nWhen is Imbolc?\n\nImbolc, the Pagan holiday, is celebrated from Saturday, Feb. 1, to Sunday, Feb. 2, at sundown, according to Pacific Lutheran University.\n\nThe holiday, also known as Candlemas, is one of four Cross-Quarter days, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. Though it is debated, some believe ancient Celts used these days to divide the year and reflect the way Earth moved through all four seasons.\n\nIts name, \"Imbolc,\" means \"lambs' milk\" because it marked the start of lambing season, the Almanac states. It also marked the in-between period between the winter solstice and spring equinox.\n\nIt was later celebrated as Candlemas, as churches would light candles on the day to celebrate Jesus Christ being presented to the temple of Jerusalem.\n\nGroundhog Day is derived from the ancient holiday.\n\nWhen is Groundhog Day?\n\nSpeaking of Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil and his other weather-predicting cohorts will let us know if we will have a longer-than-normal winter early in the morning on Sunday, Feb. 2.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl Sunday?\n\nThe Chiefs and Eagles will face each other during the big game on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 9.\n\nSuper Bowl 59 will kick off at 6 p.m. ET in New Orleans.\n\nWhen is Valentine's Day?\n\nValentine's Day is on Friday, February 14!\n\nThe best part is that it falls on the Friday before a long weekend, so make sure to have any dinner reservations, hotel bookings, or flower deliveries squared away before then.\n\nWhen is President's Day/George Washington’s Birthday?\n\nPresident's Day, which is also George Washington’s Birthday, falls on Monday, Feb. 17, making Valentine's Day weekend a long weekend for most.\n\nFebruary 2025 National Days\n\nThere are also some notable National Days in February. They include:\n\nNational Tater Tot Day (Feb. 1)\n\nNational Pizza Day (Feb. 8)\n\nGalentine's Day (Feb. 13)\n\nSingles Awareness Day (Feb. 15)\n\nRandom Acts of Kindness (Feb. 17)\n\nNational Love Your Pet Day (Feb. 20)\n\nNational Margarita Day (Feb. 21)\n\nJulia is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

Frozen waffles and pancakes. Salmon.\n\nAnd let's not forget a popular burger from a top, globally recognized brand temporarily removed from menus because it made some people sick.\n\nThere has been a rash of foodborne illnesses reported of late caused by food products potentially tainted with bacteria such as listeria, salmonella and E. coli bacteria.\n\nPossibly contaminated products have led to investigations by government health agencies, and to the recall of, in some cases millions of pounds, of product by big names in the food and restaurant industries.\n\nMany of the potentially tainted recalled products were distributed nationwide to U.S. food distributors, restaurants and retail stores such as small- and large-scale grocers, according to recall alerts.\n\nRecent foodborne illnesses leading to recalls and certain products include:\n\nWhat are foodborne illnesses?\n\nFoodborne illnesses happen and come from eating contaminated foods, per the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) arm of the the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). People can experience symptoms right away or days or weeks after eating the contaminated food.\n\nSymptoms of foodborne illness are often flu-like, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or fever. The CDC says the symptoms may often go unrecognized as being from a bacteria or other pathogens in food.\n\nNearly 48 million people are sickened each year from a foodborne illness, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die, the CDC estimates.\n\nFollowing these steps from the CDC can help prevent foodborne illnesses:\n\nClean: Wash your hands and surfaces often. Always wash hands after handling uncooked meat, chicken and other poultry, seafood, flour, or eggs. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating, cutting or peeling. After preparing each food item, wash utensils, cutting boards, and countertops with hot, soapy water.\n\nSeparate: don’t cross contaminate. Keep foods that won’t be cooked before they are eaten — such as fresh fruit, salads and deli meats — away from raw meat, poultry and seafood. Use separate cutting boards and plates for raw foods to be cooked and those that are not cooked. Also, make sure you keep raw or marinating meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs away from all other foods in the refrigerator.\n\nCook: Make sure food is heated to a temperature high enough to kill germs. Here are the safe cooking temperatures for a variety of foods:\n\nGround meats, such as beef and pork: 160 degrees.\n\nAll poultry, including ground chicken and turkey: 165 degrees\n\nWhole cuts of beef, veal, lamb, and pork, including fresh ham: 145 degrees plus a three-minute rest before carving or eating.\n\nFish with fins: 145 degrees or until the flesh is opaque and separates easily with a fork.\n\nLeftovers and casseroles: 165 degrees.\n\nChill: Refrigerate foods promptly becuse bacteria can mutliply if left at room temperature reaching the \"danger zone\" between 40 degrees and 140 degrees. Foods shouldn't be left out more than two hours or one hour if the temperature is above 90 degrees. Your refrigerator's temperature should be at 40 degrees or below and the freezer at zero degrees or below.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of E. coli?\n\nWhile there are several strains of E. coli, the bacteria strain causing the multistate outbreak of infections related to the Quarter Pounder is listed as E. coli O157:H7.\n\nSymptoms of this strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157:H7 according to the CDC include:\n\nDiarrhea and a fever higher than 102 degrees.\n\nDiarrhea for more than three days that is not improving\n\nBloody diarrhea\n\nSo much vomiting that you cannot keep liquids down\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infections usually start three to four days after swallowing the bacteria and most people recover without treatment after five to seven days.\n\nThe CDC says some people may develop serious kidney problems called hemolytic uremic syndrome or HUS, a type of kidney failure.\n\nWho is at increased risk of E. coli infection?\n\nAt increased risk for E. coli infection, according to the CDC, include:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/28/food-recalls-listeria-2024/75822582007/", "title": "From frozen waffles to meat, recalls are popping up everywhere", "text": "(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nMcDonald's burgers. Eggs. Green onions. Frozen waffles. The list of recalled food products in recent weeks has American consumers worried about the safety of their food.\n\nThe products have been recalled because of concerns over harmful bacteria that may be present. In some cases, the recalls were precautionary, but illnesses and even deaths have been linked to the outbreaks.\n\nSince a massive recall of Boar's Head deli meat revealed serious violations of health and safety regulations at one of its plants, new recalls seem to be in the headlines every day. But experts have said people should not be overly concerned.\n\nThough it's always a tragedy when an outbreak causes illness and death, the U.S. food supply is still very safe, said Martin Bucknavage, a food safety specialist at the Pennsylvania State University Department of Food Science.\n\n\"Certainly when these issues come up … we all get worried about our food supply, but our food supply is generally safe across the board,\" Bucknavage told USA TODAY.\n\nHere's what to know about food recalls and bacteria outbreaks:\n\nWhat foods have been recalled?\n\nIn recent months, a slew of companies issued recalls after possible links to listeria and foodborne illnesses.\n\nThe most extreme case is a deadly listeria outbreak within Boar's Head deli meat linked to a single Virginia plant that was first reported in July. As of late September, 59 people had been hospitalized and at least 10 had died in cases linked to Boar's Head.\n\nSince then, other recalls has caused alarm among American consumers.\n\nThis month, the TreeHouse Foods company issued a voluntary recall on its frozen waffles and pancakes after discovering potential listeria contamination, though no reports of illness have been linked to the products.\n\nGreen onions linked to potential salmonella contamination were recalled after being sold in several U.S. and Canadian stores, including Trader Joe's. No illnesses have been reported. Another listeria concern prompted the manufacturer BrucePac to recall millions of pounds of meat in prepared packaged foods.\n\nCostco announced a recall of products that include meat connected to the BrucePac recall. Some of Costco's recalled foods include Rana Chicken Truffle Carbonara and Tagliatelle Grilled White Chicken & Portabello Mushroom Sauce.\n\nMcDonald's Quarter Pounders sold across 10 states have been linked to an outbreak of yet another bacteria, E. coli. One person died and dozens were reported sick, sometimes requiring hospitalization.\n\nEven a brand of pet food recalled some of its products last month over listeria concerns in what it said was a precautionary move.\n\nAvoiding tainted food:A full list of listeria cases and recalls in the US\n\nHow does harmful bacteria get into our food?\n\nListeria, E. coli and salmonella are some of the more common bacteria that prompt food recalls in the U.S. These bacteria \"find those little, tiny gaps in our system and seem to take advantage of that,\" Bucknavage said.\n\nListeria can be a concern at processing facilities and can get a foothold into packaged products when one little piece of equipment isn't properly cleaned, he said. It survives at refrigeration temperature, and only a small amount of it can cause illness. This can happen after products are already cooked to safe temperatures but can still become contaminated before they make their way into packaging.\n\n\"You have to keep a clean facility – a really, really clean facility. And then you have to verify that facility's clean through environmental monitoring,\" Bucknavage said.\n\nTaking care:75 people got E. coli after eating at McDonald's: How can you avoid it?\n\nE. coli enters food products a little differently. It's primarily carried in the poop of cows, goats and other animals and can get into the water that's used to irrigate crops or in improperly treated compost used to fertilize produce. With E. coli, a little contamination goes a long way. In the McDonald's case, the FDA said the culprit was most likely slivered onions from a particular supplier.\n\nSalmonella, found in the guts of animals and people alike, also can contaminate produce through irrigation. It can be transmitted through raw eggs and meat or in unpasteurized milk.\n\nWhat symptoms you should look out for\n\nPoisoning from harmful bacteria can cause a range of symptoms, which may be mild for many people but can be severe and dangerous especially in older adults, younger children, pregnant people or those with conditions that weaken their immune systems.\n\nListeriosis, poisoning from Listeria monocytogenes, can involve fever, muscle aches, tiredness, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures. It also can cause complications in pregnancy.\n\nSalmonella can cause diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps and sometimes infections that lead to severe disease.\n\nE. coli symptoms include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, bloody stool and dehydration.\n\nUsually, symptoms for all three don't begin instantly after eating a contaminated food. It could take several hours, days or even weeks after consuming the food for symptoms to appear.\n\nWhy are there so many recalls?\n\nPart of the reason we may be seeing so much buzz about food recalls is because of the increased attention the Boar's Head outbreak drew to food safety, Bucknavage said. Though there has been an increase in food recalls in recent weeks, it doesn't represent a particularly extraordinary level of incidents compared with other recent years, he said.\n\nAnd the outbreaks and recalls are not linked, Bucknavage said. \"It's more coincidental than anything\" that the recalls happened so close to one another, he said.\n\n\"It's an unusual thing, but certainly not … an indication that our food supply is getting worse,\" he said.\n\nOur ability to detect outbreaks and trace them back to their source also has improved remarkably, Bucknavage said. And the U.S. has one of the safest food supplies in the world, he said.\n\n\"Just because we have the ability to see disease, that doesn't mean that this disease doesn't happen in other countries. We are just further along in that technological ability to find and track and identify these types of issues compared to other places.\"\n\nCompliance with regulations is a big factor in outbreaks like the one within Boar's Head, experts say. The Department of Agriculture's inspector general has launched an investigation into how the agency responded to reports of noncompliance at the plant linked to the listeria outbreak. Inspection reports over the past year revealed insects, mold and mildew at the facility.\n\n\"At issue, always, is what is called a culture of food safety. This means that everyone who comes in contact with a food during production and distribution does what is necessary to keep food safe and cares that it is safe,\" said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University.\n\n\"Understand: All foods are supposed to be produced under safety plans which, if followed, should reduce risks to near zero. These plans must be designed well but also followed diligently,\" she said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nRecalls 101:How the chicken and salad mix get pulled from the shelves\n\nShould you be worried about your food?\n\nFor the most part, you shouldn't be too worried about the food you eat. You should check your fridge and freezer to see if you have any of the recalled products and throw them away if you do. (The FDA and the Department of Agriculture keep updated lists of recalls and warnings.)\n\nThere are common-sense food safety steps you should take in your everyday life to further reduce your risk of contracting any foodborne illnesses, Bucknavage said.\n\nUse a meat thermometer to make sure you are cooking your meat to a safe temperature.\n\nThoroughly wash all kitchen surfaces after handling raw meat.\n\nWash hands as you handle food.\n\nEnsure your refrigerator is keeping food at the proper temperature using a thermometer.\n\nUse or dispose of food in a timely manner to avoid consuming spoiled products.\n\nTainted food history:How we got today's recall system", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/12/23/food-recalls-2024-boars-head-mcdonalds-cucumbers/77175454007/", "title": "Biggest 2024 food recalls: Boar's Head, McDonald's and more", "text": "2024 has been a year of rapidly cycling headlines - between the major pop culture moments and historic presidential election, however, there was one recurring theme: food recalls.\n\nFrom Boar's Head and McDonald's to cucumbers and carrots, outbreaks of illnesses caused by E. coli, listeria and salmonella have been the primary cause of the recurring recalls, some of which resulted in hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nWhile it may seem food recalls are on a dramatic uphill slope, data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration shows no major uptick. Instead, it seems more likely that the public and health officials are simply paying more attention and getting better at identifying outbreaks quickly with advancing technology and improving testing methods.\n\nWith a new recall seemingly every week, however, it can be difficult for the average consumer to keep up with the onslaught of food safety alerts. Here's a look back at some of the largest food-related recalls of 2024.\n\nBoar's Head\n\nIn one of the most high-profile food recall cases of the last decade, a deadly listeria outbreak attributed to Boar's Head cold cuts, specifically its liverwurst, resulted in several deaths this summer.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFirst reported on July 19 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the outbreak ultimately resulted in the recall of roughly 7.2 million pounds of product by Boar's Head. The company later blamed the outbreak on its liverwurst, which it has since discontinued.\n\nAll told, the outbreak made 61 known people ill across 19 states, resulting in 60 hospitalizations and 10 deaths. It also led to the closure of the Jarratt, Virginia facility in which the recalled meat was produced, leaving roughly 500 workers without jobs.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture inspection records obtained by USA TODAY and other outlets later showed more than 60 reports of \"noncompliance\" at the Jarratt, Virginia plant including reports of insects and green mold, as well as mildew, dripping and standing water and other unsanitary conditions within the plant in the years leading up to the July recall.\n\nThe fallout has been wide-reaching, though the outbreak itself was declared \"over\" by the CDC in November. A USDA investigation into the agency's handling of the situation is ongoing and several lawsuits remain underway.\n\nHolocaust survivor dies in outbreak:His dad died from listeria tied to Boar’s Head meat. He needed to share his story.\n\nSlivered onions used on McDonald's Quarter Pounders\n\nAn onion recall initiated due to possible E. coli contamination made headlines this fall after being linked to McDonald's burgers.\n\nThe E. coli outbreak was attributed to raw slivered onions served on Quarter Pounder burgers, which the chain temporarily pulled from some of its menus. McDonald's previously told USA TODAY that Taylor Farms had supplied onions to McDonald's in the areas impacted by E. coli illnesses, and US Foods, to whom Taylor Farms is a third-party supplier, issued a recall on raw diced, peeled and whole peeled onions produced by the company on Oct. 22. However, the recalled Taylor Farms Colorado onions were not related to the company's removal of Quarter Pounders, the company said.\n\nThe outbreak was declared \"over\" by the CDC and FDA on Dec. 3, having caused 104 illnesses across 14 states, including 34 hospitalizations and one death in Colorado.\n\nMcDonald's has since \"identified an alternate supplier for the approximately 900 restaurants that had temporarily stopped serving Quarter Pounder burgers with slivered onions.\"\n\nIs it safe to eat McDonald'sQuarter Pounders linked to E. coli outbreak has some worried\n\nDairy products\n\nIn one of the first recalls of 2024, Rizo-López Foods of Modesto, Calif. recalled about four dozen dairy products for possible contamination with listeria.\n\nThe recalled products – including cheese, crema, yogurt and sour cream – were distributed nationwide and sold under brand names including 365 Whole Foods Market, Don Francisco and Tio Francisco.\n\nThe FDA and CDC began investigating in January 2024 after the Hawaii State Department of Health reported it had found a sample of Rizo Bros Aged Cotija that tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Officials said this amounts to a multi-year multistate investigation because of previous listeria outbreaks connected to Rizo-López Foods in 2021 and 2017, with cases dating back to 2014.\n\nThe CDC and FDA reopened the investigation in January 2024 after the cheese sample showed that it was the same strain of listeria that caused illnesses in the earlier outbreaks.\n\nThe CDC declared the outbreak over in April, having resulted in 26 illnesses with 2 deaths and 23 hospitalizations in 11 states.\n\nBrucePac meats\n\nReady-to-eat meat producer BrucePac issued a recall in October for what ultimately amounted to 11.8 million pounds of product for listeria concerns.\n\nThe meat and poultry were used in frozen and ready-to-eat items across hundreds of brands, distributors and products, leading the USDA to release a 400-plus page list of recalled items.\n\nThe recall impacted not only well-known brands like Fresh Express, Udi's, Dole and Amazon Fresh, but popular grocery suppliers as well, including Walmart, Kroger and Trader Joe's. The USDA later released a preliminary list of roughly 200 schools across at least 17 states that received products included in the recall.\n\nThe outbreak is still listed as \"active\" by the USDA, though the last update was released on Oct. 17. There have been no confirmed reports of illness related to this recall.\n\nCucumbers\n\nA cucumber recall linked to a salmonella outbreak that has sickened 100 people across 23 states since October is still ongoing, according to a Dec. 19 FDA statement.\n\nAs of the most recent update, 100 people across 23 states were infected with the outbreak strain of salmonella, resulting in 25 hospitalizations. No deaths were reported.\n\nIn November, Arizona company SunFed Produce recalled cucumbers sold Oct. 12 through Nov. 26 in more than two dozen states – including at some Walmart, Wegmans, and Albertsons stores – and in parts of Canada. Costco and Kroger also recently notified customers they sold some of the recalled cucumbers.\n\nSince the initial recall, the FDA has issued several updates adding additional brands subject to the recall, including Crazy Fresh, Quick & Easy and Sprouts Farmers Market, among others.\n\nGrimmway Farms carrots\n\nCalifornia-based produce company Grimmway Farms grappled with E. coli concerns after issuing a recall for multiple sizes and brands of bagged organic baby and whole carrots on Nov. 16.\n\nThe CDC declared the outbreak officially \"over\" on Dec. 18, reporting a total of 48 illnesses across 19 states, including 20 hospitalizations and one death in California.\n\nThe carrots were distributed and sold under a handful of brands, including Trader Joe's, Wholesome Pantry, Cal-Organic, 365 and more.\n\nWolverine Packing Co.\n\nDetroit-based meat manufacturer Wolverine Packing Co. recalled about 67,200 pounds of fresh and frozen ground beef products for E. Coli concerns in November after illnesses were reported by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.\n\nWhile the products were distributed to restaurants nationwide, 15 cases of E. coli poisoning were identified in just Minnesota, with illness onset dates ranging from Nov. 2-10, said the USDA. No deaths were reported.\n\nThe recall covered over 100 raw fresh and frozen ground beef products. Products were sold under other brand names in addition to Wolverine Packing Co., including 1855 Beef, Davis Creek Meals, Farmer's Choice, Heritage Restaurant Brands and Cheney Brothers, Inc., according to a list of labels released by the USDA.\n\nFrozen waffles\n\nPerhaps one of the more unexpected recalls of the year, TreeHouse Foods issued a voluntary recall of its frozen waffle products in October due to potential listeria contamination.\n\nThe waffles were sold across brands like Best Choice, Kodiak Cakes and Good & Gather, and at several stores including Dollar General, Publix, Stop & Shop, Target and Walmart.\n\nTreeHouse Foods told USA TODAY that the issue was found at one of their manufacturing facilities. There have been no confirmed reports of illness linked to the recalled products to date.\n\nEggs\n\nA salmonella outbreak was linked to eggs in September, resulting in 65 people becoming infected across nine states. The illnesses started in May and hospitalized 24 people.\n\nAccording to the FDA and CDC, impacted eggs were supplied to retailers across Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan by Milo's Poultry Farms LLC. The eggs were labeled with Milo's Poultry Farms or Tony's Fresh Market. No deaths were reported.\n\nCinnamon\n\nThe FDA issued recalls in 2024 for several brands of cinnamon due to the presence of the toxic heavy metal and other \"possible health risks.\"\n\nA September Consumer Reports analysis identified 12 brands whose cinnamon and multi-spice powders contained such high traces of lead that a quarter of a teaspoon of any of the products would exceed an individual's daily consumption threshold.\n\nGround cinnamon sold by U.S. discount retailers including Dollar Tree and Family Dollar was also found to be contaminated with lead, the FDA said in March.\n\nYu Shang Food Inc. Ready-to-Eat Meat and Poultry\n\nOn Nov. 9, Yu Shang Food issued an initial recall of 4,589 pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products for listeria concerns. On Nov. 21, the recall expanded to include a total of 72,240 pounds, including all Yu Shang Food, Inc. products made before Oct. 28, 2024.\n\nRecalled products included all those labeled with Yu Shang Food, including Yushang Brand Cooked Chicken, Seasoned Pork Hock, Japanese Chashu Pork Belly and more.\n\nIn a Dec. 5 update, the CDC said a total of 19 people became ill across eight states, including 17 hospitalizations and two deaths.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/08/28/boars-head-listeria-outbreak-new-deaths/74985350007/", "title": "Boar's Head listeria outbreak linked to 6 new deaths, hospitalizations", "text": "Six more deaths and 14 new hospitalizations have been reported as a result of the Boar's Head multi-state listeria outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control said Wednesday.\n\nListeriosis infections from the recalled deli meat have caused at least 57 hospitalizations, including nine deaths, across 18 states since the CDC investigation began on July 19, according to health officials.\n\nThese numbers are up from an Aug. 8 report which counted 43 hospitalizations, including three deaths, across 13 states.\n\nOf the six new deaths, one occurred in Florida, one in Tennessee, one in New Mexico, one in New York and two in South Carolina.

In 1990, the popularity of the baby carrot disrupted the produce industry and became trendy for consumers who desired value-added vegetables and healthy snacking, according to the grower. From 1991 to 2001, the bio reads, Grimmway Farms acquired several brands to expand its carrot and produce empire.\n\nWith additional processing facilities now in Washington and Georgia, as of 2023, Grimmway Farms produces more than 135 seasonal and year-round products distributed worldwide, according to the grower. All of the company's produce is now grown in the U.S. and distributed to distribution centers, not directly to stores, Dana Brennan, Grimmway's vice president of external affairs and corporate responsibility, told USA TODAY in 2021.\n\nThe company has issued recalls previously, most recently in 2021 when select carrot products were possibly contaminated with salmonella. No illnesses were reported during this recall, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\"The recall was initiated as a result of a routine, internal company test,\" Huckaby said in July 2021. “The health of our customers and the integrity of our products are our highest priorities, and we will continue to monitor and communicate as additional information is available.”\n\nThe recall news to know: Start your day with USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nWhat Grimmway Farms carrots are being recalled?\n\nWhile the affected Grimmway Farms bagged organic baby and whole carrots are likely no longer being sold in stores, they could still be in peoples' homes and refrigerators.\n\nAccording to Grimmway Farms' release, the recalled products were shipped directly to retail distribution centers nationwide in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Canada.

After a pandemic lull, the number of recalls across the country have been surging back to pre-2020 levels.\n\nFood recalls jumped nationwide last year by more than a third over the year prior, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 50 million Americans become sick every year from contaminated food or beverages. Of those, 128,000 end up in the hospital and 3,000 die each year across the country.\n\nNow, just last month, millions of pounds of meat were pulled off grocery store shelves nationwide, including in Wisconsin, over listeria concerns. Dozens more are sick after a salmonella outbreak was linked to eggs from a Wisconsin farm. Other stores are recalling everything from frozen waffles to onions after reports of illness.\n\nAre food recalls increasing in Wisconsin?\n\nFood recalls are reaching pre-pandemic levels again, but so far, there isn't evidence to suggest we're seeing a \"huge uptick\" this year, according to Adam Brock, division administrator of food and recreational safety for the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.\n\n\"In the 2020 and 2021 timeframe, maybe early 2022, you saw a dip simply because there weren't as many inspections. We were staying away from the [food] plants,\" Brock said.\n\nAccording to the USDA — which specifically regulates meat, poultry, and some fish and egg products — the number of recalls for these products dropped from 124 recalls nationwide in 2019 to just 31 in 2020.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the U.S. saw 47 and 45 meat recalls, respectively. Last year, however, the number jumped back up to 65 recalls or four million pounds of meat. And this year, the Boar's Head and BrucePac recalls alone have pulled more than 17 millions pounds of meat off shelves over listeria concerns.\n\nWhen it comes to the recent meat recalls, Brock said issues with a single product at a large food processing facility can often expand to millions of pounds of product.\n\n\"A lot of these facilities are producing multiple products on multiple product lines,\" he said. \"If there's contamination of one product, it can impact another product.”\n\nHow many people have died from from listeria outbreaks in the U.S.?\n\nThe above map shows the number of deaths recorded as of Nov. 15 connected to various listeria outbreaks in the United States. So far, no deaths have been connected to such outbreaks in Wisconsin.\n\nTop food-borne causes of hospitalizations and death in the U.S.:\n\nTop five causes of food-borne related hospitalizations include: Salmonella, Norovirus, Campylobacter, Toxoplasma gondii and E. coli 0157.\n\nAdditionally, the top five causes of food-borne related deaths in the U.S. include: Salmonella, Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria, Norovirus and Campylobacter.\n\nWhat can consumers do to protect against food-borne illness?\n\nConsumers should observe good food safety practices in order to protect themselves against food-borne illness. Health experts recommend getting a refrigerator thermometer and making sure the temperature is 40 degrees or lower. \"The colder the temperature, the longer the food will last safely,\" wrote Kathleen Glass, associate director of the Food Research Institute at University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nTo ensure food is cooked properly, use a meat thermometer and cook to the proper temperature. Even if the raw meat was contaminated, proper cooking will help reduce the risk of illness.\n\n\"I don't eat rare hamburgers or 'Cannibal sandwiches' anymore. I know that is sacrilegious to hear from a Wisconsinite, but the consequences with E. coli 0157:H7 are too high for me to take the chance,\" wrote Glass.\n\nWhile cooking, avoid cross contamination by washing hands and surfaces frequently, especially after contact with raw meats and produce. To store foods, chill cooked foods to 40 degrees in two hours.\n\nThose who are immunocompromised, older than 65 years-old or pregnant should avoid high risk foods, such as meats sliced in a deli, soft cheese, raw sprouts, cut melon and raw milk.\n\nAdditionally, health experts recommend checking labels on pre-packaged foods \"Personally, if I have the choice for a deli meat that has an ingredient such as vinegar, cultured sugar, potassium lactate, sodium diacetate and sodium nitrite, vs. preservative free, I will choose the preservative route all the time,\" wrote Glass.\n\nWhat is President-elect Donald Trump's food policy?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has selected vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be in charge of the country's public health agencies if confirmed as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. \"He wants to do some things and we’re going to let him go to it,” Trump said in his Election Day victory speech. \"Go have a good time, Bobby.\"\n\nKennedy has previously spread unfounded claims about a link between childhood vaccines and autism, proposed the removal of fluoride from drinking water, and advocated for reducing certain chemical preservatives in foods.\n\nWhen it comes to preservatives, which are used to prevent the decomposition of a food and minimize foodborne illness sick, Brock, the Wisconsin DATCP administrator, said any policy reform would require careful consideration. In some cases, food products are treated with a litany of chemical preservatives that can likely be reduced. But in other cases, he said, the preservatives can be natural ingredients, such as salt, and are key to upholding the shelf life and taste of a product.\n\n“I don't disagree that there are improvements that could be made, but it's not as simple as saying we're going to take out all colors and preservatives because then you have product that you can't ship anywhere,\" Brock said. \"Product would spoil before it got there.”\n\nOngoing food recalls in Wisconsin:\n\nYou can find an updated list of ongoing food recalls in Wisconsin, visit the Wisconsin Health Department website to see ongoing outbreaks, recalls and investigations in the state.\n\nFor a list of national food recalls, you can visit the FDA's website here.\n\nRELATED:FDA issues recalls on these 6 food items sold in Wisconsin in August, see which ones", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/12/31/raw-pet-food-sales-are-soaring-despite-risk-of-bird-flu-salmonella-disease/77331150007/", "title": "Raw pet food sales are soaring despite threat of bird flu, disease", "text": "Duck necks as pink as a set of gums.

In recent weeks, at least three house cats died after eating raw foods contaminated with bird flu: one in Oregon fed raw turkey and two in California given raw milk.\n\nYet raw pet food has grown into a $3 billion industry in the U.S.\n\n\"Knowing how popular raw food diets are in California, I really haven't been surprised by these cases, I was just waiting for these to happen,\" said Dr. Jane Sykes, a veterinarian at the University of California, Davis. \"If this virus continues to spread, I'm sure we’ll see a lot more cases. I expect a lot of cases are not getting diagnosed.\"\n\nWhy raw pet food?\n\nSykes has charted the rising popularity of raw food diets at the UC Davis clinic. Raw food diets began becoming popular around 10 years ago and took off during the pandemic, she said.\n\n\"People want to care for their pets like they would for their kids or their family members,\" Sykes said. With dogs, the idea is to take them back to the less processed diet of a non-domesticated wild animal.\n\n\"And they think cats are natural predators eating other animals so it's natural for them to be eating these types of food. But you know domestic cats are not really wild cats any more, they’re very different genetically, they've evolved and probably their diets have evolved as well.\"\n\nBut the risk of food-borne illness in a raw food diet is so severe, Sykes said, that veterinarians at the UC Davis clinic began labeling which pet patients are on raw food diets in recent years. Those pets are handled with extra care for fear of diseases including salmonella and E. coli, which can be transmitted to humans and other animals.\n\nCats keep catching bird flu:Is your cat safe?\n\nCompanies tout benefits of raw pet food\n\nRaw pet food companies, for their part, promise unpasteurized foods offer various health benefits.

Benefits of a raw diet, according to the company, include healthy teeth, shinier skin and coat and increased mobility in older animals.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nRaw pet food contamination fuels multiple recalls\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration studies dating back to 2012 have found that raw pet foods are far more likely to carry disease. The FDA's list of recalls and withdrawals includes at least 10 recalls due to contaminated raw pet foods since 2018.\n\nPet food company Viva Raw LLC of North Carolina recalled a range of raw turkey and beef products earlier this year due to potential listeria contamination. Listeria monocytogenes can cause potentially fatal infections in pets that ingest contaminated foods, according to the FDA. Humans who become infected, either through contact with the pets or leftover foods, could have nausea, vomiting, aches, fever and diarrhea, or more serious and even fatal illnesses.\n\nIn September, Answers Pet Food recalled a line of its beef and chicken products for dogs due to possible listeria and salmonella contaminations, according to the FDA. Salmonella can result in serious symptoms for both pets and pet owners handling the raw food, including diarrhea, vomiting, fever and even fatal illness.\n\nBoth companies said they took action to remedy the risks and food safety is a top priority.\n\nRaw pet food industry grows despite risks\n\nThe industry keeps growing despite recalls and health authority warnings.\n\nMarket research estimated the raw pet food industry in the U.S. was worth $3.1 billion in 2023 and projected it would grow to $8.72 billion by 2032.\n\nThe 'raw food diet' is an online fad.But, can dogs eat raw meat?\n\nResearchers attribute the growth to increased pet ownership, more widespread availability and a push to gain owners' trust and sell them on potential health benefits.\n\n\"There's been heavy marketing to make consumers think that raw food diets are healthier but that’s not necessarily the case,\" Sykes said. \"People genuinely think they're doing the right thing for their pets and don't realize they can be contaminating their animal.\"\n\n‘We are heartbroken’:Bird flu roars through sanctuary in Washington, kills 20 wild cats\n\nBird flu in California\n\nCalifornia Gov.

In recent weeks, at least three house cats died after eating raw foods contaminated with bird flu: one in Oregon fed raw turkey and two in California given raw milk.\n\nYet raw pet food has grown into a $3 billion industry in the U.S.\n\n\"Knowing how popular raw food diets are in California, I really haven't been surprised by these cases, I was just waiting for these to happen,\" said Dr. Jane Sykes, a veterinarian at the University of California, Davis. \"If this virus continues to spread, I'm sure we’ll see a lot more cases. I expect a lot of cases are not getting diagnosed.\"\n\nWhy raw pet food?\n\nSykes has charted the rising popularity of raw food diets at the UC Davis clinic. Raw food diets began becoming popular around 10 years ago and took off during the pandemic, she said.\n\n\"People want to care for their pets like they would for their kids or their family members,\" Sykes said. With dogs, the idea is to take them back to the less processed diet of a nondomesticated wild animal.\n\n\"And they think cats are natural predators eating other animals so it's natural for them to be eating these types of food. But you know domestic cats are not really wild cats any more, they’re very different genetically, they've evolved and probably their diets have evolved as well.\"\n\nBut the risk of food-borne illness in a raw food diet is so severe, Sykes said, that veterinarians at the UC Davis clinic began labeling which pet patients are on raw food diets in recent years. Those pets are handled with extra care for fear of diseases including salmonella and E. coli, which can be transmitted to humans and other animals.\n\nStay healthy: Sign up for USA TODAY's Everyone's Talking newsletter to read more about wellness.\n\nCats keep catching bird flu:Is your cat safe?\n\nCompanies tout benefits of raw pet food\n\nRaw pet food companies, for their part, promise that unpasteurized foods offer various health benefits. They will prepare them, package them and deliver them to your door as part of subscription meal delivery plans that range from $50 a month to more than $200. (Standard kibble is roughly $1-$2 per pound)\n\nThe sourcing of ingredients can read like a Michelin star tasting menu.\n\nNorthwest Naturals, the company that recalled raw turkey that health officials linked to the death of the cat in Oregon, offers free range beef from the Pacific Northwest, shrimp from the Atlantic Ocean and lamb from New Zealand.\n\n“Adding some raw food to a pet’s current diet or switching one meal a day a few times a week can be very beneficial to your pet’s overall health,” the company says on its website. Benefits of a raw diet, according to the company, include healthy teeth, shinier skin and coat and increased mobility in older animals.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRaw pet food contamination fuels multiple recalls\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration studies dating back to 2012 have found that raw pet foods are far more likely to carry disease. The FDA's list of recalls and withdrawals includes at least 10 recalls because of contaminated raw pet foods since 2018.\n\nPet food company Viva Raw LLC of North Carolina recalled a range of raw turkey and beef products earlier this year due to potential listeria contamination. Listeria monocytogenes can cause potentially fatal infections in pets that ingest contaminated foods, according to the FDA. Humans who become infected, either through contact with the pets or leftover foods, could have nausea, vomiting, aches, fever and diarrhea, or more serious and even fatal illnesses.\n\nIn September, Answers Pet Food recalled a line of its beef and chicken products for dogs because of possible listeria and salmonella contaminations, according to the FDA. Salmonella can result in serious symptoms for both pets and pet owners handling the raw food, including diarrhea, vomiting, fever and even fatal illness.\n\nBoth companies said that they took action to remedy the risks and that food safety is a top priority.\n\nRaw pet food industry grows despite risks\n\nThe industry keeps growing despite recalls and health authority warnings.\n\nMarket research estimated the raw pet food industry in the U.S. was worth $3.1 billion in 2023 and projected it would grow to $8.72 billion by 2032.\n\nResearchers attribute the growth to increased pet ownership, more widespread availability and a push to gain owners' trust and sell them on potential health benefits.\n\n\"There's been heavy marketing to make consumers think that raw food diets are healthier, but that’s not necessarily the case,\" Sykes said. \"People genuinely think they're doing the right thing for their pets and don't realize they can be contaminating their animal.\"\n\nThe 'raw food diet' is an online fad.But, can dogs eat raw meat?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/07/02/cucumber-salmonella-outbreak-linked-to-florida-grower/74286181007/", "title": "Salmonella outbreak in cucumbers linked to Florida grower: CDC, FDA", "text": "A multistate investigation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration has identified a Florida grower as a likely source in an outbreak caused by salmonella-tainted cucumbers.\n\nAmidst the monthlong investigation – during which 449 people in 31 states and the District of Columbia have reported salmonella illnesses – salmonella found in untreated canal water used by Bedner Growers, Inc., of Boynton Beach, Florida, matched the strain (Salmonella Braenderup) sickening some in the outbreak, the agencies said.\n\nAdditional salmonella strains were detected in soil and water samples collected at Bedner Growers, said the CDC and FDA, which are continuing its investigation to see if these strains caused illness in people.\n\nBedner Growers, the agencies said, supplies Fresh Start Produce Sales, Inc., of Delray, Florida, which on May 31 issued a recall of cucumbers grown in Florida that had been shipped to 14 states after some tested positive for salmonella.\n\nThere's no ongoing risk to the public because Bedner Growers' growing and harvesting season has ended and there are no cucumbers still in the marketplace, the agencies said, adding that Bedner Growers' produce does not account for all the illnesses reported in the outbreak.\n\nNeed a break?

New data shows ...", "text": "New data estimates the greatest number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender U.S. adults live in the South, confirming findings from recent years.\n\nAcross the country, researchers estimate more than 5% of U.S. adults are LGBTQ+, matching prior LGBTQ+ population data. Young people ages 18-24 are much more likely to identify as LGBTQ+, according to the report from the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles.\n\nThe report, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, found that in 2020 and 2021, there were nearly 14 million LGBTQ+ adults in the U.S. − with some states having noticeably higher percentages of gay and queer residents than others.\n\nEarlier this year, a poll from Gallup found a slightly higher percentage of U.S. adults are LGBTQ+. Overall, multiple polls show that the adult LGBTQ population has been steadily increasing for years.\n\n\"Look at the numbers, more people are coming out younger and people are coming out in places where LGBTQ folks have been less out and visible,\" Cathy Renna, a spokesperson for the National LGBTQ Task Force, told USA TODAY.\n\nBroken down by state, the report shows Washington, D.C., Oregon and Delaware top the list for greatest percentage of gay and queer residents.\n\nThe census, the nation's most well-known population survey, does not gather data on Americans' sexuality or gender identity. In 2021, other, smaller surveys from the bureau began asking those questions of respondents for the first time.\n\nHow many people in the US are LGBTQ?\n\nResearchers at the Williams Institute, a leading national LGBTQ+ population data research group, estimate more than 13.9 million LGBTQ+ adults live in the U.S., representing 5.5% of the population.\n\nEvery year, Gallup also releases results of a poll estimating how many Americans are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.\n\nGallup's last report, which polled a nationally representative group of 10,000 respondents, found 7.2% identified as LGBTQ+. The number was highest among adult Gen Zers, or people born between 1997 and 2012, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nSouth continues to have highest percentage of LGBTQ+ people\n\nThe new data shows nearly 36% of the nation's adult LGBTQ+ population lives in the South, representing more than 5 million people. The number is also an increase from the last data released by the Williams Institute in 2014, showing 35% of the nation's LGBTQ+ population lived in the South.\n\nResearchers defined the South as states spanning from Texas and Oklahoma, to Florida and north through Delaware. Kentucky, West Virginia and Washington, D.C., are included in the grouping.\n\nIn recent years, Southern Republican-led states passed more laws restricting transgender health care, access to school sports and instruction on LGBTQ+ history than any other part of the country.\n\nFor that reason, the South is at the forefront of the national fight for LGBTQ+ rights and equality, Renna said.\n\n\"Despite the backlash and despite challenges we're facing, we're resilient and we're not going anywhere,\" Renna said.\n\nSpeaking from New Orleans, which the National LGBTQ Task Force selected for its next annual conference, Renna said the South is where there's the most at stake for people's lives because it's home to the most people living under the most oppressive laws.\n\n\"This is where a lot of the work really needs to happen,\" she said, adding that her organization chose to host its conference in Louisiana because \"there are so many LGBTQ people here that are underrepresented in media, culture and frankly in the movement.\"\n\nResearchers found that 5.7% of Louisiana's adult population is LGBTQ+, ranking slightly higher than states like New York, California and Illinois.\n\nIn 2021, another LGBTQ+ advocacy group, GLAAD, analyzed Southern media coverage of LGBTQ+ communities and found that dozens of outlets published few or zero substantive stories on LGBTQ+ issues, including HIV/AIDS, during the 18-month period ending in December 2020.\n\nGen Z most likely to be LGBTQ+\n\nGeneration Z, the youngest American generation to include adults, has a much higher percentage of LGBTQ+ members than older generations.\n\nResearchers found that in 2020 and 2021, 15.2% of Gen Z identified as LGBTQ+, representing more than 4.6 million people.\n\nEarlier this year, Gallup found 19.7% of Gen Z − or nearly 1 in 5 − said they were LGBTQ+ in 2022.\n\n\"It's certainly not uncommon for younger people to say they're lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or however else they would identify themselves,\" said Jeff Jones, a researcher at Gallup who has been tracking LGBTQ+ population data since 2012.\n\nWith each passing year, as more Gen Zers enter adulthood, the cohort's LGBTQ+ members also push the entire adult national total higher, Jones said.\n\n\"As more come into adulthood, replacing the older people, the overall number should go up,\" he said.\n\nBisexuals make up majority of LGBTQ+ population\n\nResearchers have long found that bisexual people − people who are attracted to more than one gender − make up more than half of America's LGBTQ+ population.\n\nResearchers at the Williams Institute did not break down data based on sexuality, instead focusing on state-by-state LGBTQ+ populations.\n\nThe most recent data from Gallup found more than 58% of all adult LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. are bisexual.\n\nResearchers in 2019 found that compared with gays and lesbians, bisexuals are far less likely to be out about their sexuality with people they're close to. Some public health professors who study sexuality say biphobia could be playing a role.\n\nWhat states have the most LGBTQ+ people?\n\nThis month's new data from the Williams Institute is the latest batch from the group to rank the states that have the greatest percentage of LGBTQ+ residents.\n\nAs in recent years, Washington, D.C., takes the top spot, with 14.3% of adults identifying with the acronym.\n\nHere are the other top states, and the percentage of adult residents who said they're LGBTQ+:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/us/lgbtq-population-increase-gallup-cec/index.html", "title": "More US adults identify as LGBTQ now than at any time in the past ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore adults in the US say they identify as LGBTQ than they did a decade ago, according to a new Gallup poll, a trend largely propelled by Gen Z adults.\n\nThe percentage of adults who told Gallup they identify as LGBTQ has doubled since 2012, per the polling firm, from 3.5% of Americans then to 7.1% of Americans in 2021.\n\nThe rise can be attributed to Gen Z, according to Gallup – about 21% of adults born between 1997 and 2003 identify as LGBTQ. Meanwhile, 10.5% of millennials, the generation that includes adults born between 1981 and 1996, identify as LGBTQ, per the poll, and the percentages dwindle among the preceding generations.\n\nAmong LGBTQ adults in the US, more than half of them – nearly 57% – said they were bisexual, according to Gallup’s poll. That encompasses about 4% of all US adults. Gallup reported that 20.7% of LGBTQ respondents identified as gay, 13.9% as lesbian and 10% as transgender.\n\nBisexuality is the most common LGBTQ identity among members of Gens Z and X and millennials, Gallup reported, with 15% of all Gen Z adults saying they were bisexual.\n\nThe results are a sign of increasing LGBTQ rights and representation, an expert says\n\nIt makes sense that a greater percentage of Gen Z identifies as LGBTQ compared to older generations, said Sharita Gruberg, vice president of LGBTQI+ Research and Communications Project at the Center for American Progress. Gruberg noted that the world in which the younger generation lives is one where same-sex marriage is legal nationwide, as well as one where awareness and visibility of orientations and identities other than heterosexual and cisgender continues to grow.\n\n“Gen Z has grown up at a time when stigma around LGBTQ identities is on the decline and rights are expanding,” said Gruberg, who was not involved in the poll. “As greater awareness about the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities grows, and as stigma surrounding LGBTQ identity lessens, we’re likely to see more people self-identify as LGBTQ.”\n\nStill, she said, LGBTQ rights aren’t guaranteed for Gen Z. Many states don’t have non-discrimination measures in place for LGBTQ residents, she said, and a 2020 Center for American Progress study found that over half of LGBTQ people hid their relationships to avoid discrimination. The Equality Act, which would ban discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and sex for employment and housing opportunities, among others, hasn’t been passed despite members of Congress for years introducing versions of the legislation.\n\nLast year also saw the largest slate of anti-LGBTQ bills in recent US history, according to the Human Rights Campaign, with more than half of states introducing legislation that targeted LGBTQ residents, particularly transgender minors.

That’s compared to 5.6% four years ago and 3.5% in 2012, the year the national polling agency began measuring sexual orientation and transgender identity.\n\nShould trends continue, the authors said, the share of LGBTQ+ adults in the U.S. will exceed 10% within the next 30 years.\n\nBrandon Robinson, an associate professor and department chair of gender and sexuality studies at the University of California, Riverside, said the growing numbers show that people sense greater societal acceptance and/or support systems for those who identify as LGBTQ+.\n\n\"More people identifying as LGBTQ is often a sign that more people feel safe and/or comfortable to openly claim an LGBTQ identity,\" they said.\n\nThe data is based on telephone surveys with more than 12,000 U.S. adults conducted in 2023. Asked whether they identified as heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or something else, 85.6% of individuals said they identified as straight or heterosexual, while 6.8% declined to respond.\n\nAbout 1 in 8 LGBTQ+ adults are transgender, the poll found.\n\nBisexual adults represented the largest group among LGBTQ+ people, comprising more than 57% of LGBTQ+ individuals and 4.4% of U.S. adults overall. Gays and lesbians each represent just over 1% of U.S. adults, while transgender individuals were slightly less than 1%.\n\nPamela Lannutti, director of the Center for Human Sexuality Studies at Widener University in Chester, Pennsylvania, agreed that greater acceptance and visibility of LGBTQ+ people and their lives have contributed to the rising numbers.\n\n\"It gives me hope that our policies will become even more positive toward LGBTQ+ people, but it is also important to keep in mind that experiences of discrimination and rejection will vary greatly depending on specific life contexts,\" Lannutti said.\n\nWhat does gender-expansive mean?Oklahoma teen's death puts identity in spotlight.\n\nLGBTQ+ representation climbs as youths age into adulthood\n\nThe portion of U.S. adults identifying as LGBTQ+ has climbed in recent years as millennials and members of Generation Z age into adulthood.\n\nMore than one in five Gen Z adults (ages 18 to 26) identifies as LGBTQ+, as do nearly 1 in 10 millennials (ages 27 to 42). The percentage falls to less than 5% of Generation X (ages 43-58), 2% of Baby Boomers (ages 59-77) and 1% of the Silent Generation (78 and older).\n\n\"As younger generations are growing up with more LGBTQ representation and arguably more acceptance of LGBTQ people, it makes sense that they are also more comfortable to openly claim their LGBTQ identity,\" Robinson said.\n\nAbout 8.5% of women identified as LGBTQ+, compared to 4.7% of men. Those differences were more pronounced among younger generations, with the ratio of women to men identifying as LGBTQ+ more than twofold among millennials (12.4% to 5.4%) and almost three times as high among Gen Z (28% to 10.6%).\n\nRobinson said it’s not surprising that more women than men say they are LGBTQ.\n\n“Masculinity is often associated with heterosexuality, so there is often more stigma, or more to lose, for men to identify as LGBTQ,” they said.\n\n'Trend is actually about larger society changing'\n\nThe poll found that bisexuality was the most common form of LGBTQ+ identification among women; men were equally likely to say they were gay or bisexual.\n\nOlder generations of older LGBTQ+ men were most likely to say they were gay.\n\nRobinson said the rising numbers don’t mean that queer desires are on the rise or that more people are transgender. Rather, it’s more about feeling safe to declare one’s identity.\n\n\"This trend is actually about larger society changing and more people feeling comfortable in stating their LGBTQ identity,\" Robinson said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/24/lgbtq-gallup-poll-more-us-adults-identify-lgbtq/4532664001/", "title": "LGBTQ poll: How many people identify as LGBTQ in US? 5.6%, per ...", "text": "A record number of U.S. adults – 5.6% – identify as LGBTQ, an increase propelled by a younger generation staking out its presence in the world, a poll released Wednesday shows.\n\nThe survey by Gallup marks more than a 1 percentage point jump from the last poll in 2017 in which 4.5% of adults identified as LGBTQ.\n\nThe estimated 18 million adults who identify as LGBTQ represent a continued upward trajectory since Gallup started tracking identification in 2012, Gallup senior editor Jeff Jones said.\n\n“It reflects what we are seeing in society and the way society is changing,” he said.\n\nOne of the biggest headlines in the 2020 poll is the emergence of Generation Z adults, those 18 to 23: 1 in 6, or 15.9%, identify as LGBTQ. In each older generation, LGBTQ identification is lower, including 2% or less of respondents born before 1965.\n\nFor the first time, Gallup queried respondents on their precise sexual orientation, rather than a simple yes or no on whether someone identified as LGBTQ, allowing more insight into identity, Jones said.\n\nAmong LGBTQ adults, a majority or 54.6% identify as bisexual, the poll shows. About a quarter, or 24.5%, identify as gay; 11.7% as lesbian; 11.3% as transgender.\n\nGeneration Z again leads the way: 72% who identify as LGBTQ say they are bisexual.\n\nA fight for rights:Progress toward LGBTQ equality 'is a jagged line.' Here's what has changed over the past decade.\n\nThere are gender differences as well:\n\n• Women are more likely than men to identify as LGBTQ (6.4% vs 4.9%.)\n\n• Women are more likely to identify as bisexual than men (4.3% vs 1.8%.)\n\nLGBTQ youths growing up amid a more accepting reality\n\nAdvocates are not surprised to see more young people identifying as LGBTQ. Ineke Mushovic, executive director of the Movement Advancement Project, cites “generational shifts in awareness and acceptance” that have reshaped how LGBTQ youths are embraced by families and peers.\n\n“I have had conversations with many older LGBTQ people who break down in tears when they share their coming-out stories of decades ago – heart-wrenching stories of family rejection, losing parents, losing siblings, losing jobs,” she said. “Older generations grew up during those times when being LGBTQ could land you in jail, or alone or jobless.\n\n\"The younger generations haven’t experienced this level of fear where often being in the closet felt less like a choice and more like a survival mechanism.\"\n\nParents have created environments where young people not only feel safe in coming out – but those on the cusp of adulthood can map futures packed with possibilities, something not seen even a generation ago, she said.\n\nYoung trans people:As Transgender Awareness Week rolls out, youths have a powerful message: We are thriving\n\nLGBTQ representation in communities, media, politics and beyond in recent years is significant, said Cathy Renna, communications director for the National LGBTQ Task Force: “Children are taught prejudice, and when LGBTQ people are part of their lives from the beginning they understand that they can be themselves and are not alone.”\n\nRenna cites a better and “more nuanced” grasp of sexual orientation and gender identity that has enabled LGBTQ youths to celebrate their full selves.\n\n“Young people do not want to check off a box; they want to be able to express themselves authentically and acknowledge all their identities,” she said.\n\nThe poll underlines what a potent force the LGBTQ community is, said Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “Young adults, in particular, feel empowered to publicly claim their identities – a compelling finding and validation for the past generations of LGBTQ advocates who have long fought for full equality.\"\n\nA more hopeful time, but hardships and bias still exist\n\nThe survey comes amid a cautiously optimistic time for the LGBTQ community. President Joe Biden made equality a plank in his campaign, promising an ambitious agenda to advance LGBTQ rights after four years of setbacks and attacks by the previous administration.\n\nBiden has signed executive orders that prohibit workplace discrimination in the federal government based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and he lifted the transgender military ban. And he has pledged to sign the federal Equality Act, recently introduced in the House – which provides sweeping protections in housing, education, credit and services – in his first 100 days if Congress acts.\n\nThe poll numbers give the battle for equality perspective, Mushovic said.\n\n“Less than 20 years ago, just being in a same-sex relationship could be a crime. Now, LGBTQ people can marry the person they love,\" she said. \"And the Supreme Court found, just last year, that it’s not legal to fire someone just for being LGBTQ. So LGBTQ people finally have a little more freedom to be themselves.”\n\nBut much work remains, she said. Violence and bias still lurk in society, Mushovic said, hitting communities such as transgender people of color particularly hard.\n\n“The fact that it’s 2021 and we’re still pushing for the Equality Act, decades after federal non-discrimination protections were originally introduced, shows that our laws need to catch up to the public on these issues,\" she said.\n\n'Incredible courage': 3 who fought the military transgender ban took stands that opened eyes, shaped lives\n\n'Epidemic of violence':HRC counts record number of violent transgender deaths in 2020", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/02/17/record-number-us-adults-identify-lgbtq/6802482001/", "title": "A record 7.1% of US adults now identify as LGBTQ", "text": "The number of U.S. adults who identify as LGBTQ has rocketed to a record 7.1%, and young people are again steering the increase, a poll released Thursday shows.\n\nThe 7.1% is double the percentage from 2012, when Gallup first measured identity, and is up over last year's poll that showed 5.6% of adults identify as LGBTQ. In a 2017 poll, that number was 4.5%.\n\nThe upswing is significant, Gallup senior editor Jeff Jones told USA TODAY.\n\n\"I think it speaks to society changing in terms of acceptance of people with different sexual orientations and gender identities and people’s willingness to identify that way,\" he said.\n\nAnd the trend is likely to continue, Jones said: “It’s not going to be too much longer before (LGBTQ identification) is in double digits in the U.S. population.”\n\nOne of the most striking takeaways of polls in recent years is the wave of younger generations embracing their identity, Jones said. Now those youths are moving into adulthood, meaning more people are entering the 18+ world as LGBTQ.\n\n“That population change is what is driving this,” he said.\n\nAbout 21% of Generation Z Americans – those born from 1997 to 2003 – identified as LGBTQ in this year’s Gallup poll, which was based on aggregated 2021 data.\n\nAmong Millennials – those born from 1981 to 1996 – 10.5% identified as LGBTQ. The numbers dwindled in each older generation.\n\nNearly 1 in 6 Gen Z adults also identifies as bisexual, the poll shows. That number is not surprising and again reflects the dynamic of youths transitioning into adulthood comfortable with their identity and orientation, Jones said.\n\n“They probably never experienced a time where there was discrimination like in the past,” he said.\n\n'SOCIETY IS CHANGING': 5.6% of US adults identify as LGBTQ, poll shows\n\n'Opening up to reflect you'\n\nThe poll results give young people a direct and uplifting message, said Jen Grosshandler, executive director and founder of The GenderCool Project, a youth-led group that works to replace misinformed opinions with real experiences of young people who are transgender and nonbinary.\n\n“America is changing,\" she said. \"It’s opening up to reflect you. You are seen. Keep living your life, and everything else will follow.\"\n\nAs more youths come to grips with their identity at an earlier age, “this is driving societal change, much of which is positive,” she said. “This change, in turn, sends a message to young people that society sees them and welcomes them. One fuels the other.”\n\n'WHO WE ARE, NOT WHAT WE ARE':These trans and nonbinary teens hope their books will enlighten the world during Pride\n\nIncreased visibility can bring 'backlash'\n\nBut the poll results land amid a legislative onslaught against the LGBTQ community, particularly transgender youths. In 2021, at least 100 bills were introduced to block trans youths' participation in sports and at least 40 targeted youths’ gender-affirming medical care, according to the Equality Federation and the Movement Advancement Project, which track state laws.\n\nThis year may be off to a similar troubling start.\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem signed a bill into law this month that bans trans youths from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity. Logan Casey, MAP senior policy researcher, said he is already tracking 220 different bills in 2022 that would negatively impact the LGBTQ community – most focused on schools and curriculums.\n\nWith increased visibility “comes backlash,” said Cathy Renna, communications director for the National LGBTQ Task Force. “But we are not going back and will fight using the best tool we have: our lives and our stories.”\n\nACCEPTANCE SURVEY:More Americans understand LGBTQ people, but visibility has 'double-edged sword', GLAAD report says\n\nIt is not surprising to see poll results showing young people leading the way in staking out their identity despite the blitz of anti-LGBTQ bills, Renna said.\n\n“If anything, this generation is getting more engaged, increasingly with family support,” she said.\n\nThe LGBTQ community and its young people grasp an important concept, Renna said: That harmful legislation can “intersect across so many communities, from ‘don’t say gay bills’ to attacks on reproductive rights and sexual education to book bans,” she said. “Activists and Gen Z are working hard to help the larger culture connect the dots.”\n\n'Finally' data that shows the reality\n\nAnother Gallup Poll released last week also reflects the presence of younger generations. The percentage of LGBTQ adults identifying as single or never married jumped to 53%, up from 50% a year ago.\n\nThe high rate of single adults within the LGBTQ community is a direct result of the number of young people coming out, Gallup says: Slightly more than half of U.S. adults who identify as LGBTQ are under age 30.\n\nPolls that mirror the reality of LGBTQ people in today’s world – particularly youths – are rays of hope, Grosshandler said: “My 15-year old transgender daughter, Chazzie, would sum it up in one word. ‘Finally.’ Finally the data is beginning to reflect what she sees every day she walks the halls of her high school.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/20/genz-lgbtq-identity-bisexual-gallup-survey/79121599007/", "title": "Almost 10% of Americans identify as LGBTQ+, largely bisexual", "text": "Almost 10% of Americans identify as something other than heterosexual, according to more than 14,000 interviews conducted by Gallup over the course of 2024.\n\n\"The number has been increasing over time,\" said Gallup senior editor Jeff Jones. \"When we first asked about it in 2012 it was in the 3% range.\"\n\nNewly released figures for 2024 show it's now 9.3%. The rise is largely driven by younger adults increasingly identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, with the higher numbers of people calling themselves bisexual.\n\n\"I don't think there's a single answer for why,\" said Jody Herman, a senior scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles Williams Institute, which conducts independent research on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy.\n\n\"It's probably a variety of things. Obviously social acceptance has changed over time, as well as awareness and education on LGBTQ identity and existence, which might decrease social taboos keeping older generations from disclosing.\"\n\nThe Gallup numbers are consistent with international surveys in wealthy nations.\n\nIpsos Global polls for 2024 found that in 26 countries, on average 9% of people identified as something other than heterosexual. The high was in the Netherlands, at 14%. The United States was 10%, and the low of 4% was in more socially conservative countries such as Hungary, Japan, Peru, South Africa and South Korea.\n\nBisexuality on the rise\n\nOverall, and especially among younger people, being bisexual is much more acceptable and safe than it once was, said Robyn Ochs, a writer and frequent speaker on sexuality on college campuses.\n\n\"It's a whole different way of being,\" she said. The definition of bisexual that's more common now is acknowledging the potential in oneself to be attracted to people of more than one gender, but not necessarily at the same time or to the same degree, she said.\n\nThere has also been a shift in what that type of identity means, especially among young people.\n\n\"They're using identity words more as adjectives, as descriptions of their experience, rather than as nouns,\" she said. \"In the past you had to pick what you were and then find the 'rule book' – the expectations of how you'd look and act – and embody that. If you're a lesbian, then you cut your hair.\"\n\nAlthough what it means is generally the same, how people name this type of attractional fluidity varies depending on their age and social group. Some call it pansexual and some queer, and some use multiple other terms.\n\n\"The definition is more expansive now and people feel they have the right to claim these terms, in contrast to previous generations,\" Ochs said. \"I can't tell you how many people I've spoken to who are boomers or in the Silent Generation who have said 'I wonder if I were young now, if I would have come to a different identity?\"\n\nYoung people most likely to identify as LGBTQ+\n\nThe highest number of adults to identify as LGBTQ+ are those born between 1997 and 2006. Known as Generation Z, a full 23.1% of them – more than 1 in 5 – call themselves something other than straight.\n\nEach successive older generation has lower rates, with 14.2% of millennials, 5.1% of Generation X, 3.0% of baby boomers and 1.8% of the Silent Generation.\n\nOne reason the number is so high for those ages 18 to 27 is they're much more likely to consider themselves bisexual than are older people. More than half of Gen Z (59%) and millennials (52%) who say they're LGBTQ+ identify as bisexual rather than gay or lesbian.\n\nOlder LGBTQ+ people are much more likely to identify as gay or lesbian.\n\nThese figures are consistent globally. Ipsos polling for 2024 across 26 countries found that 17% of Gen Zers identified as some flavor of non-heterosexual. In comparison, the numbers were 11% for millennials, 6% for Gen Xers and 5% for baby boomers.\n\nWhy are so many more people calling themselves LGBTQ+?\n\nThough no one can say for certain why so many Americans, especially younger Americans, now consider themselves something other than heterosexual, experts suggest several trends are in play.\n\nOne is that cultural norms for what is acceptable have changed significantly in the past decades.\n\n\"Older people who might have been LGBTQ+ didn't want to identify that way, whereas for the younger it's a lot more acceptable. For them to disclose that identity is just not a big deal,\" Gallup's Jones said.\n\nThere's also more information via the internet and many more role models in the media, said Ochs, who is also editor of Bi Women Quarterly.\n\n\"It's also safer than it was in the past,\" she said.\n\nIt's also true that as people enter into long-term relationships, they can come to use the term for that type of relationship.\n\nSo if a woman is married to a man, she eventually might call herself heterosexual even though she might continue to find women attractive.\n\nAnd if she's married to a woman she might end up calling herself a lesbian, even though she still finds men attractive.\n\n\"For a lot of people, you end up in a long-term monogamous relationship and that's the identity you claim,\" Ochs said.\n\nWhether younger generations will continue to identify as something other than heterosexual as they grow older isn't known.\n\nWho identifies as LGBTQ+?\n\nPeople who said they were Democrats or independents were far more likely to say they were LGBTQ+ than people who said they were Republicans. Broken down by political leanings, 14% of Democrats and 11% of independents identify as LGBTQ+ compared with 3% of Republicans.\n\nWhether someone went to college didn't seem to have much effect. Ten percent of people who hadn't graduated from college identified as LGBTQ+, and 9% of college graduates did.\n\nLGBTQ+ identification is highest among people living in cities, at 11%, compared with 10% in suburbs and 7% in rural areas.\n\nWomen were much more likely to say they were something other than straight, mostly because they were more likely than men to say they were bisexual.\n\nTen percent of women said they were something other than straight, while only 6% of men did. That was mostly because women were more likely to say they were bisexual than men.\n\nThe numbers were especially pronounced in the younger generations. Among Gen Zers, 31% of women versus 12% of men called themselves lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans. Among millennials, 18% of women versus 9% of men identified that way, with most of these younger women saying they are bisexual.\n\n\"This is also consistent with other findings,\" UCLA's Herman said.\n\nIt's probably a combination of things, she suggested, including different notions relating to masculinity and femininity in our culture.\n\n\"There could also be a legitimate gender difference in identity,\" she said. \"It's a nature-versus-nurture puzzle that no one's going to solve.\"\n\nOne percent to 2% of U.S. adults identified their gender as nonbinary, which would include transgender. Of that group, about 8 out of 10 also identified as LGBTQ+.\n\nHow were the Gallup numbers determined?\n\nThe numbers Gallup released come from all the telephone surveys it did over the course of 2024. At the end of each survey the Gallup pollster asked demographic questions including age, income, race and sexuality.\n\nLast year, 14,162 American adults were randomly sampled. Gallup first began measuring sexuality as part of demographics in 2012. The poll's margin of error is 1%, meaning differences of 1% in either direction could have happened by chance.\n\nThe question on sexuality is sensitive, and about 7% of people typically decline to answer it. \"For most questions we ask, it's 1 or 2% that don't give an answer,\" Jones said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/02/22/gallup-poll-lgbtq-identification/11309075002/", "title": "Gen Z is driving force among adults identifying as LGBTQ, poll ...", "text": "A total of 7.2% of U.S. adults identify as LGBTQ, and younger generations – particularly those 25 and under – are driving the numbers, according to a poll released Wednesday.\n\nThe Gallup survey of 2022 data also shows that the number of U.S. adults who identified as LGBTQ has more than doubled in a decade: In 2012, Gallup found that 3.5% of U.S. adults said they were LGBTQ. That number surged to 7.1% in 2021 before holding steady last year.\n\nThe fact that the numbers stabilized in 2022 after recent dramatic jumps is not unexpected, Gallup Senior Editor Jeff Jones told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We’ve seen a doubling, representing a total 3.7-point increase in 10 years,\" he said. \"At that rate, in most years we would expect to see rather incremental changes on the order of tenths of a percentage point. If you look at it over time, though, the incremental increases add up to something more substantial.\"\n\nOne of the key takeaways from the annual poll in recent years has been the growing presence of Generation Z in embracing new identities – an indicator Jones says is likely to continue.\n\n“I think the data (is) clear that LGBTQ identification is highest among the younger generations,” Jones told USA TODAY. “I don’t put much stock in year-to-year increases or decreases that are within the margin of error ... but over a longer period of years you’ll see a more definite trend emerge.”\n\nWhat do the poll results show?\n\nFor Generation Z – those born from 1997 to 2004 – 19.7% identified as LGBTQ in the poll, which was based on aggregated data of 10,000 people.\n\nAmong millennials – those born from 1981 to 1996 – 11.2% identified as LGBTQ.\n\nBy comparison, 3.3% of Generation X identified as LGBTQ in 2022; for baby boomers, 2.7%.\n\nCathy Renna, communications director for the National LGBTQ Task Force, says the poll results reflect reality as LGBTQ young people continue to blaze trails. \"Who we are is rooted deeply in us and is something young people – growing up in a culture that has finally been able to tell them that they are aren’t alone, that they are beautiful and perfect exactly as they are – will never turn back from now.\"\n\nCITIES MAKE STRIDES:More cities are excelling at policies on LGBTQ equality even amid hostile legislation, report finds\n\nOther highlights from the poll\n\n• The number of adults who said they were bisexual was also higher in younger generations. About two-thirds of LGBTQ members of Gen Z and 62% of LGBTQ millennials identified as bisexual, according to the survey.\n\n• More than half, 58.2%, of LGBTQ adults identified as bisexual in the poll.\n\n• Gallup for the first time recorded the preferred identity of those who indicated they were something other than lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender: About 1% to 2% of LGBTQ adults identified as queer, pansexual or asexual.\n\n'A PIVOTAL TIME': LGBTQ Task Force enters 50th year fighting blitz of anti-LGBTQ bills\n\nPoll lands as more than 300 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced\n\nThe poll comes at a challenging for the LGBTQ community. The Human Rights Campaign said last week that it is tracking 340 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced in statehouses this year. About 150 of those would restrict the rights of transgender people, the most pieces of legislation targeting the trans community in a single year, the HRC says.\n\nMany of the bills impact young people, from access to gender-affirming health care to the use of bathrooms and other school facilities that align with gender identity.\n\nThe wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation won't change trajectories evidenced in the Gallup poll, Renna said. The number of young adults identifying as LGBTQ are a \"testament to the courage and resilience of our young people and the legacy of so many who have worked to create a world that is more honest, open, loving and accepting of LGBTQ people,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/01/15/groomers-who-most-often-sexually-abuse-children-are-not-lgbtq/69794840007/", "title": "Groomers who most often sexually abuse children are not LGBTQ", "text": "Pat Brothwell\n\nGuest Opinion\n\nLast weekend, I watched “Keep This Between Us” on Hulu, a four-part docuseries initially airing on the Freeform network. According to the show’s news release, the series “exposes an epidemic of widespread grooming —manipulative and coercive behavior by abusers to gain access to potential victims — in U.S. high schools.” It’s a timely topic, as accusations of grooming dominate recent headlines, aimed almost exclusively at LGBTQ people and curricula.\n\nWhat’s notable about this series — and why I wanted to highlight it — is that it examines filmmaker Cheryl Nichol’s experience being groomed by a straight male high school teacher, not the demographic most currently associated with the term “groomer,” but statistically, the demographic most likely to sexually abuse children, a crime that’s rarely meaningfully addressed by pundits or legislatures, even though it’s disgustingly common. Putting the bulk of the blame on the LGBTQ community allows scores of adult groomers to continue their behavior unchecked and puts kids at risk.\n\nThe CDC reports that 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 13 boys in the U.S. experience child sexual abuse. These statistics are appalling when you consider the amount of lip service and rhetoric we devote to “saving children,” and when you consider these statistics are based on reported data, I’d imagine the actual numbers are larger.\n\nI’m not suggesting that LGBTQ adults don’t groom children — I was unfortunately acquainted with a gay guidance counselor who used his position of power to assault minors — but A) being a member of the LGBTQ community is unequivocally not synonymous with grooming, and B) statistically it’s adults who identify as straight who abuse the most children.\n\nMore:Search warrants: Buncombe high school teacher groped, sent nude photos to student\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMore:Former MAHEC psychiatry director accused of child rape appears in Buncombe district court\n\nMore:More Asheville School alumni claim sexual abuse as SBI investigation enters 2nd year\n\nThere just aren’t enough LGBTQ adults living in the United States to perpetrate such a widespread crime. While Gallup reports that Americans consistently overestimate the gay population in the U.S. — American adults estimate that 1 in 4 Americans (23.6%) are gay — just 7.1% of U.S. adults identify as being part of the LGBTQ community. (Now sure, the LGBTQ population is probably larger, as again, stats are only as good as what people will admit to, and plenty of Americans are still closeted and/or coming to terms with their sexuality, but it’s the out and visible LGBTQ population consistently misaligned as “groomers.”)\n\nSecondly, the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network reports that males perpetrate 88% of sexual abuse claims reported to Child Protective Services. Breaking down the 7.1% of LGBTQ Americans further, less than 2% of the population are gay men. The Tucker Carlsons, Laura Ingrams and Ron DeSantises of the world can shout “groomer” at gay people all they want, but the numbers don’t add up.\n\nHow did this narrative start? It’s a pretty widespread tactic. Blame an easily vilified minority for the sins of the majority. It’s been pushed so long it’s even evangelized by the population it hurts the most. Last summer I was introduced to an Instagram account with 175,000 followers by a fellow gay man I met on a dating app (talk about … indoctrination).\n\nThis “groomer” narrative misplaces blame for heinous behavior and has allowed the grooming and abuse of minors to thrive unchecked. If you care about saving kids and ending what I feel comfortable considering an unnamed epidemic, you’ll quit equating the LGBTQ community with child sexual abuse and start examining the many behaviors society has conditioned us to be unproblematic as long as it’s straight people perpetuating them.\n\nLast August, I wrote a piece for the Citizen-Times where I shared how I was cautioned against being open about my sexuality when I worked as a high school teacher. A well-meaning colleague warned it might result in a groomer narrative in the district where I taught, an affluent, conservative part of Pennsylvania that loved touting its family values.\n\nMeanwhile, I had a colleague — a popular, middle-aged straight male teacher — who pretty openly texted female students late at night and on weekends, not about school work, but just to chat. I’m not suggesting anything more than texts happened, but it’s interesting to note how I, a gay man, was counseled to conceal my sexuality while this straight teacher felt very comfortable conducting inappropriate behavior openly, without fear of a besmirching narrative following him.\n\nWe’ve been groomed as a society to focus on a false-grooming narrative, and all that does is protect actual groomers and allow an alarming number of young people to be abused.\n\nPat Brothwell is a former high school teacher, and current writer and marketing professional living and working in Asheville.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/02/lgbtq-representation-government-growing/73884368007/", "title": "LGBTQ representation in government falls short but is growing ...", "text": "Nearly 1,300 elected officials in the U.S. are a part of the LGBTQ community − a number that continues to grow every election cycle but still falls far short of being representative of the LGBTQ community.\n\nAbout 7.6% of U.S. adults now identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or as something other than heterosexual, according to a recent Gallup poll.

Protests. And now, as far-right fundamentalists wield newfound power and influence in West Michigan, Ottawa Impact leader Joe Moss has used his role to signal disapproval of county grantees that support LGBTQ+ individuals and Black residents.\n\nOttawa Impact, an ultraconservative Christian group created in 2021 fueled by outrage over the county and state response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, began publicly railing against the concept of diversity, equity and inclusion as it launched political campaigns for local elected positions.\n\nDEI is a value system that promotes the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups that've been historically underrepresented or subject to discrimination.\n\nMore:Ottawa County a glimpse of what happens when American democracy is consumed by ideology\n\nMore:Did the majority of Ottawa County support Ottawa Impact at the polls? The data says no\n\nOttawa Impact, however, claims concepts like DEI have been commandeered by a left-wing agenda.\n\n“Diversity and inclusion, as traditionally defined, are beautiful words and bring value and richness to our relationships, homes and communities,” according to the group’s website. “However, these words have been co-opted by the progressive left with divisive teachings which are being ushered into our county through the DEI office.”\n\nOI’s founders, Joe Moss and Sylvia Rhodea, targeted county commission seats in 2022, recruiting like-minded candidates who agreed “traditional Republicans” weren’t enforcing true conservative policies.\n\nIts candidates were required to sign a contract saying they recognized the \"Judeo-Christian heritage\" of the United States and \"celebrate America as an exceptional nation blessed by God.”\n\nThey unseated eight Republican incumbents in the August primary — with a county voter turnout at or below 30 percent of registered voters — and won a controlling majority of the 11-member board. (Two later publicly distanced themselves from the group as lawsuits and controversies marked the first four months of the its tenure.)\n\nOn Jan. 3, when they were sworn into office, Ottawa Impact made quick work enacting several controversial changes, including closing the county’s relatively new DEI Office and changing the county’s motto from “Where You Belong” to “Where Freedom Rings.”\n\nThe percentage of U.S. adults who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or something other than heterosexual has increased to about 7.1 percent, according to a 2022 Gallup poll. According to state data, Michigan was home to an estimated 373,000 residents who identify as LGBTQ+ in 2021, about 3.7 percent.\n\nLGBTQ-related issues have dominated headlines in 2023, as an upswell of the religious right has found traction on the issue of transgender identity, particularly among young people — re-energizing supporters and donors.\n\n“We knew we needed to find an issue that the candidates were comfortable talking about,” Terry Schilling, the president of the social conservative advocacy group American Principles Project, told The New York Times in April. “And we threw everything at the wall.”\n\nBooks and the ‘sexualization’ of children\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the inherent danger of books has been hotly debated across West Michigan.\n\nIn November, Moss and Rhodea crafted a 14-page manifesto titled “The Sexualization of Michigan Children in Public Schools.\" In it, they make the argument that “the sexualization of Michigan’s children and the push to eliminate parents from education and medical decisions … has occurred under the strategic influence of activists within Michigan government and special interest groups.”\n\nBy then, Moss and Rhodea were well-versed in protesting school-related issues. Rhodea, a self-described “parental-rights advocate” has been a long-time agitator in Allendale Public Schools, her current district. Moss unsuccessfully sued the county and its commissioners in 2021 over a mask mandate that briefly closed the private Christian school he helped found over repeated noncompliance.\n\nTheir views were shared by residents who started speaking at local school board meetings.\n\nIn 2020, parents in Hamilton were vocal enough in their complaints that the district implemented a new book review system. Last August, the operating millage for Patmos Library in Jamestown Township was voted down over inclusion of books with LGBTQ+ characters and themes, as was a second attempt in November.\n\nWith the operating millage voted down, the library is slated to close permanently in January 2025. The library has said that, out of 67,000 materials in circulation, approximately 90 are LGBTQ-related, or 0.001 percent of the library’s offerings.\n\nMore:Patmos Library millage fails again in Jamestown Township\n\nMore:'All books are worth reading': Ottawa County continues to grapple with banned books\n\nDuring a May 15 meeting of the Zeeland Public Schools Board of Education, more than a dozen public speakers focused on the content of library books, specifically their concerns about sexual content and language.\n\nOne went so far as to say “the devil wants to destroy the identity of our children” and said “parental rights are under attack and being extinguished,” despite the fact that all parents have the right to restrict specific book titles for their children in school libraries.\n\nR. Aimee Chipman, owner of Holland Township's Bluestocking Bookshop, said she was \"horrified\" by the comments.\n\n“For us, it’s important that all books are available to read for all people, because that’s how we learn about the world around us,” Chipman said.\n\n“It’s how we learn things we’re not learning in school, things we’re not learning from families. All books are worth reading and anybody who says they don’t want to read a certain book doesn’t have to read it. It’s not just about the freedom to read, but the freedom to choose not to read.”\n\nChipman said most of the banned and challenged books this year, according to the American Library Association, deal with LGBTQ themes and issues of identity. She said these books are important because they teach empathy and encourage critical thinking.\n\nEmbedded content: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-3ZVyAyHy/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D\n\n“The fact that so many of them deal with LGBTQ and issues of identity tells me these conversations are not being had, they’re being suppressed,” she said. “It's important for not just today’s youth, but for all of us, to be able to read so we’re looking at perspectives of our world that are not our own.”\n\n'Vi coactus'\n\nIn February, the county informed the Holland-based LGBTQ nonprofit Out on the Lakeshore that it was approved to receive $8,000 in grant funding provided by the Michigan Public Health Institute. But the funds never came.\n\nSeveral organizations that should have received funding, in fact, experienced significant delays without explanation. The memorandums of understanding were written and ready, waiting solely on a signature from Moss — who didn't respond to a request for comment on this article.\n\nThe money for OOTL will fund a tabletop gaming program for youth and young adults, said Kate Leighton-Colburn, the organization's executive director.\n\n“It's evidence-based curriculum and therapeutically inclined, but it's not therapy,” Leighton-Colburn said. “It's therapeutic in nature and skills-based. It's providing young people with a space to develop coping mechanisms, explore identity, explore certain facets of life, like failure and success, all through the lens of a tabletop role-playing game.”\n\nShe said such activities are critically important for LGBTQ youth, who often struggle to find support, and not receiving the funds — four months later — is short-changing the community OOTL is trying to serve.\n\n“I'm really focusing on the facts. And the fact that we were promised this money at this time, and the current board of commissioners did not follow through on that promise, for whatever reason,\" she said.\n\nOOTL’s Board Chair Susan Mendoza said the delay has prevented the program from being ready in time to launch for the summer, as the organization planned. She said it’s important for LGBTQ children to have the support they need as they transition from school to home.\n\n“That tends to be one of those places where the most support is needed,” Mendoza said. “Having those skill sets are incredibly important. This particular approach to providing support is innovative, but it's also incredibly accessible to kids.”\n\nMore:Signs of fracture as three commissioners distance themselves from Ottawa Impact\n\nLeighton-Colburn said she worries about the impact of her under-served community.\n\n“It kind of sent us scrambling a little bit, because I want to launch this program, no matter what, whether we see this funding or not. However, it meant shifting some of our priorities to refocus on funding for this program, when really we should have been able to focus on other priorities at that time,” she said.\n\nOn April 27, Leighton-Colburn emailed Moss asking for information on why the funds hadn’t been released.\n\nMoss replied that he was ”waiting on a couple answers from administration and the health department so we can wrap up the process (and answer some questions from the board).\"\n\nOn May 11, Leighton-Colburn emailed all 11 county commissioners asking why her organization still hasn't received funding when 21 other organizations had. She didn't receive a response.\n\nOn Friday, May 19, she was notified that the MOU for her grant was \"signed,\" but Moss didn't use his name. Instead, he signed it \"vi coactus,\" Latin for \"compelled by force\" or \"having been compelled.\"\n\nThe Holland-based 1cor13project, a nonprofit centered on the “health, healing and wholeness of Black people in particular,” according to its website, had also not received its promised funding of $12,500 for a Black doula program as of Friday — aimed at improving health outcomes for pregnant Black women.\n\nMore:‘You are out of order’: Discussion over commission rules gets tense in Ottawa County\n\nMore:Groundbreaking local artist to Ottawa Impact officials: 'I'm more than just gay'\n\nIn 2021, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 69.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, 2.6 times the rate of white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe project's MOU received the same \"vi coactus\" signature from Moss.\n\nBecause he signed the documents, they could still be legally binding.\n\nThe legal defense of claiming duress when signing documents must include:\n\nAn immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury to the actor\n\nA well-grounded fear that someone will carry out the threat\n\nNo reasonable opportunity for escape, except by committing the unlawful act\n\nAttorneys told The Sentinel on Friday the county is an entity, not a person, and can't claim duress. It was unclear as of press time if the county will still distribute the promised funds to the organizations.\n\n“It's curious what organizations were not funded, and the organizations that were,” Mendoza said. “It reinforces perceptions of how minoritized populations will be supported by county government, how they're valued and how they're seen.”\n\nAlthough he's never responded to local media inquiries, Moss has leveraged his position as board chair to make OI’s views known, at one point appearing on a conservative radio show to suggest the Health Officer Adeline Hambley engaged in a cover-up over a sexual health event.\n\nMore:'Integrity matters': Ottawa County denied appeal in Hambley case\n\nMost recently, he and Rhodea championed delaying a decade-old community health survey when they were unsuccessful in trying to remove or alter certain questions.\n\nOn Feb. 21, Hambley — who is currently suing Moss and the board — told commissioners they didn't have authority over the questions.\n\nShe added questions related to sexual orientation and gender identity, which she believed to be sources of concern for commissioners, are necessary for hospitals to understand healthcare needs and health disparities for those populations.\n\nMore:Ottawa Impact's passion for protecting residents could actually be hurting them\n\nMore:Ottawa County approves health assessment funding agreement after lengthy delay\n\nOn May 9, the survey was finally allowed to move forward — but Moss put health department staff on notice to “get way ahead” of the next cycle for the county’s Youth Assessment Survey, as “it sounds like some board members object to some of the questions.”\n\nOn its website, Ottawa Impact says the group does not support, among other things, “a minor’s gender transition, surveys inquiring about a minor’s sexual activities and family beliefs and public or school library books provided to minors containing illicit sexual/sexuality content or graphic violence.”\n\nActivists, officials weigh in\n\nThe anti-LGBTQ rhetoric has spilled over into other local government boards.\n\nOn Monday, protesters showed up to Grand Haven’s meeting to object to the city’s Pride Festival, approved in April and slated for June 10, according to the Grand Haven Tribune.\n\n“I don’t want to subject my family to an event that is sexual in nature and is unsuitable for children that will be taking place in a public place in downtown Grand Haven,” said Grand Haven Township resident Adam Reece.\n\n“Same-sex relationships do not produce life, they do not produce the future generations of Grand Haven,” he continued. “It is sad that the traditions of the families of Grand Haven and the families visiting Grand Haven will be broken this year for an event that has no business being in the public square.”\n\n“We are here tonight in response to a city condoning sin and depravity,” said Jenison resident Marc Edgecombe. “If you are not a Christian — a true follower of Christ — it is unsurprising that you would condone this. This is not a judgmental or bigoted statement on my part. I do not consider myself better than any of you.\n\nSubscribe:Receive unlimited digital access to your local news coverage\n\n“If you profess to be a Christian and stand in support of this event, then what Bible are you reading? I’m not just talking to the council. If you are a church, and a pastor, and have turned your head, then who do you fear more, God or man? Cowardice has one result, and one reward, and that is eternal judgment.”\n\nThe danger of certain books recently came up in Holland, where Councilman Quincy Byrd read excerpts from “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe, and argued the book is “pornographic” and inappropriate for young children — then asked other councilmembers at what age they lost their virginity and went on to read sections discussing masturbation, sex toys and oral sex.\n\n“I know as a council this isn’t something that we have direct control over, but as leaders of this community, as leaders of this great city, we have to do something for our kids,” he said.\n\nByrd also was the lone councilmember to vote against adding LGBTQ protections to the city’s anti-discrimination ordinance, which passed in 2020.\n\nIs excluding LGBTQ people inherently Christian?\n\nKeith Mannes is an ordained pastor in the United Church of Christ and has worked as a chaplain and minister for 35 years.\n\nBrought up in the Christian Reformed Church, Mannes said the current faith view of far-right fundamentalists is more of an embracement of the Old Testament while eschewing the New Testament, which spoke of Jesus’ enduring love and forgiveness.\n\n“In the true story of Jesus, he utterly and clearly rejected political domination as his method for bringing God’s good to the world and for changing the world for the better,” Mannes said.\n\nHe said he's deeply concerned over politicians on the fringe who mix religious fervor with conspiracy theories.\n\n“This kind of religion is a mangling of the life, teaching and example of Jesus,” he said. “We all suffer hellish misery in this world — degradation, brutality, violence and cruelty. Our souls want and need the sheer and simple relief of God’s love and compassion … and Jesus calls us to serve and bless every person, without exception.”\n\nHe said the primary message of Jesus was to defend and protect people who were victims of racism, exclusion and condemnation.\n\nHow did that message change? Mannes said it began early on.\n\n“‘We are God's people. We are sent.’ (That thinking) kind of got into the bones of our forebears here in this country, and then that allowed a justification of slavery,” he said.\n\n\"'We are God's people. We are here to inherit the land.' It was the doctrine of Manifest Destiny that led early settlers in this country to head west and believe that it was their right and duty to cast the pagans out of the land because God said, 'I gave you that land. So go get it, conquer it, kill every man, woman and child. And it's yours because I gave it to you.'\n\n“So when you've got that kind of mindset going: ‘We are God's people. Now we are the new Israel. And so we are here to dominate the world.' When that message gets into your bones … then you can justify a whole lot of human cruelty.”\n\n— Sentinel reporter Mitchell Boatman contributed to this article.

Google later changed the name in its maps and Sheinbaum has already threatened to sue the tech giant in hopes it would reconsider.\n\nIn a press conference Monday, Sheinbaum reiterated her intentions, saying she was waiting for Google's response to her government's latest letter before proceeding with legal action. The second letter reminded Google that maritime zones under the U.S.'s sovereignty extend for a maximum of 12 nautical miles from the coast. She also read out Google's previous response, which stated the map would still read \"Gulf of Mexico\" when users are in Mexico.\n\nRenaming the gulf \"overreaches the power of any national authority or private entity. And, in this case, Mexico's government will proceed to exercise the actions that it deems appropriate according to the law,\" Sheinbaum said in Spanish, which was translated by USA TODAY. \"We are waiting for Google's response, and if not, we will proceed in court.\"\n\nGulf of America?

The surge would include more boats, cutters, aircraft, and specialized forces to increase Coast Guard presence in six locations including the southeast border around Florida. The Coast Guard said it was to prevent mass illegal migration from Haiti and Cuba. Another area would be the southwest border between the U.S. and Mexico in the Pacific.\n\n“Together, in coordination with our Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense teammates, we will detect, deter and interdict illegal migration, drug smuggling and other terrorist or hostile activity before it reaches our border,” said Adm.

In September 2019, after Trump ousted Bolton from his position, he suspended the protection within hours. Bolton was subsequently granted security by former President Joe Biden.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Bolton said he was “disappointed but not surprised” that Trump had decided to terminate the protection.\n\n--Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump defends Jan. 6 pardons, release of Proud Boys, Oath Keepers leaders\n\nPresident Donald Trump defended his sweeping pardons for violent offenders from the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack – and commuting the sentences of Proud Boys and Oath Keepers members – arguing they’ve been treated more unfairly than murderers.\n\n\"Murderers today are not even charged,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “You have murderers that aren't charged all over. You take a look at what's gone on in Philadelphia, take a look at what's gone off in L.A.”\n\nTrump’s claim that people are not charged with homicide in major U.S. cities is false.\n\nTrump added that the Jan. 6 defendants “have already served years in prison,” even though many were only recently sentenced. “And they’ve served them viciously. It's a disgusting prison. It's been horrible. It's inhumane. It's been a terrible, terrible thing.”\n\nAsked about commutations he gave to leaders of the far-right groups Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, Trump said: “I thought their sentences were ridiculous and excessive.”\n\nTrump pardoned more than 1,500 people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack and commuted sentences of 14 others, all members of either the far-right group Proud Boys or Oath Keepers.\n\nThat includes Stewart Rhodes, the former leader of the Oath Keepers, who had received the second-longest sentence of 18 years for his role in the riot. Rhodes left a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, early Tuesday.\n\nRelatives of Enrique Tarrio, former leader of the Proud Boys who received the longest sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy, said they expected his release on Tuesday.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nTrump open to Musk buying TikTok\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he is open to Elon Musk buying TikTok one day after the president issued an executive order that halts enforcement of a ban on the mega-popular video app for 75 days.\n\n“I would be, if he wanted to buy,” Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nMusk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, emerged as a potential buyer days before the application was set to shut down.\n\nThe president said he’s also open to another tech giant to acquire TikTok: Larry Ellison, the chief technology officer of Oracle. Ellison was present at the White House with Trump.\n\n“I have the right to make a deal. So the deal I'm thinking about Larry, let's negotiate in front of the media,” Trump said, adding that he met with the wonders of TikTok and said that the company should sell to someone in the United States and give half to the U.S. government.\n\n“They'll have something that's actually more valuable because they have the ultimate partner, and the United States will make it very worthwhile for them in terms of the permits and everything else,” Trump said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump meets with Republicans at the White House, set to make announcement about infrastructure\n\nDonald Trump is meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune. While the meeting is private, the GOP officials are expected to discuss Trump's top GOP priorities, including implementing mass deportations, hitting foreign countries with tariffs and more.\n\nTrump will speak momentarily about a new infrastructure investment, a bipartisan priority across Washington.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhere's Reagan? White House says website will bring back bios soon.\n\nWhen Donald Trump's team took over the White House website this week, it made quick work of taking down web pages espousing the views of the previous administration.\n\nA silhouette of Trump and a bold-faced \"AMERICA IS BACK\" message appeared on the homepage. New links to presidential statements and remarks appeared along with the text of a mountain of newly signed executive orders.\n\nBut what was missing from the revamped White House website was nearly as noticeable to frequent visitors: pages promoting tourism, equity, internships, and information about former American presidents of both political parties. Bio pages for former U.S. presidents including Republican stalwarts Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan turned up error messages along with those of Democrats Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama, and Bill Clinton.\n\nThe White House indicated the errors were unintended and temporary. \"It's day two. We are in the process of developing, editing and tweaking the White House website. As part of this ongoing work, some of the archived content on the website went dormant. We are committed to reloading that content in a short timeline,\" said principal White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields.\n\n– Francesca Chambers and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMexican president says country will allow 'Remain in Mexico' policy\n\nMexico’s president suggested her country will let migrants wait for asylum hearings in Mexican territory after Donald Trump said he’d reinstate a program known as the “Migrant Protection Protocols.”\n\nOn Tuesday, President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo said Trump’s day-one declaration mimics his 2018 order, with which Mexico complied. The country allowed thousands of asylum-seekers to wait in cities along its northern border for immigration court hearings in the U.S.\n\n“We have our own migration policies,” she said during a news conference. “But we’re also a humanitarian government.”\n\nMexico will consider repatriating some foreign nationals, she said. The program, also called “Remain in Mexico,” was used during the first Trump administration to return nearly 70,000 people to Mexico to await court hearings, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\nSheinbaum Pardo also noted that few migrants are reaching Mexico’s northern border with the U.S. as a result of Mexico’s own immigration enforcement.\n\n– Lauren Villagran\n\nTrump executive order restricts birthright citizenship; states sue\n\nDonald Trump issued an executive order Monday that will end automatic citizenship for children whose parents are foreign nationals, whether they're here legally or not.\n\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of 18 states sued Trump and federal agencies in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, claiming the order violates the Constitution. The ACLU filed a separate legal challenge in New Hampshire on behalf of immigrant advocacy organizations on similar grounds.\n\nIt would, they said, upend a foundational aspect of the United States of America: that anyone born here is from here.\n\nThe executive order, called \"Protecting the Value and Meaning of American Citizenship, would prevent federal agencies from issuing Social Security cards, passports or welfare benefits to U.S.-born children in a sweeping reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States.\n\n– Lauren Villagran\n\n'I got to use it': Donald Trump's evolution from TikTok foe to a fan\n\nDonald Trump says he wants to \"save TikTok.\" But during the final months of his first term as president in 2020, he tried to shut down the wildly popular social media video app.\n\nIt marks a dramatic evolution as Trump begins his second term. His previous administration raised concerns about TikTok sharing personal data with the Chinese government.\n\nBut Trump is now shrugging off the same risks as he's getting hailed as TikTok's savior after seeing its benefits help him connect with young voters en route to winning back the White House.\n\n\"Because I got to use it,\" Trump told reporters Monday during a wide-ranging Oval Office media session when asked why he changed his mind about TikTok. \"And remember, TikTok is largely about kids, young kids. If China is going to get information about young kids, I don't know. To be honest with you, I think we have bigger problems than that.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump says he fired Biden appointees; chef Jose Andres says he resigned\n\nDonald Trump on Tuesday said he plans to remove over 1,000 appointees from the administration of former President Joe Biden and that he had fired four individuals immediately, including celebrity chef Jose Andres and former top general Mark Milley.\n\nHowever, Andres said on social media that his two-year term on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition was already over. The Spanish chef, whose World Central Kitchen food aid program feeds people impacted by disasters, said he submitted his resignation last week.\n\n\"My Presidential Personnel Office is actively in the process of identifying and removing over a thousand Presidential Appointees from the previous Administration, who are not aligned with our vision to Make America Great Again,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social overnight.\n\n\"Let this serve as a notice of dismissal,\" Trump wrote and named Milley, Andres, his former Iran envoy Brian Hook and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who Biden appointed to an export council. \"YOU'RE FIRED!\", he wrote.\n\n– Reuters\n\nElise Stefanik and Democratic senator clash over Israel\n\nAt her confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Elise Stefanik clashed with Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAsked by Van Hollen if she subscribed to Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich's view that Israel has a \"biblical right to the entire West Bank,\" Stefanik said she did.\n\n\"Peace and stability\" in the region would be \"very difficult to achieve...if you continue to hold the view that you just expressed,\" Van Hollen shot back.\n\nPressed by Van Hollen on whether she believes Palestinians have a right to self-determination, Stefanik responded \"I believe the Palestinian people deserve so much better than the failures that they've had.\"\n\nShe added, \"I want to ensure that, number one, we bring the hostages home.\"\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBishop directly asks Trump to have 'mercy' for LGBTQ children, immigrants unlawfully in US\n\nBishop Mariann Edgar Budde directly addressed Donald Trump during a sermon on Tuesday, telling the president sitting in the audience at a prayer service at the National Cathedral \"In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy on people in our country who are scared.\"\n\n\"There are gay, lesbian, transgender children in Democratic, Republican, independent families, some who fear for their lives,\" Budde said. She also reflected on working-class immigrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying: \"They may not be citizens or have proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals.\"\n\n\"I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away, and that you help those who are fleeing war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome here,\" said Budde, who has previously criticized the president.\n\nTrump during all three of his presidential campaigns called for mass deportations and other immigration crackdowns, often using dehumanizing language about immigrants.\n\nHe also often insulted transgender people on the campaign trail, and one of his first orders in office on Monday was that the federal government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, that are not changeable.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nElise Stefanik pushed on Elon Musk's gesture that drew online comparison to Nazi salute\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., pressed Elise Stefanik on a gesture Elon Musk made at a speech on Monday after Donald Trump's inauguration that drew accusations of being a Nazi salute. But Stefanik, who has said combatting antisemitism would be one of her main objectives as U.S. ambassador to the UN, said the gesture was nothing of the kind.\n\n\"No, Elon Musk did not do those salutes,\" she said. \"The American people are smart and they see through it. They support Elon Musk.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League later said the gesture was not a sieg heil, calling it an \"awkward\" move during a \"delicate moment\" in a statement met with some disagreement.\n\nMurphy read several comments from Christian nationalist and white supremacist groups, including the Proud Boys, praising Musk's gesture.\n\n\"I simply don't believe that if a member of the squad made that same gesture last night, that there wouldn't be commentary from you and others,\" he said, referring to the \"squad\" of Progressive Democratic congressmembers.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nElise Stefanik calls UN resolutions aimed at Israel 'antisemitic rot'\n\nElise Stefanik, Donald Trump's pick to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, promised at her confirmation hearing to \"stand with Israel\" and called United Nations resolutions aimed at Israel are \"antisemitic rot.\"\n\n\"I was interested in this position because, if you look at the antisemitic rot within the UN, there are more resolutions targeting Israel than any other country, any other crisis combined,\" she told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The UN has accused Israel of \"extermination\" and possible war crimes in Gaza.\n\nStefanik also touted that she voted to defund UNRWA, the U.N. refugee agency for Palestinians. The agency was the largest humanitarian organization still working in Gaza, until its operational ability in the enclave was hit when Israel banned it in October after around a dozen of its members were found to be on Hamas' payroll or involved in its Oct. 7 attack.\n\nShe praised then-U.S. ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan for opposing a UN resolution passed 50 years ago that classified Zionism as \"a form of racism and racial discrimination\" and said she would hope to embody \"that type of leadership\" in the position.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat's on Trump's schedule today?\n\nTrump is attending a service of prayer for the nation on Tuesday at Washington's National Cathedral, joined by Vice President JD Vance and other dignitaries.\n\nAfterward, he'll meet with congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, before delivering remarks on American infrastructure.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump, Vance attend national prayer service in Washington\n\nDonald Trump and Vice President JD Vance are attending a prayer service at the National Cathedral, alongside their spouses, first lady Melania Trump and second lady Usha Vance.\n\nThe cathedral calls the gathering a \"service for the nation, not any politician or political party.\"\n\n\"This service was designed to pray for unity, reconciliation and bridge-building in our divided nation,\" the cathedral says on its website.\n\nBishop Mariann Edgar Budde is preaching at the service, but it will also feature worship rooted in Jewish, Muslim and other faith traditions.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho is Usha Vance? Here's what to know about the second lady\n\nUsha Vance, 38, is the nation's new second lady, but she's been out of the spotlight more than the first couple or her husband, Vice President JD Vance.\n\nChilukuri, 38, was born and raised in San Diego as a child of Hindu Indian immigrants. She met her husband at Yale Law School when they were assigned as partners for their first major writing assignment.\n\nBefore Usha Vance hit the campaign trail with her husband, she worked at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a law firm that specializes in litigation, corporate, professional liability, employment, financial restructuring, tax and executive compensation. She left the firm when JD Vance secured the vice-presidential nomination.\n\n– Amaris Encinas\n\nTrump's Treasury pick clears critical hurdle\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday gave their stamp of approval to Scott Bessent, Trump's nominee to lead the Treasury Department.\n\nTwo Democrats, Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, joined their Republican colleagues in voting for Bessent.\n\nIf Bessent is confirmed by the entire Senate, he'll be the first openly gay Treasury secretary in U.S. history, as well as the highest-ranking LGBTQ official.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nThe world's richest people attended Trump's inauguration. Here are their net worths\n\nSome of the richest people in the world were among the guests invited to witness President Donald Trump take the oath of office for the second time on Monday.\n\nAs some of Trump's top allies, the tech billionaires were given VIP seating next to top U.S. officials and his family for the swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol rotunda. Seated in front of Trump's incoming Cabinet were Amazon Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos and his fiancee Lauren Sanchez, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.\n\nTheir presence in Trump's orbit underscores not only the incoming administration's pro-business agenda, but the likely influence the world's wealthiest tech leaders could have on U.S. policy.\n\nRead more: Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg attended Trump's inauguration: What are their net worths?\n\n– Kathleen Wong\n\nTrump talks Greenland, tariffs in Oval Office press conference\n\nDonald Trump turned an executive order signing ceremony into an impromptu press conference Monday, answering dozens of questions from reporters.\n\nTrump talked about imposing 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, mulled sending military special forces into Mexico to fight drug cartels, and said he’s not confident a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas will hold. He also reiterated his desire to acquire Greenland from Denmark.\n\nThe press conference came after a long day of events that saw Trump sworn into office at the U.S. Capitol, where his inauguration ceremony was moved because of frigid temperatures.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nElise Stefanik to face questions at UN ambassador confirmation hearing\n\nElise Stefanik, Donald Trump's pick as the U.S. ambassador at the United Nations, will face senators on Tuesday morning at her confirmation hearing begins.\n\nStefanik, a Republican lawmaker from New York and top Trump ally, has served five terms in Congress. Her close relationship with Trump briefly stirred speculation that he was considering her for vice president.\n\nStefanik garnered praise in conservative circles for now-viral questions she posed to the heads of three Ivy League schools at a congressional hearing on campus antisemitism, as protests against Israel's actions in Gaza rocked colleges nationwide.\n\nAfter Stefanik asked the three presidents – of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania–- whether calling for the genocide of Jews called for disciplinary action, they waffled and gave indirect answers. Two of the three later resigned.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBiden leaves letter for Trump\n\nDonald Trump discovered a personal letter Monday in the Oval Office from former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe letter-writing tradition from outgoing to incoming presidents dates back to 1989 when Ronald Reagan left a brief letter for George H.W. Bush.\n\nTrump declined to reveal the contents of Biden’s letter Monday.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nStewart Rhodes, former Oath Keepers leader, free after Trump pardon\n\nPeople convicted in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, began to be released from prison overnight after President Donald Trump approved pardons Monday for nearly 1,600 people charged in the riot.\n\nTrump commuted the sentences for 14 defendants, including Stewart Rhodes, the former leader of the Oath Keepers militia who received the second-longest sentence of 18 years. Rhodes left a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, early Tuesday.\n\nRelatives of Enrique Tarrio, former leader of the Proud Boys who received the longest sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy, said they expected his release on Tuesday.\n\nNeither Rhodes nor Tarrio entered the Capitol, but they were convicted of seditious conspiracy for helping plan the attack.\n\n--Bart Jansen and Reuters\n\nTrump pardons nearly 1,600 people charged in Jan. 6 attack on U.S. Capitol\n\nPresident Donald Trump pardoned nearly all the 1,600 people charged in the Capitol attack Jan. 6, 2021, fulfilling a campaign pledge critics said would \"endorse attacks on democracy.\"\n\nThe total includes hundreds of people convicted of felonies for attacking police and temporarily interrupting Congress from certifying the 2020 election victory of former President Joe Biden.\n\n\"These are the hostages,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"Full pardon. This is a big one. We hope they come out tonight.”\n\nAbout 1,270 have been convicted and 1,100 have been sentenced in the riot, according to the Justice Department. About 600 people were charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding law enforcement.\n\nThe list of those receiving clemency included 14 people receiving commutations to end their sentences, including top members of two militia groups, the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. Stewart Rhodes, who was leader of the Oath Keepers, had been sentenced to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy.\n\n\"We're excited about it,\" Ed Tarpley, a Rhodes lawyer, told USA TODAY. “This is an answered prayer and we're all very happy.\"\n\nNayib Hassan, a lawyer for Enrique Tarrio, who received the longest sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy as a leader of the far-right Proud Boys gang, said he wasn't sure if Tarrio got a pardon or commutation.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nCarrie Underwood sang 'America the Beautiful' after technical difficulties\n\nCountry music star Carrie Underwood took the stage during Trump's inauguration to sing \"America the Beautiful,\" but she paused as there appeared to be a technical glitch. She proceeded to sing the song without instrumentation before shaking Trump's hand.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat balls did President Trump and Melania Trump attend?\n\nPresident Trump sported a tuxedo and bowtie and first lady Melania Trump wore a black and white dress as they concluded Inauguration Day at a trio of balls in downtown Washington, D.C.\n\nJust before 10:30 p.m. Monday, the first couple shared their first dance to an Elvis-style rendition of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" at the Commander in Chief Ball. Vice President JD Vance, also in a tuxedo, and second lady Usha Vance, in a sparkly blue dress, joined the president and first lady for a spin on stage.\n\nTrump later made an appearance at the Liberty Ball and ended his night at the Starlight Ball at Union Station. In one of his final dances of the evening, the president took to the floor alongside his family members and the Vances to Frank Sinatra’s “I Did It My Way.”\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nWhat executive orders did Trump sign on Monday?\n\nPresident Trump began signing his first wave of executive orders around 7 p.m. Monday, after his swearing-in ceremony and a parade, and just before the evening's inaugural balls that stretched well past midnight.\n\nHe started by rescinding 78 executive orders approved by his predecessor Joe Biden, including efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, protect federal lands from oil drilling and reduce the cost of prescription medications.\n\nTrump also declared a national border emergency and ordered the U.S. armed forces to repel \"forms of invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border, including illegal migration and drug trafficking. The new president's moves also include halting enforcement of a ban on TikTok in the U.S. for 75 days, mandating how the U.S. government recognizes gender on federal documents, and changing the official names of Mount Denali in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n- Laura Villagran and Bart Jansen\n\nWhat did Trump say during his inauguration speech?\n\nTrump said during his inauguration ceremony in the Capitol rotunda that he believes \"a tide of change is sweeping the country.\"\n\n\"I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success,\" he said.\n\nBut the president also laid out a list of conservative priorities and campaign promises, including declaring an emergency on the southern border, rolling back climate change priorities and more. He also hit Panama's management of the Panama Canal and vowed to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nIn swearing-in ceremony, President Trump's hand wasn't on his Bible.

Not according to the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the incoming president must swear an oath of office, saying: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nBut the Constitution also protects religious freedom and holds that \"no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\"\n\n− Josh Meyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/12/los-angeles-wildfire-updates-sunday/77638871007/", "title": "Los Angeles wildfires: Death toll climbs as crews race to combat winds", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the LA fires for Sunday, Jan. 12. For the latest updates on the Los Angeles wildfires in California, please read USA TODAY'S live updates for Monday, Jan. 13.\n\nLOS ANGELES — Wildfires that have ignited across the Los Angeles area have left a trail of destruction, killing at least 24 people and destroying thousands of structures, officials said Sunday.\n\nIn an update Sunday evening, the County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner said a total of 24 people have died due to the wildfires. The cases remain under investigation by the department, which noted that only 10 have been confirmed as human remains.\n\nEfforts to gain an upper hand against the deadly infernos continued on Sunday as ominous new wind warnings as flames threatened additional Southern California communities. Aircraft unloaded water and fire retardant on hills where the Palisades Fire — the most destructive in the history of Los Angeles — has scorched over 23,000 acres, destroying more homes, businesses, and numerous landmarks.\n\nThe expansion of the Palisades Fire, which was 13% contained, to the north and east spurred officials to issue evacuation orders and warnings to the west of the 405 freeway as the blaze put parts of Encino and Brentwood in peril.\n\nOfficials acknowledged that progress had been made but warned resurging winds could complicate efforts and enhance the risk level. Santa Ana winds that have fueled the blazes for the past week were picking up Sunday morning in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, then were expected to weaken in the afternoon before strengthening Sunday night through Wednesday, with the worst of it occurring on Tuesday.\n\nNorth-northeast wind gusts between 35 to 55 mph were possible, according to Rich Thompson, an incident meteorologist with the National Weather Service. A red flag warning is in effect until Wednesday and Thompson warned that in addition to the strong winds, low humidity and dry vegetation will contribute to very critical fire conditions.\n\n\"We're not out of the woods yet. We have some very significant fire weather ahead of us,\" Nancy Ward, director of the California Office of Emergency Services, said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \"We've prepositioned additional engines, fire crews, helicopters, bulldozers, water tenders across all of Southern California ... all poised to assist and support the additional fire threat.\"\n\nThe Palisades Fire is one of six blazes that have erupted since Tuesday, obliterating neighborhoods and leaving a catastrophic trail of destruction. Three of the six fires remained active on Sunday.\n\nGet weather and fire alerts via text:Sign up to get current wildfire updates by location\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ More than 12,000 structures have been damaged or destroyed by the wildfires, which have consumed about 40,300 acres of total land, according to CalFire.\n\n∎ Evacuation orders throughout the Los Angeles area now cover 105,000 residents. Another 87,000 residents have been warned that they may have to evacuate, fire officials said.\n\n∎ The containment status of all three active fires: Palisades 13%; Eaton 27%; Hurst 89%. Three other blazes — Kenneth, Sunset, and Sunswept — have been contained.\n\n∎ California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an investigation into water supply issues that may have impeded firefighters' efforts.\n\n∎ The Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest school district in the U.S., will reopen almost all schools on Monday. The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District said all Santa Monica schools, with the exception of Roosevelt Elementary, will also reopen on Monday. Meanwhile, Malibu schools will be closed through Wednesday and the Pasadena Unified School District will be closed through Friday.\n\nThe unrelenting toll:From unhoused folks to beachfront Malibu homeowners, wildfires hit all of LA society\n\nIn Altadena, a checkerboard of destruction\n\nFirefighters from Mexico, Canada, and several other nearby states are assisting local and state personnel in combatting the blazes, according to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nArizona firefighters on Sunday were among those monitoring Altadena, California, a community north of Pasadena, where a mix of life past and present coexisted in the wake of the Eaton Fire. The fire has scorched over 14,000 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\n“We're really trying to button up the area as best as possible before any anything else, before that wind comes in,” said Captain Shaun Jones of Central Arizona Fire and Medical about the threat of further fire from more Santa Ana winds forecast for early in the week.\n\nResidential streets to the north alternated, randomly, between the houses lost to the fire that rolled down from the mountain early last week and those that withstood the inferno. Children’s playsets were covered in soot and swimming pools looked like black lagoons. Grayed-out chimneys were all that remained intact on most properties.\n\nJones said Central Arizona Fire had brought five engine trucks and a water tank to the scene and were doing tactical patrols to prevent flare-ups.\n\nA seemingly unaffected yellow bungalow provided a pop of color on one devastated street. A squirrel could be seen running in front of the house that was guarded by a white picket fence. A fully stocked Little Free Library post stood curbside.\n\nA small older-model Ford pickup appeared emblematic of the neighborhood’s condition — the front half of the white truck was toasted brown by the flames, while the rear had gone unscathed.\n\n— Jose R. Gonzalez, Arizona Republic\n\nNewsom: Death toll 'likely' to increase\n\nEarlier Sunday, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna reported that 14 people have died so far, but acknowledged that the numbers might be different from those of the medical coroner.\n\nLuna said search and rescue recovery operations involving the county sheriff’s department, coroner’s office, and county fire department are ongoing. Authorities are now conducting grid searchers with cadaver dogs, according to Luna.\n\n“I don't expect good news from those,” Luna said.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Medical Examiner reported 24 fire-related deaths on Sunday evening. Eight deaths occurred in the Palisades Fire while 16 occurred in the Eaton Fire, according to the medical examiner.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there's likely to be a lot more\" fatalities in the wildfires devastating the Los Angeles area.\n\n\"We always have to be careful on the death toll,\" he said. \"I've got search and rescue teams, we've got cadaver dogs out, and there's likely to be a lot more.\"\n\nDiscussions on returning evacuees to their homes will start Thursday\n\nDuring Sunday's news conference, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said efforts to allow people from evacuation zones back to their communities will begin after the \"next predicted red flag ends on Wednesday.\"\n\n\"To all residents, please be assured that we will continue to be here for you until the last fire is completely extinguished,\" Marrone said. \"We stand alongside all of you as we begin to plan for the repopulation of evacuated areas, establishment of disaster recovery centers, and the rebuilding of your homes, your communities, and your lives.\"\n\nOfficials will begin talks on repopulating areas under evacuation orders and warnings \"first thing Thursday,\" according to Marrone.\n\nLos Angeles City Councilmember Traci Park said curfews remain in place for the Pacific Palisades and Brentwood neighborhoods, which is a \"measure that is necessary to ensure public safety, as high winds are expected to pick up again.\"\n\n\"(The Palisades Fire) remains active, and as others have said, this situation is far from over,\" Park said. \"Pacific Palisades still faces dangerous conditions, including downed power lines, broken gas and water pipes and now slide conditions because of water activity.\"\n\nPark noted that the Los Angeles Police Department has suspended operations escorting residents back into evacuation zones to receive essential items due to the anticipated wind conditions and to bring utility personnel into the area to stabilize on-ground conditions.\n\nFire agencies investigating whether electrical equipment caused Hurst Fire\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Edison International and Southern California Edison — the primary electric utility company for much of the region — said fire agencies are investigating whether Edison electrical equipment was involved in the Hurst Fire.\n\nThe fire was reported at around 10:10 p.m. on Jan. 7 and preliminary information revealed that a circuit experienced a relay about a minute later, according to the company. A downed power line that was associated with the circuit was also found but Southern California Edison said it \"does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire.\"\n\nMinutes to flee:How the Palisades Fire rapidly expanded, devastating LA communities\n\nLos Angeles officials warn residents against scams\n\nLos Angeles officials are warning of scammers who are \"actively targeting vulnerable individuals and families (and) exploiting their distress\" during the deadly wildfires. In a Facebook post Sunday, the Los Angeles Police Department explained warning signs to help residents recognize and avoid common scams.\n\n\"Always trust your instincts. If something feels off, take a step back and verify before proceeding,\" the department said in the post.\n\nLuna also addressed scams at a briefing Sunday morning and said those taking advantage of residents would face consequences. Luna said he has talked to officials, including the state attorney general, district attorney, and U.S. attorney, who are \"eager to prosecute anybody who is taking advantage of our residents during this very difficult time.\"\n\nThat includes burglaries, white-collar crimes, and scams, Luna said, explaining he saw a man impersonating a firefighter in Malibu who was caught burglarizing a home.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Hope Karnopp, USA TODAY Network\n\nCommunity reduced to rubble looks to rebuild\n\nRoughly 24 hours after a raging wildfire forced Neal Flesner to flee his Pacific Palisades home, he decided to hike four and a half miles back into the area from Santa Monica, California, with a man he had just met.\n\nThe fire was still growing – erratically burning through brush in the mountains surrounding the Palisades. But Flesner, 48, told USA TODAY that he was propelled by a \"burning desire\" to see firsthand the damage the blaze had wrought to his and his wife Carmen’s \"happy place.\"\n\nWhen he and his new friend got there, they found both of their homes gone. Flesner’s entire neighborhood in the Alphabet Streets area of the Palisades had been reduced to rubble. The only structure still standing, almost untouched, was his garage.\n\nBut Flesner is determined to rebuild what was once there.\n\n\"It was like small town USA, like Main Street USA in Big City, Los Angeles,\" he said. \"I want to be part of the effort to just not rebuild the homes but rebuild the community, rebuild the culture, rebuild the life that we all shared and loved there.\" Read more here.\n\n— Karissa Waddick and Sandy Hooper\n\n16 reported missing; officials expect 'dozens' more\n\nAt least 16 people are reported missing as Los Angeles fire officials continue their search and rescue operations in areas devastated by the wildfires.\n\nThe tally includes 12 people in the Eaton fire and four in the Palisades fire, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said in Sunday’s press briefing. No children have been reported missing, so far.\n\nLuna said the sheriff’s department had received “dozens and dozens” of reports in the morning before the press briefing and will update the numbers accordingly.\n\nHe urges those with missing loved ones to contact their local law enforcement agency. People can also fill out an online form set up by the American Red Cross, which asks to provide as much detail as possible.\n\nHillside horror:How California's Eaton Fire rapidly expanded, decimating Altadena community\n\nUCLA a 'ghost town' amid remote operations during wildfires\n\nEvacuation zones have moved closer to UCLA, located in Los Angeles' Westwood neighborhood, and warnings and orders were in place near the campus. The university will host classes online until Jan. 17 after shutting down in-person lectures last week.\n\nThough the sky over Westwood was powder blue and the brown pall of wildfire smoke consigned to the western edge of the sky, the UCLA campus was quiet on Sunday afternoon. A scattered few people moved through the heart of campus.\n\n\"It’s a ghost town,\" said Jeff Hall, a Brentwood, California, resident who walking through the campus with friends. Hall, founder of the Brentwood News, said he’s been staying with friends in Westwood since his home lost electricity.\n\n“We’re sleeping better,” he said. “I feel like we’re relaxing.”\n\nAllie Greene, a Westwood resident, brought her dog Piper for a walk on the grassy hill below the university’s Powell Library. The beaches Greene normally visits have had access restricted during the Palisades Fire.\n\n\"I just needed to get out and clear my head,\" Greene said.\n\nShe said she has kept a close eye on the fire’s progress, packing some non-essential items in her car and staging essentials by the door in case she needs to leave in a hurry.\n\n\"I will leave if we get an (evacuation warning). I’m not gonna wait until we get (an order),\" she said.\n\nShe watched the 2019 Getty Fire stop before it could cross east over the concrete and asphalt of the 405 Freeway and said it gave her a false sense of security.\n\n\"You feel like you’re following along with Cal Fire and you understand (what’s happening),\" she said, until things suddenly take a turn. \"It’s the winds. It’s the embers.\"\n\n— Isaiah Murtaugh, Ventura County Star\n\nTrump invited to survey destruction\n\nLos Angeles Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger told reporters Sunday she invited President-elect Donald Trump − who takes office on Jan. 20 − to visit the county to get a first-hand look at the destruction.\n\n\"In my years at the county, I've seen time and time again how essential a partner the federal government is when responding to an emergency and helping out communities recover,\" she said.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she had a phone conversation with his administration to discuss the timing of such a visit.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has repeatedly attacked Newsom on social media as the wildfires have raged in the southern part of the Golden State, often misspelling the governor's last name as \"Newscum.\"\n\n\"The fires are still raging in L.A. The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out. Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost. There is death all over the place... they just can't put out the fires.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was also on the program Sunday. He said he took a tour of the devastation and was reminded of the remnants left behind in an international conflict area.\n\n\"That frankly reminded me of visiting war zones, seeing that kind of devastation, just house after house, block after block,\" Schiff said.\n\nIn the past, he continued, California wildfires have sometimes left sporadic damage, where one house would be lost but others around it were fine. This time, whole neighborhoods are \"all gone.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi and Reuters\n\nA '50% chance' their home is gone\n\nRichard and Cathryn Conn evacuated from the Pacific Palisades neighborhood earlier this week, only to find out that much of their neighborhood had been decimated. But they still aren't sure about their four-bedroom house where they'd lived for over a quarter-century.\n\n“You can visualize every room,’’ Richard Conn, 75, said, “and then you know there’s a 50% chance it doesn’t exist anymore.\"\n\n“If you have ever wondered what it was like living in Dresden after the World War II firebombing, you should come to the Palisades,\" he said.\n\nThey also don't know what will happen next as dangerous weather conditions have made it difficult to contain the fires, and more brush fires seem to keep popping up all over the county.\n\n\"I feel like people are panicking,'' said Gary Baseman, 64.

But with inflation actually starting to ease, his proposed tariffs, which the president-elect has called the “most beautiful word in the dictionary,” could actually raise prices again.\n\nWhile some experts don’t think more tariffs are a bad idea, the majority of economists and other experts who spoke with CalMatters echoed 23 Nobel laureates who warned that Trump’s policies would be worse for the economy than the ones proposed by Vice President Kamala Harris. Those economists wrote a letter last month calling Harris’ economic agenda “vastly superior” to Trump’s, and mentioned tariffs as one reason.\n\n“His policies, including high tariffs even on goods from our friends and allies and regressive tax cuts for corporations and individuals, will lead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality,” the economists wrote.\n\nBusinesses that import goods into the country must pay the tariffs. They tend to pass on their increased costs to consumers, with some executives recently promising to do just that during their earnings calls. So economists largely view tariffs as a tax, especially on the lowest- and middle-income families in the nation.\n\nWhile tariffs could raise prices for all U.S. consumers, California could feel the brunt of the impact in part because of the countries Trump singled out during his campaign: China and Mexico. Those two countries accounted for 40% of the state’s imports in 2023.\n\n“The port and logistics complex in Southern California is a very important part of the economy, and directly tied to the countries he threatened,” said Stephen Levy, an economist and director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, an independent, private research organization in Silicon Valley.\n\nTrump imposed tariffs during his first presidential term, and President Joe Biden maintained some of them. During his campaign this time around, Trump said he intends to impose tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, and has mentioned even higher tariffs on goods from China (60%) and Mexico (100% to 200% on cars).\n\nSuch tariffs could exacerbate California’s already high cost of living and raise the prices of cars, technology and electronic products, medical devices, groceries and more. Also, as the state saw during Trump’s first term — which included a trade war, with countries retaliating with their own tariffs on U.S. exports — California’s agricultural industry is likely to feel the effects. Trump’s proposed tariffs could also have an adverse effect on the state’s ports, which are among the nation’s busiest.\n\nAnd all of those outcomes could have a ripple effect on jobs in the state, including those in agriculture, trade and manufacturing.\n\nWhat the state’s ports expect\n\nTrade experts say it’s too early to tell how the state’s ports could be affected, though some of them also said they expect a near-term surge in activity as businesses brace themselves for tariffs by importing more goods now.\n\n“Long Beach and Los Angeles are two of the largest ports in the U.S.,” said Jonathan Aronson, a professor of communication and international relations at the University of Southern California, who studies trade and the international political economy. “Their traffic would presumably slow in both directions” if Trump imposes tariffs, Aronson said. Like other experts, though, he wondered if the president-elect is using the threat of tariffs as a negotiating tactic — say, to pressure Mexico into doing more to limit immigration into the United States.\n\nThe most recent available data for the Port of Los Angeles, which is the busiest in North America and handles nearly 10% of all U.S. imports, shows that trade activity rose nearly 19% at the port in September from the same month a year ago. September imports totaled $27.9 billion, a 20% increase year over year. There’s a chance those numbers could head the opposite direction as a result of tariffs.\n\n“Significant increases in tariffs, and the possibility of retaliatory tariffs, could have a significant impact on traffic — and jobs — at the port,” said Phillip Sanfield, a spokesperson. “We’re monitoring developments closely.”\n\nThe Port of Los Angeles says nearly 1 million California jobs are related to trade at that port.\n\nThe Port of Long Beach handles about 3% of all U.S. imports and has about 575,000 Southern California jobs tied to trade. Chief Executive Mario Cordero said, through a spokesperson, that he is waiting to see what trade policies Trump actually will adopt: “At this point we expect that strong consumer demand will continue to drive cargo shipments upward in the near term.”\n\nThe Port of Oakland, whose trade-related jobs at both the airport and seaport number about 98,000, also expects a traffic boost at first. Spokesperson Robert Bernardo: “As a West Coast seaport, our primary trading partner is Asia, and what’s happening right now is that retailers are expecting a short-term shipping surge in advance of new tariffs.”\n\nMike Jacob is the president of the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association, a not-for-profit maritime trade association whose members facilitate trade. They include ocean carriers, marine terminal operators and more.\n\nJacob, too, said he is expecting trade activity to pick up ahead of whatever tariffs Trump imposes: “Given the lack of understanding of the timing, scope and scale (of the tariffs), you’re more likely than not to move cargo earlier.”\n\nAs a result of tariffs during Trump’s first term, Jacob said there was “a small bump in cargo back in 2019 that resulted in additional impacts on our logistics chain.” He said after that experience, which was then followed by pandemic-related chaos, the industry might be a little more prepared to deal with possible supply-chain disruptions.\n\nPossible effects on manufacturing\n\nThe San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce is worried about potential tariffs on goods from Mexico. Kenia Zamarripa, a spokesperson for the group, said the CaliBaja region — which includes San Diego and Imperial counties and the Mexican state of Baja California — is interconnected, with a multibillion-dollar supply chain. The region’s logistics facilitate 80% of the trade between California and Mexico, she said.\n\nThe nation’s top imports from Mexico in September — worth at least $2 billion for each category — were petroleum and coal products, computer equipment and motor vehicle parts, according to the most recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nSome specific products that are imported into the U.S. from Mexico through California include the Toyota Tacoma. The truck and its components are made in Baja California and elsewhere in Mexico. “Imagine taxing each component before it goes to Mexico and back,” Zamarripa said.\n\nShe added that the region also leads in producing medical devices, and that the importance of that became apparent during the beginning of the pandemic when “a bunch of companies shut down, not knowing that a little metal piece they were producing was a vital part of a heart monitor, for example.”\n\nMexico’s economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said this week that he would hit the U.S. with tariffs if Trump imposes tariffs, though President Claudia Sheinbaum has seemed more open to negotiations.\n\nLance Hastings, chief executive of the California Manufacturers & Technology Association, said he’s well aware of the disruption tariffs can cause. When Trump put tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, aluminum prices rose at least 25%, Hastings said. “I was in the beer industry when it was put in, and we felt it,” he added.\n\nHastings also said the anxiety around Trump’s proposed tariffs stem in part from the fact that “we’re still trying to get the supply chain back to normal” after the pandemic. Because “California is the gateway to Asia, the state would feel the impact of more tariffs first and more than everybody else,” he said.\n\nMade in the USA\n\nYet there is a bit of optimism among those who think some tariffs could actually help California manufacturers.\n\nSanjiv Malhotra, founder and CEO of Sparkz, a maker of lithium batteries, said tariffs could benefit his company and the rest of the domestic battery industry amid the increasing popularity of electric vehicles.\n\nSparkz, which will get its materials from West Virginia and make batteries at a plant in Sacramento, “is all U.S.-sourced. Nothing is coming in from China,” Malhotra said.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump indicated he would try to roll back emission-reduction rules and said he would oppose banning gas-powered vehicles. But Malhotra, who served in the U.S. Energy Department under the first Trump administration, said that as demand for lithium batteries grows, he believes Trump’s incoming administration will understand that they “need to be made here in the U.S. so we are not dependent on China for batteries.”\n\nKate Gordon, CEO of California Forward, a nonprofit organization that focuses on the state’s economy, said that while it’s important to get back some of “what we’ve lost over the past couple of decades” — the nation once led in solar panels — it “needs to happen deliberately and with attention to where we’re really competitive.”\n\n“What would be terrible would be tariffs on things where we’re no longer competitive, like parts of the solar supply chain, which have been held by China for a long time,” she said. All that would do is drive up prices, Gordon said.\n\nAmericans may say they want things to be made in the USA, but they also don’t want to pay higher prices for them, said Derek Guy, a menswear writer based in San Francisco who has covered the clothing industry for more than a decade. A few years ago, Guy wrote about American Apparel, under new ownership, offering U.S. consumers the option of paying a little bit more for clothing made here vs. similar pieces made overseas.\n\n“Even based on a few dollars, when someone wasn’t looking over (their) shoulder, people chose the foreign version,” Guy said.\n\n“A lot of manufacturing in the U.S. has long shifted toward the higher-end,” Guy said. “The kind of cheaper clothes we’re talking about (what most Americans buy) are made elsewhere.” Tariffs would raise those prices.\n\nThe price of almonds\n\nCalifornia’s top agricultural exports include almonds, wine, dairy products, pistachios and other nuts.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term as China imposed retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., California exports of wine, walnuts, oranges and table grapes to China fell, according to the University of California Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics.\n\nIn addition, almond prices sank, with the foundation’s researchers saying prices fell from $2.50 a pound to $1.40 a pound in 2018. That had a negative impact on an industry that generates $4 billion to $5 billion a year and employs about 110,000 people, according to the website of lobbying group Almond Alliance.\n\nAmanda Russell, a spokesperson for the Almond Alliance, said in an emailed statement: “In previous trade negotiations, President Trump demonstrated a commitment to supporting agriculture, and we are optimistic about continuing this partnership to address the challenges and opportunities facing our growers and stakeholders.”\n\nBesides tariffs, another likely action by Trump that could affect the state’s agriculture industry is mass deportations — a threat that has immigrants and advocates on edge.\n\n“I can’t see any benefit to California if he goes through with mass deportation,” said Levy, the economist in Silicon Valley. “Even the threat of deportation will affect the labor pool.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/europe/joseph-ratzinger-pope-benedict-xvi-obituary-intl/index.html", "title": "Joseph Ratzinger, former Pope Benedict XVI, shaped Catholic ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPope Emeritus Benedict XVI, whose death at 95 was announced Saturday, was a powerful intellectual force who shaped the Catholic Church’s theology for more than a quarter century before shocking the world by resigning in 2013.\n\nWhile not quite unprecedented, Benedict’s resignation was highly unusual. Popes typically hold office until death, and the last pope to step down was Gregory XII, who quit in 1415 to end a civil war within the church.\n\nBookended by globally popular and charismatic popes – St. John Paul II and Pope Francis – Benedict cut a different figure. Friends and biographers described him as quiet and scholarly, more at home among theological tomes than adoring crowds.\n\nIn typical fashion, Benedict announced his unexpected resignation in Latin. He was 85 at the time and cited his advanced age as ill-suited for the demands of running the Catholic Church.\n\nThe German-born Benedict saw himself, and the church, as a bulwark against secular trends in Western society, particularly what he called the “dictatorship of relativism.” He often insisted that Catholics maintain a fortress mentality, saying perhaps a smaller, “purer” church would best maintain Catholicism’s traditions and teachings.\n\nAs Pope, Benedict was a polarizing figure. He was hailed by conservatives who admired his erudite writings and careful theology. But critics, particularly in the postmodern West, called him “God’s Rottweiler” for his staunch insistence on fidelity to church’s doctrine and his willingness to silence dissent.\n\n“He policed the boundaries of the faith,” said David Gibson, author of “The Rule of Benedict,” a biography of the former pope. “He was brilliant and brutally effective.”\n\nBenedict also came under fire for his handling of the sexual abuse crisis that engulfed the Catholic church during his years as a senior cleric. A damning report published in January 2022 found that he knew about priests who abused children but failed to act when he was archbishop of Munich from 1977 to 1982.\n\nThe son of a policeman\n\nJoseph Ratzinger was born and raised in Bavaria, where he briefly served in the Hitler Youth, despite his objections, and the German military during World War II. His father, a policeman, loathed the Nazis, according to biographers.\n\nRatzinger, like his elder brother Georg, saw their future in the Catholic Church, entering a German seminary in 1945. Once ordained, Ratzinger rose quickly through the church, establishing himself as a leading theologian. Originally a liberal thinker, he turned conservative in 1968 in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, which upended a number of Catholic teachings.\n\nIn 1977, Ratzinger was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising. Later that year, former Pope Paul VI made the German scholar a cardinal, a sign of his growing reputation within the church.\n\nFrom 1981 to 2005, Ratzinger ran the Vatican’s influential Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), the office responsible for stating and policing church doctrine. He was, in effect, Catholicism’s chief theologian during this time, said Gibson, Benedict’s biographer.\n\n“His twenty-four years at the CDF were far more influential than his tenure as pope,” Gibson said.\n\nHis influence was certainly felt in the United States. In 1984, Ratzinger told the Order of Preachers, also known as the Dominicans, to investigate one of its monks, Matthew Fox, for heresy. The Vatican expelled Fox from the order in 1993.\n\nIn 1999, Ratzinger effectively silenced an American nun and priest engaged in LGBTQ ministry because they would not affirm the “Church’s teaching regarding the intrinsic evil of homosexual acts.” The nun and priest were “permanently prohibited from any pastoral work involving homosexual persons.”\n\nBut Ratzinger eventually tired of the job, reportedly asking Pope John Paul II to appoint him as a librarian at the Vatican’s library. John Paul refused.\n\n‘Please don’t do this to me’\n\nRatzinger was dean of the College of Cardinals in 2005 when he became the sixth German to be picked as pope, the first since the 11th century. At the time, the church was facing several pressing issues, including declining popularity in parts of the world and a growing crisis over its role in handling sexual abuse accusations against priests.\n\nAs the conclave to appoint Pope John Paul II’s successor went on, Ratzinger said he quickly realized that he would be elected as the new Pope – though he was reluctant to assume the mantel of St. Peter.\n\n“At a certain point, I prayed to God, ‘Please don’t do this to me,’” he told a German audience in 2005. “Evidently, this time he didn’t listen to me.”\n\nUpon his election, Ratzinger took the name Benedict XVI as a nod to church history, he said. He chose the name to honor Benedict XV, who pursued peace during World War I, and the original St. Benedict, a monk “whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe,” Ratzinger said.\n\nAt 78, he was the oldest person to have been elected pope since Pope Clement XII in 1730. Given his age, Benedict XVI was widely seen as a caretaker pope, a bridge to the next generation after the long tenure of John Paul II, a globe-trotting pontiff whose early youth and vigor gave way to such frailty in later years that he required help walking and was often hard to hear during public addresses.\n\nIn his tone, demeanor and actions, Benedict was notably different from his predecessor. Where John Paul wowed crowds around the world with his mastery of numerous languages, Benedict’s influence was felt through his erudite writings and theological rigor.\n\n“In a world which he considered relativist and secular, his main thrust was to re-establish a sense of Catholic identity for Catholics themselves,” said Delia Gallagher, CNN’s Vatican correspondent.\n\nAs Pope, Benedict often championed a back-to-basics approach. Three of his encyclicals – letters from the Pope to Catholics around the world – were based on the theological virtues of faith, hope and love.\n\nBill Donohue, of the conservative US Catholic League, credited Benedict for working to reduce friction among adherents of various faiths, something that was a key part of John Paul’s mission as well.\n\nBut critics say Benedict didn’t always choose his words wisely. During a speech in Regensburg, Germany in 2006, he quoted a 14th century Byzantine emperor who criticized Islam, calling it violent, “evil and inhuman.”\n\nHis remarks were sharply criticized by heads of states in the Middle East and Muslim groups throughout the world. Effigies of Benedict were burnt in Basra, Iraq, and elsewhere in predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nBenedict later apologized, saying he was “deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address.”\n\nCriticism over sexual abuse crisis\n\nBenedict became pope at the height of the molestation scandal involving Catholic priests, as complaints of sexual abuse and related lawsuits tore at the church and threatened its moral standing around the world.\n\nIn 2002, he asked Pope John Paul II to route all accusations of sexual abuse to his office, where he instituted changes meant to deal swiftly with accused priests. From 2004-2014, the Vatican defrocked 848 priests who raped or molested children and sanctioned another 2,572 with lesser penalties, according to the church. During that time, his office had received 3,400 accusations, according to the church.\n\nThe flood of accusations worldwide has waned at times but has never stopped.\n\nIn 2008, Benedict acknowledged “the shame which we have all felt” over abuse reports and said those responsible for the “evils” should face justice. Two years later he said abusive priests “disfigured their ministry” and brought “profound shame and regret” on the church.\n\nThat same year, 2010, he issued new rules aimed at stopping abuse. These included allowing church prosecution of suspected abusers for 20 years after the incidents occurred, up from 10 years previously. The rules also made it a church crime to download child pornography and allowed the pope to remove a priest without a formal Vatican trial.\n\nIn some cases, Benedict acted swiftly, as when he removed Marcial Maciel, a powerful Mexican priest who founded the conservative Legion of Christ, after years of allegations that he had sexually abused children.\n\n“No one did more to successfully address the problem of priestly sexual abuse than Joseph Ratzinger,” Donohue said.\n\nBut others such as the late Barbara Blaine, the former president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said the opposite was true.\n\n“I would hate for him to be remembered as someone who did the right thing because from our perspective, Pope Benedict’s record has been abysmal,” said Blaine, who died in 2017.\n\nIn 2010, The New York Times reported that church officials, including Ratzinger, had failed to act in the case of a Wisconsin priest accused of molesting up to 200 boys. The Times reported that church officials stopped proceedings against the priest after he wrote Ratzinger.\n\nAlso in 2010, the Times reported that the future pope – while serving as the archbishop in Munich – had been copied on a memo informing him that a priest accused of molesting children was being returned to pastoral work. At the time, a spokesman for the archdiocese said Ratzinger received hundreds of memos a year, and it was highly unlikely that he had read it.\n\nTwelve years later, a Church-commissioned report into abuse by Catholic clergy in the diocese found that Ratzinger had as archbishop been informed of four cases of sexual abuse involving minors – including two that had taken place while he was in office – but failed to act. In a letter published by the Vatican in February 2022, Benedict issued a general apology to survivors of abuse, writing: “Once again I can only express to all the victims of sexual abuse my profound shame, my deep sorrow and my heartfelt request for forgiveness.”\n\nOver the years, victims’ groups pressed the International Criminal Court to prosecute Benedict in the sex abuse scandal.\n\nDavid Gibson, Benedict’s biographer, said that, like many in the Vatican, the former pope was initially slow to recognize the magnitude of the church’s abuse crisis.\n\n“Like so many in the church, he was part of the learning curve,” Gibson said.\n\nThe anti-Francis\n\nUltimately, however, Benedict showed little skill or interest in governing the vast and complex world of the Catholic Church, Gibson said.\n\nIn 2012, his butler was convicted of theft for leaking confidential papal documents to fight what he saw as deep corruption within the Holy See.\n\nA year later, Benedict announced his resignation.\n\nSince then, Benedict, who chose the name Pope Emeritus and continued to wear the traditional papal white, rarely left his monastery high on a hill in Vatican City, where he promised to live a “hidden life.”\n\nStill, conservative Catholics tried to draw Benedict out, or at least use him as counterweight to the more liberal papacy of Francis. Some Catholics looked to him as an anti-Pope, or at least an anti-Francis.\n\nThe contrast between the two men was dramatized in a 2019 Netflix film, “The Two Popes,” which earned Anthony Hopkins an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Benedict.\n\nThe Rev. Joseph Fessio, an American Jesuit who studied under Benedict and has published his works at Ignatius Press, said the former Pope likely knew that conservatives were trying to pit him against Francis.\n\n“In some ways, he has become the face of ‘the Resistance,’” Fessio said, “even though he hasn’t done anything to be a resistor.”\n\nBenedict preferred to be called something more modest.\n\nBefore he left Rome in 2013, a crowd of 10,000 people gathered to bid him an emotional farewell.\n\n“I am no longer the Pope but I am still in the church,” Benedict said. “I’m just a pilgrim who is starting the last part of his pilgrimage on this earth.”", "authors": ["Daniel Burke Hada Messia", "Daniel Burke", "Hada Messia"], "publish_date": "2022/12/31"}]}

What you need to watch", "text": "Get ready for the most unpredictable Tony Awards of the last decade.\n\nIn most Broadway seasons, one or two new musicals rise to the top as the clear standouts of the year. But coming off the most crowded spring in recent memory, no consensus has formed around any of the five vastly different shows nominated for best musical, which include an Alicia Keys passion project and a suffragist history lesson produced by Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt’s also the most star-studded Tonys in a while, with Rachel McAdams (“Mary Jane”), Eddie Redmayne (\"Cabaret”) and Jim Parsons (\"Mother Play\") all vying for top trophies. Here’s everything you need to know going into this weekend’s ceremony:\n\nInterview:'Merrily We Roll Along' made them old friends. Now, the cast is 'dreading' saying goodbye.\n\nWhen are the Tonys this year?\n\nThe Tonys will take place Sunday, June 16, at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center in New York. It’s the first time Lincoln Center will host the awards, which have long been held at Radio City Music Hall. (Last year, the telecast moved to Washington Heights’ United Palace.)\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHow can I watch the Tony Awards?\n\nThe ceremony will air live on Sunday, June 16, on CBS (8 EST/PST) and stream on Paramount + for subscribers. Julianne Hough (“Dancing with the Stars”) and Utkarsh Ambudkar (“Ghosts”) will also host a pre-show streaming free on Pluto TV (6:30 EST / 3:30 PST), during which the first round of awards will be handed out.\n\nWho is hosting the 2024 Tonys?\n\nOscar winner Ariana DeBose is returning to host the show for a third consecutive year. The “West Side Story” star (and “Hamilton” Broadway vet) teased her opening number on Instagram with a series of rehearsal snaps. DeBose memorably opened the 2022 telecast with an earnest mashup of dozens of showtunes. And last year, due to the Hollywood writers’ strike, she opted for a lively, wordless dance performance to kick off the proceedings.\n\nWho is presenting at the Tony Awards?\n\nPrevious Tony winners Cynthia Erivo, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Ben Platt, Idina Menzel, Adrienne Warren, Jennifer Hudson, Jeffrey Wright, and Sean Hayes are all lined up to present during Sunday’s show, as are “Gutenberg” musical stars Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells. Angelina Jolie, a producer on “The Outsiders,” is also set to present, along with Nick Jonas, Ashley Park and “After Midnight” host Taylor Tomlinson.\n\nBest of Broadway:10 new shows you need to see this summer, including 'Illinoise'\n\nWho is performing at the Tonys? Watch out for ‘Stereophonic.'\n\nWith the exception of “Gutenberg,” which closed early this year, all the nominees for best musical and best musical revival will be performing on the telecast, including “The Who’s Tommy” and “Cabaret.”\n\n“Stereophonic,” this year’s buzzy new play partly inspired by Fleetwood Mac, was also added to the lineup Wednesday. The announcement was made following days of outcry from theater fans, after playwright David Adjmi revealed on social media that the Tonys initially rejected the rock drama’s request to perform.\n\nWhich shows are nominated for best musical at the 2024 Tonys?\n\nUnlike past years, where critical darlings “Kimberly Akimbo” and “A Strange Loop” were presumed frontrunners all season long, this year’s winner is anybody’s guess. Alicia Keys’ feel-good “Hell’s Kitchen” leads the pack with 13 nominations, but the Tonys’ biggest prize has rarely gone to a jukebox show. “Illinoise,” a dance piece set to the songs of Sufjan Stevens, is breathtaking and beloved by critics. Although, some voters may hesitate to call it a musical, given that it’s dialogue-free and movement-driven.\n\n“Suffs,” about women’s fight to vote, is certainly the timeliest offering, while “Water for Elephants” may hoodwink folks with its dazzling circus spectacle. But we’re placing money on “The Outsiders” to eke out a victory. Adapted from S.E. Hinton’s 1967 novel, the new musical is already a box-office hit among youngsters and their parents. More importantly, its artful staging and affecting performances make it just highbrow enough to appease snootier voters. Stay gold indeed.\n\nWhat are our other 2024 Tony predictions?\n\nIn addition to best musical, there are plenty of other races that are seemingly too close to call. Jessica Lange (“Mother Play”) and Sarah Paulson (“Appropriate”) are neck and neck for best leading actress in a play, although we give the edge to Paulson, whose family melodrama is expected to pick up an armful of trophies throughout the night. Jeremy Strong (“An Enemy of the People”) and Leslie Odom Jr. (“Purlie Victorious\") are similarly a toss up in leading actor, while Odom’s castmate Kara Young should earn a well-deserved Tony after three consecutive nominations. But look out for a featured actress spoiler in Sarah Pidgeon, whose “Stereophonic” has huge momentum as the most Tony-nominated play in history.\n\nThe musical acting races are also up for grabs, with veteran Kelli O’Hara (“Days of Wine and Roses”) squaring off against newcomer Maleah Joi Moon (“Hell’s Kitchen”) in best leading actress. If there are any sure things going into Sunday’s ceremony, “Merrily We Roll Along” co-stars Jonathan Groff and Daniel Radcliffe are all but assured to scoop up their first Tony wins for leading and featured actor, respectively.

I haven't spoken to Hugh yet, but maybe I'll ask him how I'm doing in the middle of the show so that he has to tell me I'm doing a good job. (Laughs.)\n\nQ: What other Broadway shows or performances were especially memorable for you this season?\n\nDeBose: Myles Frost in \"MJ\" (a bio-musical about Michael Jackson) is quite spectacular. But all the Michaels (who are played by different actors at different ages) are really beautiful. I realize the masses may have their feelings about the artist, but the show that is being put on at that theater is truly something to behold. That is a gorgeous dance show.

Having been an understudy yourself, can you remember a time you had to step in at a moment's notice?\n\nDeBose: I've been in situations where I didn't find out until three hours before, or midshow, or right before the show starts. That's happened to me many a time. While I cannot tell you exactly what we are doing on the show, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that because of my own personal experience, there's no way this evening is going to go by without us finding a respectful way to acknowledge the contributions by these individuals.\n\nQ: You've spoken beautifully about your identity as a queer Afro-Latina, and ended your Oscar speech in March by saying there's a place for everyone. Why was it important for you to convey that message?\n\nDeBose: We live in troubling times, and it's really important for folks who are blessed with positions like mine to remind those that no matter what the world tells you, you're enough. You couldn't be more enough if you tried! Unfortunately, in the United States right now, there are many entities who are trying to make us feel as if we don't have value. But the reality is, we do. We're all humans and that's the banner we need to unite under right now. That was my hope, just to try and remind people to keep going. It's hard.

I'm not one of those that's ready to be like, \"Oh, I put my toilet paper on it\" or \"It's a doorstopper.\" With my journey, it has meant too much to even be in those rooms and for me to get to that place.

Is there anything else you can spill?\n\nDeBose: God, I wish I could. I can tell you I had a great time working on it. Evan and I are North Carolina natives, so that was really thrilling to share space with her and it's a beautiful show. It's a hard show to work on and changes on a dime. But I really like my clothes. I mean, clothes are half the character.\n\nQ: Looking at all your upcoming projects, you've got a spy movie, a Marvel film and a queer rom-com, among many others. What's your ethos when it comes to choosing what's next?\n\nDeBose: I believe in variety and I don't believe in doing the same thing twice.

(The show earned Corden his own Tony, in fact.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/09/22/tony-awards-2021-nominees-how-to-watch/5812660001/", "title": "Tony Awards 2021: 9 things to watch for on Sept. 26", "text": "With the unpredictability of the theater world, it's often \"a year like no other.\"\n\nBut this time, I think they really, really, really mean it.\n\nThe 74th annual (2020? 2021?) Tony Awards are set for Sunday, Sept. 26, honoring productions that hit Broadway prior to the COVID-19 shutdown in March 2020.\n\nThe Tony Awards, originally set for June 2020, became an afterthought as the world grappled with the deadly pandemic and the theater industry fought for its survival — and began to confront systemic issues surrounding racism, equity, inclusion, abuse and more that have long plagued it.\n\nThere is more work to be done. But 18 months later, Broadway is opening back up and it's time to take a moment to celebrate.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe quirky way that seasons shake out often leads to interesting juxtapositions of nominees and categories. But with so much more in play in terms of shows that opened, shows that didn't open and changing rules to accommodate the unexpected showdown, this year's awards are in a league of their own. There were only 18 productions eligible for nominations this year (roughly half of the usual), including only four musicals, which spelled a lot of interesting choices in many categories.\n\nHere are 9 things to watch out for in a Tony Awards ceremony that is sure to be like none other.\n\n'A new normal':Broadway casts, crews prepare for return to the stage after COVID shutdown\n\n2021 Tony Awards:Delayed Tony Awards finally have a date after pandemic shortened Broadway season\n\nThink back\n\nIn a typical year, many shows time their openings so they're fresh in the minds of voters and audiences come Tony time. Of course, due to scheduling issues, availability of theaters, actors and creatives and more, that's not always true, and some shows do open and run in the earlier part of a season.\n\nThat was the case of \"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune.\" The revival, starring Audra McDonald and Michael Shannon, opened in May 2019 (interestingly enough, a few days prior to the 2019 Tony Awards), and closed at the end of July — 791 days before these Tony Awards, where it is nominated for two awards.\n\nTony Awards 2019:Wheelchair-using actress Ali Stroker makes history; 'Hadestown' sweeps with 8 wins\n\n\"Grand Horizons,\" which opened on Jan. 23, 2020, and starred Jane Alexander and James Cromwell, is nominated for two awards: Best Play, and Alexander for Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Play.\n\nOne singular sensation\n\nAaron Tveit is nominated for best leading actor in a musical for his work in \"Moulin Rouge!\" He's the only one nominated in the category. Chalk this one up to musicals slated to come in later in the season.\n\nThat doesn't mean Tveit is a lock to win, though. Tony rules say that when there is only one nominee in a category, they must garner a \"yes\" from 60 percent of returned ballots. We like his chances.\n\nMaking history:Aaron Tveit makes history as only nominee for best lead actor in a musical\n\nMusicals shut out\n\nThere's an emphasis on \"original\" in Best Original Score (Music and/or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre.\n\nThat means of the four musicals that opened during the abbreviated season (\"Moulin Rouge!\"; \"Jagged Little Pill\"; \"Tina - The Tina Turner Musical\" and \"The Lightning Thief\"), the first three were automatically excluded because they were built off existing material, and nominators did not recognize the latter.\n\nThat left the category wide open to music composed for plays, and five of them (\"A Christmas Carol,\" \"The Inheritance,\" \"The Rose Tattoo,\" \"Slave Play\" and \"The Sound Inside\" will duke it out to take home the award.\n\nMissing faces\n\nWith some shows opening for limited engagements, it's not terribly unusual for a nominee to appear at the Tony Awards for a role they're no longer playing.\n\nBut when one of the nominees for leading actress in a musical leaves the show the way Karen Olivo did, it's worth noting.\n\nOlivo, nominated for \"Moulin Rouge!,\" announced in April they will not be returning to the show when it re-opens over concerns over injustice and inaction in the industry.\n\n\"Social justice is actually more important than being The Sparkling Diamond,\" she said in an Instagram video. \"Building a better industry for my students is more important than me putting money in my pockets.\"\n\nMore:Karen Olivo announces exit from Broadway's 'Moulin Rouge!': 'I want a theater industry that matches my integrity'\n\nIn the video, Olivo also said she does not need to be on stage: \"I need to be out here. People are more important than your pocketbook. That's it. That's all that needs to be said from here on out. I value humanity more. I want a theater industry that matches my integrity.\"\n\nFellow nominee Elizabeth Stanley (\"Jagged Little Pill\") announced the birth of her daughter in mid-August and will not re-join the show immediately, meaning out of the three nominees in the category, only one — Adrienne Warren in \"Tina\" — is currently slated to play their nominated role when their show returns.\n\nAll in the family\n\nSpeaking of \"Jagged,\" three performers from the show make up the bulk of nominees in the featured actress in a musical category. Kathryn Gallagher, Celia Rose Gooding and Lauren Patton are all vying for the award, alongside Robyn Hurder (\"Moulin Rouge!\") and Myra Lucretia Taylor (\"Tina\").\n\nWhile multiple nominees from the same show are not unusual (\"Hamilton\" anyone?) and the talent deserving of recognition often outpaces the available nomination spots, this is likely another case of the limited pool of shows impacting the breadth of nominations.\n\nMissing productions\n\nWhen the shutdown happened in March 2020, it was at the start of what was to be a flurry of openings in the coming months to complete the season.\n\nIn fact, they had already begun, with \"Girl From The North Country\" and \"West Side Story\" having just opened in the weeks before the shutdown. Things ground to a halt on the day of \"Six's\" opening night.\n\nTony Award organizers made the decision to change the cut-off date for Tony eligibility to ensure that enough voters had seen the productions they would be judging, meaning those productions would have the opportunity to be considered the following season. \"Girl From The North Country\" and \"Six\" are set to open soon, while \"West Side Story\" has announced it will not return.\n\n'Like no other opening night ever':Broadway will be back, but here's what will change\n\nSpecial recognition\n\nIn the past 18 months, while the stages of Broadway have been dark, the community has united in countless ways not only to support one another but to fight for change.\n\nSpecial Tony Awards are awarded each year to productions, artists and organizations that do not fall into any of the competitive categories.\n\nThis year, in addition to \"American Utopia\" and \"Freestyle Love Supreme,\" the Broadway Advocacy Coalition will be honored for its work in \"building the capacity of individuals, organizations and communities by using storytelling to dismantle systems that perpetuate racism.\"\n\nThe organization was created by members of the Broadway community in 2016 in response to racism and police brutality, and has continued to grow to create lasting collaborations and policy change. Visit bwayadvocacycoalition.org to learn more.\n\nAs Broadway responds to ongoing issues surrounding race and inequity, taking steps to recognize those fighting on the frontlines is a hopeful admission that the work to do better continues.\n\nSpecial Tony Awards:go to 'David Byrne's American Utopia,' Lin-Manuel Miranda's 'Freestyle Love Supreme'\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nRemembering community members lost each year is never easy. But this year, with the Broadway family felled by the very disease that silenced its stages, it promises to be especially heart-wrenching.\n\nThe world helplessly watched as Nick Cordero fought COVID for months early in the pandemic, eventually succumbing in July 2020, leaving his wife, fellow actor Amanda Kloots, and baby son Elvis behind.\n\nThe Broadway world also lost Terrance McNally, Alvin Ing, Adam Schlesinger and others to COVID, who are also sure to be remembered.\n\nAlso especially heart-rending was the loss of Doreen Montalvo to a sudden ailment. She was a beloved actress with roles in \"In The Heights\" and \"On Your Feet\" who was part of the current cast of \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" when the shutdown happened.\n\nHow to watch\n\nThis year's Tony Awards and celebration will not take place fully on network television as usual.\n\nSix-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald hosts the awards ceremony from 7 to 9 p.m. — streaming exclusively on Paramount+.\n\nAt 9 p.m., Tony and Grammy Award winner Leslie Odom Jr. will host a live concert that will include songs from the three Tony-nominated Best Musical contenders. The Tonys for Best Play, Best Revival of a Play and Best Musical will also be announced.

There's going to be more films down the line, and obviously an album. Soon.\n\nQ: What's it like entering the talk show arena with fellow \"American Idol\" competitor Kelly Clarkson?\n\nHudson: We love each other so much. She reached out to me to ask if I needed any help or advice. It feels good, because she knows the ropes. And Sherri Shepherd sent me flowers. I love that she's from Chicago, like me. We all want to see each other shine.\n\nQ: You're taking over Ellen's previous stage. What have you done to the place?\n\nHudson: It's been Jennifer-ized. I want you to feel a sense of my person when you come into it. I'm thinking of getting a bird that will sing my song \"Spotlight\" when you walk in. And when you leave, it's going to sing, \"I'm not going ...\"\n\nQ: In 2011, a Texas snowstorm delayed your plane and you were late for \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" How will that affect how you treat late guests?\n\nHudson: I still have anxiety from that. You only got to tell me one time. It'll never happen again. We took every precaution. When does it snow in Texas? I flew back in and had to go straight to the show. I whipped my own tail because I didn't sleep for three days. So it was a lesson well learned.\n\nQ: You just won your EGOT-completing Tony in April. Where are you storing all this trophy hardware?\n\nHudson: They're all in my home in Chicago and I put them all together. You hear people talking about the EGOT, but you don't see them together. So I was like, \"Emmy, this is Tony, this is Oscar and Grammys. You're all a family now.\"\n\nJennifer Hudson's 'Dreamgirls':Audition tape shows 'this incredible, natural talent'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/theater/2021/12/06/broadway-erie-pa-2022-season-traveling-shows-set-warner-theatre/8813163002/", "title": "Broadway in Erie: 2022 season of traveling shows set at Warner ...", "text": "Staff report\n\nErie Times-News\n\nCue the lights and raise the curtain.
