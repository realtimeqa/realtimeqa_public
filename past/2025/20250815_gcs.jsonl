It will be the first meeting between Trump and Putin on American soil.\n\nLearn more:What Trump thinks could happen at summit\n\nPutin has met all five U.S. presidents who were in office since he came to power in 2000.\n\nIn Trump’s first term, he and Putin met face-to-face six times in five locations around the world. Here’s where they have met.\n\nCan't see our graphics? Click here to reload page.\n\nThe summit is a “listening exercise,” and the goal for Trump “is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a news briefing Aug. 12.\n\nPutin has visited the United States before, even spending time with President George W. Bush at the Bush family home in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 2007.\n\nBut the Alaskan conference is the first visit by a Russian leader to the state, which the United States bought from Russia in 1867 for $7.2 million. That equals about $156.4 million today, according to officialdata.org.\n\nWhat other U.S. presidents have Putin met?\n\nPutin has met five U.S. presidents: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nHow does Putin compare with other Russian leaders?\n\nTrump said he hopes the meeting with Putin will lead to a second meeting between himself, Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where the two sides can reach a peace agreement, USA TODAY reported.\n\nCONTRIBUTING Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, Tom Vanden Brook, Joey Garrison, Kathryn Palmer and Ben Adler\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; Reuters; State Department archive", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/15/alaska-strategic-location-trump-putin-summit/85649075007/", "title": "Why Alaska is the 'most strategic place' for Trump-Putin meeting", "text": "Why Alaska? After all, the state known as the Last Frontier isn't exactly a typical hotbed of international diplomacy. But that's where President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have mutually agreed to meet Aug. 15.\n\nThe meeting will take place on the grounds of Anchorage's sprawling Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson, which lacks the gold-covered facilities both men are so fond of. The base is thousands of miles from both the White House and the Kremlin, and it sits on land that once belonged to Russia.\n\nBut Alaska itself is preparing to play an increasing role on the world stage as climate change opens up new shipping routes close to the North Pole as Russia, China and the United States contest the polar seas for dominance.\n\nAlaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said in a statement that picking Alaska was natural: His home state is \"the most strategic place in the world.\"\n\nThe United States bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 under what was dubbed \"Seward's Folly\" by the then-Interior secretary William Seward, who persuaded Congress to pony up the equivalent of $160 million in today's dollars.\n\nTrump has visited Alaska several times as president, pushed for expanded oil, gas and mining permits there, and even got funding for new polar icebreakers, a popular stance in a state he won with 54% of the vote in 2024.\n\nThe face-to-face meeting between the men was billed as a \"listening exercise\" by the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n\"The goal of this meeting for the president is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war,\" Leavitt told reporters during an Aug. 12 news briefing.\n\nSafe space for Putin\n\nHistorians and political scientists say the location offers a surprising variety of benefits, chief among them the fact that no one is likely to try arrest Putin there.\n\nThe two men are meeting as part of Trump's efforts to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for Putin after indicting him for war crimes.\n\n\"I don't think it's a good time for him to go to Europe,\" former Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell said of Putin.\n\nIn addition to the arrest warrant, the Russian strongman might have trouble flying over Europe and Canada, both of which have closed their airspace to Russian aircraft. The United States has done the same, but Trump is apparently waiving that Biden-era ban for Putin's visit. Trump's flight from Washington, DC, will take about seven hours.\n\nSome experts have also criticized Trump's decision to host Putin on U.S. soil ‒ no matter how far it is from the White House ‒ because it legitimizes the Russian leader. Putin last year received 87% of the votes cast in the Russian presidential election, a statistic one elections expert likened to the \"sham\" elections held in African dictatorships.\n\nCloser than most people realize\n\nBecause Russia and Alaska are separated only by a narrow stretch of the Bering Sea ‒ yes, there are places where you can really see Russia from your American house ‒ the logistics of getting both men there are relatively simple, Russian presidential assistant Yuri Ushakov told the BBC.\n\nThe closest distance between the two countries are the tiny islands of Little and Big Diomede.\n\nLittle Diomede is American, while Big Diomede is Russian, although families have long been split between the two, a reflection of Russia's former ownership of Alaska. The two islands are just three miles apart. The two mainlands themselves are only 55 miles apart where Alaska's Seward Peninsula and Russia's Chukotka Peninsula sit on opposite sides of the Bering Sea.\n\nThe National Park Service's Bering Land Bridge National Preserve exists in part to highlight how the two peninsulas were once connected, allowing ancient peoples to migrate from the Eurasian landmass east into North America.\n\n\"It seems quite logical for our delegation simply to fly over the Bering Strait and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska,\" Ushakov said.\n\nBecause Alaska was once part of Russia, some cultural ties also remain: There are about 80 Russian Orthodox churches and chapels still standing across Alaska, many of them on the state's western islands and peninsulas close to the Bering Sea. The first Russian Orthodox Church was established in on Kodiak Island in 1794, and Holy Resurrection Orthodox Cathedral still holds services there.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the threat of Soviet invasion from the west prompted heavy defense investment in missile-warning systems in Alaska, along with marine and air patrols that continue to this day. The base where Putin and Trump are meeting is home to fighter aircraft like the F-22 Raptor, which is used to intercept Russian military planes as they fly close to the border.\n\nRussian invasion pushed Ukrainians to Alaska\n\nWhile there has long been a Russian community in Alaska, several hundred Ukranian refugees have also moved there under federal humanitarian programs following Russia's 2022 invasion. Trump put that program on indefinite hold upon taking office.\n\nTrump is meeting with Putin without Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a move that has concerned some European leaders who have pledged their unconditional support in his country's efforts to repel Russia.\n\nEuropean leaders have expressed concern that Trump would pressure Ukraine to make too many concessions to Putin. But Treadwell said he believes everyone can agree that ending the war should be a top priority, and if this meeting in Alaska is what it takes, it's worth it.\n\n\"There are a lot of former Russians who live in Alaska and a lot of former Ukranians who live in Alaska,\" he said. \"If this leads to peace, I think we'd all be very happy.\"\n\nAlaska has long been a stopover for diplomatic missions\n\nIn addition to its strategic military importance, Anchorage is a familiar stopover for diplomatic missions traveling between Europe and Asia.\n\nIn 1971, President Richard Nixon met with the Emperor of Japan on the tarmac in Anchorage as Hirohito traveled to Europe for meetings. It was the first time a reigning Japanse monarch had stepped foot on foreign soil, Nixon said, according to his presidential library. Nixon also noted their meeting took place approximately equidistant from the White House as to Tokyo.\n\nPope John Paul II stopped in Anchorage in 1981 on his way back to Rome from Japan, touring the city and meeting with the faithful. He also met with President Ronald Reagan in Fairbanks in 1984.\n\nIn 2021, then-Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met with his Chinese counterparts for several days of trade talks held at a hotel that was considered the midpoint between the two country's capitals.\n\nTrump-Putin meeting comes during Alaska's busiest season\n\nWhile the White House has not discussed the reason for having the meeting on the military base, one factor may have played a key role: This is Alaska's tourist season and every place else is booked solid.\n\nMore than 2 million tourists visit Alaska annually, the vast majority of them traveling via cruise ships and the historic Alaska Railroad from Anchorage to Denali National Park, according to state statistics.\n\nTrump early on in his administration named Denali back to its former name of Mount McKinley, which President Barack Obama had renamed to honor Alaska Native people. Trump said he was changing the name back to honor the tariff-loving former President William McKinley, who was also responsible for adding Hawaii, Guam and several other territories to the United States.\n\nFederal officials have warned that passenger and cargo flights to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport may be affected by temporary flight restrictions during the Trump-Putin meeting on Aug. 15 and early Aug. 16.\n\nAugust is the airport's second-busiest month behind July, according to airport officials. The flight restrictions will also impact the adjacent Lake Hood Seaplane Base, the world's busiest seaplane base.\n\nAlthough many other presidents have taken their counterparts on sighteeing trips, or used state visits to do their own tourism, there's little indication Trump and Putin will be taking the time to go fishing or land on a glacier. Intead, Trump said he expects to know \"probably in the first two minutes,\" whether he can reach a deal with Putin.\n\nTreadwell, who was the state's lieutenant governor from 2010-2014, said there could be another reason for Trump to agree to meet at JBER: the sprawling 36-hole Moose Run Golf Course. Along with sand traps and water hazards, he said, players there must periodically avoid moose and bears.\n\n\"In the summer here, you can play golf until almost midnight, but I doubt he'll have time for that,\" he said. \"I think people of all political stripes hope this meeting will produce peace.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/15/trump-putin-meeting-live-updates/85616476007/", "title": "'No deal': Live updates from Trump-Putin Alaska summit", "text": "President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met on the tarmac of a U.S. air base in Alaska and began a closed-door meeting over the Ukraine war.\n\nTrump said on Air Force One that he might consider U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, outside of the NATO alliance.\n\nThe Kremlin estimated the Trump-Putin meeting could last as long as 6 or 7 hours, state media reported.\n\nThe Russian president teased the possibility of a nuclear arms control deal.\n\nWASHINGTON − With handshakes and a red carpet, President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin met for an hours-long summit that Trump hoped would lead to a resolution of the three-year Ukraine war.\n\nPutin said after the meeting that they had reached a deal, but Trump said the two sides were not there yet. \"There is no deal until there is a deal,\" he said at a press conference with Putin. \"We're going to try and get this over with.\"\n\nTrump said he had always had a good relationship with \"Vladimir,\" despite some tough meetings in over the years. But there was more work to be done on reaching an agreement on the war.\n\nFollow along for live updates.\n\nNative Ukrainian left speechless after ‘no deal’ summit\n\nUkrainian-American Volodymyr Valchuk said he already had low expectations for the high-stakes summit between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut after listening to the world leaders meet in person for the first time in six years to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, Valchuk admitted this was a head-shaker.\n\n“I’m speechless. I have nothing to say. I really didn’t expect much, but this is even worse than I thought,” said Valchuk, 46. “That’s what I’m feeling right now.”\n\nValchuk, a respiratory therapist who lives in San Rafael, California, said he’s “very disappointed” when Trump said “no deal” was reached to end the war.\n\n“At least they could’ve given us a little idea what Putin said the agreement was,” Valchuk said. “Trump said he will talk to NATO and (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy, but I really don’t know what that means?\n\n“Yeah, I’m disappointed,” said Valchuk, who came from Ukraine to the US to attend college in 1996. “Very disappointed.”\n\nValchuk, who gained his American citizenship in 2004, said he doesn’t know what happens next for his homeland.\n\n“I just hope it’s not going to cost Ukraine some of its land and more lives,” Valchuk said. “I hope.”\n\n--Terry Collins\n\nPutin warns Europe leaders not to ‘throw a wrench’ in peace talks\n\nPutin warned European leaders not to “throw a wrench” in the peace negotiations through “provocations.”\n\nHis warning came before Trump said he would call European leaders including Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to notify them about the talks.\n\n“I would like to hope that the agreement that we’ve reached together would help us bring closer that goal and pave the path to peace in Ukraine,” Putin said. “We expect that the European capitals will perceive that constructively and that they won’t throw a wrench in the works and will not make any attempts to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n'We didn’t get there': Trump says biggest issue unresolved\n\nPresident Donald Trump said “many points were agreed to” in his meeting with Vladimir Putin but offered no specifics and added on the biggest issue “we didn’t get there.”\n\n“We had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to,” Trump said in a short statement to the media without taking questions. “One is probably the most significant… We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”\n\n-Zac Anderson\n\nTrump hoped for a ceasefire. Will he get one?\n\nTrump said in a Fox News interview on Air Force One that he'd \"like to see a ceasefire\" and \"wouldn't be thrilled\" if he did not get one at his meeting with Putin.\n\n\"I'm not going to be happy with that,\" Trump told 'Special Report' host Bret Baier.\n\nBut he again said the meeting with Putin would be \"setting the table\" for a potential second meeting, where a deal to end the war would be discussed.\n\n\"It's not for me to negotiate a deal for Ukraine, but I can certainly set the table to negotiate the deal, and our next meeting will have President Zelensky and President Putin and probably me,\" Trump said.\n\n--Francesca Chambers\n\n‘All of Ukraine is ours’: Putin's position heading into summit\n\nVladimir Putin believes Ukraine belongs to Russia – full stop. He said so himself in June, at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\n“I have said many times that I consider the Russian and Ukrainian peoples to be one people. In this sense, all of Ukraine is ours,” Putin told forum attendees, according to the Atlantic Council. “We have an old rule. Wherever a Russian soldier sets foot is ours.”\n\nHe has said it before.\n\nIn 2021, in a nearly 7,000-word essay posted in English to the Kremlin website, Putin said: Russia and Ukraine are “essentially the same historical and spiritual space.”\n\nSeven months later, in February 2022, Putin led a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n-Lauren Villagran\n\nMurkowski: ‘Believable’ ceasefire best case scenario from summit\n\nAs Trump and Putin continued to meet at a military base in her home state Aug. 15, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told CNN that the best case scenario from the summit is a ceasefire with teeth.\n\n“I think the best that we could hope for is that there is a commitment coming out of Putin to a ceasefire with enough contours to it that it is believable that it will be more than just a brief moment to check a box here,” Murkowski said.\n\nTrump and Putin both have “a lot on the line” and the question is whether they can reach a deal that both of them can tout as a win, she said.\n\n“Because I don’t see them coming together in a chummy way and saying: ‘We got a win for the world here.’ I don’t see that at all, I’m not so rosy eyed to think that,” Murkowski said. “So how do both of them claim a little bit of advantage here? That’s the great unknown.”\n\n-Zac Anderson\n\nAnchorage crowd supports Ukraine as Trump meets Putin\n\nDemonstrators in Anchorage held up a large Ukrainian flag, encircling it and gripping the blue and yellow edges as Trump met with Putin at a nearby military base.\n\nA video feed showed a large crowd, many holding signs and smaller Ukrainian flags, with the city and cloud-covered mountains in the background.\n\nOne blue and yellow sign read “We stand with Ukraine.” The crowd broke into a chant of “peace for Ukraine.”\n\n-Zac Anderson\n\n'Did you underestimate Ukraine'?\n\nReporters shouted, \"Mr. Putin, did you underestimate Ukraine?\" and \"President Putin, will you stop killing civilians?\" while Putin stood next to Trump after exiting his plane. After the second question, Putin made a face, pointed to his head, shrugged and lifted his palms to the air.\n\nTrump and Putin then rode together in the 20,000-pound U.S. presidential limousine, known as The Beast, to the formal summit. Putin smiled and waved from behind the 3-inch-thick glass.\n\nBefore Air Force One landed for the high-stakes meeting, Trump told reporters he would \"walk\" if things didn't go well with the Russian strongman.\n\n“We're going for a meeting with President Putin in Alaska, and I think it's going to work out very well − and if it doesn't, I'm going to head back home real fast,” Trump told Fox News anchor Bret Baier in an interview during the flight.\n\nReluctant to halt the bloody Ukraine war\n\nPutin has been reluctant to halt the bloody Ukraine conflict, frustrating Trump, who has lashed out and threatened economic penalties. The Aug. 15 summit is a test of whether Trump can make progress on a deal that is acceptable to both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe two leaders are meeting at a U.S. military base in Alaska. Not invited: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who spoke with Trump twice this week and has rejected the idea of territorial concessions to end the war.\n\nA grimace from Putin at start of meeting\n\nThe leaders held a brief photo opportunity as the meeting began. On each side of the room was an interpreter and two senior aides for each man.\n\nTrump and Putin sat next to one another, tilted forward with their hands between their legs, in front of a dark blue banner that said \"Pursuing Peace\" and \"Alaska 2025.\"\n\nTrump did not respond to shouted questions from reporters, other than to say, \"Thank you very much. Thank you.\" Putin appeared to bristle at one question. He cupped his hands around his mouth as he officered an inaudible response.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump admin mulls Russian icebreakers for Arctic oil\n\nThe United States has had internal discussions about using Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker vessels to support the development of gas and LNG projects in Alaska as one of the possible deals to aim for when President Trump meets Vladimir Putin, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe icebreaker idea has been discussed among White House officials as one of the potential deals to try to strike with Russia at the Alaska summit, one of the sources said.\n\nThe ongoing talks between the United States and Russia over Ukraine have included discussions about business deals. The White House is planning to continue this approach at the Aug. 15 summit, said the source, who, like the others spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kremlin officials were not available for comment.\n\n– Reuters\n\nZelenskyy says Ukraine is counting on ‘strong position’ from Trump\n\nAs Trump arrived in Alaska, Zelenskyy issued a statement saying that he and the people of Ukraine “count on a strong position from America.”\n\n“On the day of negotiations, the Russians are killing as well. And that speaks volumes,” the Ukrainian leader said in a videotaped statement posted on X.\n\n“Everyone needs a just end to the war. Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to bring the war to an end, and we count on a strong position from America. Everything will depend on this – the Russians factor in American strength. Make no mistake – strength.”\n\nUkraine says Russia testing new, nuclear-capable missile\n\nRussia is preparing to test a new nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missile, and, if successful, plans to use the results to bolster its negotiating position with the West, Ukrainian military intelligence said on August 15.\n\nAndriy Yusov, a spokesperson for the service, issued the written statement to Reuters just before President Donald Trump was due to hold talks in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending Moscow's war in Ukraine.\n\nReuters on Tuesday reported two U.S. researchers and a Western security source as saying that Moscow was readying a test of the Burevestnik at its Pankovo test site on the Barents Sea archipelago of Novaya Zemlya.\n\n– Reuters\n\nQuigley: 'tyrants of the world' see what Trump is doing\n\nRep. Mike Quigley, D-Illinois, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's willingness to attend the summit with Putin allowed him to \"blow past the sixth deadline\" Trump has given the Russian leader to reach a ceasefire deal.\n\n\"Putin continues to ask for maximalist conditions and escalates the conflict,\" Quigley told USA TODAY.\n\n\"The tyrants of the world see what the president's doing, and frankly, they see a lack of interest, or weakness.\"\n\nPutin's recent \"flattering\" is \"what he's smart enough to know works with Trump,\" he added.\n\nOf Putin's efforts to negotiate a new nuclear deal, Quigley said, while Putin's motives were suspect, \"There's always time for diplomacy.\"\n\n\"I don't trust Putin, but we need to try to do this on a multilateral basis for the future of peace in the world,\" he said.\n\nTrump arrives in Alaska, red carpet awaits\n\nTrump, aboard Air Force One, landed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska at 2:20 p.m. ET, or 10:20 a.m. local time.\n\nTrump will be joined in his meeting with Putin by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff, White House press secretary Karoline Levitt told reporters.\n\nA red carpet is sitting on the tarmac awaiting Trump and Putin to greet each other.\n\nPutin was expected about half an hour later, according to C-SPAN.\n\nTrump says he'll ‘walk’ if Putin meeting doesn’t go well\n\nTrump, on board Air Force One en route to Alaska, said he will end his high-stakes meeting with Putin quickly if it doesn’t go well.\n\n“We're going for a meeting with President Putin in Alaska, and I think it's going to work out very well − and if it doesn't, I'm going to head back home real fast,” Trump told Fox News anchor Bret Baier in an interview during the flight.\n\n“I would walk,” the president added in an excerpt of the interview released by the television network.\n\nRussian foreign minister says ‘our position is clear’\n\nAfter landing in Alaska, Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told reporters that he expected to continue a “productive conversation” with Trump but declined to say whether the summit would be successful.\n\n“We never try to anticipate the outcome or make any guesses,” Lavrov said Aug. 15, after being told Trump had predicted a 25% chance the talks would be unsuccessful. “What we do know, however, is that we have arguments we can contribute to the discussion and that our position is clear. We will present it.”\n\nLavrov showed up at the talks wearing a CCCP sweatshirt, from when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nPutin teases new nuke deal ahead of Trump summit\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin indicated he’s interested in securing a new nuclear arms control pact with the United States, raising the stakes of the summit with President Donald Trump.\n\nPutin suggested the summit could create “the long-term conditions of peace between our countries … and in the world as a whole, if we reach agreements in the field of strategic (nuclear) offensive arms control,” while speaking to senior Kremlin military and civilian officials at an Aug. 14 meeting.\n\nThe world’s last remaining nuclear arms control treaty, New START, limits the U.S. and Russia to keeping only 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads on alert at any given time. It expires in February 2026, though Russia in 2022 paused and later stopped consultation meetings and stopped U.S. and NATO inspections of its nuclear arsenal.\n\nTrump, long a proponent of reducing the risks of nuclear weapons, tried and failed to initiate three-way arms control negotiations with Putin and Chinese President Xi Xinping during his first term.\n\n– Davis Winkie\n\nRussia predicts marathon talks\n\nThe Kremlin predicts that Trump's tete-a-tete with Putin could last as long as six or seven hours, state broadcaster RIA reported.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has said the entire summit could be a short-lived bust.\n\n“At the end of that meeting, probably the first two minutes, I’ll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,” he said Aug. 11.\n\nTrump speaks with Belarus leader before Russia summit\n\nPresident Donald Trump said before his Russia summit that he called Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to thank him for releasing 16 prisoners and to discuss the release of 1,300 more prisoners.\n\n“Our conversation was a very good one,” Trump said on social media. “We discussed many topics, including President Putin’s visit to Alaska.”Lukashenko, a key Putin ally, is accused of holding hundreds of political prisoners in Belarus, which his government denies.Trump added that he hoped to meet with Lukashenko “in the future.”\n\nTrump sees a 'possibility' of US security guarantees for Ukraine\n\nAsked if there was a possibility of the U.S. providing security guarantees to Ukraine, Trump first sought to banish the idea of a NATO membership for the country.\n\n“Not in the form of NATO,” he said. “There are certain things that aren't going to happen.”\n\nAside from that, security guarantees could be on the table, he said.\n\n“Along with Europe, there's a possibility,” he said.\n\nSummit ‘has risks for everybody’: Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan\n\nGOP Sen. Dan Sullivan called the summit in his home state of Alaska “really preliminary” but a chance for Trump to get a sense of whether Putin is ready for a ceasefire with Ukraine before tackling more complex issues, such as territorial issues and security guarantees.\n\n“Negotiating peace is very complex, very difficult,” Sullivan told CBS’s “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” in an interview Aug. 14 that will air Aug. 17. “Even this kind of high-level diplomacy has risks for everybody, including the president and his team.”\n\n“I would call it, you know, an exercise in place-setting for the real negotiations,” Sullivan added.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says Putin’s 'genes' may be responsible for attacks on Ukraine\n\nAsked for his view on Russian attacks on Ukraine on the eve of their summit which killed at least seven civilians, Trump said it might be them setting the stage for negotiations.\n\n“In his mind that helps to make a better deal. It actually hurts him,” Trump told reporters while flying to Alaksa. “In his mind, that helps him make a better deal if they could continue the killing.”\n\nTrump went on to analyze Putin and the “part of the world” he belonged to.\n\n“Maybe it's just his fabric, his genes, his genetics,” he said. \"But he thinks that makes him, gives him strength in negotiating. I think it hurts him, but I'll be talking to him about it.”\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump calls Putin 'a smart guy'\n\nAsked about what would be different in a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Putin, President Trump reflected on his impressions of the Russian leader and their relationship during an interview with reporters on Air Force One on his way to Alaska.\n\n“Look, he's a smart guy,” said Trump. “We get along. It's a good respect level on both sides. And I think, you know, something's going to come of it.”\n\nTrump said he’d noticed that Putin was bringing “a lot of business people from Russia.”\n\n“That's good.

They include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scot Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, CIA Director John Ratcliff and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nSecondary tariff on India ‘probably’ played a part in Putin-Trump summit\n\nOn the eve of his trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump said the secondary tariffs against India for purchasing oil from Russia \"probably\" played a part in Putin wanting to meet with him.\n\nOn July 28, Trump gave an ultimatum to Russia: declare a ceasefire in Ukraine within 10–12 days or face sanctions.\n\nInstead, on Aug. 8, the day the deadline was supposed to expire, Trump announced that he was meeting Putin on Aug. 15.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump also announced that a 25% secondary tariff on India would go into effect later in the month for buying oil from Russia, in addition to the country-specific 25% tariff.\n\nDuring an interview with Brian Kilmeade of Fox News on Aug. 14, Trump was asked if the 10-day deadline had played a role in Moscow trying to schedule the meeting.\n\n“Everything has an impact,\" said Trump, before adding that the secondary tariffs on India took the country \"out of buying oil from Russia.\"\n\n\"Certainly, when you lose your second largest customer and you're probably going to lose your first largest customer, I think that probably has a role,\" he said of Russia’s incentive to meet.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nIt was sold in 1867, but some Russians want Alaska back from the US\n\nWay back in 1991, as the once-mighty Soviet Union disintegrated and Westerners cheered, Vladimir Putin’s favorite rock and roll band released “Don’t Fool Around, America,” a patriotic hit about an even older lost cause – Russia’s 1867 sale of Alaska to the United States.\n\nThis bouncy, accordion-driven single ignored the disorienting collapse of the Soviet dictatorship and instead pointed listeners east, 2.4 miles across the Bering Strait, to the 49th U.S. state, demanding:\n\n“Give us our dear Alaska back/Give us our dear native land.”\n\nNow the song, by rabble-rousing rockers Lyuba (the Loud Ones), has taken on new significance as President Donald Trump hosts Putin at an Alaskan military base – and conspiracy theories resurface claiming Uncle Sam swindled Mother Russia out of the 665,000-square-mile Arctic jewel.\n\nRead more on Russian seller's remorse in USA TODAY.\n\n– Dan Morrison\n\nWhat time is it in Alaska now?

Putin denied interfering in the 2016 election, comments that Trump embraced, saying Putin “was extremely strong and powerful in his denial\" despite U.S. intelligence assessments pointing to interference by Moscow on Trump's behalf.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nTrump’s relationship with Putin in the spotlight\n\nTrump has had a famously warm relationship with Putin over the years, often praising the Russian autocrat. Trump reportedly shared classified intelligence with Russian officials during his first term and tried to soften U.S. opposition to Russia's past aggression against Ukraine and its human rights violations.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine and Zelenskyy featured in one of the lowest points of Trump's first term. He was impeached over allegations that he pressured Zelenskyy to dig up dirt on political rival Joe Biden.\n\nTrump's friendly approach to Putin has largely continued as he worked to get a peace deal and focused his ire on Zelenskyy, most notably during an explosive Oval Office meeting when the two clashed publicly. Trump told the Ukrainian leader he didn’t “have the cards” when it came to resolving the conflict in the country’s favor.\n\nLately, though, Trump has repeatedly slammed Putin and complained about his unwillingness to stop the fighting.\n\nPutin escalated his attacks on Ukraine ahead of the summit, which former GOP House speaker and Trump ally Newt Gingrich called “a sign of very bad faith.” Trump said Aug. 13 that there would be “very severe consequences” if Putin does not agree to end the war.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nJockeying over territorial concessions\n\nTrump is trying to push Moscow into an accord that Kyiv and its allies fear will include the loss of significant territory seized by Russia in its 3-year-old war.\n\nSpeculating about an eventual deal on Aug. 8, Trump said it would involve “some swapping of territories.\"\n\nThat drew a sharp response from Zelenskyy, who said, “Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier.”\n\nBut Trump has continued to push, saying on Aug. 11 that he was a “little bothered” by the Ukrainian leader’s assertion that a land swap would violate the country’s constitution.\n\n\"There will be some swapping,” Trump insisted Aug. 11. “There will be some changes in land.”\n\nThe debate over territorial concessions hangs over the summit. Putin claims four Ukrainian regions – Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/14/when-is-trump-putin-meeting-time/85657823007/", "title": "Where is the Trump-Putin meeting?

He's killing too many people,\" Trump said. \"So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine.\"\n\nTrump did not approve the weapons pause, two sources with knowledge of the situation said. And the president told reporters during the Cabinet meeting after he unleashed on Putin that he did not know who did.\n\nTrump’s decision to resume supplying Ukraine against an onslaught of Russian drone and missile attacks reverses a Pentagon decision last week amid concerns of dwindling stocks of crucial weapons.\n\nLast week, Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said the pause in shipments to Ukraine and other countries was being done to assure military aid “aligns with our defense priorities.”\n\nBut after Trump announced arms shipments to Ukraine would resume, Parnell issued a statement that said while the framework of the review remains in effect, at Trump’s direction, the Pentagon “is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops.”\n\nThe Defense Department has not informed Congress that key weapons like Patriot interceptors are in critically short supply, a U.S. official briefed on the situation said.\n\nAt a State Department news briefing, spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said the United States has been and remains behind Ukraine. \"The president feels obviously very passionate and determined regarding the ability of Ukraine to defend itself,\" she said.\n\nTrump's war of words with Putin\n\nTrump's criticism of Putin has escalated as he nears the six-month mark in his term, in spite of the Russian leader's attempts to entice him with economic partnerships and even an exchange of movies \"promoting traditional values,\" a Kremlin readout of the two leaders' most recent conversation shows.\n\nTrump said in late May that Putin was \"playing with fire\" and had gone \"absolutely crazy,\" as he speculated that Russia wants to lay claim to all of Ukraine. The next month he said the war had been \"more difficult\" to resolve than other conflicts and called Putin \"misguided.\"\n\nIn a call July 3, Putin informed Trump he was willing to participate in negotiations but would not back down from his goals. Trump told reporters several days later, after a separate call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he was disappointed with the outcome.\n\n'We have to': Trump sending weapons to Ukraine after expressing disappointment with Putin\n\nAt his Cabinet meeting July 8 Trump used the most colorful language yet to describe his frustrations with Russian leader.\n\n\"We get a lot of bulls--t thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,\" Trump said. \"He’s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”\n\nUkraine seeks air defense weapons\n\nThat night, Zelenskyy said Ukraine mainly expected to receive air defense supplies. He added that he had instructed his defense team \"to intensify all contacts\" with their American counterparts.\n\n\"We now have the necessary political statements and decisions, and we must implement them as quickly as possible to protect our people and our positions,\" Zelenskyy announced July 8.\n\nUkraine needs defense missiles most urgently, especially those fired by the Pentagon’s Patriot system. They can intercept Russian missiles that have targeted the capital, Kyiv.\n\nPatriot interceptors and other weapons awaiting shipment to Ukraine had been held up in Poland last week when the Pentagon announced a worldwide review of its arsenals.\n\nThe Pentagon appears to have enough of the interceptors and other air defense weapons to continue supplying Ukraine, a U.S. official briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly said. It can begin immediate shipments of weapons in greater supply, such as artillery shells and anti-tank and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, the official said.\n\nRamping up munitions production ‘difficult’\n\nThe Army, which produces the most munitions of the military’s branches, said stockpiles are at an acceptable level, but it acknowledged that ramping up production of ammunition and Patriot interceptors is “difficult.”\n\nIncreasing production of Patriots, which are especially vital to Ukraine’s defense, “presents challenges,” Steve Warren, an Army spokesperson, told reporters July 8. The Army now produces 40,000 155mm shells of ammunition every month, but it is working toward increasing that number to 100,000 by mid-2026, he said.\n\nWarren said the question of how much weaponry the United States should have at any given time is “unanswerable.”\n\n“We are confident we have what we need to meet battlefield threats,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/07/09/trip-russia-shameful-fools-errand/766732002/", "title": "Trip to Russia was a shameful, fool's errand", "text": "Ross K. Baker\n\nFor USA Today\n\nUntil a few years ago, the only senior Republican who had anything good to say about Russia was California’s eccentric Rep. Dana Rohrbacher who, despite representing the John Birch Society’s old Orange County stamping ground, seemed totally beguiled by Russia and most particularly by Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut in 2016, he got the high-level affirmation for his dalliance with the oligarchs and poisoners in the Kremlin from then-presidential nominee Donald Trump, who initially maintained in the face of the unanimous opinion of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia made no effort to influence our last presidential election.\n\nTrump ultimately accepted the assessment but has continued to maintain that Russian interference had no impact on the outcome. Trump’s dismissive attitude towards the significance of Russian meddling appears to stem from his need to believe that he needed no outside assistance in his triumph over Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut now, at the very time that a preliminary report from the Senate Intelligence Committee points to clear and convincing evidence of Russian interference, a delegation of eight members of Trump’s party — seven senators and one House member — have trooped over to Moscow to be lectured to by Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and his sidekick former Russian ambassador to the United States and alleged part-time spy Sergei Kislyak. What could possibly have prompted seven senators and one congresswoman to abase themselves and, to make matters worse, do it on the Fourth of July?\n\nPerhaps the visit would have been less jarring if the police in West Wiltshire in the UK were not at the time in the process of tracking down the source of the poisoning of a British couple with the nerve agent Novichok, a signature Russian-produced pathogen that had been used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMoscow’s persistent efforts to disassociate itself from Novichok would be like the U.S. denying the American origin of the Big Mac. Did the eight lawmakers really think that the Russians would fold in the face of this display of congressional muscle and confess their efforts to dirty us up during the 2016 election? If so, they were stymied by the wall of belligerent denial they they encountered.\n\nMore disappointing was the membership of the group that included Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking senator in the Republican Party's Senate leadership. These prominent members along with well-regarded members like Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas have generally been regarded as sensible and level-headed, but in this instance managed to delude themselves into thinking that some good could be derived from sitting across the table from men who are virtuosos of deceit and obfuscation.\n\nPeople who strive to make distinctions between the president’s refusal to believe the Russians' capacity to act in bad faith and others in his party — notably those on Capitol Hill — who are less narcissistic and insecure must be having a hard time seeing this group as anything other than a collection of naive dupes who are giving the Russians one more public opportunity to restate their implausible denials of tampering with our democratic process.\n\nAre these senators not aware of the fact that under Vladimir Putin Russia has reverted to being an old-fashioned communist dictatorship minus the ideology but with the same paranoia, the same penchant for aggression and the same intolerance of political dissent? In their desire to achieve some kind of reset with Russia, did they choose to overlook the machinations of “Cozy Bear” and “Fancy Bear” and the other sinister trolls who contaminate the Internet? Are they not aware of the cyberattacks on neighbors like Estonia and Georgia or the continued armed aggression against another neighbor, Ukraine?\n\nFinally, there is the unfortunate fact that the mission to Moscow consisted only of Republicans. One redeeming feature of these congressional trips — typically derided as taxpayer-financed “junkets” — is that they are usually bipartisan. We don’t know whether Democrats were invited but declined because they were astute enough not to be used as props by Putin or that they just weren’t asked, but the effect of the all-GOP membership was to create the impression that they were acting as advance men to smooth things over before the upcoming Helsinki summit between Trump and Putin. Lacking the legitimacy of bipartisan membership and unrealistic in its objectives, the trip comes off looking like a fool’s errand.\n\nRoss K.

Aleprete\n\nYour Turn\n\nAI-assisted summary Putin will likely pressure Trump to force Ukraine to cede territory in Donetsk province in exchange for a ceasefire.\n\nThis mirrors Hitler's offer to Neville Chamberlain in 1938, where a small piece of Czechoslovakia was exchanged for \"peace in our time,\" ultimately leading to WWII.\n\nCeding this territory before a final settlement with strong security guarantees would weaken Ukraine's defenses and risk further conflict.\n\nTrump risks repeating Chamberlain's mistake and being remembered for appeasement, not peacemaking.\n\nHistory never exactly repeats itself, but the Aug. 15 summit meeting could come close if President Donald Trump is not careful to avoid the trap Putin has laid for him in Alaska. Putin is already tempting Trump with the prospect of peace in exchange for a small sliver of Ukrainian territory currently not under Russian occupation. In Alaska Putin will ask Trump to force Ukraine to abandon the portion of Donetsk province it still holds, in exchange for freezing the conflict.\n\nAt first glance this offer does not seem all that unreasonable. Donetsk is one of the two provinces Russia aided in the separatist conflict which emerged after the fall of Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Russia's military has been involved in the fighting there since 2014. Donetsk may very well be ceded to Russia as part of a final settlement, but that is not what Putin is asking for. Putin wants Trump to pressure Ukraine to surrender this territory immediately before a final settlement to the war is achieved.\n\nIn 1938 at the Munich Conference Adolph Hitler made a similar offer to another Western leader eager for peace. Back then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain accepted Hitler's proposal, exchanging a small sliver of Czechoslovakia for \"peace in our time.\" Chamberlain didn't overly consider the particulars of the territory he was being asked to concede. After all, Czechoslovakia was \"a far-away place\" and peace between the great powers seemed a much more important goal. So, Chamberlain gave away a small country's territory in exchange for an empty promise, and a little more than a year later World War II began. On Friday, Putin will make Trump a similar offer. While Chamberlain's appeasement has gone down in history as one of the greatest diplomatic blunders of all time, what is often missed in the story is the significance of the territory that he so lightly traded away.\n\nOn the surface, Germany's claim to the Sudetenland seemed somewhat reasonable; just as Russia's offer seems now. The territory was inhabited primarily by ethnic Germans. Yet Hitler was less concerned with his coethnics than he was with dominating Czechoslovakia completely. The Czechs were a small state, but they were no pushovers, and the Sudetenland, with its well-fortified mountainous territory, was key to their defense. Germany's army in 1938 would have had a very hard time assaulting Czechoslovakia with the Sudetenland still in Czech hands. Once Germany possessed this territory however Czechoslovakia's defense against future aggression became impossible.\n\nToday, the small strip of Donetsk province held by the Ukrainian army is part of Ukraine's fortress belt, a series of well-fortified towns and positions. The Ukrainians have invested heavily in this defensive line which has withstood countless Russian assaults over the past two years. Russia is paying a terrible price in men and equipment and they are not, despite recent limited gains, anywhere near breaking through its formidable defenses. Behind the fortress belt however lays terrain that is much more open and significantly less defensible. Putin, like Hitler before him, seeks to achieve by diplomacy what his army is likely unable to achieve by force.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn Alaska Putin and Trump may very well discuss the fate of Ukraine's fortress belt without Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelenskyy present, just as Hitler and Chamberlain met in 1938 without the presence of Czechoslovakia's representatives. Trump has already said both sides will likely have to trade territory for peace. Trump would do well to remember though that not all territory is equally valuable and not all peace agreements last.\n\nUkraine's last sliver of Donetsk remains crucial for the defense of the entire country. It cannot be given away prior to a final settlement of the conflict — a settlement that must include ironclad security guarantees from Europe and the United States so that Russia cannot restart the war.\n\nTrump wants the credit for bringing this war to an end. Doing so would be an incredibly significant accomplishment; something that his predecessors were unable to manage. However, Putin has laid a trap for him. If Trump leaves Alaska pressuring Ukraine to abandon the fortress belt before a final settlement is reached, he will like go down in history not as the man who ended this century's bloodiest conflict, but as its Neville Chamberlain — the man who sacrificed the ability of a small state to defend itself in exchanged for the empty promise of a dictator.\n\nMichael E.

Within days of losing the Falklands Islands War to the United Kingdom in 1982, Argentina's General Leopoldo Galtieri, the leader of the embattled military junta that had launched the war to head off popular demands for new elections, resigned his office and started the process of restoring democracy. To say that things have not ended well for many individual dictators who tried to add territorial aggrandizement to domestic oppression, from Benito Mussolini to Saddam Hussein, is putting it lightly.\n\nThat stark history surely weighs heavily on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been Russia's increasingly brutal authoritarian leader throughout nearly the entirety of the 21st century and whose disastrous war of choice in Ukraine entered its fourth year in February, a conflict that has failed to \"achieve almost any of his stated military objectives,\" said the Institute for the Study of War , \"despite an estimated 900,000 Russians killed and wounded.\" While Putin's regime is currently in no danger of being overthrown by Ukrainian tanks surrounding the Kremlin, the longer the war drags on without a decisive military breakthrough, the more likely it is that Putin could be subject to removal from rivals inside Russia, or perhaps even tossed aside by the Russian people themselves, who are no strangers to revolution.\n\nFor a few weeks in early 2025, it looked like newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump was throwing Putin a lifeline, publicly dressing down Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy in the White House, blaming the war on its Ukrainian victims and siding with Russia at the U.N. Security Council. But in March, Trump \"refused to acquiesce to Putin’s top demand,\" which was \"ending foreign military and intelligence aid to Ukraine,\" said the German Marshall Fund . Trump himself \"appears to be rapidly losing patience with a faltering peace process that is showing few signs of progress,\" said The Atlantic Council , although it remains unclear if he is \"prepared to turn up the pressure on Putin and increase the costs of continuing the invasion.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Meanwhile, the war grinds on, while Putin has had to rely on military reinforcements from North Korea , forging \"a marriage of convenience or even a marriage of desperation,\" said RAND . Putin has also had to lean on Iran, inverting the longstanding patron-client relationship between Moscow and Tehran. Iran has made \"substantial contributions to Russia's ground operations\" as well as \"delivered hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles to Russia,\" said the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . Neither of these developments is a sign of strength for Putin and his regime.\n\nThe Russian economy is also starting to groan under the weight of long-term sanctions and its wartime footing. While the Russian economy has \"repeatedly defied expectations\" since the beginning of the Ukraine war, even seeing significant GDP growth, Putin is fighting to \"manage a wartime economy\" that is struggling to combat \"rising inflation, sanctions pressure and record defense sector spending,\" said The Atlantic Council. With inflation approaching 9% and interest rates hiked to 23%, even Putin has been forced to admit \"that the country’s economy is overheating,\" said CNBC. Russia's economy is in \"an increasingly precarious state,\" said Reuters, despite contradictory claims from Moscow.\n\nAt 72, Putin is also entering the twilight of his life after dominating Russian politics for 25 years. A survey of more than 40 Russia experts conducted by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in July 2024 found that 40% believe Putin will remain in power until he dies, while 23% expect a \"palace coup.\" Just 3% of experts believe that Putin will ever leave voluntarily. But regardless of how it happens, there are several alternatives who may someday replace Putin as president of the Russian Federation. Putin himself \"constantly considers potential successors and confirmed he has a list of candidates,\" said the Kyiv Independent , citing an interview the Russian strongman conducted with \"pro-Russian state journalist Pavel Zarubin.\" Putin, unfortunately, did not reveal any names on his list.\n\nMikhail Mishustin\n\nRussia's 59-year-old prime minister would be a logical choice for successor, and not just because he would become the interim president should Putin step away before his term ends. Mishustin was also regarded as Putin's most likely successor by Russia experts in the RFE/RL survey. A trained economist, Mishustin spent a decade as head of the country's tax bureau before his appointment as prime minister in 2020. Mishustin has been muted about the Ukraine war, and focused largely on containing the fallout from Western sanctions placed on Russia since the February 2022 war began — but he was reportedly opposed to Putin's decision to invade. That might make him well-placed to keep the basic structures of the Russian authoritarian regime intact, while making a strategic retreat or settling on less favorable terms than Putin has been willing to countenance.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nSergei Sobyanin\n\nMoscow's long-time mayor, Sergei Sobyanin , has long been a rumored successor and was the second most popular choice among experts in the RFE/RL poll. The 66-year-old Sobyanin was born in Russia's Tyumen region and before embarking on a political career in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, worked in a metal pipe factory. A former regional governor who also served as Deputy Prime Minister of Russia between 2008 and 2010, Sobyanin is a close Putin ally and a member of his United Russia political party. His rise to prominence was helped by his \"ability to toe whatever lines Putin has set on key aspects of Russia's internal policies while staying mum on some of the tricky-to-navigate external policies,\" said Olga Kiyan of Russia Matters . What makes him a top-tier contender to lead Russia after Putin is his success in keeping \"Russia's capital running smoothly through mass opposition protests, the disastrous Covid pandemic and now regular Ukrainian drone attacks,\" said the Agence France Presse .\n\nDmitry Medvedev\n\nMedvedev, 59, served four years as Russia's president from 2008 to 2012 before stepping aside for Putin in what was later revealed to be a prearranged agreement. The Leningrad native and former law professor is perhaps Putin's longest-standing ally, and he accepted the subordinate role of Prime Minister from 2012 to 2020. Now the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, Medvedev has struck a belligerent tone about the war in Ukraine. \"This conflict will last for a very long time. For decades, probably,\" he recently said to Russian news agencies, per Reuters . He has also threatened a preemptive nuclear strike if Ukraine were to try to acquire its own nuclear stockpile. Questions remain, however, about whether someone who has been so subservient to Putin for so long could take or consolidate power. The Spectator 's Mark Galeotti recounted a joke purportedly making the rounds in Moscow, in which Medvedev looks for the steering wheel in a car and Putin pulls out a remote control from the passenger seat and announces he'll be the one driving.\n\nSergei Kiriyenko\n\nPutin's 62-year-old first deputy chief of staff is a jack-of-all-trades who was most recently given the job of managing the sham referenda in the regions Russia seized from Ukraine in 2022. In the 1990s, Kiriyenko was known as a liberal reformer, so much so that then-President Boris Yeltsin made him the country's youngest-ever prime minister in 1998. But Kiriyenko's tenure coincided with the country's worst post-Soviet financial crisis, and he was forced to step down after four months. During his brief turn in office, Kiriyenko made the fateful decision to appoint Putin as the head of the FSB, the successor institution to the KGB. Kiriyenko is working hard \"to make himself an irreplaceable cog in the wheels of power,\" said Carnegie Politika . As a Putin inner-circler, Kiriyenko would likely only get the top job if the succession process was managed by Putin or his allies.\n\nAlexei Dyumin\n\nDyumin, 52, cut his teeth as Putin's bodyguard in the 1990s before ascending to play various roles inside the Russian state, including deputy director of the military intelligence bureau GRU, governor of Tula Oblast and now Secretary of the State Council. Dyumin was instrumental in spiriting pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych out of the country in 2014 after a pro-democracy uprising in Kyiv, and then served as a special forces commander in the successful operation to seize Crimea from Ukraine. Once a deputy to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, extensive rumors said Dyumin would take the place of his former boss, though he did not ultimately get the position. Dyumin's rise to power is emblematic of how Putin operates, identifying allies and then shuffling them from one position of authority to another inside the sprawling Russian state. This points to a \"creeping process of late as the people closest to Putin,\" including bodyguards, \"start getting appointed to key positions,\" said Mark Galeotti at War on the Rocks . If Putin were to step aside voluntarily, Dyumin \"would be a top contender, thanks both to his long-time proximity to the Russian leader and his versatile professional experience,\" said the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies .\n\nNikolai Patrushev\n\nUntil May 2024 , Patrushev was the secretary of Russia's Security Council. He was also a leading proponent of the idea that there is a Western conspiracy to weaken or possibly break up the Russian Federation. The 73-year-old has known Putin since they worked together in the KGB, and became a major strategist in both the 2014 and 2022 invasions of Ukraine. \"His ideas form the foundations of decisions taken by Putin. He is one of the few figures Putin listens to,\" said Tatiana Stanovaya to The Washington Post in 2022. \"Washington and London are again conniving with Nazism and fascism,\" Patrushev said in a March 2023 interview with Russian newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta . \"They have no qualms about using Ukraine to set Europe or the entire world ablaze in a belief that they can get away with anything.\" During the war, Patrushev traveled widely, seeking to shore up Russia's diplomatic position and playing a critical role in managing the alliance with China. But after he was replaced on Russia's Security Council by Sergei Shoigu, Patrushev's star seems to have dimmed. Patrushev's 47-year-old son Dmitry , currently deputy prime minister for agriculture, is another rumored Putin successor. The younger Patrushev has \"has made a dizzying career\" and \"regularly attends Kremlin meetings with Putin,\" said RFE/RL .\n\nOther possibilities\n\nBefore his 2023 assassination, Wagner Group mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin would also have been considered a potential successor; but in Putin's Russia, it is dangerous to be seen as having too much ambition. One name that has vaulted to the top of the potential successors list is Andrei Belousov , who was named Russia's new defense minister in May 2024. An economist by training, the 66-year-old Belousov had served as first deputy prime minister from 2021 until his appointment as defense minister. Another close Putin ally, Belousov would likely carry on with most of Putin's policies both inside and outside of Russia. The change at the defense ministry likely means that Sergei Shoigu, the outgoing minister, is on the outs with Putin, particularly given the trajectory of the war he had been tasked with overseeing. Shoigu did not receive any votes in the RFE/RL survey of Putin successors despite his appointment as Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.\n\nThere is also 66-year-old Dmitry Kozak , a former deputy prime minister and now deputy Kremlin chief of staff, who reportedly worked out an agreement with Ukraine prior to the war that Putin rejected.\n\nIn the event of a full rupture of the regime itself, of course, the list of possibilities would not be limited to Putin loyalists and other Kremlin insiders. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny would have once been the most prominent politician who could seek to lead a post-Putin Russia, but he died in prison in February 2024. Putin has had some opposition leaders, like Boris Nemtsov, assassinated , while others, like tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, live in exile.", "authors": ["David Faris", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/politics/donald-trump-liv-golf-pga-tour", "title": "Analysis: The real reason Donald Trump is on board with LIV Golf ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump is not one to quibble about ethics when money is on the line.\n\nIn business, he has always lived by a simple principle: All that matters is winning. And winning is judged by who has the most money.\n\nWhich brings me to Monday – and a post from Trump on his Truth Social site.\n\n“All of those golfers that remain ‘loyal’ to the very disloyal PGA, in all of its different forms, will pay a big price when the inevitable MERGER with LIV comes, and you get nothing but a big ‘thank you’ from PGA officials who are making Millions of Dollars a year,” Trump wrote. “If you don’t take the money now, you will get nothing after the merger takes place, and only say how smart the original signees were.”\n\nLet’s take a quick step back.\n\nLIV Golf, a brand new rival to the PGA Tour, receives money from a Saudi-backed sovereign wealth fund and is paying high-profile golfers exorbitant sums to play in its events. So far, it has recruited a handful of big names, most notably Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson. Golf legend Greg Norman has been leading the LIV efforts.\n\nIt’s caused an outcry among human right advocates who note that the Saudi regime has a history of repressive behavior and has been linked by the US intelligence community to the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 in Istanbul.\n\nMickelson acknowledged that the Saudis are “scary motherf******” in an interview for a book on his life, but added: “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates. The Tour likes to pretend it’s a democracy, but it’s really a dictatorship. They divide and conquer.”\n\nTrump, of course, has selfish motives for promoting the LIV Tour. His golf courses are scheduled to host not one, but two LIV events this year – a tournament at his Bedminster, New Jersey, course later this month and the final event of the LIV season at his Doral, Florida, course in October.\n\nHis involvement with LIV is about revenge too.\n\nTrump’s Bedminster course was supposed to host the 2022 PGA Championship, a major sign that Trump – always desperate for the approval of the golfing elites – had finally made it.\n\nBut in the wake of the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, the PGA voted to strip Bedminster of the tournament, eventually moving it to Southern Hills in Oklahoma.\n\nSpeaking to Golf Digest earlier this year, Trump expressed shock that the tournament was taken from him, before touting the role he would play with the LIV tour.\n\n“I made a deal with them,” Trump said of the LIV executives. “They’re very good people. They’re very fine people. Greg Norman’s been a total gentleman, you know, and he’s wanted to do this for years and now he has the right backers because, you know, [the Saudi money] is unlimited. They can do the job right. I think when you put up first-place prize money for $6 or $7 million, I think a lot of people are gonna be showing up, to be honest with you.”\n\nNowhere did Trump mention the murder of Khashoggi or the protests from the families of 9/11 victims that he and others who participate in LIV events are effectively “sportswashing” Saudi Arabia in exchange for massive financial windfalls. (While the Saudi government has not been directly linked to the 9/11 attacks, 15 of the 19 men who hijacked planes that day were Saudi nationals. The Saudi government has denied any involvement.)\n\nTrump has never let ethics get in the way of a good business deal. And if he’s able to punish his enemies along the way, all the better.\n\nThat’s why it makes perfect sense that Trump has sided with LIV Golf: He can make money, get attention and hurt the PGA Tour along the way. That’s the trifecta in Trump’s world – ethical concerns be damned.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/politics/trump-liv-golf-tournament-saudi-arabia", "title": "LIV Golf: Controversial Saudi-backed golf tournament to begin ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe top controversies upending both the sporting world and international relations are coming together this week at Donald Trump’s New Jersey golf club, with the former President stepping right in the middle of the drama.\n\nStarting Friday, Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster will host the third event for LIV Golf, the new Saudi-backed professional circuit that has rocked the sport’s main professional organizer, the PGA Tour, by pulling away big-name golfers with larger, guaranteed paydays.\n\nIn the run-up to this weekend’s tournament, Trump has promoted the event in interviews and public statements, encouraging golfers to join LIV Golf and disparaging the PGA Tour.\n\n“Just arrived in Bedminster for the big LIV Tour Golf Tournament,” he posted Wednesday on Truth Social, the social media site he created. “Record money to winners, great excitement. Come on out on Friday, Saturday or Sunday to watch the great play by the best players!”\n\nTrump is benefitting from his professional relationship with LIV Golf, especially after officials at PGA of America pulled the 2022 PGA Championship from Bedminster following the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. In October, LIV Golf will hold its final competition of the year at another Trump property, Trump National Doral in South Florida.\n\nBut while activists, media outlets and others have expressed concerns that LIV Golf provides international legitimacy to the ruling regime in Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of human rights violations for years, Trump has brushed aside such criticisms.\n\nDuring an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, he spoke approvingly about how the golf tour, which is financed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, has already improved the kingdom’s reputation.\n\n“I think LIV has been a great thing for Saudi Arabia, for the image of Saudi Arabia,” Trump told the Journal.\n\nA spokesman for Trump did not respond to questions from CNN.\n\nHuman rights groups and media organizations have questioned both LIV Golf’s organizers and players over the tour’s connection to Saudi Arabia. Several of those questions have centered around the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nA US intelligence report released last year determined that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the operation to capture or kill the Saudi journalist, confirming reports soon after the murder that the CIA had made the same conclusion. During his presidency, however, Trump publicly downplayed allegations that bin Salman was involved as his administration strengthened US ties with the Saudis.\n\nBut LIV Golf’s event at Bedminster has also raised the ire of some survivors and families of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Speaking on Tuesday at a press conference near Bedminster, Terry Strada, chair of 9/11 Families United, said the group was “appalled” by the “offensive, disrespectful and hurtful” tournament at Trump’s club, which is just 50 miles from the site of the 2001 New York attack. Strada said she was “very disappointed” in Trump, but noted that he was not the main target of the group’s criticism.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN at his club Thursday, Trump reiterated that he has been “friends” with people in Saudi Arabia for a “long time.”\n\n“Frankly, what they’re doing for golf is so great. What they’re doing for the players is so great,” the former President said.\n\nAsked what he would say to the families of 9/11 victims who are protesting the LIV Golf event, Trump appeared to question whether there was knowledge of the Saudi involvement in the terrorist attacks.\n\n“Nobody’s gotten to the bottom of 9/11, unfortunately, and they should have, as to the maniacs that did that horrible thing to our city, to our country, to the world,” he said. “So nobody’s really been there. But I can tell you that there are a lot of really great people that are out here today.”\n\nFollowing Trump’s remarks, Strada told CNN that the former President “knows full well it was the Kingdom. He did everything in his power to protect the kingdom while in office by reneging on a promise he made to 9/11 families he would declassify FBI reports re: Saudis involvement in 9/11.”\n\nThe new circuit has drawn criticism from the PGA Tour, which has suspended players who have signed on with LIV Golf, as well as from some of golf’s biggest stars, including Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. The allure of LIV Golf for the sport’s top athletes – including larger purses and guaranteed payouts – threatens the PGA Tour’s dominance and seems to have caught the legacy organization off guard.\n\nTrump himself seems to be relishing the damage to the PGA Tour, with which he’s had a rocky relationship. While his clubs have hosted events for the PGA and other professional golf events in the past, the PGA Tour has not held an event at a Trump property since a March 2016 tournament at Doral. And after stripping Bedminster of the 2022 PGA Championship, the organization has been squarely in Trump’s sights.\n\n“All of those golfers that remain ‘loyal’ to the very disloyal PGA, in all of its different forms, will pay a big price when the inevitable MERGER with LIV comes, and you get nothing but a big ‘thank you’ from PGA officials who are making Millions of Dollars a year,” Trump wrote last week in a post on Truth Social. “If you don’t take the money now, you will get nothing after the merger takes place, and only say how smart the original signees were.”\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has spoken out about professional sports since entering politics. During his presidency, he frequently criticized the National Football League for allowing players to protest during the national anthem. And last year, Trump joined other Republicans in calling on Americans to boycott Major League Baseball after the league moved its All-Star Game from Atlanta following a new Georgia election law.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Michael Warren"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}]}

Thom Tillis said he wouldn't seek reelection in 2026 after Trump threatened to support a primary opponent. Tillis voted against the bill.\n\nThe GOP Senate bill would cut more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, while extending 2017 tax cuts, pouring funds into Homeland Security and increasing the national debt.\n\nWASHINGTON – The Senate was still voting and negotiating early Tuesday, July 1, on President Donald Trump’s sweeping bill on tax cuts, Medicaid, and border security, after a marathon weekend of caustic debate and political maneuvering, but the result still wasn't certain.\n\nSeventeen long hours after they began, Republican senators are trying to resolve disagreements over policies that would impact Medicaid, green energy tax credits, and carve-outs to protect food stamps in Alaska and Hawaii before bringing them up for a vote.\n\nRepublicans hold a 53-47 majority and face united Democratic opposition and the defection of at least two of their members. If the Senate approves the bill, it heads back to the House, where votes are scheduled to begin July 2.\n\nSens. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, and Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, voted against even debating the bill. A third GOP opponent would force Vice President JD Vance to break the tie. A fourth could kill the bill.\n\nPresident Trump earlier in the evening pushed GOP senators to pass the bill, while attacking his biggest campaign contributor and former DOGE leader Elon Musk over his opposition.\n\nThe Senate bill is projected to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, $800 billion more than the House version, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nSenators pull AI regulation ban from bill\n\nA controversial provision in the Senate version of Trump’s bill would have restricted states from enforcing any regulation on artificial intelligence. Nineteen hours into a marathon series of votes, senators overwhelmingly voted to strike the measure.\n\nThe AI regulation ban had been a sticking point for some Republicans, including Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who led the effort to remove it.\n\nHer amendment to take the moratorium out of the mega tax and spending bill passed 99 to 1. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, was the lone no.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate rejects Sen. Collins' amendment to boost tax rate\n\nThe Senate rejected an amendment from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would implement a higher 39.6% tax rate for couples making more than $50 million per year or individuals making more than $25 million per year.\n\nThe amendment was defeated 78-22, which included all but a handful of Democrats voting against it. They argued that Republicans aimed to paper over a larger problem they were creating. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, called it \"a band-aid on an amputation.\"\n\nThe highest current income tax rate is 37% for individuals who make more than $609,351.\n\nThe amendment would have also doubled a proposed fund for rural hospitals, which would suffer under the proposed cuts to Medicaid, to $50 billion.\n\n\"When these facilities close their doors, the people they serve are often left behind without access to healthcare. This amendment would help keep them open,\" Collins said, adding that it is paid for by a \"modest\" increase in the top tax rate.\n\nIt's unclear whether the amendment's failure means Collins won't vote for the final package. She is considered a key swing vote on the bill. Republicans can only lose 3 GOP senators and still pass it.\n\n-- Riley Beggin\n\nPresident Trump slams Musk in late-night post\n\nTrump amped up his feud with former advisor Elon Musk in a late-night post on Truth Social.\n\n\"Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate,\" Trump wrote on the social media platform.\n\n\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,\" Trump wrote. \"No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our country would save a FORTUNE.\"\n\nMusk has been critical of the GOP bill, which would eliminate subsidies for electric vehicles. Musk is the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.\n\n-- Riley Beggin\n\nRepublican lawmakers negotiate key portions of Trump's bill\n\nThe U.S. Senate has been slowly grinding through doomed Democratic motions to send the GOP bill back to committee since 9 a.m.\n\nWhat's the holdup? Republican senators are trying to resolve disagreements over policies that would impact Medicaid, green energy tax credits, and carve-outs to protect food stamps in Alaska and Hawaii before bringing them up for a vote.\n\nFailure to find consensus on these issues may jeopardize the bill, as each speaks to key constituencies needed to pass it. Once a deal is reached, the Senate is expected to speed up its votes on amendments, culminating in a final vote on the package that will likely come early Tuesday.\n\n-- Riley Beggin\n\nTrump bill to block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood\n\nA provision to block Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood will remain in Trump’s legislative package under a ruling from the Senate parliamentarian, which Democrats decried for blocking women's access to reproductive health care.\n\nThe bill doesn’t mention Planned Parenthood but it prohibits clinics that offer abortions from accepting Medicaid for their other reproductive healthcare services, which applies to the group.\n\nThe provision is estimated to save the government $52 million over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled it was qualified to remain in the bill in which every item must have a budgetary impact.\n\n“Between their backdoor abortion ban, gutting Medicaid and taking food out of the mouths of hungry kids, Republicans just officially became the party of ‘let them die,’” Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee overseeing Medicaid, said in a social media post.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nElon Musk vows to defeat Republicans who vote for Trump's mega bill\n\nMusk escalated his criticism of Trump's tax and budget mega-bill as the Senate took up the legislation, warning that he would boost primary challenges to defeat Republican lawmakers who vote for the legislation.\n\n\"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\" Musk wrote. \"And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\"\n\nMusk, the richest man in the world and former top White House adviser, unleashed a flurry of posts on June 30 on X attacking the bill, the centerpiece of Trump's domestic agenda, over the tech entrepreneur's well-documented concerns the bill will increase the national debt.\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nWill Trump visit 'Alligator Alcatraz'? FAA notice hints at presidential stop\n\nWhite House brushes off Tillis criticism: ‘He is just wrong’\n\nThe White House brushed off harsh criticism from Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who warned on the Senate floor that passing the tax and budget legislation would betray Trump’s promise to protect Medicaid.\n\n“He is just wrong,” Leavitt said of Tillis during a briefing with reporters. “And the vast majority of Republicans who are supportive of this legislation are right. This bill protects Medicaid.”\n\nThe White House has argued new work and other eligibility requirements for Medicaid - which more than 71 million low-income Americans rely on for health care – will “strengthen” the program.\n\nBut the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the Senate version of the reconciliation bill would leave 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034 by cutting about $1 trillion form the program. The CBO had estimated 10.9 million people would lose Medicaid under the House proposal.\n\nAmid his opposition to Trump’s signature legislation, Tillis announced he won’t seek reelection for his Senate seat in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nAsked whether Tillis’ position is a reason for concern about the bill’s passage, Leavitt said: “No, it is not. We’re confident that this bill is going to be back at the White House by the 4th of July.”\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nMusk continues to rail against Trump’s bill\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk criticized Trump’s bill as the Senate undergoes its marathon voting session, and called for a new political party.\n\n“It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country – the PORKY PIG PARTY!!” he wrote in a June 30 post on X. “Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people.”\n\nMusk, the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency, had previously quieted his harsh criticism of Trump and the legislation after his departure from government.\n\nBut he blasted the bill on June 28 less than an hour before the Senate was prepared to hold a critical vote to begin debate, arguing that it was “utterly insane and destructive.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, Musk targeted the right-wing House Freedom Caucus.\n\n\"How can you call yourself the Freedom Caucus if you vote for a DEBT SLAVERY bill with the biggest debt ceiling increase in history?\"\n\nHe tagged Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, a Republican from Maryland, and Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican from Texas.\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi and Bart Jansen\n\nHouse hardliners oppose Senate bill\n\nIf and when Trump’s sweeping tax and domestic policy bill passes the Senate, House lawmakers must give it a final stamp of approval. But getting the bill out of the House won’t be an easy task for House Speaker Mike Johnson, especially as Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline nears.\n\nSome conservative House members have already come out against the Senate bill.\n\nAn analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found the Senate bill would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. That’s a nearly one trillion dollar increase from the House version, which would add $2.4 trillion to the debt.\n\n“I will not negotiate via X. But it’s important to know that jamming us with a bill before we’ve had any chance to review the implications of major changes & re-writes, fluid scores, a high likelihood of violating the house framework (deficits) , & tons of swamp buy-offs is bad,” Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy said in a June 28 post on X.\n\nRoy is the policy chair of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus. The caucus includes other high-profile Republican firebrands such as Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado.\n\n“The Senate must make major changes and should at least be in the ballpark of compliance with the agreed upon House budget framework,” the caucus wrote in a June 30 tweet on X. “Republicans must do better.”\n\nThe GOP is working with small majorities in both the House and Senate, and can't afford more than a few defections.\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBleary Fetterman: ‘I just want to go home’\n\nPennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman told reporters he doesn’t know when the marathon voting session will wrap up. But, he added, he wants a vacation.\n\n“Oh my God, I just want to go home…I've missed our entire trip to the beach,” he said, noting his family will be back before the Senate takes the bill across the finish line.\n\n“And again, I'm going to vote 'No.' There's no drama. The votes are going to go…I don't think it's really helpful to put people here till some ungodly hour,” he said.\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi\n\nModerate GOP senators try to protect clean energy credits\n\nModerate Senate Republicans are planning to put forward an amendment to the GOP bill that would slow the phase-out of clean energy tax credits, Politico reported.\n\nOne amendment from Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, would exempt projects that have already started construction.\n\nIt reflects a key fracture in the GOP conference on the sweeping bill: Several moderate Republicans have urged leaders to be softer on the clean energy credits that passed under former President Joe Biden, while fiscal conservatives have pushed for them to be eliminated quickly to balance out some of the costs of their proposed massive tax cuts.\n\nThe Senate's version sided with the fiscal hawks, cutting multiple credits and creating new taxes on renewable projects.\n\n--Riley Beggin\n\nSusan Collins proposes tax increase on ultra-rich\n\nThe Senate will soon vote on an amendment from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would implement a higher 39.6% tax rate for couples making more than $50 million per year or individuals making more than $25 million per year.\n\nThe highest current income tax rate is 37% for individuals who make more than $609,351.\n\nThe amendment would also double a proposed fund for rural hospitals − which would suffer under the proposed cuts to Medicaid − to $50 billion.\n\n“I would say that’s dead on arrival,” Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said of Collins’ amendment.\n\nCollins is one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans up for reelection in 2026 and is considered a key swing vote in the GOP-controlled Senate. Asked if she had the votes, Collins said, \"I don't know. It's hard to predict.\"\n\n--Riley Beggin\n\nWhat’s with Trump's July 4 deadline?\n\nTrump has told Republicans in Congress he wants the tax, spending and policy bill on his desk by July 4, hence the current hurry on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe deadline imposed by Trump is more political than procedural. “The president wants that,” Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said. “But for us, it’s a matter of getting it done before there is any issue with the debt ceiling itself.”\n\nThe real deadlines to get provisions passed are near the end of summer, when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned the federal government is in danger of hitting its debt limit, and at the end of this year when Trump’s 2017 tax cuts are set to expire.\n\n--Savannah Kuchar\n\nProtesters lay out caskets over Medicaid cuts\n\nMore than 250 people protested across from the Capitol at the steps of the Supreme Court.\n\nSurrounded by over 50 caskets covered with statistics of how many people would lose Medicaid and SNAP in each state, the crowd of faith leaders and religious believers who protest outside the Capitol as part of \"Moral Monday\" demonstractions chanted \"you will not kill us and our people without a fight.\"\n\n--Sarah D. Wire\n\n12 million to lose Medicaid under Senate GOP bill\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Senate version of the budget reconciliation bill would leave 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034. Previously, the CBP estimated 10.9 million people would lose Medicaid under the House proposal.\n\nBut Senate Republicans concerned with the swelling national debt forced additional cuts to Medicaid benefits – more than $1 trillion worth.\n\nThe Senate included an amendment that would not only slash the program writ large – as House Republicans wanted – but would also reduce the federal share of Medicaid spending for people enrolled through state-level expansions of the Affordable Care Act. The expansions made more people eligible for subsidized insurance.\n\n\"The Senate bill will cut health care more deeply than the House bill and leave more people uninsured,\" Sarah Lueck, vice president at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a June 29 post on X.\n\nStates would be forced to pay more to maintain their Medicaid expansions over this period as a result, she said.\n\nRepublican-led Florida and Texas each have more than 1 million residents on Medicaid, among the highest in the country. But many other Republican-led states have some of the lowest levels of coverage by private insurers, and Medicaid is a staple for hundreds of thousands of residents of Louisiana, South Carolina, and Georgia, among others.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, blasted the proposed cuts in a firey speech on the Senate floor June 29. \"What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding is not there?\" he said.\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities now estimates that health care costs to people covered by Medicaid could go up dramatically as well, pushing the number of people who might lose coverage to near 17 million.\n\n--Lauren Villagran\n\nTrump foe Thom Tillis still opposed to mega bill\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, remains a key holdout in the ongoing Senate process.\n\n“I’m still focused on the devastating impact on Medicaid,” he told reporters while walking into the chamber the morning of June 30.\n\nTillis, a persistent thorn in Trump’s side, announced over the weekend he will not seek re-election next year.\n\n“The choice is between spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with the love of my life Susan, our two children, three beautiful grandchildren, and the rest of our extended family back home,” Tillis said in a statement June 29.\n\n“It’s not a hard choice.”\n\n--Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate's marathon vote-before-the-vote is underway\n\nSenators have officially kicked off what will be an hours-long series of votes, known in Washington lingo as a vote-a-rama, on amendments to Trump’s mega bill.\n\nThe marathon prefaces a final vote on the legislation package, expected sometime July 1.\n\nTypical vote-a-ramas see a bevy of amendment proposals from the opposing party, and Democrats appear poised to raise their share this time around.\n\nHowever, some Republicans, still wary about the bill as is, are expected to put their own amendments up for consideration as well.\n\n--Savannah Kuchar\n\nDHS wins big in GOP bill\n\nOne House proposal the Senate didn't touch: a plan to surge money to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe parent agency of ICE and the Border Patrol stands to gain $169 billion under the current bill, more than doubling the department's current budget of $68 billion.\n\nThe surge in resources would fund Trump's mass deportation campaign, paying for thousands more deportation agents and new detention centers.\n\nIt would also “provide ICE enough money to become by 2029 the largest interior federal law enforcement agency and the nation's largest jailer,\" said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.\n\nThe new money would give billions to state and local governments to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he said.\n\nAmong the DHS appropriations: $45.6 billion for a \"big, beautiful wall,\" as Trump likes to call the 30-foot steel border barriers erected at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nRon Johnson, R-Wisconsin, had previously called into question the need for so much money for border fencing. He said in May committee that, at an estimated $14 million a mile, DHS could build more than 3,000 miles of border fence with that kind of money.\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico border only runs 1,950 miles from California to Texas; roughly 700 miles of the border is already fenced off.\n\n--Lauren Villagran\n\nTrump warns Republicans against cutting too deep\n\nAs bleary senators worked through the massive GOP bill, Trump warned Republicans against going overboard on unpopular cuts.\n\nThe bill calls for $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and would cause 11.8 million people to lose health insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nEarly on June 30, Trump urged caution, suggesting future economic growth would make up for deficits.\n\n\"For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before.\"\n\n--Dan Morrison\n\nGOP, Democrats disagree over how many trillions bill adds to deficit\n\nOne of the first votes will determine the cost – at least for the legislative debate – of a centerpiece of the legislation: an extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.\n\nSenators are divided over how to count the projected $4 trillion cost of extending the cuts, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nRepublicans ignored that cost by arguing nobody expects the tax cuts to expire at the end of the year as scheduled. They contend the overall bill will reduce the federal debt $500 billion through economic growth.\n\nDemocrats challenged that interpretation, calling it “fake math.” But Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the chamber so they are expected to win the vote and the argument.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTillis won't seek reelection after opposing Trump bill\n\nTillis announced June 29 he will not seek reelection in 2026, after Trump threatened to find a Republican primary opponent against him in North Carolina for opposing his legislative package.\n\n\"As many of my colleagues have noticed over the last year, and at times even joked about, I haven't exactly been excited about running for another term,\" Tillis said, adding that retiring in a divided time for the nation was \"not a hard choice.\"\n\nTrump welcomed the decision.\n\n\"Great News! 'Senator' Thom Tillis will not be seeking reelection,\" Trump said in a social media post.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWhat's in the bill?\n\nBesides extending the 2017 tax cuts, Trump campaigned on provisions in the legislation to end taxes on tips for employees such as waiters through 2028 and for overtime pay. The Senate capped the deduction at $25,000 and weakened the break for individuals with income above $150,000.\n\nFor border security, the bill would increase funding about $150 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. The bill authorizes $45 billion for new detention centers as Trump ramps up arrests and $27 billion for a mass deportation campaign.\n\nA crucial provision would increase the amount the country can borrow by $5 trillion. The country's debt is already approaching $37 trillion and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned the current limit on borrowing will be reached in August.\n\n--Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/14/8-ways-trump-big-beautiful-bill-affects-iowa-medicaid-rural-hospitals-biofuels/84519501007/", "title": "8 ways Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' will affect Iowans, from rural ...", "text": "Big changes are coming to Iowans’ health care, taxes, nutrition assistance, energy generation and student loans — courtesy of President Donald Trump’s \"One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.\"\n\nTrump signed the law July 4 in a ceremony at the White House after all six of Iowa’s Republican members of Congress voted for the legislation.

Several parts of the package are still being negotiated and are likely to shift right up until the full House votes.\n\nA slim GOP margin on taxing, spending bill\n\nThe margins are slim: Because no Democrats are expected to support the proposal, House Republicans can lose only three GOP votes to pass it.\n\nEven then, the legislation is still far from the finish line. Once it gets through the House, it will likely have to go through committees and a floor vote in the Senate before it is once again reconciled with the House and sent to the president. The policy details may be tweaked at any point along the way.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has said he wants to pass the bill before Memorial Day.\n\n\"I am absolutely convinced we're going to get this in final form and pass it in accordance with our original deadline,\" he told reporters on May 18.\n\nHere are some of the more important pieces of the bill, as they are currently written.\n\nAmped up border security\n\nThe bill includes more than $140 billion in spending on the Trump administration's plan to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nThat includes $50 billion for completing the wall on the southern border, $45 billion for detention centers, $8 billion to hire more immigration officers, and $14 billion for deportations.\n\nBoosted defense spending\n\nThe bill includes around $150 billion more in defense spending, which could increase as it goes through the Senate.\n\nThe current proposal includes $20 billion that would go, in part, to creating a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system that Trump has promoted.\n\nChanges could push 7.6 million off Medicaid\n\nMedicaid, the program that provides health insurance to more than 71 million low-income Americans, would undergo big changes if the bill remains as is.\n\nHouse Republicans have proposed changes that would save at least $625 billion and cause 7.6 million Americans to lose their health insurance over the next 10 years, according to initial estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe bill would implement work requirements for adults enrolled in Medicaid expansion and increase the frequency of eligibility checks to ensure people still qualify for the program.\n\nThe proposal would also bar Medicaid from funding services at clinics that also perform abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and discourages states from using their own funds to provide Medicaid coverage to undocumented children.\n\nFood assistance work requirements\n\nThe proposal would implement new requirements in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, which provides food assistance to around 42 million Americans.\n\nThat would save up to $300 billion over the next ten years and shift more of the cost of the program to states.\n\nThe Republican plan would implement new work requirements for people ages 55 to 64, require states to provide more funding for the program for the first time, limit SNAP eligibility to citizens and lawful permanent residents − and prevent future presidential administrations from increasing benefits without Congressional approval.\n\n$2 trillion in tax breaks\n\nRepublicans want to make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a bill passed during Trump's first term that lowered taxes for all income brackets but disproportionately benefitted the highest earners.\n\nThe cuts implemented in 2017 expire at the end of the year. If they are not extended, income tax rates will go up for all but two income brackets next year.\n\nThis is the most expensive provision in the bill and is expected to cost over $2 trillion over the next ten years alone.\n\nNo tax on tips, overtime, car loan interest\n\nTwo of Trump's major campaign promises – no taxes on tips or on overtime wages – are included in the bill.\n\nWorkers could claim the tax deduction through 2028. Both include guardrails to stop \"highly compensated employees\" from claiming the deduction, and the tipped work specifies what kind of occupations are eligible, such as people serving food or providing beauty services.\n\nBoth provisions also require workers to list their Social Security number when they claim the deduction, which bars undocumented workers from claiming it.\n\nThe bill would also allow people to temporarily deduct up to $10,000 in car loan interest payments if they buy an American-made vehicle. The total deduction amount would decrease for people who make more than $100,000, or $200,000 filing jointly.\n\nRaising the debt ceiling\n\nThe United States Treasury expects the country will hit the debt ceiling in August. In order to avoid a catastrophic default on the national debt, Congress will have to approve an increase in the debt ceiling. This legislation raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.\n\nExpanded child tax credit\n\nThe bill would increase the child tax credit to $2,500 through 2028. It would drop to $2,000 after that.\n\nThe child tax credit is currently $2,000 but will go back to $1,000 at the end of this year if not extended.\n\nExtra money for seniors\n\nPeople over age 65 could deduct an additional $4,000 from their taxes if they make less than $75,000 or $150,000 filing jointly. People who make more than that are eligible for smaller deductions as their income increases. The deduction would last through 2028.\n\nGreen energy roll-backs\n\nThe bill would rescind several climate change-related provisions of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, including a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles.\n\nIt would pull back unspent money for several grant and loan programs at the Energy Department and Environmental Protection Agency, delay methane fees for oil and gas companies, repeal additional rules encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles, and accelerate permitting for fossil fuel projects.\n\n'MAGA' savings accounts\n\nChildren under 8 years old would be given $1,000 each for their parents to open \"money accounts for growth and investment,\" also known as a \"MAGA\" savings account.\n\nParents, other relatives and non-profits could contribute $5,000 annually to the account tax free until the child is 18, when a portion of the funds can be used for higher education, training programs, buying a home or starting a small business until age 30, when the funds would become unrestricted.\n\nMore SALT\n\nState and local tax deductions, also known as SALT, allows people to write off a portion of their local taxes from what they owe the federal government.\n\nThe 2017 tax law capped that deduction at $10,000. But now a handful of Republican members from high-tax states like California, New York and New Jersey are pushing to raise it.\n\nThe proposed bill would raise that cap to $30,000. However, the group of blue-state Republicans says it is not enough and is negotiating with Johnson to boost it further. That number is likely to rise before the bill is passed out of the House.\n\nTaxing private university endowments\n\nThe bill would increase taxes on private university endowments.\n\nThe rate would jump significantly for schools with higher rates for larger endowments, like those held by elite schools such as Harvard University.\n\nFor example, schools with endowments of more than $500,000 but less than $750,000 per student would be taxed at 1.4%, while schools with endowments of more than $2 million per student would be taxed at 21%.\n\nPrivate school vouchers\n\nThe bill would allow the federal government to spend $5 billion per year for the next four years on vouchers that could be used to subsidize education outside of public schools.\n\nFamilies who earn less than three times their local median income and who receive the federal scholarships created by the program could choose to spend the estimated $5,000 they receive on tuition or other schooling needs at private schools, parochial schools or homeschooling.\n\nKayla Jimenez contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/22/house-passes-trump-bill-congress/83747173007/", "title": "Trump's deficit-swelling tax bill passes House vote", "text": "The Trump-backed bill is expected to add more than $3 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.\n\nIf the bill becomes law, more than 7 million people will lose Medicaid coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe bill includes temporary tax breaks for tipped wages and overtime.\n\nAnd the proposal includes $140 billion for mass deportations and immigration enforcement.\n\nWASHINGTON – Americans could see major changes to Medicaid, food stamps, border security and taxes under a sweeping Republican bill that passed the U.S. House early on May 22.\n\nThe proposal, which President Donald Trump has dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill,\" would enact Trump's major campaign promises like eliminating taxes on workers' tips and overtime and is likely to be one of the most significant pieces of legislation that will be passed during his second term in the Oval Office.\n\nIt passed the House 215-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans - Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio - voting against it after a marathon all-night debate. Republicans had only three 'no' votes to spare in the closely-divided House.\n\nAs recently as May 20, it wasn't clear House Republicans would be able to get the bill endorsed by Trump across the finish line.\n\nA handful of Republicans from primarily Democratic states were holding out on raising a tax deduction cap that would benefit their constituents, while fiscal conservatives remained concerned about the cost of the legislation, which is expected to add around $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. The tax plan has rattled stock markets in recent days as investors worry about the ballooning debt.\n\nTrump met personally with the GOP conference that morning, urging them to stop pushing for more changes and get behind the bill. \"Failure is simply not an option,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said after the meeting.\n\nHouse vote count on Trump tax bill\n\nAfter several marathon days of negotiations, including a May 21 meeting at the Trump White House, Republican leadership made additional changes and enough lawmakers came on board to pass it.\n\n\"What we're going to do here this morning is truly historic, and it will make all the difference in the daily lives of hard working Americans,\" Johnson said in a floor speech shortly before the bill passed.\n\nApart from Massie and Davidson, three other Republicans did not vote in support of the legislation. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland, voted present, which would have effectively been an opposition vote if the rest of the lawmakers had tied. Harris is the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which sought greater cuts in spending in the package.\n\nReps. David Schweikert of Arizona and Andrew Gabarino of New York missed the vote entirely.\n\nDemocrats have slammed the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of people who benefit from social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n\"This is one big, ugly bill that House Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people under the cover of darkness,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, said on the House floor in an early morning speech before the final vote.\n\nStill, it has a long way to go before it becomes law. The bill will next go to the Senate, which has already made clear that it plans to make changes. If that happens, the two chambers would still have to hash out the details capable of winning majority votes before they can send it to Trump's desk to be signed into law.\n\nThe clock is ticking: Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent warned that the U.S. is likely to hit the debt ceiling in August, and urged lawmakers to finalize the package – which raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion – before leaving for their summer recess at the end of July.\n\nTrump urges Senate to act swiftly on bill\n\nTrump commended the House passage of the legislation and urged quick Senate action by highlighting priorities such as no taxes on tips, overtime or interest on loans for American-made cars.\n\nHe also cited tougher border security measures such as pay raises for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents.\n\nTrump chided Democrats for opposing the measure and supporting “Open Borders” and transgender participants in women’s sports.\n\n“Now, it’s time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!” Trump said in a social media post. “There is no time to waste.”\n\nWhat is in the bill?\n\nThe sweeping House bill is expected to touch many corners of American life, from their wallets and healthcare to the southern border and the national debt.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered income tax rates for all income groups but disproportionately benefitted the highest earners, is set to expire at the end of 2025. The bill would make those tax rates permanent at an expected cost of more than $2 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\nNo taxes on tips and overtime\n\nThe bill would also implement temporary tax breaks for tipped wages and overtime, create a new temporary deduction for the interest on loans for American-made cars, and create a new tax deduction for people over age 65. Children under 8 years old could also benefit from a new \"Trump\" savings account seeded with $1,000 from the federal government.\n\n7.6 million would lose Medicaid\n\nMedicaid, the program that provides health insurance to more than 71 million low-income Americans, would undergo big changes. That includes new work requirements for adults enrolled in Medicaid expansion beginning in December of 2026, more frequent eligibility checks, and disincentives for states to cover unauthorized migrant children, among other provisions.\n\nCollectively, the Medicaid proposal would save at least $625 billion and cause 7.6 million Americans to lose their health insurance over the next 10 years, according to initial estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nTrump warned Republicans who wanted to squeeze additional changes out of the health insurance program, telling them \"Don't f‒‒‒ around with Medicaid,\" at a May 20 meeting.\n\nThe proposal would also implement new requirements in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, which provides assistance to around 42 million Americans. That would save up to $300 billion over the next ten years and shift more of the cost of the program to states.\n\nBig spending on border security, missile defense\n\nThe bill would put more than $140 billion toward Trump's plan to crack down on illegal immigration, including $50 billion for a border wall, $45 billion for detention centers, $8 billion for immigration officers and $14 billion for deportations.\n\nIt would also put around $150 billion toward defense spending, including $20 billion that would go, in part, to creating a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system that Trump has promoted.\n\nBlue state tax benefits, green energy, vouchers\n\nResidents of high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey making under $500,000 will be able to claim a deduction of up to $40,000 on their federal returns for taxes paid to their state and local governments – which those holdout lawmakers pushed up from the initially-proposed $30,000. Right now, the cap on that deduction is $10,000.\n\nThe bill would eliminate several green energy provisions passed under former President Joe Biden, such as tax credits for electric vehicles and renewable energy, and would accelerate permitting for fossil fuel projects.\n\nFamilies could use new vouchers collectively worth billions dollars for education outside of public schools, such as for private schools, parochial schools or homeschooling. Meanwhile, private universities could face new taxes for large endowments.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen\n\n(This story has been updated with more information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/30/medicaid-cuts-could-hit-20-million-americans/84417061007/", "title": "Senate vote: 20 million people could lose Medicaid benefits", "text": "Republican stronghold states are among those likely to take the hardest hit from a Senate bill slashing Medicaid.\n\nMore than a quarter of residents in Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky and West Virginia receive healthcare coverage through the popular, federally backed insurance program, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization. Republican-led Florida and Texas each have more than 1 million residents on Medicaid ‒ among the highest in the country.\n\nNationwide, between 12 million and 20 million people could lose Medicaid coverage under deep cuts to the health insurance program proposed by Senate Republicans, according to two estimates.\n\nThe first, by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, calculates that the Senate version of the reconciliation bill would leave 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034. The second, by the Senate Joint Economic Committee Minority, estimates that about 20 million people could lose the coverage under the amended Senate bill.\n\nSenate Republicans concerned that their planned tax cuts would swell the national debt forced steep reductions to Medicaid benefits – more than $1 trillion worth – into a bill that's the subject of a \"vote-a-rama\" on Monday, June 30.\n\nShould it pass, the amended version will return to the House of Representatives for consideration. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to deliver the budget reconciliation bill to his desk by July 4.\n\nThe Senate included an amendment that would not only slash Medicaid writ large – as House Republicans wanted – but would also reduce the federal share of Medicaid spending for people enrolled through state-level expansions of the Affordable Care Act. The expansions made more people eligible for subsidized insurance.\n\nThe bill's impact on Medicaid recipients and others\n\nMedicaid insures 83 million low-income children and adults, according to KFF, including 40% of American children and 60% of nursing home residents. The vast majority of voters have repeatedly told pollsters they want Medicaid left alone.\n\nTrump repeatedly promised he wouldn't 'touch' Medicaid other than seeking out fraud, and his spokesperson said this bill accomplishes that goal.\n\n\"The president and the vast majority of Republicans who are supportive of this legislation are right: This bill protects Medicaid for those who truly need it, the needy, pregnant women, children, sick Americans who physically cannot work,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. The bill strips out \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" she added.\n\nHospitals are required to provide emergency care and uninsured people often end up getting treated in emergency rooms. Federal Medicaid cutbacks threaten hospitals' financial stability, experts say. Acknowledging the impact, the Senate added $25 billion to a rural hospital relief fund, though it's unclear if that will be enough to keep rural hospitals from closing.\n\nThe bill also adds a work requirement for Medicaid recipients.\n\nAccording to KFF, 92% of Medicaid recipients work full or part-time, or can't work because of illness, disability, caregiving responsibilities, or school attendance. Many work for low-paying jobs in small companies that do not provide insurance.\n\nAdding work requirements, KFF found, would require states to verify someone's employment status at least every 6 months, creating bureaucratic hurdles. A number of states that imposed work requirements during Trump's first term ended up eliminating them.\n\nOpposition to Medicaid cuts\n\nThe American Hospital Association, a trade group, urged Congress to reject the Medicaid cuts, saying in a statement that they \"would not only strip access to health care from some of the most vulnerable populations but also destabilize hospitals and health systems, leading to a loss of services that would impact patients and communities nationwide.\"\n\nOther opponents of the cuts, include senior citizens in wheelchairs and other disabled people, who protested on Capitol Hill on June 24. Several were arrested by Capitol Police, and footage online showed officers tying the protestors' hands with zip ties.\n\nStates would be forced to pay more to maintain Medicaid expansion as a result of the cuts, Sarah Lueck, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a June 29 post on X.\n\nMany Republican-led states have some of the lowest levels of coverage by private insurers, and Medicaid is a staple for hundreds of thousands of residents of Indiana, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia, among others.\n\nIn a firey speech on the Senate floor June 29, Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, who is not seeking re-election, blasted the cuts. They'll hit his constiuents, he said, as they are implemented over the next few years.\n\n\"What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years,\" he said, \"when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding is not there?\"\n\nContributed: Sarah D.

It will now go to the Senate, where it may be changed and then voted on yet again before heading to the president's desk for his signature.\n\nHere's what you need to know about what's in the package Trump calls his one \"big, beautiful bill.\"\n\nMedicaid, SNAP cuts\n\nHouse Republicans have approved big changes that would save at least $625 billion from Medicaid, the program that provides health insurance to more than 71 million low-income Americans.\n\nThose changes are expected to cause 7.6 million Americans to lose their health insurance over the next 10 years, according to initial estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe legislation would implement work requirements for adults enrolled in Medicaid expansion and increase the frequency of eligibility checks to ensure people still qualify for the program.\n\nIt would also bar Medicaid from funding services at clinics that also perform abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and discourages states from using their own funds to provide Medicaid coverage to undocumented children.\n\nThe bill would also implement new work requirements for people ages 55 to 64 in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, which provides food assistance to around 42 million Americans.\n\nThat would save up to $300 billion over the next ten years and shift more of the cost of the program to states for the first time. It would also limit SNAP eligibility to citizens and lawful permanent residents and prevent future presidential administrations from increasing benefits without Congressional approval.\n\nBig tax breaks\n\nThe tax cuts implemented through the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law by Trump during his first term expire at the end of the year. If they are not extended, income tax rates will go up for all but two income brackets next year.\n\nThis bill would make those cuts permanent. While the policy keeps tax rates lower for all income groups, they disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans.\n\nFamilies could benefit from an increased child tax credit of $2,500 through 2028, which would drop to $2,000 after that. If the bill doesn't pass, the child tax credit would drop back to $1,000 at the end of this year.\n\nPeople over age 65 could also deduct an additional $4,000 from their taxes if they make less than $75,000 or $150,000 filing jointly.\n\nNo tax on tips, overtime\n\nTipped employees like waiters and hairstylists would be able to claim a new tax deduction for tips through 2028, as could workers who are paid overtime wages. The bill would also allow people to temporarily deduct up to $10,000 in car loan interest payments if they buy an American-made vehicle.\n\nSALT benefits\n\nRepublicans from primarily Democratic states like California, New York and New Jersey pushed for an increased cap on state and local tax deductions, also known as SALT, which allows people to write off a portion of their local taxes from what they owe the federal government.\n\nThe 2017 tax law capped that deduction at $10,000. The new bill would raise that cap to $40,000 for people who make less than $500,000 per year.\n\nGreen energy roll-backs\n\nThe bill would cut off many green energy tax credits for projects beginning 60 days after the bill passes – a major priority and last-minute change for fiscal conservatives who were hoping to shave more off the cost of the bill.\n\nThe bill would rescind several other climate change-related provisions of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, including a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles.\n\nIt would pull back unspent money for several grant and loan programs at the Energy Department and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, delay methane fees for oil and gas companies, repeal additional rules encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles, and accelerate permitting for fossil fuel projects.\n\n'Trump' savings accounts\n\nChildren under 8 years old would be given $1,000 each for their parents to open savings accounts that Republican lawmakers dubbed \"Trump\" accounts.\n\nParents, other relatives and non-profits could contribute $5,000 annually to the account tax free until the child is 18, when a portion of the funds can be used for higher education, training programs, buying a home or starting a small business until age 30, when the funds would become unrestricted.\n\nTaxing universities, boosting private schools\n\nThe bill would increase taxes on private university endowments. The rate would jump significantly for schools with higher rates for larger endowments, like those held by elite schools such as Harvard University.\n\nThe bill would also allow the federal government to spend $5 billion per year for the next four years on vouchers that could be used to subsidize education outside of public schools.\n\nFamilies who earn less than three times their local median income and who receive the federal scholarships created by the program could choose to spend the estimated $5,000 they receive on tuition or other schooling needs at private schools, parochial schools or homeschooling.\n\nStudent loan changes\n\nStudent loan relief regulations enacted by Biden's administration would be repealed, and the number of repayment plans for federally held loans would shrink to just two programs.\n\nThe bill would also impose significant caps on loans for parents and undergraduate students, while eliminating a lending program for future graduate students.\n\nGeorge Petras and Jennifer Borresen contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/07/01/millions-lose-health-insurance-trump-tax-bill/84431378007/", "title": "Millions will lose health insurance under Trump tax bill", "text": "The Senate cleared President Donald Trump's domestic spending and tax cut bill that will enact steep cuts to the nation's safety-net health insurance program for low income families.\n\nIn addition to delivering tax cuts and increasing immigration enforcement, what Trump has called the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" would cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income families and the disabled. The bill is projected to eliminate insurance coverage for 11.8 million people over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAnother 5 million could lose coverage if Congress doesn't extend the COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits that have made Affordable Care Act plans more affordable for consumers.\n\nThe legislation amounts to \"the biggest rollback in health care coverage in the history of the United States,\" said Joan Alker, a research professor and executive director and co-founder of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families.\n\nVice President JD Vance, who cast the tiebreaking vote July 1 to pass the Senate bill 51-50, said in social media posts the Medicaid cuts are \"immaterial\" compared to savings the bill will fund through bolstered immigration enforcement. The House is scheduled to consider the legislation on July 2 in advance of Trump's self-imposed July 4th deadline for his signature domestic policy legislation.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHow will the legislation cut Medicaid?\n\nThe legislation would require states to double eligibility checks to twice a year. And states, which administer Medicaid, would have to set up systems to verify a person's employment or exemption status.\n\nThe legislation requires \"able-bodied\" Medicaid recipients to work 80 hours a month or qualify for an exemption, such as being a student, caregiver or having a disability. The original House version limited the work requirement to low-income adults without children, but the Senate version added the work requirement to parents of children older than 13.\n\nThe legislation defines \"able-bodied\" people as those not medically certified as physically or mentally unfit for employment. The legislation also would strip coverage from undocumented immigrants who get Medicaid through state-funded programs.\n\nHealth policy experts say more frequent eligibility checks and red tape will add administrative costs and cut off people who qualify but fall through the cracks because of administrative miscues.\n\nWhat do hospitals and doctors think of bill?\n\nMedicaid insures 83 million low-income children and adults, according to KFF, a health policy nonprofit. That represents more than 1 in 5 Americans.\n\nHealth policy experts have warned the cuts could harm rural hospitals and doctors who serve a higher percentage of people enrolled in Medicaid. The Senate bill added a $50 billion rural health care fund, double the amount that an earlier version of the legislation proposed.\n\nStill, hospitals are \"deeply disappointed\" the bill cleared the Senate, said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, a trade group.\n\nPollack said the $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts would cause \"irreparable harm to our health care system,\" and reduce access to care for all Americans.\n\nHospitals are required to diagnose and stabilize anyone who visits an emergency room. Eliminating coverage of nearly 12 million Americans will \"drive up uncompensated care for hospitals and health systems,\" Pollack said.\n\nPollack said hospitals might be forced to cut services and staff, and patients could face longer wait times in emergency rooms. Some rural hospitals and facilities in underserved communities could close, Pollack said.\n\nDr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said the cuts to Medicaid and a federal food assistance program \"will make our country sicker, put children at risk of going hungry and make it harder for families to afford basic necessities\" while delivering tax cuts.\n\nWhen will the Medicaid cuts take effect?\n\nMedicaid recipients won't immediately be impacted by the legislation. The bill sets a Jan. 1, 2027, deadline for states to begin twice-a-year eligibility checks and verify work or exemption status of non-disabled enrollees.\n\nHowever, some states already have submitted waivers to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to begin Medicaid work requirements. CMS might choose to approve the waivers and allow some states to launch Medicaid work requirements before January 2027, Alker said.\n\nA KFF survey found nearly 2 in 3 people on Medicaid are employed full or part time, and others would qualify for an exemption from the work requirement because they are caregivers or students. Just 8% were not working due to inability to find work, retirement or other reasons, KFF said.\n\nWhile the bill doesn't mandate work requirements before January 2027, states will likely need to plan for big changes before then, said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the KFF program on Medicaid and the uninsured.\n\nStates will need to prepare for smaller Medicaid payments from the federal government while adding the extra administrative duties of verifying an enrollee's work or volunteer status.\n\n\"Some states are anticipating this reduced revenue,\" Tolbert said. \"At the same time, they are also required to make pretty costly changes to their eligibility systems.\"\n\n'Death by a trillion cuts': Health care workers lobby Republicans in Congress\n\nJohannah Alabi’s days usually consist of feeding, bathing, and caring for residents at two nursing homes in Bloomfield, Conn. She said most of her patients depend on government health insurance programs, so she is concerned about what will happen to them and her job if Trump signs the bill into law.\n\nMedicaid is the primary payer for 63% of nursing home facility residents and an additional 13% rely on Medicare as their primary payer, according to KFF, a health policy nonprofit headquartered in San Francisco.\n\n“If some of that money is going to be taken away, something has to give,” Alabi said. “It’s going to come down to the resident care. It’s going to come down to the food. It’s going to come down to the activities.”\n\nThat’s why she was inspired to join Service Employees International Union members to lobby lawmakers to vote against the bill last week.\n\nThey arrived at the Capitol with signs reading, “Death by a trillion cuts,” and wearing shirts with the message, “Republican cuts kill.”\n\nJennifer Woods, another SEIU member who works in the claims department at Kaiser Permanente, ran into Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, during her trip to Washington. She said she tried to explain how cuts could “ruin people’s lives” and potentially lead to some patients’ deaths as she followed him through the Capitol building.\n\n“He just shook his head and would keep going,” Woods said. “He didn’t really say anything. None of them did.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/04/donald-trump-signs-megabill-taxes-medicaid-border/84470497007/", "title": "Donald Trump signs BBB megabill into law that cuts taxes, Medicaid", "text": "President Donald Trump capped the whirlwind opening stretch of his second term with a Fourth of July signing ceremony for his signature legislation, reveling in pushing the megabill through a fractious Congress and delivering on multiple campaign promises.\n\nThe measure cements into law much of Trump’s agenda and is being hailed by the president and his supporters as a major victory.\n\nIt includes tax cuts, increased spending on immigration enforcement and the military and deep spending reductions to Medicaid that Democrats and some Republicans have strongly criticized.\n\nBut with the furious legislative debate behind him, Trump was ebullient as he signed what he has dubbed the “Big beautiful bill” into law during a White House ceremony that included legislative leaders and a flyover from military planes.\n\n“We made promises, and it’s really promises made, promises kept,” Trump said, addressing a crowd of supporters gathered on the White House South Lawn, his wife at his side.\n\nTrump sketched out some of the broad strokes of the bill on the campaign trail as he proposed to cut taxes on tipped wages and overtime pay and greatly expand immigration enforcement and deportation efforts. The legislation does that, and a lot more.\n\nIt extends the 2017 tax cuts that Trump passed and were set to expire at the end of the year and has many other provisions, including reducing taxes on corporations and large estates, boosting the child tax credit, increasing the deduction for state and local taxes to $40,000 and eliminating dozens of green energy incentives. The bill reduces tax revenues by roughly $4.5 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nIn the process, it adds $3.4 trillion to the national debt over a decade, according to CBO, and includes a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling. CBO projects it will result in 12 million people losing health insurance, while the Senate Joint Economic Committee Minority estimates that about 20 million people could lose coverage. Medicaid is being cut by nearly $1 trillion.\n\nDifferent factions of Republicans took aim at the bill, with some complaining about the Medicaid cuts and other arguing the legislation didn’t go far enough to cut spending.\n\nYet the nearly 900-page legislation cleared Congress less than six months into Trump’s second term, allowing him to quickly put in place the centerpiece of his agenda. Since reclaiming the White House, the president has moved aggressively to implement his priorities, from overhauling the federal government to mass deportations.\n\nTrump has relied heavily on executive orders to accomplish his goals, which can be reversed if a Democrat wins the presidency. The legislation he signed July 4 could be a more lasting legacy. He was able to hold together a GOP caucus that at times seemed poised to buck him, but ultimately fell in line, once again demonstrating the president’s immense influence within his party.\n\n“I think I have more power now,” Trump said after the bill passed, in discussing his sway with congressional Republicans.\n\nThe legislation narrowly cleared the Senate, with three Republicans breaking ranks to vote against it and the chamber ending in a tie vote that was broken by Vice President JD Vance, resulting in a 51-50 margin. It passed the House 218-214 with two Republicans opposed.\n\nDemocrats were united against the measure, saying that it disproportionately benefits the wealthy and hurts lower-income Americans. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, laid out these concerns in a marathon address that broke the record for longest House speech.\n\n\"I rise today in strong opposition to Donald Trump's disgusting abomination… that guts Medicaid, rips food from the mouths of children, seniors and veterans, and rewards billionaires with massive tax breaks,\" Jeffries said.\n\nThe legislative drama will now give way to a political messaging battle over the legislation.\n\nTrump and his allies predict it will turbocharge the economy and ultimately benefit the party, even as polls show it's unpopular.\n\n\"After this kicks in our country is going to be a rocket ship economically,\" Trump said before signing the legislation surrounded by lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who handed him a gavel used during the bill's passage.\n\nFormer Trump White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer called the legislation \"a massive legislative and political victory” and said passing it now allows time for its effects to “marinate into the economy and I think will be a huge bonus for Republicans in both chambers running\" in the 2026 midterm election.\n\n“The consequence and effects of this bill will be baked into the economy for 18 months and I believe spur economic growth, job creation” Spicer said.\n\nSome Republicans are nervous about political fallout, though. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis opposed the bill because of the Medicaid provisions.\n\nIn a Senate floor speech criticizing the legislation, Tillis attributed his rise to U.S. senator to blowback against former President Barack Obama's 2010 health care law, the Affordable Care Act, which fueled crushing Democratic losses across the country.\n\nThe GOP is now rushing into similarly perilous territory, Tillis implied, by cutting Medicaid.\n\nContributing: Sarah Wire, Phillip Bailey, Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/05/23/what-medicaid-cuts-passed-by-u-s-house-could-mean-for-washington/83818819007/", "title": "What Medicaid cuts passed by U.S. House could mean for WA", "text": "Jake Goldstein-Street\n\nWashington State Standard\n\nWashington leaders are warning that at least 194,000 people in the state stand to lose Medicaid coverage under a Republican-backed budget bill that passed the U.S. House early Thursday.\n\nOnly nine other states could potentially have more residents lose their health insurance from Medicaid than Washington, according to estimates released by Democrats on Congress’ Joint Economic Committee.\n\nWashington would also lose about $2 billion in federal Medicaid funding over the next four years, Gov. Bob Ferguson said at a press conference Thursday at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. He said “no rainy-day reserve fund is going to backfill that.”\n\nBut he stopped short of saying the proposed cuts would necessitate a special legislative session since many of the bill’s provisions wouldn’t go into effect immediately.\n\nThe cuts also threaten the livelihood of the state’s nursing homes and rural hospitals, officials said.\n\n“Hospitals will close in Washington state, in rural parts of our state and urban parts of our state,” Ferguson said. “Take that to the bank. That’s going to happen. Nursing homes in our state will close.”\n\nIn light of this, about two dozen Washington state Republican lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, pleaded with the 12-member congressional delegation to avoid cuts that would imperil the state’s Medicaid program, known as Apple Health.\n\n“We urge you to protect Medicaid,” they wrote in a letter sent Wednesday. “We can’t afford to lose local health care resources, and our rural communities will not be able to ride out the economic shockwaves that are sure to follow if this program is significantly cut.”\n\nThe letter marked a departure from Republican lawmakers’ tack on federal policy maneuvering, as they’ve largely remained mum on the potential Medicaid cuts and numerous other hot-button topics since President Donald Trump took office in January.\n\nWashington U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner, of Spokane, who served previously in the Washington state Senate, took swipes at leaders in Olympia as he touted passage of the House bill on Thursday.\n\n“Elections have consequences and the contrast between leadership in Washington DC and Washington state is stark,” he wrote in a social media post. He went on to slam Ferguson for signing state laws this week that will raise billions in new taxes and also criticized the governor’s stance on immigration.\n\n“The American people are getting what they voted for,” he added.\n\nWA's Republican delegation supported bill, with Senate next\n\nThe legislation that Republicans in Congress are forging ahead with is sprawling in scope. It would extend tax cuts approved in 2017 during Trump’s first term, pump more money toward border security, rework energy permitting and restructure college aid, among other changes.\n\nTo cut spending in line with their desired tax breaks, House Republicans propose reductions between $600 billion to $700 billion over 10 years to Medicaid, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. The program, which is run jointly by the federal government and states, provides health care for people who are poor or disabled. Roughly a quarter of Washington residents are covered by Medicaid.\n\nThe bill squeaked through the House by a single vote, with only Republicans in support. Baumgartner and the other Republican in Washington’s delegation, Dan Newhouse, of Sunnyside, both voted for it.\n\nNewhouse and Baumgartner’s red districts have the highest proportion of Medicaid enrollees in Washington.\n\nIn a statement, Newhouse defended his vote, saying Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” would implement “real, common-sense reforms to strengthen the integrity of Medicaid, protecting the program for low-income families, seniors, and those with disabilities.”\n\nOne of the key changes the bill proposes is a requirement that certain Medicaid recipients prove they are working to qualify for coverage.\n\nSpecifically, the proposal would require childless adults without disabilities to work, volunteer or attend school for 80 hours per month, with some exceptions. Work requirements would go into effect by the end of 2026, up from the initial 2029 meant to give states time to prepare.\n\nOf Washington adults on Medicaid, 70% are working, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.\n\nDemocrats have universally decried the legislation, framing it as an attempt by Republicans to pay for tax cuts that will deliver outsized benefits to wealthier taxpayers, while undermining safety net programs for lower-income Americans.\n\n“This legislation is a betrayal of Republicans’ promise to lower costs for everyday families,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina. “It will rip health coverage away from millions of families while increasing groceries, utilities, and health care bills.”\n\nThe bill would also punish states like Washington that offer Medicaid-style coverage to immigrants without legal status. Enrollment in Washington’s program for immigrants is capped, and it is funded using only state money.\n\nFor states that offer programs like this, House Republicans want to decrease how much the federal government would pay to cover enrollees who qualify for Medicaid under expanded eligibility stemming from the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Hundreds of thousands of Washington adults got Apple Health coverage under that expansion.\n\nOver the next decade, this could shift to the state $10 billion in costs the federal government previously covered, according to KFF.\n\nThe legislation still needs to pass the U.S. Senate before reaching the president’s desk.\n\nNearly 2M residents using state health program\n\nWashington receives over $13 billion in federal funding for Medicaid, according to fiscal year 2023 data from the state Office of Financial Management. The state chips in another $8 billion, one of the largest categories of spending in its operating budget.\n\nAs of last month, nearly 2 million Washington residents were enrolled in Apple Health, including over 850,000 children, according to the state Health Care Authority, which oversees the program.\n\nJen Chong Jewell’s son, Gabriel, is one of them. The Everett 14-year-old has developmental disabilities and has used Medicaid to cover surgeries, therapies and medical equipment.\n\n“I love my son, and I hate that he, along with so many others, are being swept into this narrative about the need to, quote ‘eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,’” Chong Jewell told reporters.\n\nAlso looming is the expiration of expanded tax credits for the Affordable Care Act that allowed more people to purchase insurance. That change and others to the federal health care law could cost another 79,000 residents in Washington their coverage, according to the congressional analysis.\n\nNationwide, this would bring the total to 13.7 million people with lost coverage by 2034.\n\nThe bill also would stop coverage for gender-affirming care for transgender people and reproductive care through Planned Parenthood. Washington state Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, was among more than 500 legislators across the country who called on congressional leadership this week to preserve Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood services.\n\nMeanwhile, cuts to federal food stamp benefits — known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — would shift $300 million in annual costs to Washington, according to Ferguson’s office.\n\nThe story was initially published by Washington State Standard, a nonprofit news organization and part of the States Newsroom network.

Trump met at the White House with skeptical GOP lawmakers, worked the phones and, via social media, cheered the members on during votes.\n\nIt’s a major victory for Trump and Republican leadership in Congress, which captured a trifecta during the 2024 elections and has used that political muscle to force what they've dubbed their \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" through both chambers at a rapid-fire pace. The passage came despite deep reservations within their own party and unanimous opposition from Democrats who see it as a ticket to winning back congressional majorities in 2026.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said he hopes Trump will sign the bill on the nation's 249th birthday on Friday. \"What more appropriate time to pass the big, beautiful bill for America than on Independence Day?\" he said.\n\nThe bill that Trump has touted as a centerpiece of his second-term agenda will touch nearly every aspect of the American economy, from the social safety net and income taxes to business and clean energy incentives.\n\nIt is estimated to increase deficits by around $3.4 trillion over the next ten years. It would make 2017 income tax cuts permanent; create new, narrow tax breaks for tips and overtime; implement new benefits for businesses; and roll back clean energy tax credits crated under former President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy,\" Trump said on social media during a procedural vote. \"What are the Republicans waiting for???\"\n\nThe timing of the victory gives Trump a chance to promote his so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" tonight in Des Moines, Iowa, where he’s traveling to kick off a yearlong celebration marking the 250th birthday of the United States.\n\nDemocrats were unified in opposition to the bill in the House and Senate, calling it an assault on healthcare and nutritional assistance. The bill would make deep cuts to Medicaid, leaving nearly 12 million Americans uninsured, and knock 2 million people off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance food program.\n\n\"People will die.

Only two House Republicans voted against the bill.\n\n\"I did not have much of a problem with any of them,\" Trump said, adding that he didn’t make any \"deals\" in exchange for their support but focused on the merits of the bill. \"It was not hard. This is going to be a great bill for the country.\"\n\nTrump acknowledged the enormous sway he has on Republicans in Congress — and said he has even more power over his party compared to his first White House term.\n\n\"I think I have more power now,\" Trump said. \"I do. I could say, oh gee, I don’t know. I think I probably do because we’ve had a great record of success.\"\n\n\"More gravitas. More power,\" he added.\n\nTrump is set to sign the bill into law during a White House ceremony on Friday, which falls on the 4th of July, the deadline Trump set weeks ago for Republican lawmakers to send him the bill.\n\nHouse takes next week off from voting after passing Trump bill\n\nAfter round-the-clock negotiations to send Trump’s legislative package to the president’s desk, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer announced lawmakers will not be voting next week.\n\nJohnson had said he hadn’t slept much in the previous two days.\n\nThe House had expected to be on recess this week for the July 4 holiday, but returned to vote on Trump’s bill. Lawmakers had planned to return July 7. But Emmer, R-Minnesota, announced the next House votes are now expected July 14 about 6:30 p.m. EDT.\n\nYMCA blasts as Johnson enrolls bill\n\nJohnson and dozens of Congressional Republicans crammed into a ceremonial room off the House chamber to celebrate the completion of their months-long effort.\n\n\"YMCA\" by Village People — a standby from Trump’s campaign rallies — blasted as Johnson shook hands with his colleagues and signed the bill at a wooden desk.\n\n\"We had a vision for what we wanted to do,\" Johnson said. \"I believed in this vision. I believed in the group. I believe in America.\"\n\nWhen will Trump sign the bill into law?\n\nTrump will sign the newly approved megabill into law Friday at 4 p.m. EDT during a ceremony at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nThe ceremony will take place on the Fourth of July, the deadline Trump set weeks ago for Republicans to send his signature to his desk.\n\n\"Today is a victorious day for the American people,\" Leavitt said in a call to reporters where she described the bill as \"an encapsulation of all of the policies that the president campaigned on.\"\n\nWhich Republicans voted against Trump’s bill?\n\nTwo House Republicans voted against Trump’s legislative package, after round-the-clock meetings with legislative leaders and the president himself at the White House prevented more defections.\n\nGOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania opposed the measure in the 218-214 vote.\n\nThe legislation was approved by narrow votes throughout its journey through Congress. The House approved its initial version in May on a 215-214 vote, with two Republicans opposed, one voting present and two absent. The Senate voted 51-50 on July 1, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie with three Republicans voting no.\n\nWhat does non voting, voting present mean?\n\nIt’s not as simple as yes or no for lawmakers. The other options include \"present\" or \"non voting.\"\n\nLawmakers can vote present, essentially opting out of a yes or no, and keeping their vote from counting toward the final tally.\n\nThis is a popular route for hardliners in controversial decisions — saving them from voting against their position without hurting their party’s chance of success.\n\nSpeaker Johnson tees up House vote\n\nJohnson teed up the vote on Trump’s sweeping tax bill. But before surrendering the microphone, the Louisiana Republican slammed Jeffries' record-breaking speech.\n\n\"Democrats deliver performances and Republicans deliver results,\" Johnson said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the speaker teed up the roll call as a pivotal political moment for the country. \"In a few moments, we will remind the world why the American experiment still endures today and why its best days are still ahead of us,\" he said.

Hakeem!\"\n\nRepublicans then took the floor and immediately began poking fun at Jeffries' marathon speech.\n\n\"I'm from the 'Show Me' state,\" Rep. Jason Smith, R-Missouri, said on the floor after the speech. \"And what we just heard can be defined in one word: A bunch of hogwash.\"\n\nWhat was the scene like on the House floor?\n\nThe mood in the House was while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries trashed Trump’s sweeping tax bill during his floor remarks that started in the middle of the night.\n\nDemocrats seated behind Jeffries included Michigan Rep. Shri Thanedar, California Rep. Luz Rivas, and Arizona Rep. Yassamin Ansari. They had pursed lips and scrunched eyebrows while listening to their leader rail against the bill's tax cuts and Medicaid spending changes.\n\nSome were spotted scrolling on their phones. At times, Jeffries’ colleagues stood up and clapped at his remarks. Others shouted \"preach\" and \"take your time.\"\n\n\"You are the swamp,\" Jeffries said at one point addressing Republicans, who almost entirely skipped the Democratic leader's remarks.\n\nAbout 50 Democrats were present in the chamber. For the GOP, a few staffers and lawmakers were present, including South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman.\n\nVP JD Vance: Hakeem Jeffries’ speech flipped a GOP vote on the bill\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ marathon floor speech protesting Trump’s tax bill has not only moved Democrats. It’s moved Republicans too, according to Vice President JD Vance.\n\n\"GOP Congressman just texted me: 'I was undecided on the bill but then I watched Hakeem Jeffries performance and now I’m a firm yes,'\" Vance wrote on X, without specifying who the lawmaker was.\n\nRepublicans criticized Jeffries. \"When I listen to Hakeem Jeffries, it drives me bananas,\" Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles said on \"The Benny Show.\"\n\nJohnson told reporters of Jeffries, \"It takes a lot longer to build the lies than to tell the truth, so he's really spinning a long tale in there.\"\n\nWhen will the GOP tax and spending bill go into effect?\n\nThe nearly 900-page spending and tax bill covers a wide swath of government spending beyond Medicaid cuts and tax cuts, and there is a wide variation on when each provision goes into effect as well.\n\nMedicaid: Nationwide Medicaid work requirements take effect Jan. 1, 2027, shortly after the mid-term elections decide which party controls Congress.\n\nThe legislation requires \"able-bodied\" Medicaid recipients to work 80 hours a month or qualify for an exemption, such as being a student, caregiver or having a disability. The work requirement applies to parents of children older than 13.\n\nTax rates: The bill permanently extends the tax cuts introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which were set to expire this year. There should be not disruption in their application if the bill is signed.\n\nSALT: The cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, would lift to $40,000 starting in 2025. That benefit starts to phaseout for people who earn more than $500,000 of income. In 2030 the increased deduction ends and the $40,000 limit would revert to $10,000.\n\nTips and overtime: No tax on tips or overtime are promises Trump made on the campaign trail when he was running for a second term. Workers will be able to deduct up to $25,000 in tips and up to $25,000 in overtime, but the tax law change is temporary and ends Dec. 31, 2028, right before he leaves office.\n\nChild Tax Credit: Under current law, the maximum child tax credit is $2,000, which will revert to $1,000 after 2025 without changes from Congress. The GOP’s spending bill would permanently raise that maximum credit to $2,200 starting in 2025 and tie the amount to inflation going forward. There is no end date\n\nSocial Security tax deduction: Only some Social Security beneficiaries will be able to claim the deduction, which was also a promise Trump made on the campaign trail. This deduction is also temporary. It would last from 2025 to 2029.\n\nThe bill includes a temporary $6,000 deduction for seniors over the age of 65 and eliminates Social Security tax liability for seniors with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less or $150,000 if filing as a married couple.\n\nThe lowest-income seniors who already don’t pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold could not claim the deduction. - Sarah D. Wire\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: ‘We have the votes’\n\nJohnson told reporters on July 3 that he expects Trump's major tax bill to make it through to final passage.\n\n\"We have the votes,\" the Louisiana Republican said.\n\nWith a razor-thin majority in the House, Johnson can only afford to lose three Republican votes. Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie has previously said he will oppose the bill.\n\nMembers of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus have also raised concerns about the legislation adding to the nation's deficit. But Johnson expressed confidence in the bill’s passage, saying he’s \"ready to roll.\"\n\nWhat does the GOP bill mean for Medicaid?\n\nThe GOP spending and tax bill would cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income families and disabled people. The bill is projected to eliminate insurance coverage for between 12 million and 20 million people over the next decade, according to two estimates.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculates that the bill would leave 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034. The Senate Joint Economic Committee Minority estimates that about 20 million people could lose coverage.\n\nMedicaid insures 83 million low-income children and adults, or more than 1 in 5 Americans, according to KFF, a health policy nonprofit. Medicaid funds 63% of nursing home facility residents, according to KFF.\n\nRepublicans say the $900 billion-a-year program was allowed to grow too large under Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden by adding nondisabled adults they say don't deserve government assistance, and they have long sought to scale it back. The expanded access has been in place for 13 years.\n\nPeople may not recognize that their coverage is at risk because in many states Medicaid goes by a local name. For example, California’s program is called Medi-Cal and Louisiana's Medicaid program is called Healthy Louisiana.\n\nThe funding cuts mean states will receive smaller Medicaid payments from the federal government.\n\nWhat Medicaid work requirements are in the bill?\n\nThe Trump tax bill imposes nationwide Medicaid work requirements that take effect Jan. 1, 2027, shortly after the mid-term elections decide which party controls the next Congress.\n\nThe legislation requires \"able-bodied\" Medicaid recipients to work 80 hours a month or qualify for an exemption, such as being a student, caregiver or having a disability. The work requirement applies to parents of children older than 13.\n\nThe bill would require states to check eligibility twice a year, rather than once. And states, which administer Medicaid, would have to set up systems to verify a person's employment or exemption status.\n\nThe work requirements mean states will have extra administrative duties of verifying an enrollee's work or volunteer status.\n\n‘MAGA is not happy,’ Trump warned Republican holdouts\n\nAs the House advanced the bill forward earlier on the morning of July 3, Trump applied pressure to conservative holdouts and expressed frustration with their stubbornness.\n\n\"FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!\" Trump said in a 12:45 a.m. ET post on Truth Social.\n\nA half-hour earlier, he wrote: \"Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy. What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!\"\n\nHakeem Jeffries slams Trump’s bill in ‘magic minute’ speech\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized Trump’s sweeping tax and domestic policy bill under a procedural tactic known as \"magic minute,\" which allows party leaders to have unlimited speaking time on the floor.\n\nJeffries' speech started shortly before 5 a.m., as the bill moved closer to passing the House.\n\n\"I rise today in strong opposition to Donald Trump’s disgusting abomination…that guts Medicaid, rips food from the mouths of children, seniors and veterans, and rewards billionaires with massive tax breaks,\" Jeffries said.\n\nHe condemned the cuts in spending for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the bill, arguing that the cost of living is too high.\n\n\"Cruelty should never be the objective or the outcome of legislation that we consider here in the House of Representatives,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/03"}]}

And Columbus City Schools isn't requiring unvaccinated students to wear masks.\n\nFor now, it appears most central Ohio districts will also be going forward with no mask mandates this school year, based on plans submitted to the Ohio Department of Education last month.\n\nSenate Bill 209, introduced earlier this month by Powell Sen. Andrew Brenner, also would prevent public schools and universities from requiring students, staff or visitors to wear masks while in class, at school-sponsored sports or during extracurricular activities.\n\nThe proposed ban wouldn't be in place before the start of the upcoming school year. Ohio lawmakers aren't meeting to pass legislation until September and any changes would need 90 days to take effect. The bill would not apply to private schools.\n\n“It’s nerve-racking to say the least,” said Dorcas, 45, of the East Side.\n\nWhile some parents nationwide demanded an end to mask mandates for children in school near the end of the last school year, many others are begging their districts to reinstate those same mandates for the 2021-22 school year or at least strongly encourage them, saying doing anything else would be irresponsible.\n\nAnd many health experts support their request.\n\nMore: GOP lawmaker's bill would ban mask requirements at Ohio's public schools, universities\n\nStudents under 12 who aren’t eligible to get vaccinated should still wear a mask in school, said Dr. Sara Bode, a pediatrician at Nationwide Children's Hospital who is the medical director of the hospital's school-based health programs.\n\n\"The most effective way to get kids back to school and keep them there without having an outbreak is to continue to require or encourage masking,\" Bode said.\n\nColumbus City Schools, the state’s largest district with nearly 47,000 students, is returning to “pre-pandemic protocols” in the fall, which does not require but permits masks, according to the district's website. The protocols also don't require social distancing; sneeze guards in classrooms; and doesn't include restrictions for lunchrooms, staff break rooms, restrooms or for entering or existing buildings.\n\n\"We’ll continue to follow Columbus Public Health and the Ohio Department of Health guidelines on mitigation efforts to defeat this virus and protect students and staff,” district spokesperson Jacqueline Bryant said in an email to The Dispatch. “If they change, we’ll update our plans.”\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine tracker: How many people in Franklin County are fully vaccinated?\n\nBode said she doesn't think it's enough for schools to just be encouraging masks and neither does the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which on Monday recommended face masks for anyone over the age of two, including those who are fully vaccinated — a stricter position than that taken this month by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"The AAP believes that, at this point in the pandemic, given what we know about low rates of in-school transmission when proper prevention measures are used, together with the availability of effective vaccines for those age 12 years and up, that the benefits of in-person school outweigh the risks in all circumstances,\" the guidance says.\n\nThe academy said universal masking is necessary because much of the student population is not vaccinated, and it's hard for schools to figure out who has had the shot as new variants emerge that might spread more easily among children.\n\nChildren 12 and over are currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently said that emergency authorization for vaccines for those under 12 could come in early to midwinter.\n\nCDC guidelines on returning to school\n\nThe CDC issued new guidelines on July 9, urging schools to fully reopen next school year, regardless of whether all mitigation measures can be implemented.\n\nStudents who are vaccinated don’t have to wear masks this coming school year unless they're riding the bus or their school decides otherwise, according to the new federal guidelines.\n\nWhile the guidelines aren’t mandatory, they are expected to influence school officials, health departments and governors nationwide who are in the midst of preparing for students to return to the classroom this fall.\n\nIn May, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include 12- to 15-year-olds, which still leaves out elementary school and some middle school students.\n\nBoth Moderna and Pfizer, however, launched trials of their COVID-19 vaccines for children 6 months to 11 years old in March. Results are expected in the fall, and Pfizer hopes to submit request for emergency authorization for ages 5 to11 in September, company spokeswoman Keanna Ghazvini said in an email to The Dispatch.\n\nIn the meantime, people who are eligible for the vaccine should get the shot, Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman Alicia Shoults said in an email to The Dispatch.\n\n“Vaccinating yourselves is the best way to protect those and younger, who aren’t yet authorized to receive COVID-19 vaccines,” Shoults said.\n\nOhio school districts will still be required to report all cases of COVID-19 to their local health departments.\n\nGoing to school but worried about the risks\n\nJordyn Mitchell, who is going into the fifth grade, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes last fall, so she is more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.\n\n“I have a lot of concerns,\" said Jordyn's mom, Dorcas. \"I don’t really understand why they would even say you don’t have to wear a mask when you have this age group that can’t even be vaccinated.”\n\nColumbus City Schools is changing its digital academy this year to a what it is calling BlendED, \"a school without walls.\" Among other changes, the program will require in-person testing, orientation and help sessions. Students are enrolled in BlendED for the entire school year.\n\nA maximum of 2,000 students had the option to enroll in BlendED between May 17 and 28 and 556 did so, Bryant said in an email.\n\nDorcas opted not to enroll Jordyn or her older sister in remote learning because she wanted them in the classroom, she said.\n\n\"(Virtual learning) was really, really hard for them and they just want to be in the classroom,\" she said.\n\nDorcas said Jordyn will wear a mask in class and thinks the district should require all students who aren't vaccinated to wear a mask.\n\n“They are not even old enough to get the vaccination, so require them to wear a mask,\" she said.\n\nAn impossible choice?\n\nChristine Creagh, 49, of Clintonville, is still deciding what’s best for her son, Felix, who will be in second grade at Indianola Informal K-8 School.\n\n“If nothing changes between now and then, we would probably take him out and home-school him,” she said. “I literally don’t even let him go in Target. I can’t wrap my head around letting him go into a classroom with 25 kids and no one is wearing a mask all day, every day.”\n\nShe said her family is being forced to choose between his physical safety, mental health and academic success.\n\n“We’re prioritizing physical health, but it’s definitely coming at a cost to his physical wellness and his academic wellness and that stinks,” she said.\n\nShe didn't enroll her son in the district's BlendED program but wishes it offered a first-quarter, at-home digital option.\n\n“It seems outrageously irresponsible to put our unvaccinated young children in crowded classrooms without even a mask,\" Creagh said.\n\n\"He can't be in a classroom with a bunch of kids\"\n\nElizabeth Plakis enrolled her son Niko, who will be a first-grader at Avalon Elementary, in the district's BlendED program for the upcoming school year, saying it was the best option for him.\n\nNiko was born with esophageal atresia tracheoesophageal fistula, a rare birth defect in which the esophagus (the tube that connects the throat with the stomach) does not develop normally.\n\nAs a result, his airway is unstable and collapses, Plakis said, and he could end up on a ventilator if he gets sick.\n\n“He obviously can’t go (to school),” she said. “He can’t be in a classroom with a bunch of kids. … Why would they not enforce masking and social distancing with kids who can’t be vaccinated?”\n\nDispatch reporters Alissa Widman Neese and Jessie Balmert contributed to this story.\n\nmhenry@dispatch.com\n\n@megankhenry", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/09/07/kids-covid-school-mask-mandates-poll/5714392001/", "title": "COVID in kids: School mask mandates find support to keep kids ...", "text": "U.S. parents are eager for kids to return to school, but they're concerned their children will get seriously ill if they catch COVID-19. A strong majority support requiring masks and teacher vaccinations amid a surge in pediatric cases.\n\nParents are more skeptical of online learning than they were last school year, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos poll, which found declining optimism about distance learning. More than 1,000 schools, having just reopened, halted in-person learning and went back online because of COVID-19 outbreaks. Thousands of children are quarantined.\n\nHalf of parents say their district adequately prepared students for remote instruction, a 15-percentage-point drop from last May. Concerns are especially high among Black parents, 37% of whom say their children were well-prepared for distance learning.\n\nParents’ confidence that their children “will eventually be able to make up any lost ground” has taken a dip. More than half of parents say online learning caused their children to fall behind.\n\nThese sentiments may help to explain why most Americans are in favor of resuming in-person learning. Among parents of schoolchildren, 7 in 10 support returning to full-time instruction in classrooms. Support is strongest among white and Asian parents and weakest among Black and Hispanic parents, communities that have been hit harder by COVID-19.\n\nThe poll was conducted online from Aug. 30 to Sept. 1 among roughly 2,000 adults in the USA. About a fifth are parents of schoolchildren. The poll had a credibility interval, akin to a margin of error, of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.\n\nSupport for mandates, despite controversy\n\nSivya Leventhal, 39, a mother of two in the Dallas area, kept her 7-year-old son home all last year, in part because he wears glasses and “wasn’t crazy about masking.” But the second grader was “so hungry” to return to the classroom and is now in school. He’s gotten used to wearing a mask and understands it helps to keep him and others safe.\n\n“Being together and wearing masks is better than the isolation of everyone being home,” says Leventhal, a Democrat.\n\nMasking was optional at his school this year – at least until recently: Texas is one of more than half a dozen states that banned school mask requirements. Leventhal's school district issued a temporary mask mandate in late August amid litigation throughout the state challenging the ban's legality.\n\nBefore that change went into effect, Leventhal says, case numbers at the school grew exponentially – by the last week of August, nearly 800 cases had been reported, her district’s data shows. “Percentage-wise, that’s not that high,” Leventhal says, noting the district serves more than 50,000 students. “But it’s so much higher than it needs to be.”\n\nA majority of parents in the USA TODAY/Ipsos poll agree with Leventhal that masks should be required. Research suggests masking at schools can limit COVID-19 transmission, yet it’s emerged as one of the most contentious issues in education, causing chaos at school board meetings and garnering lawsuits.\n\nMasks in school: These states have banned mandates despite experts’ pleas\n\nRoughly 2 in 3 Americans – parents and non-parents alike – are in favor of schools or states implementing mask mandates for teachers and students. Support is strongest among parents of color. Forty-three percent of poll participants say student mask-wearing should be at the discretion of individual parents.\n\nRespondents are similarly in favor of requiring teachers and other school employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19: 65% of all participants – and 56% of parents – say they support such mandates.\n\nDenver has a strict vaccine mandate for teachers: It's working.\n\nThe political divide\n\nOpinions are slightly more mixed when it comes to student vaccination mandates: Roughly 6 in 10 respondents – and half of parents – say they’re in favor of requiring eligible students to be vaccinated against the virus. A person's political views are most likely to determine their position: 31% of Republican parents of schoolchildren say they support such mandates, compared with 70% of Democrats.\n\nAbout a dozen states passed laws or issued orders that restrict schools’ ability to require vaccination against COVID-19. At least eight states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico implemented vaccine requirements for schools.\n\n“I think the masks are worthless,” says Wayne Pittman, a Republican father of three in Monument, Colorado. “They’re just a feel-good measure and a way for people to get mad at each other and point fingers.”\n\nPittman, 46, a civil engineer, strongly supports his kids' schools' return to full-time, in-person learning. “That’s where kids learn the best,” Pittman says. He says his children, ages 10, 13 and 15, grew listless from all the remote instruction last year, their motivation levels so low they even refused to walk the family dog.\n\nHe's wary of vaccine requirements as a way to keep them in school. Pittman is vaccinated – his parents have respiratory issues – as are his two older children. But vaccination should be a personal choice, he says. The decision to sign his teenagers up for the shots was largely based on convenience: The family will soon fly to Hawaii, which waives certain travel restrictions for visitors who show proof of vaccination.\n\nHe and his youngest child contracted COVID-19 this year, both with mild symptoms. “You should have the right to not be vaccinated if you’re not afraid\" of COVID-19, he said.\n\nMohit Mathew, 32, a pharmaceutical scientist in Germantown, Maryland, has a different take. School mask and vaccination mandates are “just common-sense rules,” says Mathew, who has a 5-year-old daughter in public school. He has “absolutely no doubt” that his daughter will get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as she’s eligible.\n\nMathew, who doesn't affiliate with a political party, says mask wearing is the norm in his community, including at his daughter’s school, which is one reason he felt comfortable sending her back for in-person learning. The school did a pretty good job with remote instruction, but the in-person experience is especially hard to replicate for children her age, he says.\n\nWhat parents fear: Kids' illness\n\nMany parents may feel such requirements are necessary because they’re worried their children may get severely ill from COVID-19. Nationally, children account for roughly 15% of all cases during the pandemic, according to data collected by the American Academy of Pediatricians.\n\nForty-one percent of parents in the poll say severe illness would be their top concern if their kids were exposed to the coronavirus, including 60% of Black parents. Among all parents, more than 15% worry about higher-risk family members catching the virus from their kids or their kids missing class time because of an infection.\n\nA majority of parents – 60% – say schoolchildren face greater risks from COVID-19 than they did last year.\n\nTameka Dumas, 48, a mother of two in Grenada, Mississippi, is wary of the return to in-person learning because of the health risks. Her younger son, who’s back in class, regularly tells her how scared he is of catching the virus at his high school. He doesn’t have the option of sticking with distance learning, and students at his school aren’t required to mask up.\n\n“He’s still giving it his all,\" Dumas says, but returning to school affects him emotionally. “We should not have to put that kind of stress on them. … It’s unfair for a child to have to go to school and feel that way.”\n\nTo Dumas, a Democrat whose son got the vaccine as soon as he was eligible, school mask and vaccine requirements are a no-brainer. “The more time these children are spending in that school” without such mandates, she says, “the more likely they are to get sick. I don’t know what the excuse is.”\n\nAsked about the people who shape schools, respondents are most satisfied with their teachers, though educators’ approval ratings have declined since pre-pandemic times. Respondents are least satisfied with the U.S. Department of Education, governors and state boards of education.\n\n“It’s just going to be an insane year,\" says Leventhal, the Dallas-area mother. \"What scares me the most is at some point, everyone is going to get (COVID-19). … The difference is I’m vaccinated, my husband’s vaccinated, my parents are vaccinated – but my kids aren’t.\"\n\nContact Alia Wong at (202) 507-2256 or awong@usatoday.com.

Last year, the virtual academy was available only for grades 6-12.\n\nAsheville City Schools, however, has no virtual option except in special cases approved through the district’s medical homebound program, a service for students confined to a hospital or to the home due to a medical issue.\n\n“We are going to use our medical homebound procedures, but we have adapted it to provide some additional services for students who may be out of school for an extended period of time,” ACS Director of Secondary Education Laura Parks said.\n\nStudents who have conditions that make them high-risk for COVID-19 may apply for the medical homebound program, in which students are provided a teacher through a third-party program for the duration of their time away from the school building.\n\nMore on ACS: Parents thank Asheville City Board of Education for mandating masks during monthly meeting\n\nBut students without a medical condition that makes them at higher risk for the coronavirus will be required to sit in classrooms, as Asheville City Schools opted for fully in-person learning in accordance with Gov. Roy Cooper’s COVID recommendations for schools.\n\nCooper, along with Secretary of the NCDHHS Mandy Cohen, released an updated StrongSchoolsNC Toolkit on July 21. The refurbished toolkit does not include any references to virtual learning.\n\nACS heeded all of Cooper’s recommendations for returning to school, including mandating masks, maintaining social distancing and keeping windows and doors open when possible.\n\n“I just want people to understand that this is not Asheville City Schools coming up with this information,” board Chair James Carter said. “This is the state and the toolkit and the things that we’ve been telling individuals over and over again that we are going to follow.”\n\nOther districts have strayed from the governor’s toolkit, however. Buncombe County Schools will require masks only for people who don’t voluntarily show proof of vaccination despite the toolkit's recommendation to require everyone to wear face coverings.\n\nOnAug. 9, at least one parent addressed the ACS Board of Education with these concerns.\n\n“It seems like a lot of folks really are wishing there was an online option at least. That does have the effect of then reducing the numbers in the schools,” ACS parent Shannon O’Conner said. “Social distancing is possible, but if you’re talking about less than 3 feet, it could add up quickly.”\n\nOther parents want ACS to deviate from the plan slightly.\n\n“I would love a remote option, until the younger kids can be vaccinated anyway,” ACS parent Amelia Lacey Buchholz said.\n\nOthers aren’t as set on wanting the district to provide a virtual option right away but are curious what ACS will do should cases continue to mount.\n\n“I personally never want to do virtual learning again, if possible,” ACS parent Stacy Claude said. “But I really would like some more information about what happens when kids test positive. Rolling 14 days of quarantine with no at-home learning plan … doesn't sound fun either.”\n\nThe toolkit offers different lengths of quarantine depending on symptoms and vaccination status, but if an unvaccinated student is exposed to or contracts COVID, they are typically required to isolate between 10 and 14 days. The toolkit encourages school districts to offer additional excused absences in these cases.\n\nDespite the toolkit’s outlined guidelines and ACS’s efforts to curb the spread of COVID in schools, some parents feel despondent — not convinced any safety measure in the classroom can help their children while the virus runs rampant in the community.\n\n“The problem is vastly bigger than ACS. At this point I don't think there's much they can do,” ACS parent Brooke Heaton said. “At the end of the day I think a number of people in our community have failed our children. It's pretty clear that we haven't made our children and their education a top priority in our community.”\n\nShelby Harris is a reporter covering education and other topics.

Will her husband’s new job at a school also become virtual, she wonders, or will he need to report to school? If it’s the latter, who will be able to watch her 6-year-old?\n\n“The whole thing is just nerve-wracking because there are so many unknowns,” Phillips said.\n\nBackground: Here's how JCPS plans on keeping kids safe when classes begin\n\nReturning to school puts a special pressure on parents of Jefferson County's youngest students because they can't yet be vaccinated against COVID-19. And, up until a few weeks ago, they didn’t have a virtual learning option.\n\n“The beginning of the year is always a time of some anxiety,” said Dr. Stephen Taylor, a psychiatrist and the chief medical officer at Peace Hospital. “But … throw a pandemic into that, and you create quite a stew of anxiety …”\n\nJefferson County Public Schools, along with several other Kentucky districts, expanded its virtual school offerings for interested families. But the late July decision means the district has had little time to find enough teachers for hundreds of interested students before school starts Wednesday.\n\nAnd not everyone could take advantage of the virtual school, with parents saying they didn’t have child care or didn’t want to give up their spot at their kid’s magnet school or special education program.\n\n“It’s not easy for any family and for any kids right now. …That’s the very tough situation they’re in right now,” Taylor said.\n\nJCPS’ universal mask policy calms some of Phillips' nerves. But as COVID-19 cases rise, and with her daughter not old enough to be vaccinated, Phillips questions if she made the right choice in deciding to send her to in-person classes at Fern Creek Elementary.\n\n“Not ever knowing if my kid is truly safe is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to deal with,” she said. “Once she can get vaccinated, I can breathe a bit, but it’s going to be a very long couple of months.”\n\nNo COVID-19 vaccine for majority of students\n\nA majority of students are expected to return to school without what health officials consider a key defense against COVID-19: a vaccination.\n\nAbout 52.7% of the more than 95,000 kids JCPS is expecting this year are not old enough to be vaccinated against COVID-19, according to district data.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many older JCPS students have been vaccinated, but the local health department has reported around 40% of children ages 12 to 18 in Jefferson County have been vaccinated.\n\nBack-to-school season comes as the number of infected kids grows. Around 500 Kentucky children under 12 had COVID-19 in June, Gov. Andy Beshear said in a recent press conference. In July, that figure jumped to more than 2,000.\n\nHealth officials don't anticipate a COVID-19 vaccine being available for those under 12 until late fall, at the earliest.\n\nInterested in education? Sign up for our education newsletter The Hall Pass\n\nFollowing federal and state health guidance, JCPS is requiring everyone inside schools to wear a mask, even if they have been vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\nBeshear on Tuesday afternoon backed that effort and issued an executive order mandating masks for everyone inside Kentucky schools for at least 30 days.\n\nStudents can be disciplined for not wearing a mask as required, but educators said mask wearing wasn’t an issue, even for the youngest students, during the spring.\n\nJCPS reported 85 behavior incidents tied to mask noncompliance during the two months of part-time or \"hybrid\" in-person education in the spring. About 60,000 students attended in-person school during that time.\n\nPressure falls on schools\n\nWith one kid going in-person, three going virtual and underlying health issues in the family, Alexa Quinn is feeling “concerned, worried and uneasy.”\n\nHer son has “awful asthma,” she said. She’s a cancer survivor with autoimmune and kidney disease.\n\nHer main fear involves the potential for her daughter, who is going back in-person to Farnsley Middle School, to bring something home to them because others refuse to be vaccinated.\n\n“Why are we not shutting down?” she asked. “If people cannot do their part, which they have proven with the newest mutation of COVID, why are we living like nothing is wrong?”\n\nTwo of her kids — a second- and a fourth-grader — are elementary school students not old enough to be vaccinated.\n\n“As parents, we have to do what we feel is best to protect and care for our children,” she said. “So my question is, who is going to protect the children?”\n\nBeshear previously said he was not considering another mask mandate, nor is a vaccine mandate on the table. But with a limit of 10 non-traditional instruction days (virtual learning) this year, districts have few options if cases continue to escalate.\n\n“There are no citywide mandates. There are no statewide mandates. And that puts the schools in an impossible situation,” Jason Linden, a parent and teacher, said.\n\nHis 12-year-old daughter, a seventh grader at the Brown School, was able to be vaccinated over the summer. His 9-year-old son, a fourth grader at Field Elementary, doesn’t have the same option. Both are onboard with wearing masks in school.\n\n“I’m not worried about my kids so much as I don’t want them to be vectors who make it worse for people in the community,” Linden said, later adding gatherings of unvaccinated, maskless kids — like during lunchtime — concern him.\n\n“I just wish people, in general, were being responsible,” he said.\n\nHigh demand for virtual option\n\nJCPS’ school board voted to offer a virtual option for grades K-5 two weeks before school started.\n\nIn less than a week, JCPS received more than 1,200 applications from elementary school families wanting to act on the option, called the Pathfinder School of Innovation.\n\nIncluding middle and high school students who could apply earlier in the summer, JCPS plans to enroll more than 2,200 students in its virtual school by the first day of classes, the district reported.\n\nThe district previously said applicants who haven’t heard back from Pathfinder by the day before school should send their child in-person to their original school.\n\nMaking up for lost time: As kids prepare to return to JCPS classrooms, are teachers ready?\n\n“We want to be able to provide this opportunity for as many families that want this,” JCPS spokeswoman Renee Murphy said. “We’re working through how we can accommodate that.”\n\nArtie Dietz, who led the virtual school while it was limited to high school grades, said he met with Pathfinder’s teachers from grades K-12 on Monday morning. Two traits stood out in the educators: flexibility and enthusiasm.\n\n“Those two skills have really come to the front,” Dietz said. “They’re really evident in the staff, and we’re hoping that we can share that with our students and their families.”\n\nPreparing for virtual school “is just like any other school year,” Pathfinder teacher Greg Bruce said.\n\n“You’re getting all of the materials together except they’re all virtual so there’s no standing at the copier,” said Bruce, a former elementary school music teacher who will teach eighth-grade social studies.\n\nSince his hiring, he’s spent the last two-and-a-half weeks working with other teachers at the virtual school, pooling resources and figuring out what still needs to be done.\n\n“We’re on an accelerated path. … We've been moving at a very swift pace,” Murphy said. “This is a whole new school, so we have been moving quite quickly.”\n\n'Confident in my decision to keep my kids home'\n\nChristy Hallahan signed her kids up for Pathfinder's elementary option as soon as she could.\n\nHallahan left her job as a nurse last year to help her now second- and fourth-graders through nontraditional instruction.\n\nShe felt “totally prepared” to send her kids back to in-person learning, masked up, in June. But as the summer wore on, and her friends working as nurses began seeing “worrisome trends,” she grew more apprehensive.\n\nThe East End mom saw her kids’ return-to-school plan and saw social distancing likely would not be possible in most classrooms.\n\n“That statement right there sealed the deal for me,” she said. “No way was I going to put my unvaccinated kids in a classroom with 20 other unvaccinated kids, and they can’t even keep proper distance.”\n\nMost classrooms’ inability to distance kids at least three feet apart drove JCPS to open elementary schools on a hybrid model rather than the planned full week of classes in the spring.\n\nAnd that's when case rates were lower, Hallahan pointed out.\n\nIf kids can’t “properly social distance, then that means you can’t safely go back to school,” she said.\n\n“The more days that pass,” Hallahan said, “the more confident I am in my decision to keep my kids home this year.”\n\n'Safety first, not second'\n\nLess than a week before school starts, LaPreesha Edison’s classroom is a work in progress.\n\nStacks of thin picture books, spirals of Velcro strips, laminated signs and a spare, uncapped glue stick sit on small desks across the room in Jacob Elementary.\n\nA handful of district-issued posters lay on a colorful rug at the front of the classroom, with cartoon kids encouraging students to wipe equipment after they use it and to “wear your mask.”\n\nGuiding her new first graders on how to be safe in school is at the top of her priority list, Edison said.\n\n“I always say, ‘Safety first, not second,’” Edison said, “Especially while we are, you know, fighting a pandemic.”\n\nWhen kids arrive at Jacob Elementary Wednesday, her first activity will be something “fun and engaging” about starting their first day of school having to wear a mask.\n\n“We’ll just talk about how important it is to keep everyone safe, themselves and others,” she said.\n\nRelated: Kindergartners are going to school for the first time. We asked kids for words of wisdom\n\nSome of her students didn’t come in the building for classes last year. Some may have never been in a school setting. “So I’m more … nervous as far as actually getting them in the door,” she said with a laugh.\n\nShe’s ready for a nervous kid, too: “I would say, ‘Show me your muscles, show me your smile. Show me how strong and brave you are, and we can rock through this together.’”\n\nAnd for parents who are nervous sending first graders — all of whom are unvaccinated — into school?\n\n“It’s our second go-around,” she said, adding that teachers have been trained and they have the masks and sanitizer they need.\n\n“We went through all the trial and error, and we’re prepared,” Edison said. “We have all the equipment.”\n\nReach Olivia Krauth at okrauth@courierjournal.com and on Twitter at @oliviakrauth.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/01/03/alachua-schools-start-new-semester-amid-covid-omicron-concerns/9047599002/", "title": "Alachua schools start new semester amid COVID omicron concerns", "text": "With Alachua County Public Schools set to begin their spring semester Tuesday, the omicron variant is causing concern among district officials, staff and parents.\n\nDue to the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, the school district has made the decision to reinstitute its mask policy for staff, vendors, volunteers and other visitors who come on campus.\n\nThe district also strongly encourages parents to ask their children to wear masks while in the schools, especially now that the school board's hands are tied when it comes to implementing a mask mandate for students.\n\nAt a school board meeting in December, district policy makers repealed their mask policy to comply with state law.\n\nCOVID updates: Cases continue to climb in Alachua County and Florida\n\nIs omicron spiking near you? Use this free tool to compare the spread of COVID-19\n\nRobert Hyatt, board chair, said the risks are more manageable now that all students have had the chance to get vaccinated.\n\n\"What we will do is continue to follow as closely as possible CDC guidelines and follow every avenue that's available to us,\" Hyatt said.\n\nSchool Board member Leanetta McNealy said the district will continue to follow safety protocols such as washing hands and social distancing, but parents should be vigilant in making sure that their children understand the importance of masking in schools.\n\nJackie Johnson, district spokeswoman, said in an email the district has been monitoring the spread of COVID-19 locally as Alachua County had a sharp uptick from 194 cases per week before the district went on break, surging to 2,072 weekly cases as of Dec. 31.\n\nJohnson said the district is concerned that cases will continue to increase with people returning to school from traveling and holiday gatherings.\n\n\"But we're also concerned that a significant increase in positive cases in schools and the employee absences that would follow would make it more difficult for schools to operate effectively,\" Johnson said, in an email.\n\nIn Alachua County as of Dec. 31, 68% of people ages 12 and older have been vaccinated.\n\nPaul Myers, spokesperson for the Alachua County Department of Health, said that of 19,260 children aged 5-11 in the county, 3,518 are fully vaccinated while an additional 1,786 have received just the first dose.\n\n\"We are scheduled to provide (the) second dose (and most likely some first doses) vaccination clinics at Alachua County Public Schools beginning tomorrow Jan. 4, 2022,\" Myers said.\n\nStates response to COVID surge\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis gave a press conference in Broward County Monday morning addressing the states return to school and the surge of the Omicron variant.\n\nAt the conference DeSantis said school needs to remain open and that schools are not the reason behind the recent surge.\n\n\"Kids need to be in school,\" DeSantis said. \"They do not need to be doing any crazy mitigation, just let them be kids.\"\n\nDeSantis praised State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo on his decision to no longer quarantine healthy children after a positive exposure, stating that the policy the Center for Disease Control had on quarantining was not good.\n\nThe quarantine rule, updated in September, allows for parents to decide for how long their children should quarantine if they are healthy.\n\nMore options: New private school hoping to come to Gainesville by fall 2022\n\n\"We revised that (policy) and said, actually, if you're symptomatic send home, but if you're healthy, you need to be in school. And that is our policy,\" DeSantis said.\n\nAlachua County Public Schools states that if a student has had direct contact with a positive case, it is recommended that the parent quarantine their child for seven days, however, the child is allowed to return to school if there are no symptoms presented.\n\nQuarantine is not recommended for students who are fully vaccinated.\n\nFor students who are at home quarantining, they can stay up to date with their school work through the canvas program which teachers are required to update daily.\n\nParents' plan to send child back to school upended\n\nSarah Rockwell, a parent within Alachua County was hopeful that she would be able to send her eight-year-old daughter Charlotte back to school.\n\nRockwell, mother of two, made the decision to homeschool her children back in August when the delta variant was rapidly spreading throughout Alachua County.\n\nDue to the relief that the Pfizer vaccination brought, allowing children ages 5-11 to be inoculated, she was going to reenroll her daughter for the spring semester so she could attend Talbot Elementary School.\n\nHowever, with masking no longer able to be mandated, Rockwell and her husband sat down to discuss their options because their daughter is considered high risk.\n\n\"At that point omicron wasn't here yet. but we could see the signs that it was coming because South Africa was reporting about it. And I I told him that when that wave came, we were going to see major issues because it's so much more highly transmissible even then delta,\" Rockwell said.\n\nAfter hearing the news Rockwell and her husband sat their daughter down , explained to the new state law, the severity of the omicron variant and that she wouldn't be able to return to school.\n\nCharlotte cried, Rockwell said.\n\n\"She's sad she's disappointed but she understands. She was excited because we were starting to move toward normal. Numbers were good. And she got vaccinated and it's really disappointing to me that we're basically throwing away all of the people who are in any way at high risk,\" Rockwell said.\n\nTeacher at high risk continues in classroom\n\nMaggie Paxson, a science teacher at Gainesville High School, has to be incredibly careful due to her health condition while she's teaching in the classroom.\n\nPaxson has a blood clotting condition called lupus anticoagulant. The ailment left her with damages to her left lung when she was 18-year-old freshman in college.\n\nShe recalled she had three blood clots in her left lung and was in the hospital for a few weeks because of it.\n\n\"I already have decreased oxygenation because of some tissue damage in my lungs. I could have a series of oxygenation issues. I could need a ventilator if were to get bad enough...I could die,\" Paxson said.\n\nShe said she takes all the precautions to prevent getting sick. She's triple vaccinated, obtaining her booster shot, and she wears a KN95 mask while she's teaching her students.\n\nLast year she taught virtual classes but, with the Digital Academy no longer being an option, she now teaches in person.\n\nPaxson said her students have been great when it comes to masking in the classroom, a lot of them knowing that she is high risk. She said, she's even had kids with mask exemptions who would wear their mask while they were in her classroom.\n\nPaxson said what keeps her going is that she loves showing up to work and teaching her students.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/01/03/jcps-classes-restart-in-person-tuesday-amid-omicron-what-parents-need-know/9077413002/", "title": "JCPS classes restart in-person Tuesday: What parents need to know", "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Despite a surge of COVID-19 cases in Louisville, Kentucky's largest school district plans to reopen to in-person classes Tuesday as scheduled.\n\nJefferson County Public Schools told families Sunday evening it is \"continually reviewing data to understand COVID’s impact on our school community.\"\n\nThe omicron variant of COVID-19 helped push local positivity rates to record highs over winter break, leaving some parents concerned about a potential return to virtual learning and the district's mitigation efforts.\n\nJCPS reported a 21.6% positivity rate from more than 6,400 tests given at its testing sites Sunday. Students, staff and family members were eligible for the tests.\n\nKentucky saw almost 30,000 new cases last week, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday afternoon — double the case total from the week prior. The state's positivity rate is at a record-high 21%, he said.\n\n\"Omicron has not only come to the commonwealth, it has hit us harder in terms of escalation of cases than anything we have seen today,\" Beshear said.\n\nSchools not having universal mask policies, given low vaccination rates for school-age kids, Beshear said, is \"going to make it very, very difficult to continue what I want to see, which is our kids in school with in-person learning.\"\n\n\"We got to have our kids in school, folks,\" Dr. Steven Stack, the state's top health official, said Monday afternoon.\n\nIf a school district opens this week without requiring masks, he said, \"you're going to infect the whole building in the first two weeks.\"\n\nAs kids prepare to head back to class, here's what parents should know:\n\nHow is JCPS addressing the omicron variant?\n\nExpect JCPS' COVID-19 plan of attack to remain how it was in the fall.\n\nIn a message to families Sunday, JCPS outlined existing mask, testing and vaccine policies. It did not share new ways of ensuring those policies are fully enforced — something teachers said has become an issue in recent weeks — or new mitigation efforts.\n\nJCPS is:\n\nRequiring everyone in schools, regardless of vaccination status, to wear a mask;\n\nOffering voluntary COVID-19 testing to all students and staff, both in school and at drive-thru sites after school;\n\nEncouraging, but not requiring, those eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine — anyone 5 years or older — to receive it.\n\nAround 90% of district employees are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, JCPS told families. Staff are required to undergo regular testing if not fully vaccinated or risk losing their jobs.\n\nThe district's \"test-to-stay\" and \"test-to-play\" programs will continue in the new year. If a student tested positive for COVID-19 over the break and was told to quarantine, they can test at a JCPS testing site. If they test negative, they can head to class Tuesday under the \"test-to-stay\" program, the district says.\n\nSchool board member James Craig tweeted Sunday that JCPS is \"the one place that takes COVID mitigation and safety more serious than any other in Louisville.\"\n\n\"We've offered vaccine clinics,\" he continued. \"We've offered free testing to the community. We've used our federal dollars for these things, while others stash that money for other purposes.\n\n\"Who is doing more than JCPS?\" Craig asked in a subsequent tweet.\n\nInterested in education? Sign up for our education newsletter, The Hall Pass\n\nHas JCPS changed quarantine policies?\n\nJCPS has not updated its quarantine policies to match recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying it is waiting on state health officials to make that call.\n\n\"Until we receive this from the state, we will continue to follow the existing guidance of a 10 day quarantine for those who test positive,\" the district told families.\n\nLast month, the CDC cut the amount of time those who test positive for COVID-19 or are exposed should isolate or quarantine from 10 days to five.\n\nBut the guidance for K-12 schools remains unchanged, partially due to low vaccination rates and struggles with masking at certain parts of the school day, like lunch.\n\nHow many COVID-19 cases are in JCPS?\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, there were 938 positive COVID-19 cases among JCPS students and staff — the highest ever number of active cases in JCPS.\n\nAnother 284 students and staff are in quarantine, according to the district's COVID-19 dashboard.\n\nNew cases and quarantines found at JCPS testing sites on Sunday were being added to the dashboard Monday, district spokesman Mark Hebert said. The dashboard also includes any cases and quarantines self-reported by families and staff.\n\nSearch the data:How many COVID-19 cases, quarantines are in your school\n\nCan JCPS return to NTI?\n\nYes, JCPS can return to nontraditional instruction.\n\nAll school districts get 10 NTI days under state law to use for districtwide virtual learning. JCPS has not used any of its 10 days allotted for this school year.\n\n\"Schools are preparing to have the necessary technology in students’ hands and implement their NTI plans almost immediately\" should JCPS announce a pivot to NTI, Hebert said.\n\nJCPS is also able to close schools like they would for a snow day. Since the district's school year is four days longer than what state law requires, the school board could forgive four days without students needing to make them up. Missed days can also be made up at the end of the school year.\n\nDistricts can no longer use targeted remote learning days, which allowed them to switch individual schools or student groups to remote instruction due to COVID-19 without closing all schools. The targeted days, which state lawmakers created in a special legislative session in September, expired on Dec. 31.\n\nLawmakers could restore that option when they begin the 2022 legislative session Tuesday. Board member Sarah McIntosh tweeted last week that she hopes large districts gain the ability to temporarily move to virtual instruction if needed.\n\nBoard member Chris Kolb tweeted Sunday he would prefer the district delay reopening a few days to allow everyone time to get tested for COVID-19.\n\nBut, he continued, JCPS has limited days that can be used for virtual learning or be excused, and state lawmakers have \"shown virtually no interest in helping us keep kids safe by granting more flexibility.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is that the federal, state, and city government have completely abandoned their responsibility and left our kids and schools out in the cold with no good options,\" Kolb tweeted.\n\nSome teachers pushed board members to consider using the days the district knows it has this week.\n\n\"I know our days our limited, but opening now would endanger schools & strain the city,\" Liz Palmer, a journalism teacher at duPont Manual, tweeted Monday.\n\nMatilda Ertz, a teacher at duPont Manual and Lincoln Performing Arts School, responded, \"We should use them when we know they will be effective. They will be effective during the current omicron spike. Period.\"\n\nRelated:What to expect as Kentucky General Assembly kicks off 2022 session\n\nWhat are parents' concerns?\n\nConcerns from parents, teachers and students range from health worries to fears of a return to virtual learning, and basically everything in between.\n\nSeveral parents fear reopening to in-person learning will cause the omicron variant to spread, causing already high positivity rates to climb.\n\nCiting reports of hourslong lines to get tested at JCPS sites over the weekend, some question if JCPS has the capacity to test enough to safely keep kids in school.\n\nHebert said JCPS and its testing partner, SphereDX, expanded testing hours at five schools Monday to accommodate the demand. They could expand hours again in the future if needed, he said.\n\nOthers are worried quarantines will worsen existing staffing woes, potentially to the point schools won't have enough teachers. Hebert said there is \"no magic number\" of teacher absences that would trigger a district closure.\n\nMany, with last year's unprecedented use of NTI still fresh in their minds, are worried students will have to return to virtual instruction once more.\n\nRelated: Demand for at-home COVID tests in Louisville outpacing supply\n\nHow are other school districts operating?\n\nSchool districts across Kentucky are making final decisions on COVID-19 policies for the new year, with some requiring masks after previously having them optional.\n\nBullitt County Schools is not changing its mitigation efforts from the fall, a spokeswoman said. Masks are required in Bullitt County.\n\nMasks became optional in Oldham County Schools in November. The district has not announced a change in its policy.\n\nBoth districts also plan to return to classes on Tuesday.\n\nWhat should parents know about omicron?\n\nDr. Kris Bryant, a pediatric infectious diseases physician with Norton Children’s Hospital, said experience with the delta variant of COVID-19 showed most children can attend school safely as long as precautions including wearing masks are followed.\n\nThe spread of the new, even more contagious omicron variant shows schools should not drop such precautions, she said Monday.\n\n“Now, if kids go back and omicron is circulating and it’s twice as infectious and people don’t wear their masks, I’m worried that we’re going to have a lot more cases,” said Bryant, who also is affiliated with University of Louisville Health.\n\nRelatively low vaccination rates also are concerning, with about 47% of all Kentucky children ages 12-17 having received a first dose of vaccine and only 16% of those ages 5-11 vaccinated, Bryant said. Vaccines are not yet authorized for children under 5.\n\nFor parents reluctant to get children vaccinated, Bryant had this advice: “If you have questions please talk to your child’s pediatrician and get your questions answered.”\n\nStaff writer Sarah Ladd contributed to this report.\n\nReach Olivia Krauth at okrauth@courierjournal.com and on Twitter at @oliviakrauth.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/08/01/parent-teacher-concerns-grow-oklahoma-schools-reopen-covid-surge/8031224002/", "title": "Parent, teacher concerns grow as Oklahoma schools reopen in ...", "text": "Every time the school bus passed by 7-year-old Cole Sandlin's house, he would break down in tears.\n\nHe missed school.

Her son is old enough to be vaccinated, but he's not because he doesn't want to be.\n\nChildren under the age of 12 are not yet eligible to get vaccinated. The district is encouraging mask-wearing and vaccination.\n\nAlso outside Fellows on Wednesday, Savita Devrajani was dropping off her daughter in third grade; she also has a son in kindergarten.\n\nDevrajani was also \"kind of excited\" about the start of the new school year. Her daughter learned remotely last year and missed her friends. \"It affects a lot of social-emotional learning,\" Devrajani said.\n\nShe said she would have kept her daughter learning at home if she could — she was nervous about there not being a mask mandate, although she was reassured by how many people were wearing them Wednesday. She also sees the benefits of in-person learning.\n\nAmes school board director Allen Bierbaum noted at the board's Monday night meeting of what he saw at Fellows that night during a supply drop-off and PTO social: \"The thing that really caught me is there are a lot of excited kids, a lot of life in those buildings, a lot of people that are excited to see their teachers and that is just awesome to see compared to last year.\"\n\nFamilies of immunocompromised students feel face tough choices as school starts\n\nAll excitement about some more semblance of normalcy returning to school aside, there are families in Ames who are particularly concerned about their children's potential exposure to COVID-19 at school — even as they see the benefits for their children of in-person learning.\n\nSeveral parents spoke to the school board Monday night about their predicament.\n\nKaren Stein thanked the board for a remote option — online learning is available in the district to middle and high schoolers, as well as elementary students who have or live with someone with a severe health condition — but although it helps an immunocompromised family member, it doesn't help her son with his 504 plan to accommodate disability and equitably meet his educational needs.\n\nStein said, \"In order to academically lessen the learning gap, he would need to be in school, in-person\" to receive the assistance he needs so he can be at grade-level.\n\nShannon Grundmeier told the board she's worried about her immunocompromised son, but said she feels she has no choice but to have him in-person at school for the sake of his education; he has an individualized education plan.\n\nDistrict spokesperson Eric Smidt responded to the Tribune's question of how many immunocompromised students are in the district: \"We do not have a definition of immunocompromised and that information is not something that we specially keep for the school district.\"\n\nResearchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2016 published in the Journal of the American Medical Association a finding that an estimated 2.7% of the adult population in the U.S. reported being immunosuppressed, based on the results of a 2013 national health study.\n\nCauses of having a suppressed immune system include autoimmune conditions, chemotherapy, organ transplants and infection with HIV.\n\nMegan Schroder, another parent who on Monday night addressed the school board in Ames, said she's cautiously optimistic about the year ahead, but was concerned that the inability to require masks leaves students vulnerable.\n\n\"I think our kids’ lives are more important than a bad law,\" she said. \"I’m worried, and I’m kind of just waiting for my kids to get COVID and hoping it’s not too bad.\"\n\nHow school board members in Ames feel about the year ahead\n\nBoard president Sabrina Shields-Cook said Monday that she also has an at-risk child at home who's not vaccinated. \"It’s terrifying, and I share the concerns of the parents who said being remote doesn’t work for their kids, because that is the same for my child as well, and it’s a very difficult position to be in.\"\n\nBoard member Jamet Colton said the start of school \"feels a little bittersweet this year, because there’s certain groups of our students, they are vaccinated and they were able to get vaccinated and the littles are not. So, I absolutely understand why people are freaking out, because I am, too.\"\n\nColton added, \"It feels awful to sit here and to know what works, to know that masks work, and not be able to mandate it, because you live in a state that there’s a law that says you can’t do it ... It’s the duplicity that feels awful for me not to be able to mandate something that we know helps them.\"\n\nShields-Cook said, \"I wish we could require masks, but we cannot. ...So, I personally will hope that it gets challenged and that there may be some possibility that that changes at some point down the road. For now, I’m crossing my fingers and hoping for the best,” and asking those who can get vaccinated to do so and wear a mask. “Please help protect our kids,” she said.\n\nMore:\n\nBoard member Michelle Lenkaitis said, \"Our governor’s putting a lot of faith in Iowans making the right decisions, and we all know the right decision is to mask up.

Our expert ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States is facing an unprecedented surge of Covid-19 infections, driven in large part by the very highly contagious Omicron variant. New research is coming out every day about Omicron, and people have many questions about what this surge — and the new variant — means for considering personal risk.\n\nTo begin with, what is the risk of Omicron to someone who is vaccinated and boosted? Are vaccinated children safe to go back to school? Is it safe to continue going to restaurants and concerts? And what’s the best way to protect kids under age 5 who are too young to be vaccinated?\n\nFor guidance, I spoke with our expert, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health,” and the mom of two young kids.\n\nCNN: What’s the main thing you want vaccinated people to know about Omicron?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: Everyone wants to know what’s the risk of this new variant to us and our families. Overall, there is reassuring news: Research strongly points to Omicron causing milder infection than the previously dominant Delta variant.\n\nAlso, people who are vaccinated and boosted are well protected against severe illness, and vaccination and boosting also reduces the likelihood of mild illness, too.\n\nThis means the risk to the individual person who is vaccinated and boosted is low. Someone who is generally healthy and vaccinated will probably not end up in the hospital if they contract Omicron. Those who are unvaccinated remain at high risk for severe disease, and one of the problems we are seeing is that hospitals are getting filled because of the number of people who are unvaccinated and then get infected with Covid-19.\n\nOverwhelmed hospitals impact care for everyone, because if hospitals are at or over capacity, people may end up with long delays to get the care that they need. This doesn’t just affect people with Covid-19, but patients with appendicitis, chest pain, and who are victims of car accidents could end up waiting many hours to be treated.\n\nCNN: Are vaccinated children safe to go back to school? Are there specific things that can help to reduce risk?\n\nWen: Yes to both. It is crucial for schools to remain open for in-person instruction. We have seen the many negative consequences of removing children from the classroom, and plenty of studies have documented that schools can be very safe from a Covid-19 standpoint, when protective measures are in place.\n\nVaccination is a key layer of protection. If your child is vaccinated, that reduces the chance of your child getting infected — and especially of getting severely ill — from Covid-19. Making sure that your child is wearing a high-quality mask at all times, indoors, is very important too. A single-layer cloth mask just isn’t enough to protect against such a contagious variant as Omicron.\n\nEveryone should be wearing at least a three-ply surgical mask — a cloth mask on top can help with fit. An N95 or KN95 mask is even better protection.\n\nIf you are particularly concerned for your kids — for example, if they have an underlying medical condition — you should contact the school and see if they can make additional accommodations, especially around mealtime. Unmasked children eating together, in close proximity, is a setting that could result in Covid-19 transmission. Perhaps the school is already taking precautions, such as having kids eat outside or in well-ventilated spaces, sitting apart. If not, ask if your child can eat in a space away from others, perhaps in an unused classroom.\n\nCNN: What about unvaccinated kids, can they go back to school?\n\nWen: First, I strongly recommend that all children 5 and older to get vaccinated. Vaccination is more important now than ever, with so much virus circulating.\n\nUnvaccinated children are at greater risk for contracting Covid-19 and spreading it, as well becoming severely ill. That said, other protective measures can still make it possible to send your unvaccinated child to school. Wearing a high-quality mask protects your child. Of course, it’s better if other kids around your child are all wearing masks. Even if they are not, masking still protects your child.\n\nCNN: The US Food and Drug Administration just authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech booster for children ages 12 to 15. Should my teen get a booster shot once it’s available? (Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss whether to recommend boosters for that age group, and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has the final say.)\n\nWen: If your teen is eligible, yes, absolutely, I would recommend the booster shot. The first two doses protect well against severe illness, but effectiveness to mild illness from Omicron is diminished. The booster dose restores this protection. The booster is particularly important if your teen has underlying medical conditions like asthma or obesity that predispose to more severe illness.\n\nCNN: Is it safe for vaccinated and boosted people to go to a concert, sporting event or restaurant?\n\nWen: This is a difficult question to answer because it depends on what you mean by “safe.” In most US communities, the level of Covid-19 is extremely high. Going to any of these places means that you will get exposed to coronavirus, because chances are high that someone around you will be carrying coronavirus.\n\nThat said, you can substantially reduce your risk. Outdoors remains safer than indoors, and outdoor concerts and sporting events will be much lower risk than if they were indoors. Indoors, making sure to wear a high-quality mask and keeping it on at all times will also make the activity a lot safer.\n\nThe same applies for dining, though, obviously, you won’t have your mask on to eat, and others won’t either. Outdoor restaurants are much safer than indoor restaurants. Indoor restaurants and bars are high risk settings, though ventilation and spacing can reduce the risk somewhat. Whether you go depends on how you feel about getting a breakthrough infection. Some people will want to return to pre-pandemic activities and would not be too bothered if they developed symptoms. Others fear the risk of long-haul symptoms and the unknowns of Omicron and would probably want to avoid indoor restaurants while Covid-19 cases are surging.\n\nCNN: What about children under age 5, what’s the best way to protect them?\n\nWen: I have two kids under 5, and they are not yet eligible to be vaccinated yet. The best way to protect them is to surround them with others who are fully vaccinated. Adults caring for the kids, including parents, grandparents, teachers and babysitters, should be vaccinated and boosted. Older siblings who are eligible to be vaccinated should get the vaccine.\n\nBeyond that, we can also make sure kids over age 2 are masked in indoor settings, and try to reduce indoor gatherings with others. This is not the time for indoor birthday parties and playdates. And I also hope that the FDA will expedite review and authorization for vaccines in this younger age group, as these younger kids are particularly vulnerable right now, given the high level of virus all around us.\n\nCNN: Should I try to catch Covid-19 since I hear Omicron isn’t so bad?\n\nWen: I hear this question being asked a lot, including from people who have been very careful throughout the pandemic. I understand where this question is coming from. It is true that those who are vaccinated and boosted are unlikely to become very ill, especially if they are generally healthy. And getting Omicron, in addition to vaccination, probably confers an additional level of immunity.\n\nHowever, there are still consequences to this infection. Some people – especially the unvaccinated, but also a small proportion of the vaccinated – could become very ill. Some could have long-term consequences. No one wants to inadvertently spread a disease to people around us, including vulnerable elderly individuals or children too young to be vaccinated. And there’s no evidence that contracting Omicron would be better than boosters in protecting against future variants.\n\nThe bottom line is that we should do our best to avoid getting Omicron. Take simple measures that protect you, and reduce your likelihood of infecting others, like wearing a mask while in indoor public spaces. For most people, that’s a small price to pay to avoid being sick.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/01/25/parents-voice-growing-concern-cincinnati-public-schools-prepares-hybrid-learning-model/4247903001/", "title": "Parents voice growing concern as CPS prepares for hybrid learning ...", "text": "Cincinnati Public Schools will start vaccinating teachers this week and phase into a hybrid learning model next week despite rising concerns from parents, students and teachers – especially surrounding a return to Walnut Hills High School, which the district has previously said has special safety considerations due to high enrollment and smaller-sized classrooms.\n\nDistrict teachers will start getting inoculated on Thursday, said superintendent Laura Mitchell.\n\nSchools weren’t expected to begin inoculating teachers and staff until next week. The Ohio Department of Health declined to answer questions about the earlier vaccination date on Monday night.\n\nA spokeswoman said Gov. Mike DeWine would discuss the school vaccination plan at his Tuesday coronavirus briefing.\n\n\"We are in the process of communicating with our staff about the vaccination plan,\" Mitchell said, stating a letter went out to teachers Monday afternoon.\n\nThe district says 4,000 employees answered a survey about the vaccine, 600 of which said they would not get the vaccine. About 400 others said they needed more information to make their decision. Additional information will be provided Tuesday during a district town hall.\n\nWalnut Hills remained closed while the rest of the district moved to a hybrid model in the fall. But last week Mitchell said Walnut Hills could return if the district follows a 3 feet of social distance criteria, instead of the 6 feet of social distance the rest of the schools are maintaining.\n\n\"Six feet of social distance with the space at Walnut would only allow them to be in class one day a week, in person,\" Mitchell said during a Wednesday board meeting. \"If we do 3 feet of social distancing, then that would get them to two days in person, and they would be... on schedule with the rest of the district.\"\n\nFollowing the board meeting, CPS announced Walnut Hills would start a hybrid model in March that allows students to be in the classroom twice a week.\n\nCharles Barilleaux has a daughter at Walnut Hills and sent a letter to the district outlining his concerns. He said he is worried about the rapid transmission of the virus if his daughter were to return to school.\n\n“I'll be blunt,” Barilleaux told The Enquirer. “It’s not just my kid I’m worried about. I’m worried about me. And I don’t want to catch this virus.”\n\nBarilleaux’s daughter Caitlin, a sophomore at Walnut Hills, also sent a letter to the board.\n\n“It seems as though most of you made up your mind about sending us back to school before hearing the remarks of the people who need to live with the consequences of your decision,” Caitlin wrote. “I have friends, parents, and teachers who are scared for their lives because of you. I was taught my whole life that school was supposed to be a safe place to learn in. Putting students and their families at risk disregards safety.”\n\nA Change.org petition to keep Evanston-based Walnut Hills virtual for the rest of the school year was created Thursday and had about 3,000 signatures as of Monday afternoon. Current enrollment at the high school, which serves students in grades 7-12, is more than 2,800, according to the school's website.\n\nErin Prus Carbon says she has a sophomore son at Walnut Hills. She said her son has been worried, stressed and confused at the board's decision.\n\n\"It's like a sardine tin there,\" she said. \"Teachers are upset, students are upset – I mean, I'm sure there's students who are happy, but when you think about distancing 3 feet, I'm not sure that– actually, no, that doesn't hold up to science.\"\n\nDistrictwide concerns mounting\n\nWalnut Hills parents are not the only ones with reservations about CPS's hybrid plan, which will start as early as Feb. 1 for students pre-K through the third grade and specialized classrooms.\n\nAnother Change.org petition against the board’s decision, entitled \"Keep Cincinnati Public Schools Remote Until Teachers are Vaccinated,\" garnered more than 3,000 signatures as of Monday afternoon. Districtwide, CPS employs about 6,500 full- and part-time employees who serve about 36,000 students, according to the district’s website.\n\nMore: 'It is no easy task balancing health and safety.'

Angie Wilson, a CPS parent, posted the video on Friday.\n\n“It seems premature to have our students go back when we’ve worked so hard for so long to stay safe” Wilson says in the video.\n\nWilson told The Enquirer she is the mother of two CPS students, an elementary schooler at Sands Montessori in Mount Washington and a high schooler at Clark Montessori in Hyde Park. Individually, she said that some parents felt powerless to the board's decision and that their concerns were not being heard.\n\nWilson wanted the board to see parents' faces and understand that they are \"not just letters, we're not just numbers.\" The video also shows the community's concern for teachers in the district.\n\n\"Even though I do not want to send my kid into the classroom, I also do not like the idea of my daughter's teacher, who we love, being exposed and potentially being sick,\" Wilson told The Enquirer. \"That affects everybody.\"\n\nSchool board member Melanie Bates told The Enquirer Monday that she would feel comfortable sending a child to school at this time. Her grandchildren are in preschool and first grade, she said, and \"they can't wait to go back to school.\"\n\nNot only are teachers about to be vaccinated, Bates said, but also Monday the district announced CPS staff will soon have access to onsite rapid testing.\n\n\"It seems like everything is falling in place with all the planning and the work that was done,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/25"}]}

Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison for federal racketeering and ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nDisgraced R&B singer R. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison Wednesday following his conviction last year on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from his efforts over years to use his fame to ensnare victims he sexually abused.\n\nProsecutors had asked the judge to sentence Kelly, 55, to more than 25 years behind bars, while his defense attorneys asked for 10 or fewer, saying prosecutors’ request was “tantamount to a life sentence.”\n\nSurvivors of Kelly’s abuse held hands and prayed as US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly began reading his sentence. Kelly – who wore a tan prison uniform, dark-rimmed glasses and a black mask at the hearing in federal court in Brooklyn – showed no emotion.\n\n“You left in your wake a trail of broken lives,” Donnelly told Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly.\n\nIn deciding the sentence, Donnelly said she considered Kelly’s own traumatic childhood, during which his attorneys said he was repeatedly sexually abused by a family member and a landlord.\n\n“It may explain, at least in part, what led to your behavior,” the judge said. “It most surely is not an excuse.”\n\nJovante Cunningham, a former backup singer for Kelly, praised the sentence.\n\n“I started this journey 30 years ago,” Cunningham said outside the court after the hearing. “There wasn’t a day in my life up until this moment that I actually believed that the judicial system would come through for Black and brown girls. I stand here very proud of my judicial system, very proud of my fellow survivors and very pleased with the outcome.”\n\nA jury convicted Kelly last September on nine counts, including one charge of racketeering and eight counts of violations of the Mann Act, a sex trafficking law. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York accused Kelly of using his status as a celebrity and a “network of people at his disposal to target girls, boys and young women for his own sexual gratification.”\n\nThe five-week federal trial in Brooklyn included testimony from witnesses who said they were sexually and physically abused by Kelly. The court also heard from people involved with orchestrating the disgraced R&B singer’s 1994 marriage to the late singer Aaliyah when she was just 15 years old and he was an adult after she believed she’d gotten pregnant.\n\nKelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said he would not address the court, pointing to the other criminal case faced by Kelly, but said before the sentence was read that her client “rejects that he is this monster.”\n\n“He accepts that he is a flawed individual,” Bonjean said, “but he is not this one-dimensional monster that the government has portrayed and the media has portrayed.”\n\nKelly made his only comment in response to the judge after Bonjean said he wouldn’t speak: “Yes, your honor, that’s my wish.”\n\nBonjean said she advised Kelly not to speak at the sentencing because of pending litigation against him, but added, “he has regrets. And he is sad. Nobody wants to hear what he heard today.”\n\nKelly and the judge are seen in a sketch of the sentencing. Sketch by Christine Cornell\n\n‘No one can undo the harm’\n\nPrior to sentencing, the court heard impact statements from seven of Kelly’s victims, including Jane Doe 2, who testified at trial.\n\n“It’s been 23 years since we knew each other, and you’ve victimized a lot of girls since then,” she said, addressing Kelly. She later added: “Now it’s your turn to have your freedom taken from you.”\n\n“No one can undo the harm that has been done to these victims,” attorney Gloria Allred, who represented three victims who testified, told reporters Wednesday outside court. “But at least it’s time for Mr. Kelly to be accountable.”\n\nDefense attorneys and prosecutors argued Wednesday in court over whether Kelly even could pay a fine. The defense said he is “pretty close to indigent” and could not. Prosecutors disagreed, saying money from the sale of some of his music rights and millions of dollars in royalties held by Sony could cover any fine.\n\nIn the nine months since his conviction, Kelly has replaced his entire legal team with Bonjean and her firm. Bonjean is the attorney who helped Bill Cosby get his sexual assault conviction overturned and also represented Cosby in a civil case he lost this month at trial.\n\n“We were prepared for it,” Bonjean said of the sentence outside the court. “We are now prepared to fight this appeal.”\n\nKelly is being held at a federal detention facility in Brooklyn and is expected to be moved back to Chicago, where he faces another federal trial in August on child pornography and obstruction charges.\n\nBonjean will ask for Kelly to continue to be held at the Brooklyn federal detention center as her team prepares for his upcoming trial, she told CNN on Thursday, adding she is based in New York. CNN has sought comment from the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Bureau of Prisons and US Marshals, who would be tasked with moving Kelly.\n\nKelly also has state cases pending in Illinois and Minnesota.\n\nChildhood trauma revealed\n\nIn over 14 hours of interviews with psychiatrist experts, Kelly said his closest relationship growing up was with his mother. His earliest memories were watching his mom perform as a singer in a band called “Six Pack,” and he would often accompany her to McDonald’s where she would drink coffee and they would share a pastry.\n\nKelly had never met his father and described his mother’s death as the most tragic event of his life, saying he would go to McDonald’s frequently to smell the coffee and remember her, according to a letter filed by Renee Sorrentino, a clinical assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\n“To me, the ‘M’ stands for mom. Going to McDonald’s is always being around my mother,” Kelly said.\n\nBut his childhood was also marked by trauma.\n\nKelly saw a childhood sweetheart drown when he was a little boy. And people interviewed by psychiatrist experts say Kelly was repeatedly sexually abused beginning when he was a 6 or 7-year-old boy, his attorney wrote, saying he was abused by his older sister and also a landlord, at times on a “weekly basis.”\n\nSorrentino said in her letter Kelly’s childhood sexual abuse may have contributed to his “hypersexuality,” or difficulty controlling sexual urges, and believes it was a factor in his criminal convictions.\n\nWhile Kelly was convicted of sexual exploitation of a child, Sorrentino refused to diagnose Kelly with pedophilia because he told her his “sexual behavior has never involved prepubescent individuals,” she said.\n\nFaith, another woman who testified at Kelly’s trial, countered that defense argument Wednesday in her victim impact statement, saying her own father had also been sexually abused as a child but “never molested me.”\n\nSupport for the singer\n\nAmong the letters that asked for a shorter sentence for Kelly was one written by Diana Copeland, Kelly’s former assistant who testified as a government witness and said she wrote a letter in support of Kelly because it was the “right thing to do.”\n\n“God doesn’t want us to throw humans away,” Copeland wrote. “If we have the audacity to care for the perpetrators as well as the victims, we can all rise.”\n\nJoycelyn Savage, who was considered a victim of Kelly’s by prosecutors, also remains a supporter.\n\n“Robert and I are deeply in love and it breaks my heart that the government has created a narrative that I’m a victim,” Savage wrote. “I’m a grown woman, and can speak for myself which is why I wanted to provide this letter to the court.”\n\nIn her letter, Savage revealed she is now engaged to Kelly.\n\nProsecutors faced threats\n\nAhead of the sentencing, a Chicago man who had attended Kelly’s trial in Brooklyn was arrested and charged for making threats against the three US attorneys who prosecuted Kelly, a copy of his arrest warrant shows.\n\nChristopher Gunn was arrested Saturday for allegedly posting threats to kill or seriously injure the female prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the arrest warrant, Gunn posted video to his YouTube channel in October, shortly after Kelly was found guilty, that showed an image of the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York where the women work. Prosecutors believe a voice narrating the video is Gunn’s, and he says, “That’s where they at. That’s where they work at … We’re going to storm the office,” saying each of the three prosecutors’ names.\n\n“If you ain’t got the stomach for the sh*t we ‘bout to do, I’m asking that you just bail out,” he allegedly said in the video.\n\nProsecutors also analyzed a CashApp account linked to Gunn that shows multiple transactions from February 26, 2021, to June 1 that indicate Gunn “engaged in the sale of firearm ammunition in relation to the Kelly matter,” they said. Transactions included payments for $20 with descriptions saying “30 rounds.. free R kelly.” CNN has reached out to an attorney for Kelly for comment.\n\nProsecutors believe Gunn was planning to attend Kelly’s sentencing on Wednesday after he posted another video saying he had a “spot” for supporters to meet up near the courthouse.\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for Gunn, who is expected to have a detention hearing Friday. The session had been scheduled for Wednesday.", "authors": ["Sonia Moghe Dakin Andone", "Sonia Moghe", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/us/nyc-synagogue-threat-arrests", "title": "No decision yet on federal charges for 2 men arrested in connection ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAuthorities are still trying to determine whether to file federal charges against two men arrested in connection with a threat against a New York synagogue, an FBI official said Monday.\n\n“No decision has been made yet regarding possible federal charges. That investigation continues,” Mike Driscoll, assistant director of the bureau’s New York field office said of the Friday arrests.\n\nThere is no information indicating any continued threat to the city’s Jewish communities, he added.\n\nAuthorities held a news conference Monday to outline the urgent joint operation that unfolded to stave off “danger that was developing in real time.”\n\n“The focused collective efforts of the (New York Police Department) and our partners were able to uncover, investigate and most importantly stop a threat to our Jewish community,” NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said.\n\n“This was not an idle threat,” Mayor Eric Adams told reporters. “This was a real threat.”\n\nChristopher Brown, 21, of Aquebogue, New York, and Matthew Mahrer, 22, of Manhattan, were arrested Friday, authorities said. They were arraigned over the weekend, court documents show. Officials would not comment if the men were previously known to law enforcement\n\nAmong the charges Brown faces are making a terroristic threat and criminal possession of a weapon, while Mahrer faces charges including criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a firearm, according to court documents.\n\nBrown was denied bail, and Mahrer’s bail was set at $150,000 cash or $300,000 bond, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said. Mahrer bailed out, according to a court website. Their attorneys have not responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nAdams listed an inventory of items confiscated from the men, including a Glock semi-automatic weapon, a hunting knife, a black ski mask, a Nazi armband and another firearm, its serial number obscured and outfitted with a 30-round magazine and laser sight.\n\n“A Nazi armband in NYC in 2022,” the mayor said. “Think about that for a moment.”\n\nOfficer recounts encountering suspects\n\nThe two Metropolitan Transportation Authority policemen whose quick response led to the suspects’ arrests were on hand at the news conference. Officer Ryan Fackner said he and his partner, Connor Colasurdo, were on patrol at Penn Station when a joint task force issued a be-on-the-lookout alert for one the suspects, who was thought to be traveling on the subway to the Long Island Rail Road.\n\n“We were up at … 34th Street and 7th Avenue when we saw (Brown) actually walk in with his friend,” he recalled. “They both walked in through the entrance. We followed them down the escalator, stopped them and made the arrest.”\n\nThe suspects were “completely compliant,” Fackner said. Brown and Mahrer were turned over to the local police and FBI, the MTA said.\n\nRed flags initially went up when investigators from the FBI/NYPD terrorism task force uncovered “a developing threat to the Jewish community,” Sewell said Saturday.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows antisemitic messages projected outside football game 01:27 - Source: CNN Video shows antisemitic messages projected outside football game 01:27\n\nThe threats – including a reference to attacking a synagogue – appeared on Twitter on November 12 and were traced late Friday to a computer at a veterinary clinic where one of the suspects worked, authorities said. One of the messages alluded to “big moves being made on Friday” but gave no specific target, authorities said.\n\n“Gonna ask a priest if I should become a husband or shoot up a synagogue and die,” one post allegedly read.\n\nLocal and federal authorities began hunting the suspects and homed in on them late Friday, law enforcement sources said.

CNN has reached out to the NYPD and FBI for additional information.\n\nAlleged plot comes amid rising antisemitism\n\nInvestigators strongly believe an imminent attack was prevented because one of the suspects had made threatening posts, obtained a semi-automatic weapon and had a Nazi armband, large knife and ski mask, they told CNN.\n\n“Today, we’re extremely grateful to NYPD investigators and our law enforcement partners who uncovered and stopped a threat to our Jewish community,” Sewell tweeted.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul praised the MTA officers who spotted the men, saying on Twitter, “Their vigilance & heroic work … helped stop a threat to our Jewish communities. Grateful to law enforcement for keeping New Yorkers safe.”\n\nThe latest threat against synagogues comes more than a week after a New Jersey man was accused of making threats to attack a synagogue and Jewish people.\n\nNew York state leads the nation in antisemitic incidents, with at least 416 reported in 2021, including at least 51 assaults – the highest number ever recorded by the Anti-Defamation League. There were 12 assaults reported in the city in 2020, the ADL said last week.\n\nThe arrests also come at a time when antisemitism is high on America’s mind amid backlash against former President Donald Trump, rapper/producer Kanye West and Brooklyn Nets player Kyrie Irving following actions deemed hateful toward the Jewish community.\n\nA total of 2,717 antisemitic incidents were reported last year across the nation – a 34% increase compared to 2,026 in 2020, according to the ADL.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'SNL' host Amy Schumer mocks Ye 01:39 - Source: CNN 'SNL' host Amy Schumer mocks Ye 01:39\n\nCalling rising hate “a dark cloud over our nation,” Adams called for more to be done to stamp out domestic terrorism.

A wave of killings followed.", "text": "BALTIMORE – Just before a wave of violence turned Baltimore into the nation’s deadliest big city, a curious thing happened to its police force: officers suddenly seemed to stop noticing crime.\n\nPolice officers reported seeing fewer drug dealers on street corners. They encountered fewer people who had open arrest warrants.\n\nPolice questioned fewer people on the street. They stopped fewer cars.\n\nIn the space of just a few days in spring 2015 – as Baltimore faced a wave of rioting after Freddie Gray, a black man, died from injuries he suffered in the back of a police van – officers in nearly every part of the city appeared to turn a blind eye to everyday violations. They still answered calls for help. But the number of potential violations they reported seeing themselves dropped by nearly half. It has largely stayed that way ever since.\n\n“What officers are doing is they’re just driving looking forward. They’ve got horse blinders on,” says Kevin Forrester, a retired Baltimore detective.\n\nThe surge of shootings and killings that followed has left Baltimore easily the deadliest large city in the United States. Its murder rate reached an all-time high last year; 342 people were killed. The number of shootings in some neighborhoods has more than tripled. One man was shot to death steps from a police station. Another was killed driving in a funeral procession.\n\nWhat's happening in Baltimore offers a view of the possible costs of a remarkable national reckoning over how police officers have treated minorities.\n\nStarting in 2014, a series of racially charged encounters in Ferguson, Missouri; Chicago; Baltimore; and elsewhere cast an unflattering spotlight on aggressive police tactics toward black people. Since then, cities have been under pressure to crack down on abuses by law enforcement.\n\nSo has the U.S. Justice Department. During the Obama administration, the department launched wide-ranging civil rights investigations of troubled police forces, then took them to court to compel reforms. Under President Donald Trump, Washington has largely given up that effort. \"If you want crime to go up, let the ACLU run the police department,\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a gathering of police officials in May.\n\nWhether that scrutiny would cause policing to suffer – or crime to rise – has largely remained an open question.\n\nIn Baltimore, at least, the effect on the city's police force was swift and substantial.\n\nPolice typically learn about crime in one of two ways: either someone calls for help, or an officer sees a crime himself and stops to do something. The second category, known among police as an “on-view,” offers a sense of how aggressively officers are doing their job. Car stops are a good example: Few people call 911 to report someone speeding – instead, officers see it and choose to pull someone over. Or choose not to.\n\nMillions of police records show officers in Baltimore respond to calls as quickly as ever. But they now begin far fewer encounters themselves. From 2014 to 2017, dispatch records show the number of suspected narcotics offenses police reported themselves dropped 30 percent; the number of people they reported seeing with outstanding warrants dropped by half. The number of field interviews – instances in which the police approach someone for questioning – dropped 70 percent.\n\n“Immediately upon the riot, policing changed in Baltimore, and it changed very dramatically,” says Donald Norris, an emeritus professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, who reviewed USA TODAY's analysis. “The outcome of that change in policing has been a lot more crime in Baltimore, especially murders, and people are getting away with those murders.”\n\nPolice officials acknowledge the change. \"In all candor, officers are not as aggressive as they once were, pre-2015. It’s just that fact,\" says acting Police Commissioner Gary Tuggle, who took command of Baltimore's police force in May.\n\nTuggle blames a shortage of patrol officers and the fallout from a blistering 2016 Justice Department investigation that found the city's police regularly violated residents' constitutional rights and prompted new limits on how officers there carry out what had once been routine parts of their job. At the same time, he says, police have focused more of their energy on gun crime and less on smaller infractions.\n\n\"We don’t want officers going out, grabbing people out of corners, beating them up and putting them in jail,\" Tuggle says. \"We want officers engaging folks at every level. And if somebody needs to be arrested, arrest them. But we also want officers to be smart about how they do that.\"\n\nThe change has left a perception among some police officers that people in the city are free to do as they please. And among criminals, says Mahogany Gaines, whose brother, Dontais, was found shot to death inside his apartment in October.\n\n“These people don’t realize that you’re leaving people fatherless and motherless,” Gaines says. “I feel like they think they’re untouchable.”\n\nA wave of violence\n\nOn a sticky morning in May, the Rev. Rodney Hudson slips on a black “Sermonator” T-shirt and walks down the street from his west Baltimore church, a gray stone edifice two blocks from where police arrested Gray. A few days earlier, a drug crew from another neighborhood set up camp on the corner across the street. Hudson says the dealers nearly got into a gunfight with the crew that usually works across from the elementary school down the block.\n\nSince Gray’s death, at least 41 people have been shot within a short walk of Hudson’s church.\n\n“Drug dealers are taking control of the corners and the police’s hands are tied,” Hudson says. “We have a community that is afraid.”\n\nTwo blocks away, Mayor Catherine Pugh and a knot of city officials are under a tent on an empty lot to break ground for a group of new townhouses. Police officers linger on the streets, and a helicopter swirls overhead. But three blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue, drug crews still appear to be at work. Shouts of “hard body” – one of the drug cocktails on offer – ring clearly. Another man shouts a warning as Hudson and a reporter approach.\n\nDrug dealers have worked Baltimore’s street corners for decades. But Hudson says it has been years since he has seen so many young men selling so brazenly in so many places. Dealers, he says, “are taking advantage” of a newly timid police force.\n\nAt least 150 people have been killed in Baltimore this year.\n\nEbony Owens’ son, Decorey Horne, 20, was shot to death in 2016 in a parked car along the narrow street behind his aunt’s house. Another man who was with him was shot but survived. Eleven months later, the father of Owens' youngest son, Sherman Carrothers, was found dead outside his house with a gunshot wound. He was one of four people shot in the city that night.\n\nOwens grew up in Baltimore and knew the city could be dangerous. But this, she says, is different:\n\n“I don’t remember it being like this.”\n\n'These guys aren't stupid'\n\nBy almost any measure, this has been a troubled time for Baltimore’s police force.\n\nIt began in April 2015, when officers in west Baltimore chased Gray, arrested him for possession of what they said was an illegal switchblade and loaded him into the back of a police van, handcuffed but without a seatbelt. By the time Gray left the van, he was in a coma. He died a week later. Protests followed, then riots. Prosecutors charged six police officers for Gray’s death but abandoned the case after three were acquitted.\n\nThe next year, the Justice Department’s civil rights arm accused Baltimore’s police of arresting thousands of people without a valid legal basis, using unjustified force and targeting black neighborhoods for unconstitutional stops. Investigators quoted a detective who said he saw officers plant drugs on a suspect, and a patrol officer who said his job was to “be the baddest (expletive) out there.”\n\nThis year, eight officers in an elite anti-gun unit were convicted in a corruption scandal that included robbing drug dealers and carrying out illegal stops and searches. One officer testified that a supervisor told them to carry replica guns they could plant on suspects. Another officer was indicted in January after footage from his body camera showed him acting out finding drugs in an alley. The city’s new police commissioner, Darryl De Sousa, resigned in May after federal prosecutors charged him with failing to pay his income taxes.\n\nFor civil rights lawyers and federal investigators, those episodes offer evidence of a police force in trouble and too often willing to trample the rights of minorities.\n\nBut some officers drew a different lesson: “Officers no longer put themselves on the firing line,” says Victor Gearhart, a retired lieutenant who supervised the overnight shift in Baltimore’s southern district before he was pushed out of the department for referring to Black Lives Matter activists as “thugs” in an email.\n\n“These guys aren’t stupid. They realize that if they do something wrong, they’re going to get their head bit off. There’s no feeling that anybody’s behind them anymore, and they’re not going to do it,” he says. “Nobody wants to put their head in the pizza oven when the pizza oven is on.”\n\nGearhart and other officers say no one ordered them to make fewer stops or take fewer risks. \"We didn't have to tell them,\" he says. \"We just said these are the facts, this is the situation, and if you want to risk your career, have at it.\"\n\nThat reaction fits a wider pattern. Nearly three-quarters of police officers who responded to a Pew Research Center survey last year said high-profile incidents had left them less willing to stop and question people who seem suspicious. Even more said the incidents had made their jobs harder.\n\nIt has also drawn scorn from civil rights advocates, who scoff at the idea that police can’t protect both the city and the rights of its residents.\n\n“What it says is that if you complain about the way the police do our job, maybe we’ll just lay back and not do it as hard,” says Jeffery Robinson, a deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, which had advocated for an overhaul of police agencies in Baltimore and elsewhere. “If it’s true, if that’s what officers are doing, they should be fired.”\n\nA sudden change\n\nTo track the change in Baltimore, USA TODAY examined 5.1 million police dispatches from 2013 to 2017.\n\nThey show that even before Gray died, the number of encounters Baltimore officers initiated on their own was dropping.\n\nBut in the weeks after the 25-year-old’s death – after protests erupted into riots, and the National Guard came and left – the number of incidents police reported themselves plummeted.\n\nWhere once it was common for officers to conduct hundreds of car stops, drug stops and street encounters every day, on May 4, 2015, three days after city prosecutors announced that they had filed charges against six officers over Gray’s death, the number fell to just 79. The average number of incidents police reported themselves dropped from an average of 460 a day in March to 225 a day in June of that year, even though summer weather typically brings higher crime. By the end of last year, it was lower still.\n\nAt the same time, violence in the city leapt to historic highs. Police recorded more than 200 murders and assaults involving guns in May 2015, triple the number in March.\n\nCriminologists who reviewed the records say it’s impossible to determine whether that rapid change played a role in the city’s rising crime, but some found the pattern troubling.\n\n“The cops are being less proactive at the same time violence is going up,” says Peter Moskos, a John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor and former Baltimore officer who reviewed USA TODAY’s data and analysis. “Cops are doing as requested: lessening racial disparity, lessening complaints, lessening police-involved shootings. All those numbers are just great right now, and if those are your metrics of success, we’re winning. The message has clearly gotten out to not commit unnecessary policing.”\n\nNeither the mayor nor Kevin Davis, the city’s police commissioner until January, responded to questions about the changes.\n\nAnthony Barksdale, a retired Baltimore police commander, says the message to officers was unmistakable.\n\n“These guys have family members who tell them 'Don’t go to work and chase people for a city that doesn’t care about you,'” he says. “If I’m riding down the street and I see an incident, I see it, but you know what? It’s not worth it. That’s what these cops are thinking.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/us/brooklyn-subway-shooting-wednesday", "title": "Suspect in Brooklyn subway train shooting called in the tip that led to ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nThe man suspected of shooting 10 people on a subway train in Brooklyn on Tuesday called in a tip to Crime Stoppers that led to his capture Wednesday, two law enforcement sources told CNN.\n\nFrank James, 62, was arrested without incident by patrol officers in Manhattan’s East Village neighborhood on Wednesday afternoon, officials said.\n\nJames called in the tip and told authorities he was at a McDonald’s on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the sources confirmed.

James was in custody by roughly 1:40 p.m ET, about an hour after he made his call.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Brooklyn subway station shooting\n\nJames is suspected of setting off smoke grenades and firing a handgun 33 times on a crowded N train traveling toward the 36th Street station in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood. The attack left 29 people injured, including 10 who were shot, though none of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening, officials said. Five of the victims were young people commuting to school, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nThe motive of the shooting is not yet known.\n\nJames was charged in federal court with violating a law that prohibits terrorist and other violent attacks against a mass transportation system, according to Breon Peace, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. If convicted, he could spend life in prison, Peace said. He was in federal custody Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJames will have his initial court appearance Thursday, according to a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. CNN has reached out to his federal defender for comment.\n\nJames had nine prior arrests in New York dating from 1992 to 1998, including possession of burglary tools, criminal sex act, and theft of service, NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said. He also had three arrests in New Jersey in 1991, 1992 and 2007 for trespassing, larceny and disorderly conduct, Essig said.\n\nWednesday’s arrest came hours after officials elevated James from a “person of interest” to a suspect – and shortly after the city issued an emergency alert to residents saying James was “wanted” and asking for tips.\n\nThe subway shooting represents a long-feared nightmare scenario for New York City, which relies heavily on its mass transit system. Subway ridership cratered during the Covid pandemic as many workers stayed home, and ridership has not returned to its pre-pandemic levels, in part due to wariness over an increase in violence on the transit system.\n\nThe photo gallery below contains graphic images.

After opening fire on the train, he got off at the 36th Street station, boarded an R train across the platform and rode to the 25th Street station stop, Essig said.\n\nLess than an hour later, he was spotted boarding the subway at the 7th Avenue and 9th Street station, about 1.5 miles away, Essig added.\n\nInvestigators combing through the shooting scene found a Glock 9 mm handgun, three extended magazines, two detonated smoke grenades, two non-detonated smoke grenades, a hatchet and keys to a U-Haul van, Essig said. Witnesses also described the suspect as a heavyset Black man wearing a neon construction jacket.\n\nThe gun found at the scene was purchased by James in Ohio in 2011, Essig said Wednesday. A credit card that was used to rent the U-Haul was also found, two law enforcement sources told CNN. Two officials told CNN they believe the gun jammed during the shooting.\n\nThe U-Haul van was rented by James, police said. The van was recovered near the Kings Highway Station, and surveillance video showed James leaving it on Tuesday morning, according to a criminal complaint. The neon construction jacket, which had been discarded on the subway platform, had a receipt for a storage unit in Philadelphia registered to James, the complaint states.\n\nFederal prosecutors believe he visited the storage facility filled with ammunition and more weapons on the evening before the Tuesday attack, according to court documents.\n\nOn Tuesday, authorities executed a court-authorized warrant to search the storage facility and found “9mm ammunition, a threaded 9mm pistol barrel that allows for a silencer or suppresser to be attached, targets and .223 caliber ammunition, which is used with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle,” among other things.\n\nAccording to the complaint, law enforcement executed a search warrant at a Philadelphia apartment authorities believe James rented for 15 days beginning around March 28 and found “an empty magazine for a Glock handgun, a taser, a high-capacity rifle magazine and a blue smoke cannister.”\n\nInvestigators did not find any other weapons or explosives in the van, two law enforcement officials said. The officials said it appeared James may have slept in the vehicle. They said a license plate reader detected the van driving over the Verrazzano Bridge from Staten Island into Brooklyn around 4 a.m. ET Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities also tracked the purchase of a gas mask to James through an eBay account, two officials said.\n\nHis family did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows inside NYC subway car 'after all the popping' 01:23 - Source: CNN Video shows inside NYC subway car 'after all the popping' 01:23\n\nPeople aboard the train car on Tuesday morning said smoke filled the car and gunshots rang out, causing people to push their way to the other side of the train in panic and confusion.\n\nHourari Benkada, 27, who was shot in the back of the knee, said he thinks he was sitting next to the shooter.\n\nSpeaking from a hospital bed Tuesday, Benkada said he’d gotten into the last car of the N train and sat next to a man with a duffel bag who appeared to be wearing an MTA vest. The man let off a “smoke bomb,” said Benkada, a housekeeping manager at the New Yorker Hotel.\n\n“And all you see (is) smoke – black smoke … going off, and then people bum-rushing to the back,” Benkada said. “This pregnant woman was in front of me. I was trying to help her. I didn’t know there were shots at first. I just thought it was a black smoke bomb.\n\n“She said, ‘I’m pregnant with a baby.’ I hugged her. And then the bum-rush continued. I got pushed, and that’s when I got shot in the back of my knee.”\n\nThe shooting started about 20 seconds after the train took off from the 59th Street station and felt like it lasted for nearly 2 minutes, Benkada said.\n\nClaire Tunkel, 46, who was in the subway car where the shooting took place, described the scene as chaotic. She said she couldn’t see anything because of the smoke, but she heard people crying out for help and others saying they were bleeding.\n\nPeople were rushing to the front of the car, and some fell to the ground, she said. “You could feel the bodies.”\n\nSuspect talked about mass shootings in videos\n\nEmergency personnel, including the FBI, search a moving truck during an ongoing investigation in the Brooklyn borough of New York, Tuesday, April 12, 2022. John Minchillo/AP\n\nJames has also been linked to multiple rambling videos posted on a YouTube channel. He documented his travel from Wisconsin to the Northeast in a series of videos in recent weeks.\n\nJames talked about violence and mass shootings in the videos, including one uploaded Monday in which he said he’s thought about killing people who have presumably hurt him.\n\nIn another video posted last week, James rants about abuse in churches and racism in the workplace, using misogynistic and racist language. Many of the videos that James uploaded included references to violence, including at a set group of people he believed had maligned him, in addition to broad societal and racial groups that he appeared to hate.\n\nIn another video posted last month to the same channel, James said that he had post-traumatic stress.\n\nIn a video posted in February, he also criticized a plan by the Adams administration to address safety and homelessness in the subway in part through an expanded presence of mental health professionals. In a racist and rambling recording, James called the new effort “doomed to fail” and described his own negative experience with city health workers during a “crisis of mental health back in the ’90s, ‘80s and ‘70s.”", "authors": ["Brynn Gingras Shimon Prokupecz Pervaiz Shallwani Artemis Moshtaghian Laura Ly Kristina Sgueglia Eric Levenson Mark Morales", "Brynn Gingras", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Pervaiz Shallwani", "Artemis Moshtaghian", "Laura Ly", "Kristina Sgueglia", "Eric Levenson", "Mark Morales"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/us/police-departments-struggle-recruit-retain-officers", "title": "Why police forces are struggling to recruit and keep officers | CNN", "text": "Durham, North Carolina CNN —\n\nIn a growing number of American cities, if you call the police, there are fewer officers taking the call.\n\nPolice departments across the nation are raising concerns about current and future staffing levels. CNN reached out to nearly 20 departments nationwide, along with other key stakeholders including elected officials, union officials and outside recruiters for departments for this story.\n\nThey all point to similar concerns including Covid-19, the great resignation, the climate for law enforcement and local reform efforts that are making recruitment and retention difficult.\n\nThe challenges have led the chief of police in Durham, North Carolina, to join her officers in patrolling her own city. The department is down 90 officers out of a budgeted force of 627. The department has started to offer a $5,000 bonus for new hires to fill its ranks.\n\nDurham, North Carolina, Police Department Headquarters. CNN\n\n“It’s been tough,” Chief Patrice Andrews said of the current staffing issues facing her city. “We’ve had to be very creative with staffing, you know, putting investigators and those that typically wouldn’t necessarily be taking 911 calls, putting them back on the street.”\n\n“The 911 calls don’t stop. People are still having emergencies, the emergencies don’t stop and certainly the emergencies don’t care if you are 60% staffed or below,” Andrews told CNN while she was on patrol. “This profession is, is something we were all called to do and not everyone is meant to be the police. This profession is certainly a noble one, even yet and still, despite everything, this profession is certainly noble.”\n\nA national survey from June of 2021 found that departments around the country on average were filling 93% of budgeted positions available, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\n“You’ve got a workforce that’s being compressed on the front end, you’ve got a drop in people who want to be cops. And on the other end, you have a significant increase in people who are resigning and retiring. And we have a survey that we did (that found a) 44% increase in retirements, 18% increase in resignations (in police departments),” according to Police Executive Research Forum President Chuck Wexler.\n\nOn average, officers spend 8 months training before they can patrol the streets alone, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Meaning, it will take years to fill the open jobs at departments across the country, Wexler said.\n\n“It’s a trying time to be a police officer in this country,” Wexler said. “So, police chiefs are wondering who are going to be the cops of the future.”\n\nDepartments are also struggling daily to cover those out sick due to Covid-19, and higher rates of crime, Wexler and several departments said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the department is down 440 officers or 7% of the number of police officers budgeted for the city, the department told CNN.\n\n“Well, right now it’s not a very desirable job,” John McNesby, head of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), told CNN. “Everything that’s been going on around the country for the last couple of years. … But right now, I mean just getting people to apply is a monster in itself.”\n\nDuring a recent recruitment event, 600 people said they would attend, only 200 showed up and only 26 moved on to the physical assessment phases, McNesby said. The FOP also points to a recently passed requirement that requires all applicants to have lived in the city for at least a year, as an additional challenge to find new officers in the city of brotherly love.\n\nIn Atlanta, which like many cities in America also saw unrest in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, two incidents of police use of force also put pressure on the local community. Community outreach events like Clippers and Cops, held in local barbershops around the city, are trying to “bridge the gap” between the community and the police. The events allow officers to open a dialogue between themselves and the citizens who they serve and protect, participants say.\n\nAtlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant, left, with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. CNN\n\nDuring an appearance at the event this month, Andre Dickens, the newly elected mayor of Atlanta, said he is working to get the police department back to full strength.\n\n“The goal is to be smart on crime, and so we have to have a balanced approach to safety and justice,” Dickens said. “That means getting more officers in because we lost about 400 to 500 officers over the past three years. So I’m trying to get those 400 officers back, but training them in conflict resolution and skills on how to de-escalate issues so that they can be better community-based cops.”\n\nThe mayor said a number of issues contributed to the decrease in the rank and file. “There was a morale challenge across the last couple of years with Covid and with a lot of issues related to police, excessive use of force that went unchecked, but then … everybody said get rid of police and these sorts of things,” Dickens said.\n\nTyrone Dennis CNN\n\nThe founder of Clippers and Cops was one of those 400 officers who left the department. Detective Tyrone Dennis retired from the force in August 2020, moved back to St. Louis, Missouri, to be with his family and took a job as a director of school safety, a job that paid more than being a police officer.\n\n“They got to do better with pay … incentives to retain officers,” he said. “It would be foolish for me to stay for $48,000. When I have a wife and three kids to feed for $48,000. I can almost qualify for public assistance. That’s not cool,” Dennis said.\n\n“Basically we’re one bullet away from death, and one mistake away from indictment so why roll the dice with my future when I can go do something else?” Dennis said.\n\nPolice leadership also say that pay should be more in line with work requirements. “When you think of what the line of work calls for and what they’re having to do, they’re wanting to be compensated, you know, but also to they’ve got to be able to support their families. You know, we have officers that can’t even qualify for apartments because their, their income doesn’t match up with what the apartments require. That’s a problem,” Andrews said.\n\nIn Phoenix, the police department is sending detectives and officers from various specialty assignments to patrol. Last month, the department started to take additional reports virtually rather than send officers out, police department spokesperson Sgt. Andy Williams told CNN.\n\nThe police department is down 13% of its allotment of officers, according to data provided by Phoenix Police to CNN.\n\nIt is offering hiring bonuses of up to $8,700 dollars for new hires with college degrees, the department said.\n\nIn Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Police Chief Catriana A. Thompson says the situation is “alarming.” The department is down 96 officers or 18% of its allotted force. Some of the department’s “specialized units have been disbanded temporarily until staffing levels improve,” Thompson told CNN in a statement.\n\nReliant Hiring Solutions, a firm that works with law enforcement around the country to set up job fairs, said it was more difficult to find recruits in more “liberal cities,” Randall Blanchard, told CNN.\n\nIn Seattle, the department is experiencing “unprecedented” losses of staff, the department told CNN. The department is short more than 225 officers or 17% of its workforce.\n\n“Our losses over the last two years have been unprecedented,” police department spokesperson Sgt. Randy Hyserik told CNN. “Many of our newer officers separated from our department and moved to smaller agencies in the area, and some left law enforcement altogether. In their exit interviews, many cited the ‘defund’ movement and a lack of support from local elected officials as their reason for leaving our department, or for leaving law enforcement completely.”\n\nSeattle’s attrition rate has over doubled in the last two years. Prior to 2020, the annual attrition rate was 70 to 75 officers a year. The department has had 356 officers leave over the last two years, according to data provided to CNN by the department.\n\nPeople that call police for non-life-threatening calls may have to wait longer for a response, unless staffing levels are improved, “you may be lucky if you get an officer 2, 3, 4 hours down the line,” McNesby said.\n\n“I mean it’s easier for me to sit here and talk about it,” McNesby said, “but it really affects the people standing at roll calls in the morning when they look to the left and look to the right and there’s nobody else there … or you have a citizen that’s on the line … where they feel the need for police attention and they dial 911 and you’re not getting anybody coming.”", "authors": ["Ryan Young Devon M.

The officer is currently on trial for second-degree murder.\n\nThe U.S. Crisis Monitor recorded more 7,750 demonstrations across the U.S. between May and August and found 93% to be neither violent nor destructive. No fatalities were reported in Ohio, but some protesters broke Statehouse windows, damaged businesses and spray-painted buildings.\n\n\"Over the past year, we have seen our nation’s first responders become targets of intimidation, harassment and assault. This is simply unacceptable,\" wrote Sen. Tim Schaffer in an email. \"We are a civilized society, and we don’t seek change through violence.\"\n\nThe groups representing Ohio's first responders agreed. Schaffer, who sponsored both Senate bills, has support from the Ohio Fire Chief's Association, Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association and the Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio.\n\nConcerns about criminalizing protest\n\nDemocrats and the ACLU of Ohio have concerns about the legislation.\n\nFor example, SB 16 would create a new crime for blocking traffic or “unlawfully impeding public passage.” If committed during a riot, as defined in state law, the charge could be a fifth-degree felony.\n\n\"When people think of a riot they think of cars being overturned or buildings on fire, but Ohio defines riot extremely broad,\" ALCU Ohio's chief lobbyist Gary Daniels said. \"Five people who get together in violation of disorderly conduct to commit a misdemeanor is a riot.\"\n\nIn a protest where thousands of people were packed into the streets, he said, a riot could be declared because people didn't walk away fast enough after an order to disperse.\n\n\"It's a direct slap in the face,\" Rep. Sedrick Denson, D-Cincinnati, said.\n\nHe's proud of the way Cincinnati worked to improve relationships between police officers and the Black community following a series of officer-involved shootings that culminated in riots, boycotts and a federal lawsuit.\n\n\"I’ve been a part of that ongoing work. This takes us 20 steps backward,\" said Denson, who is Black.\n\nImagine, he continued, seeing something like what happened to Floyd and pulling out your cell phone to record it.\n\n\"You start shouting and screaming, as any human might do, and that may be considered interfering with an officer, and you may end up in the same position as the person on the ground,\" Denson said.\n\nThat's what he sees when he reads HB 22, a bill that would expand Ohio's definition of obstruction of justice to include “failure to follow a lawful order from a law enforcement officer or diverting a law enforcement officer’s attention.”\n\nBut police officers who testified before Denson on the House Criminal Justice committee urged him to pass it.\n\n\"Officers are very vulnerable when attempting to make an arrest, especially in the absence of a backup officer,\" Ohio State Highway Patrol Superintendent Richard Fambro said.\n\nHe believes the bill would create \"a protective 'halo' around an officer\" and anyone who enters that space without the consent of the officer could be prosecuted.\n\nQuestions of constitutionality\n\nOpponents of all four Ohio bills have questioned whether they violate the First Amendment right to freedom of assembly and speech.\n\nSchaffer wrote in his email that he's been \"diligently working with our caucus legal team to alleviate any concerns,\" and the sponsors of HB 22 recently removed a section of their bill about taunting an officer.\n\n\"The only chilling effect these bills will have is on violence. Read the bills. Peaceful protest is a powerful American value, one that helped shape the beginnings of our country. These bills respect that,\" Schaffer wrote.\n\nBut Ohio's Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said lawmakers \"need to be cautious about creating new crimes and enhancing penalties\" – especially given the lifelong consequences that come from a felony conviction.\n\nProtecting law enforcement is important, Huffman said, but \"that usually can be done with better techniques ... rather than changes to the law.\"\n\nEven conservative groups like the Ohio chapter of Americans For Prosperity described HB 22's phrasing as \"highly subjective\" and potentially \"interfering with the constitutional exercise of the rights of free assembly and speech.\"\n\n\"More generally, HB 22 exemplifies a continuing problematic trend of overcriminalization by the legislature over the course of the last several decades,\" AFP Ohio State Director Micah Derry said in his testimony. \"This bill is not necessary.

The 52-year-old will be eligible for parole under Georgia law only after he has served 30 years in prison because he was convicted of serious violent felonies.\n\nBefore handing down the sentence, Walmsley held a minute of silence, saying it “represents a fraction of the time Ahmaud Arbery was running” through the neighborhood outside Brunswick before he was killed on February 23, 2020.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nHe described the killing as a “chilling, truly disturbing scene,” telling the court, “When I thought about this, I thought from a lot of different angles. And I kept coming back to the terror that must have been in the mind of the young man running through Satilla Shores.”\n\nArbery’s mother and father cried as the sentences were handed down, according to a pool reporter present. Gregory McMichael leaned back in his chair and appeared visibly shaken, the reporter added, after his son was sentenced.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ahmaud Arbery's mother demands killers get max sentence 02:10 - Source: CNN Ahmaud Arbery's mother demands killers get max sentence 02:10\n\nEarlier in the day, Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones delivered a victim impact statement aimed at achieving a stiffer sentence, asking the judge to impose the maximum sentence.\n\n“I made a promise to you the day I laid you to rest,” she said, speaking directly to her late son. “I told you I love you, and someday, somehow, I would get you justice.”\n\n“Son, I love you as much today as I did the day you were born. Raising you was the honor of my life, and I’m very proud of you.”\n\nThe judge imposed additional prison time for each of the defendants for other felony charges. For the McMichaels, that additional time will be served concurrent to each other but consecutive to the life sentence, Walmsley ruled. As a result, both face total sentences of life without parole plus 20 years.\n\nFor Bryan, Walmsley imposed additional imprisonment sentences of 10 years for his false imprisonment conviction and 5 years for his criminal attempt to commit a felony conviction. Unlike the sentence for the McMichaels, the additional sentence for Bryan totaling 15 years will be suspended, resulting in a total sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole.\n\nSentencing, Walmsley said, “does not generally provide closure,” though that may be what Arbery’s family and the community are seeking.\n\n“Instead of closure, maybe it would be best to see today’s proceeding as an exercise in accountability,” the judge said. “We are all accountable for our own actions. Today demonstrates that everybody is accountable to the rule of law. Taking the law into your own hands is a dangerous endeavor.”\n\nAt a news conference after the sentencing, Arbery’s mother was asked how important was it for her to respond to comments from Gregory McMichael’s defense attorney Laura Hogue, who called Arbery’s toenails long and dirty in her closing arguments.\n\nCooper-Jones responded saying, “The long toenails that she brought up in her closing argument, she failed to mention that Ahmaud was laying there in the middle of the road with a big hole in his chest. She left that part out,” she said. “I didn’t want to mention that today, but I wanted to reiterate that Ahmaud was bigger, he was bigger than that.”\n\nThe sprawling legal saga isn’t over: The men’s attorneys say they’ll appeal the verdicts; a federal hate crime trial is slated for next month; Arbery’s mother has filed a civil lawsuit; and the original prosecutor faces charges over her alleged handling of the case.\n\nDefendants face decades in prison\n\nDefense attorneys argued for leniency on behalf of their clients, who told police after the shooting that they chased Arbery because they believed he had committed a crime in their neighborhood.\n\nThe defendants, their attorneys argued Friday, were upstanding members of their communities who had made mistakes, but whose actions did not deserve among the harshest possible sentences.\n\nTravis McMichael is a “devoted father,” said his attorney Robert Rubin, and a “hard worker,” who thought he was doing the right thing for his community at the time of Arbery’s killing.\n\n“Nothing in Travis McMichael’s life suggests that he’s a danger to society now, or will be a danger to society 30 years from now after he has time to think, to work, to grow,” Rubin said. “When he’s in his 60s, older than me right now, do we still need, want a person like Travis McMichael behind bars?”\n\nHogue similarly asked for life with parole for her client, arguing he was a good man and Arbery’s death was an unintended consequence of his actions.\n\n“If life without parole is a sentence that is held for only the worst of the worst, it simply can’t be a sentence for a person who never intended that tragic result that took place on February 23, (2020),” she said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Mother of Ahmaud Arbery describes the moment she heard guilty verdict 03:02 - Source: CNN Mother of Ahmaud Arbery describes the moment she heard guilty verdict 03:02\n\nAttorney Kevin Gough distinguished Bryan, his client, from the McMichaels. Bryan did not know what was happening when he joined the pursuit of Arbery, Gough argued, nor did he have a weapon with him. And after Arbery was dead, he cooperated with law enforcement, Gough said.\n\n“I think it is readily clear that while Mr. Bryan has disputed and continues to dispute whether things that he did that day constituted crimes, he has never questioned the tragedy of this death,” Gough said.\n\nThe McMichaels were armed as they gave chase that afternoon in February 2020, and Bryan later joined the pursuit, recording it from his pickup. Bryan’s video shows Travis McMichael exit his truck and confront Arbery, who tussles with Travis over a shotgun before the younger McMichael fatally shoots him.\n\nThe McMichaels claimed they were conducting a citizen’s arrest and acting in self-defense. Bryan said he took no part in the killing. Authorities made no immediate arrests. The men were so confident in their defense, they had Bryan’s video released to the public in May 2020, according to criminal defense attorney Alan Tucker.\n\nIt helped spell their undoing. The 36-second video sparked outrage that soon dovetailed with outcries over the killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nAt trial, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski ripped holes in the self-defense and citizen’s arrest claims, emphasizing Travis McMichael acknowledged never seeing Arbery armed and never hearing Arbery threaten anyone. She pointed out inconsistencies between his testimony and what he initially told investigators, spurring him to testify he was “mixed up” and traumatized when police arrived.\n\nDunikoski pointedly questioned how Arbery could be an aggressor when he was unarmed on foot and repeatedly tried to elude three men, two of them armed, in trucks.\n\nJudge Walmsley said Friday that Arbery was “hunted down and shot” by a group of individuals who had taken the law into their own hands.\n\n“Remorse I think can be determined by looking at somebody’s reaction to difficult circumstances and the reality of the situation that they’re in … Remorse is something that’s felt and demonstrated,” the judge said. “In this case, getting back to the video, again, after Ahmaud Arbery fell, the McMichaels turned their backs … and they walked away.”\n\n“This was a killing – it was callous,” he said, “and it occurred, as far as the court is concerned, based upon the evidence, because confrontation was being sought.”\n\nAppeals coming, defense lawyers say\n\nA jury of nine White women, two White men and one Black man heard from 23 witnesses over eight days. During 11 hours of deliberation, jurors asked to see two clips of the video.\n\nTravis McMichael was convicted on all counts: malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, one count of false imprisonment and one count of criminal attempt to commit a felony. His father was convicted on all counts except malice murder, and Bryan was found guilty of all charges aside from malice murder, one felony murder count and one aggravated assault count.\n\nFollowing the verdicts, Travis McMichael’s attorneys said their client is “sorry for what happened to Ahmaud Arbery,” and they plan to appeal. One of the father’s attorneys, Laura Hogue, was “floored” by the verdict and intends to appeal, she said. Bryan’s attorney, Kevin Gough, said he feels “appellate courts will reverse this conviction.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Stoic': Attorney describes one defendant's reaction after verdict 01:56 - Source: CNN 'Stoic': Attorney describes one defendant's reaction after verdict 01:56\n\nRace was a steady factor, and not solely because of the defendants’ and Arbery’s skin tones. Walmsley expressed concern about the jury’s makeup, and Gough and Hogue were accused of making insensitive remarks, with the latter accused of dehumanizing Arbery by raising his “long, dirty toenails” during closing arguments.\n\nDuring her victim impact statement on Friday, Arbery’s mother brought up her son’s toenails in an overt nod to Hogue’s comment.\n\n“He was messy. He sometimes refused to wear socks or take good care of his good clothing. I wish he would have cut and cleaned his toenails before he went out for that jog that day,” Cooper-Jones said during her statement.\n\n“I guess he would have if he knew he would be murdered.”\n\nDuring jury selection, Gough complained of a dearth of older White men without college degrees. Glynn County is 69% White and 27% Black.\n\nRace could be a component of the appeals process, as Gough repeatedly called for mistrials because prominent Black pastors accompanied the family in the courtroom and attended a “Prayer Wall” outside the courthouse during trial.\n\nDunikoski alleged Gough’s complaints about Black pastors in the courtroom led to the Prayer Wall.\n\n“That is good lawyering right there because now he’s motioned for a mistrial based on something that he caused,” she said. Later, Dunikoski added Gough “intentionally and strategically, I believe, did what he did in an effort to attempt to insert potentially some error into the case in case he lost the case and it went up on appeal.”\n\nThe defendants have maintained their innocence on federal hate crime charges, including interference with rights and attempted kidnapping. The McMichaels were also charged with using, carrying and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence; and Travis McMichael was charged with discharging a firearm.\n\nFederal prosecutors say the defendants “used force and threats of force to intimidate and interfere with Arbery’s right to use a public street because of his race.”\n\n“We are deeply disappointed that the Justice Department bought the false narrative that the media and state prosecutors have promulgated,” Travis McMichael’s defense team said.\n\nThe federal trial is scheduled for February 7, one month after the men’s sentencing. Because they’ve remained at Glynn County Detention Center since their arrest, there’s been no federal bond hearing. If convicted on the weapons charges or interference with rights counts, they face additional penalties of up to life in prison with possible six-figure fines.\n\nFederal prosecutors asked Arbery’s mother if she would consider a plea deal for the men who killed her son, her attorney told CNN Friday. She declined.\n\nArbery’s mom has also filed a civil lawsuit targeting the men and police and prosecutorial officials. Among the officials is former District Attorney Jackie Johnson, who lost her November 2020 reelection bid after a decade overseeing the five-county circuit.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's killers puts new focus on first prosecutor 03:11 - Source: CNN Conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's killers puts new focus on first prosecutor 03:11\n\nFollowing Arbery’s shooting, Gregory McMichael called Johnson, for whom he worked as an investigator until 2019, saying he needed advice. Glynn County police officers who responded to the scene also reached out to Johnson for advice. No one was arrested for two and a half months.\n\nJohnson was indicted in September on counts of violating her oath of office and hindering law enforcement. She’s accused of directing officers not to arrest Travis McMichael, “contrary to the laws of said State” and “showing favor and affection to Greg McMichael during the investigation,” according to the indictment. She recused herself from the case the day after the killing, citing her connection to Gregory McMichael.\n\nCNN’s attempts to reach Johnson have been unsuccessful. She denied any wrongdoing in an October 2020 debate during her reelection campaign, saying, “It is a tragedy for the family. I’m sorry how things happened. I’m sorry that a lie got started and I could not turn it back.”", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Eliott C. Mclaughlin Alta Spells Devon M. Sayers", "Dakin Andone", "Eliott C.

The violence was from police only,\" said Sally Frank of the National Lawyers Guild, a human rights defense group. \"Certainly, the first or second dispersal warning was muffled, but everyone got out of the street. By the time the dispersal order was audible, everyone was on the sidewalk, but police moved in.\n\n\"Some people were dispersing and were chased, and other people weren't given the opportunity and were grabbed within seconds.\"\n\nA professor of law at Drake University, Frank said a legal observer with the guild was among those arrested. Legal observers are not affiliated with protest groups and are there to see whether people's First Amendment rights are being violated.\n\nSgt. Paul Parizek, spokesman for Des Moines police, did not directly respond to questions about protester behavior Monday night.\n\n\"Our position has been clear from the beginning,\" Parizek said. \"Peaceful protest is welcome and supported but disorderly conduct, disruption of peaceful neighborhoods, and destruction of property has an expiration date. It won’t be allowed to continue.\"\n\nOfficials with the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa said many concerns have been raised about how law enforcement handled Monday's demonstrations, which ended with about 20 arrests by Des Moines and West Des Moines police and the Iowa State Patrol.\n\n\"We are in communication with eyewitnesses to the police actions last night,\" ACLU of Iowa Legal Director Rita Bettis Austen said in a statement. \"There are credible accounts of police action in violation of the constitutional guarantee of free speech, including 'kettling' and the use of excessive force on nonviolent protesters including a child, media and a legal observer.\"\n\nKettling has been reported in New York, Washington, D.C., and other cities dealing with protests and riots following the Memorial Day death of George Floyd, a Black man, while he was being detained by a white police officer in Minneapolis. A class-action lawsuit filed in St. Louis last fall alleged St. Louis police kettled more than 100 protesters in 2017.\n\nWhat happened Monday\n\nMatthew Bruce, a leader of Black Lives Matter Des Moines, led a group of 150 people on a march from East High School to the Iowa Capitol. Law enforcement officials kettled them around 11 p.m. and then chased them as they tried to disperse, Bruce and several others said.\n\nVideo uploaded to Twitter, Instagram and Facebook appears to show either Des Moines police or state troopers bracketing groups of people in the shadow of the Capitol. A Register reporter covering Monday night's demonstrations reported seeing officers on both sides of a group of peaceful organizers near downtown Des Moines.\n\n\"They were literally like, 'Y'all got to get out of the street' and we said, 'Where are we supposed to go? We're surrounded.' The answer was pretty much to jail,\" Bruce said.\n\nState patrol spokesman Sgt. Alex Dinkla said troopers have, upon request, been helping local law enforcement during demonstrations under a \"unified command structure.\"\n\nParizek did not mention kettling specifically when told about the accusation from protesters, but said there was \"always an avenue\" for demonstrators to leave and avoid arrest. West Des Moines police did not immediately return calls seeking comment.\n\n\"There were multiple dispersal orders given, appropriately spaced in time, to allow those who chose to comply the opportunity to do so,\" Parizek said. \"Based on the social media videos circulating, it appears that confrontation with the police was the desired outcome for many.\"\n\nSome protesters said they felt they did not have enough time, or space, to properly disperse.\n\nBerina Smajlovic, 30, who was in Bruce's group, said members were marching peacefully when they saw \"cops on all directions, blocking every intersection\" as they walked near the Capitol.\n\n\"They demanded that we disperse,\" Smajlovic said. \"We had nowhere to disperse to, because we were trapped in. It wasn’t even a full minute before they started approaching us.\"\n\nShe said she saw people pushed, beaten and arrested as they tried to comply with police orders.\n\nEven though he wasn't among those detained, Bruce still spent four hours at the Polk County Jail. He said leaders with BLM Des Moines and the Des Moines Mutual Aid Bail Fund worked from 3 a.m. to about 7:30 a.m. to get bail for protesters in police custody.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bruce lamented media reports that said demonstrators \"clashed\" with police.\n\n\"Yesterday, (police) definitely were coming for a fight. They literally told us 'We're beyond talking.' ... They're completely trying to take control of the movement and not let people speak and act freely,\" Bruce said.\n\nQuestions about police tactics persist\n\nAdvocates, attorneys and protesters have been critical of how Des Moines police have dispersed crowds of unarmed protesters since demonstrations began nearly a month ago.\n\nA Des Moines woman is suing police because she said she was pepper-sprayed although she was not being violent and no curfew was implemented that night.\n\nSmajlovic said officers insulted protesters Monday and hit them with riot shields, batons and their hands. Parizek said he could not speak to what was said by officers and did not immediately respond to a follow-up email.\n\nMonday night was problematic, Frank said, but her group has long been watching how protesters in Des Moines are treated.\n\n\"They’re using chemical weapons that are banned in warfare against peaceful protesters,” she said of police. “Several people in the early nights were arrested blocks away from where dispersal orders were given.\n\n\"If you give an order to disperse and then they’re blocks away, it sounds like they dispersed.”\n\nDes Moines police have used tear gas and pepper spray on multiple occasions during the near-nightly protests. They said they have used crowd-dispersal tactics when protesters are damaging property, harming officers or have gathered unlawfully after a curfew.\n\nHowever, one man who spoke with the Register earlier this month said he was charged while walking into his home. Police said the group he was a part of was seen causing a disturbance shortly before they went inside an apartment building. Another group of seemingly peaceful people was arrested outside the Blazing Saddle bar.\n\nMany protesters Monday night said no one in their group had hurt officers or broken anything. Any neighborhood disturbances came after police followed protesters to their cars, which were parked at East High School, Smajlovic said.\n\nOnce people had cleared the street and started to walk away from downtown, officers followed and told them that as long as they were in a large gathering, they were subject to arrest, Smajlovic said.\n\n\"Protesters responded, 'We are dispersing. We’re just trying to get to our cars. Our cars are in the same location. This is why we’re walking there together in the same direction,'\" she said. \"And police just kept following us and pushing people and grabbing anybody that was slowing down or injured.\"\n\nFrank said that many cities around the U.S. have had to settle lawsuits over arresting people without giving them an exit.\n\nShe cited a 2016 settlement stemming from a 2002 mass arrest by the Washington, D.C., Park Police that ordered them not to use chemical weapons to disperse crowds. She said they had violated that order on June 1, and that the ACLU has since filed a lawsuit on behalf of BLM DC.\n\nMonday's events involved the first known instance of kettling during the Des Moines protests, Frank said. Smajlovic said she has been protesting nearly every day of the month, and she has not yet seen police surround demonstrators the way they did Monday.\n\nLaw enforcement experts on use of force\n\nWithout concerted effort, violence at protests can become self-perpetuating, University of Iowa sociology professor Bodi Vasi said earlier this month. A Register reporter spoke with Vasi after dozens were arrested near the Capitol building in Des Moines.\n\nVasi studied the role of social media in the Occupy Wall Street movement, specifically. His research in the case found that perceptions of unjustified force used against peaceful protesters would lead to more protests — and with them, more use of force.\n\n\"The vast majority of police and protesters have good intentions,\" Vasi said. \"It only takes a small number of people with bad intentions to create instability, which is then amplified when you don't have proper communication channels.\"\n\nWitnesses and protesters maintain Monday's events were not rowdy until police closed in on protesters.\n\nThe Iowa Law Enforcement Academy teaches crowd management to participating agencies, but it has not provided such training since about 2015, Director Judy Bradshaw said earlier this month, and it does not serve the Des Moines police or State Patrol.\n\nCrowds outnumber police, who seek to avoid direct confrontation, instructor Ben Thompson said. Chemical agents should only be used if the crowd becomes violent toward officers, he said, using the example of people throwing bags of urine, Molotov cocktails and rocks, and when dispersal orders are ignored.\n\n\"The next way to do this is we need some way to deploy some kind of chemical munition to get these people to disperse without getting into some actual contact or actual physical force,\" he said.\n\nBradshaw, who is also the former chief of the Des Moines Police Department, said each demonstration can take on a life of its own.\n\nShe called the scale of demonstrations witnessed at the beginning of June unprecedented in Des Moines. She said she wouldn’t second-guess how law enforcement responded and that the public isn't aware of the information police on the ground may have about potential dangers.\n\n“These are unprecedented times here,” she said. “We'll learn from what happened and how should we train differently as a result from this. … The commanders are trying to do the best they can to manage these crowds, and especially the agitators. It's really not the peaceful protesters at all. It's the agitators. How do we manage that? How do we predict them, how do we identify them, how do we respond to them?”\n\nHowever, those on the street are adamant that the violence is coming toward the people from police, not the other way around.\n\n\"There's obviously an intent to do harm. The arrests they made, the kettling, the illegal arrests ... it is obvious they were out to punish us for speaking,\" Bruce said.\n\nRegister staff Maya Miller contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the Register on Facebook and Twitter for more news.

Twitter: @DrTomFrieden.\n\nCNN —\n\nAlthough it’s possible that deadly new coronavirus variants could emerge, I’m more optimistic today than at any point since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Here’s why.\n\nDespite growing pandemic fatigue and rough weeks ahead as the Omicron tsunami recedes, we’re better defended against Covid than ever. Vaccines and prior infection have steadily strengthened our collective immune defenses. We have now built up a wall of immunity – although we have lost far, far too many people along the way to get here.\n\nIn 2020, failure to follow public health recommendations greatly increased the death toll in the United States and elsewhere. In 2021, failure to reach people with vaccination – largely due to partisan opposition and entrenched resistance in the US, and lack of access in many countries – had lethal consequences.\n\nWe’ve already lost nearly 900,000 people to Covid in the United States alone and are closing in on the grim milestone of a million American deaths. Most could have been prevented. But now, we can have the upper hand over Covid because our defenses are multilayered and strong, starting with immunity.\n\nBased on antibody seroprevalence among people who donated blood, an estimated 94% of Americans had at least some protection against Covid back in November – before the Omicron variant’s surge hit – through either vaccination or prior infection. Immunity against severe infection is holding up, especially for people who receive booster shots. In December, the rate of Covid-associated hospitalization was 16 times higher in unvaccinated adults than among adults who were up to date on vaccination.\n\nGlobally, 10 billion doses of lifesaving vaccines have been administered in just over a year. That’s a stunning achievement, although vaccine inequity continues to cost lives and create the conditions for dangerous variants such as Omicron to emerge. Africa remains particularly vulnerable, as less than 1 in 10 people continent-wide are fully vaccinated.\n\nWe have new drugs that are highly effective at preventing severe Covid. Lab studies suggest they will work just as well against the Omicron variant as Delta. Generally, medical treatments don’t have anywhere near the life-saving impact of vaccines, but they help. These pills could be a life-saver for people at high risk of severe Covid, though we must still overcome supply challenges, pair testing with early treatment and make sure there’s equitable access for everyone who needs them.\n\nMost people understand that masks work and that better masks (such as N95s) work better, and there are now more of them. Masks can stop airborne spread of whatever variant Covid throws at us. We can learn from East Asia by masking if we’re sick or vulnerable, to resist not just Covid but flu and other respiratory diseases.\n\nAlthough there have been bumps in the road, testing is more widely available, including rapid antigen tests that can be done at home. When Covid is spreading in our community, we can test before gathering indoors with vulnerable people or in large groups, or test if we feel sick; if infected, we can isolate at home until no longer contagious.\n\nGenomic surveillance is another tool that we’ve sharpened. South Africa set a great example by warning the world about Omicron. Many countries have increased their capacity to perform robust genetic sequencing. We can stay ahead of the virus by continuing to be on the lookout.\n\nGenomic surveillance alerted us to a new version of Omicron, termed BA.2, that’s becoming more common in several countries. This Omicron subvariant has generated concern, but findings from the UK suggest that BA.2 doesn’t escape immunity any more than the version we’ve been dealing with.\n\nAll of the above are reasons for cautious optimism, but there are wild cards. Protection from Omicron infection may not be strong or long-lasting; less severe infections often result in less lasting immunity. And although vaccine protection has held up well against severe disease, we may need additional doses to stay up to date.\n\nLong Covid is another ongoing challenge. We don’t know how often an Omicron infection leads to long Covid or how best to treat people who have the condition, although we’re learning more every day and eagerly await study results from the National Institutes of Health. A new study suggests that vaccinated people who get infected are much less likely to develop long Covid, another reason to keep your vaccinations up to date.\n\nThe biggest wild card: SARS-CoV-2’s ability to mutate. It’s highly unlikely that Omicron will be the last variant. What’s to say a deadly, highly transmissible, immune-escape variant won’t arise? Frankly, it could.\n\nBut even if a worse variant emerges, we’re better prepared than ever: more immunity, more vaccines, more treatments, better masks and more of them, better tests, better understanding of Covid, more sequencing. Covid doesn’t have to keep dominating our lives, and with our improved defenses, we may soon be able to safely resume many activities.\n\nAnother reason for optimism? We have a unique opportunity to put public health systems in place to find, stop and prevent health threats when and where they emerge, anywhere in the world. With our partners, Resolve to Save Lives advocates for 7-1-7 as a global goal for early disease detection and response. Every outbreak should be detected within seven days, with public health authorities notified and investigation started within one day and all essential control measures established in the next seven days.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe world has a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make the world safer from health threats. The Global Fund, which last week celebrated its 20th anniversary, has made impressive progress against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and it should play a key role in preventing the next pandemic.\n\nEvery country and every organization has made mistakes, and challenges remain, but we’ve come a long way in the past two years. The most important lesson we can learn from Covid is that we’re all in this together – that a disease outbreak anywhere is a threat everywhere.\n\nFar, far too many lives have been lost to Covid, and it’s not over yet. But we can learn the lessons from the past two years and work together to create a safer world where, instead of adding to fear of contagion, the connections among us strengthen our health, our economy and our common community.", "authors": ["Dr. Tom Frieden"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/us/sandy-hook-newtown-shooting-victims-profiles", "title": "10 years after Sandy Hook, the victims' memories still endure | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThey were pianists and painters, swimmers and dancers, budding readers, little brothers and big sisters. Then, in a flash of violence, their 20 bright smiles were snuffed out forever in a rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary that haunts the nation to this day.\n\nAlso stolen that chilly Friday – just 11 days before Christmas – were six adults felled by the same gunman as they refused to abandon their sacred trust to safeguard the smallest among them.\n\nTen years later, even those who have never set foot near Newtown, Connecticut, can conjure the scene painted by police of a first-grade classroom turned into a killing field.

In that spirit, some survivors have pressed to the highest court in the land for changes that might thwart another nightmare like theirs. Others have refused to succumb to a cruel lie that mocks their eternal sorrow.\n\nThe 12 girls, eight boys and six women whose futures were taken that day will be remembered, always. Here is a glimpse of what we learned about them in the days after they were lost:\n\nCharlotte Bacon, 6\n\nCharlotte Bacon loved school, her grandmother said. From The Guardian\n\nCharlotte was sweet, outgoing and full of energy, her grandmother told CNN affiliate WCCO in Minnesota.\n\n“This is tough. This is surreal. You can’t believe this could happen,” Irene Hagen told the station. “The whole family is just devastated, and we’re all trying to come to terms with it.”\n\nShe said her granddaughter loved school and dresses. Her hair was a mass of beautiful red curls.\n\n“It’s horrible. It’s really horrible,” Hagen told WCCO. “It’s hard to believe that someone would kill children, innocent children.”\n\nDaniel Barden, 7\n\nDaniel Barden loved riding the waves. From The Guardian\n\nDaniel earned his missing two front teeth, his family used to say. His “fearless” pursuit of happiness and life also earned him ripped jeans.\n\n“Despite that, he was, as his mother said, ‘Just So Good,’” his family wrote in a statement published in the New Haven Register.\n\nTaking after his musician dad, he and his siblings – brother James and sister Natalie – formed a band. Daniel played drums.\n\nHe loved to ride waves at the beach and make s’mores around bonfires with his cousins.\n\n“He embodied everything that is wholesome and innocent in the world,” the family said.\n\nRachel D’Avino, 29\n\nRachel D'Avino was working on her doctorate at the University of St. Joseph of Hartford. From Legacy.com\n\nShe probably didn’t know it when she died, but her best friend was about to propose.\n\nHe had recently asked D’Avino’s parents for their blessing, and he was planning to ask for her hand in marriage on Christmas Eve.\n\nThat and other details about D’Avino’s life were described in an obituary posted on the website of Munson-Lovetere Funeral Homes of Connecticut.\n\n“Her presence and tremendous smile brightened any room she entered,” it read.\n\nBorn in Waterbury, D’Avino received her undergraduate degree from the University of Hartford and her master’s from Post University. She was working toward her doctorate at the University of St. Joseph of Hartford.\n\nD’Avino loved karate, cooking, animals, photography and her two younger siblings.\n\n“Her passion, however, was her occupation as a behavioral therapist working with children within the autism spectrum,” the obituary read.\n\nOlivia Engel, 6\n\nOlivia Engel took art and dance lessons, played tennis, soccer and swam. Timothy Nosenzo/Engel Family\n\nHer favorite stuffed animal was a lamb; pink and purple were her favorite colors.\n\nOlivia’s family posted a statement on Facebook with those and other details about their beloved daughter.\n\n“She was insightful for her age and had a great sense of humor. She laughed a lot and always lit up a room including the people around her. She was very creative and was always drawing and designing things,” her family said.\n\nOlivia took art and dance lessons, played tennis, soccer and swam. She was involved in Girl Scouts and musical theater. She loved school and did well in math and reading.\n\nHer family described her as a “grateful child … never greedy.” Each night, Olivia led grace at the dinner table.\n\nJosephine Gay, 7\n\nJosephine Gay had just turned 7. CNN\n\nJosephine celebrated her seventh birthday just days before she died. In one picture, published in various news stories, she’s smiling with glasses on the tip of her nose.\n\nJosephine liked to ride her bike and sell lemonade in her neighborhood in the summer, The Wall Street Journal reported. The little girl loved the color purple.\n\nDylan Hockley, 6\n\nDylan Hockley's family said he loved to play tag with neighbors at the bus stop. Courtesy Caters News Agency\n\nDylan and his family had moved from England to Connecticut two years before he died.\n\n“We specifically chose Sandy Hook for the community and the elementary school. We do not and shall never regret this choice,” Dylan’s family said in a statement. “Our boys have flourished here, and our family’s happiness has been limitless.”\n\nDylan’s family said he loved to cuddle and play tag with neighbors at the bus stop every morning.\n\n“He was learning to read and was so proud when he read us a new book every day,” the family said. “He adored his big brother Jake, his best friend and role model.”\n\nDylan’s parents also expressed gratitude to the educators who died with their son.\n\n“We cannot speak highly enough of Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, exceptional women who knew both our children,” the family said. “Dylan’s teacher, Vicki Soto, was warm and funny and Dylan loved her dearly.

Jill Biden tweeted a photo of him blowing out a candle on top of a coconut cake, with balloons in the background.\n\nPresident Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday, blowing out the candle on his coconut birthday cake with first lady Jill Biden, Naomi Biden, her husband Peter Neal and other Biden grandchildren on Sunday, November 20, 2022. Flotus/Instagram\n\n“A perfect birthday celebration filled with so much love – and Joe’s favorite coconut cake!” she wrote.\n\nMembers of Biden’s family already in town celebrating his granddaughter’s wedding at the White House on Saturday attended the brunch.\n\nThe wedding’s timing, two people familiar with the planning had told CNN, was not a coincidence – noting the “age issue” is never something Biden wants to highlight.\n\nThe president has political momentum on his side ahead of a potential reelection bid – having been able to maintain a Democratic majority in the Senate and thwart the historical political tides of a resounding Republican wave in Congress. There was also the lukewarm political support his slightly younger predecessor, Donald Trump, received when he announced his recent decision to run for president in 2024.\n\nBut Biden has not been able to shake voters’ apprehensions about his age, with rhetorical gaffes and literal stumbles at times reinforcing concerns about his health and mental acuity.\n\nBiden would be an unprecedented 86 years old by the end of his second term if he were to run and win his reelection. By comparison, some of the oldest past living presidents still had years on Biden – Trump left office at the age of 74 and Ronald Reagan left office after his two terms at 77 years old.\n\nThe president, for his part, maintains that voters concerned about his age should see his record of accomplishments since taking office.\n\n“Well, they’re concerned about whether or not I can get anything done. Look what I’ve gotten done,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper in October. “Name me a president in recent history that’s gotten done as much as I have in their first two years.”\n\nBiden said last month that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so. But he’s long said it’s a decision both he and his family will decide on together. And Saturday’s wedding marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether their patriarch should seek a second term.\n\nAnd the president isn’t the only Washington power reckoning with pressures to bow out.

Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden signed the American Rescue Plan, a sweeping $1.9 trillion package, into law in early March. The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/29/politics/steny-hoyer-interview-help-america-vote-act-anniversary", "title": "House majority leader reflects on 20 years since first federal voting ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe first piece of modern federal legislation to address the infrastructure of voting systems across the country, known as Help America Vote Act, celebrates its 20th anniversary on Saturday.\n\nHAVA was created on a bipartisan basis after the 2000 presidential election, which was decided by the Supreme Court after razor thin margins revealed the need to address antiquated voting systems. As Congress has become more partisan, funding for HAVA has significantly decreased.\n\nLess than two weeks before the country faces its first midterm election since the 2020 presidential race, where former President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede and efforts to overturn the results culminated with his supporters attacking the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a co-author in crafting HAVA 20 years ago, reflected on the importance of this legislation in a wide-ranging conversation with CNN.\n\n“Clearly it was a partisan era, as it is today,” Hoyer told CNN in an interview, comparing the fallout from the 2000 election to the election issues now. “But there was not the dishonesty of claiming something that was not fact.”\n\nLawmakers crafted HAVA after the fate of the 2000 presidential election between then Democratic candidate Al Gore and then Republican candidate George W. Bush came down to 537 votes out of almost 6 million cast in Florida, and exposed a wide range of ballot irregularities. Phrases like “hanging chads” when a ballot is not completely punched through, “pregnant chads,” when paper ballots are dimpled but not pierced, and “butterfly ballots,” where poor ballot design confused voters on which candidate they were voting for, dominated the national conversation until the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that Bush had won.\n\nWhen it passed in 2002, HAVA made sweeping reforms to voting systems across the country to improve the administration of elections for federal office. It established a new federal agency, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which still exists today, to help advise states in their election administration, set national guidelines and create a national program for the testing, certification and decertification of voting systems. The legislation also provided grants for states, which EAC was tasked with overseeing, to address a wide range of issues including updating voting systems, creating new poll worker trainings particularly for students, and even making all polling locations accessible for individuals with disabilities.\n\n“The EAC is the only federal agency solely focused on election administration and our mission has grown in the years since HAVA’s passage to serve a critical role in supporting election officials across the country,” EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks said in a statement to CNN. “The EAC is a critical part of ensuring free, fair, secure, and accessible elections across the United States.”\n\nHAVA sought to restore confidence in the country’s voting system, Hoyer said, but the dynamics have shifted – a growing number of Americans are unwilling to accept results they don’t agree with.\n\n“It’s not so much the technology that is in question now,” Hoyer told CNN. “That was the case in 2000. Now, it’s a question of whether or not people are willing to accept results that courts over and over and over again have said were legitimate results.”\n\nAnother key difference between now and then, Hoyer said, was that both parties could find common ground in the early 2000s when it came to election related funding.\n\n“They were not hostile to that in 2002,” Hoyer said of Republicans back then, who had the majority in the House when HAVA was enacted. “We got an overwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans voting for the creation of HAVA, the funding to the states, and the provisions that we provided for advisory capacity by the Election Assistance Commission. That bipartisan commitment no longer exists sadly.”\n\nFear of establishing ‘result by violence, not by voting’\n\nIn the fallout of the 2020 presidential election, Trump and his allies repeatedly called into question the validity of voting systems, making false claims about foreign interference and voting machine irregularities. Courts across the country have invalidated Trump’s claims about voting machine issues. One company, Dominion Voting Systems, has sued Trump’s campaign and conservative media allies for defamation.\n\nA wave of election denying candidates made in Trump’s mold have emerged on the scene since Trump lost, creating a new concern that those who could potentially oversee elections might not accept future results they don’t agree with.\n\nThreats to nonpartisan poll workers and fears about safety at polling locations have also increased. Heading into the 2022 midterms, states across the country have worked to further secure their polling locations and poll workers in anticipation of disruptions.\n\n“It is a sad day in America when there are threats to election officials, threats to voters and the creation of an atmosphere around voting which is perceived to be unsafe,” Hoyer said. “Those are despotic countries that present their citizens with such an environment, and hopefully, Republicans, Democrats, independents will all reject that kind of violence. But unfortunately, we’ve seen that’s not always the case.”\n\nHoyer believes if more funding had gone to HAVA over the years, the American people would have had more confidence in the country’s voting systems and it would have been more difficult for election lies related to voting systems to catch on.\n\n“Frankly had we funded HAVA in an effective way over the years, I think we would be much more likely to have a public that would conclude, ‘Look, the machine we used was honest, it was transparent, it works well, and it does reflect our vote,’” the majority leader said.\n\nHAVA initially provided around $3.5 billion in funding, but the commitment to fully refund the programs enacted by the legislation has dwindled.\n\nIn 2011, when Republicans reclaimed the House, broad funding for HAVA languished. Over the years, Republicans have sought to abolish the EAC.\n\nMost recently, Congress appropriated a total of about $800 million in 2018 and 2020 combined. In 2018, Congress provided $380 million in election security grants due to bipartisan concern about Russian interference in elections. A second $400 million was appropriated in the CARES Act in 2020 to help states run their elections during the Covid pandemic.\n\nIn December 2021, secretaries of state and election officials across the country sent a letter to President Joe Biden seeking $5 billion in the Biden administration’s next budget, part of a larger request for Congress to allocate $20 billion in funding to local and state election administrators for secure election infrastructure over the next 10 years.\n\nNational Association of Secretaries of State Director of Communications Maria Benson said in a statement to CNN, “NASS is proud of the work accomplished by our Chief Election Official members to invest in their elections systems and processes.” Benson asked Congress to reference the organization’s resolution on stable federal funding for election security and requested lawmakers seek input directly from secretaries of state when approaching how to fund HAVA in the future.\n\nHicks told CNN, “Election officials have historically done more with less and the EAC has distributed and administered $880 million in Congressionally allocated HAVA election security grants over the last four years to support them. But the EAC has heard from election officials across the country that consistent funding is needed to support their short- and long-term planning.”\n\nCongress is currently deliberating its government funding bill ahead of a mid-December deadline, which could include more funding for HAVA. Hoyer said he hopes Republicans come to the table and the funding gets approved, but he acknowledged the roadblocks Republicans have put up when it comes to HAVA funding.\n\n“The way we resolve our disputes is through elections,” Hoyer said. “And if those elections don’t have merit, then as we saw in the insurrection, some people can be incited to try to establish a result by violence, not by voting. And that’s very dangerous for our democracy, and for the stability of our country. That’s a great fear that I have.”", "authors": ["Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/us/schools-after-mass-shootings-uvalde-texas", "title": "Here's what happened to schools after previous mass shootings | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe extraordinary trauma after a school massacre may be too overwhelming for survivors to even think about returning to class.\n\nIn Uvalde, Texas, students at Robb Elementary School are marred by the slaughter of 19 children and two teachers at their school.\n\nBut at some point, classes must resume.

Her trip comes at a low point in US-China relations and despite warnings from the Biden administration against a stop in Taiwan.\n\nThe California Democrat is leading a congressional delegation on a tour in Asia this week, which includes stops in Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, and Japan. Although not included in her official itinerary, expectations that she was planning a visit to Taiwan have fueled US-China tensions since reports of her trip emerged last month.\n\nIn a statement after landing, Pelosi and the congressional delegation that accompanied her said the visit “honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.”\n\nPelosi, a forthright critic of Beijing, has previously said it is important for the US to show support for Taiwan.\n\nChina has lashed out at the visit. In a statement following Pelosi’s arrival, China’s Foreign Ministry said the trip would have a “severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations.”\n\n“China will definitely take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity in response to the US Speaker’s visit,” the statement said.\n\nA spokesman for China’s Ministry of Defense said the People’s Liberation Army was “on high alert” and would launch “a series of targeted military operations to counteract the situation, resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely thwart the interference of external forces and ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist schemes.”\n\nPrior to the visit, US officials had been worried that China could respond militarily, potentially triggering the worst cross-strait crisis in decades. Last week, China’s Defense Ministry warned: “If the US insists on taking its own course, the Chinese military will never sit idly by.”\n\nThe tensions provided the backdrop for a lengthy phone call between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, in which Xi warned the US not to “play with fire” on the Taiwan issue. Neither side immediately confirmed if Pelosi’s reported plans were discussed, though a US official later confirmed they were. Preparation for the call predated reports of the trip.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the high-stakes visit.\n\nWhy is Beijing angry about Pelosi’s visit?\n\nChina’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-ruled democracy of Taiwan as its own territory – despite never having governed it – and has not ruled out the use of force to “reunify” the island with the Chinese mainland.\n\nFor decades, Beijing has sought to isolate Taipei on the world stage, from chipping away at its diplomatic allies to blocking it from joining international organizations.\n\nAny move that appears to lend Taiwan a sense of international legitimacy is strongly opposed by China. And in the eyes of Beijing, high-profile overseas visits by Taiwanese officials, or visits by foreign officials to Taiwan, will do just that.\n\nIn 1995, a visit by Taiwan’s then-President Lee Teng-hui to the United States triggered a major crisis in the Taiwan Strait. Enraged by the trip, China fired missiles into waters around Taiwan, and the crisis ended only after the US sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area in a forceful show of support for Taipei.\n\nIn recent years, Taiwan has received a flurry of visits by US delegations, consisting of sitting and retired officials and lawmakers. That has drawn angry responses from China, including sending warplanes into Taiwan’s self-declared air defense identification zone.\n\nBut Pelosi’s political stature makes her visit all the more provocative to Beijing.\n\n“Pelosi is the third public official in the line of succession after the President and Vice President, I think the Chinese take that very seriously,” said Susan L. Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at UC San Diego.\n\n“So she is a very important figure in American politics. It’s different from your ordinary member of Congress.”\n\nPelosi is a longstanding critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has denounced Beijing’s human rights record, and met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government.\n\nIn 1991, Pelosi unfurled a banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters. More recently, she has voiced support for the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nWhy is the trip fueling US-China tensions?\n\nBeijing sees Pelosi’s trip as a “serious violation” of historical US-China agreements governing their relations.\n\nThe US formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 – but has long trod a delicate middle path. Washington recognizes the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China, but maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan.\n\nThe US also supplies Taiwan with defensive weaponry under the terms of the decades-old Taiwan Relations Act, but it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion – a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”\n\nChina’s authoritarian turn under Xi’s leadership and plummeting relations with Washington have pulled Taiwan closer into the orbit of the US. This has infuriated Beijing, which has accused Washington of “playing the Taiwan card” to contain China’s rise.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, has stepped up its engagement with Taiwan, approving arms sales and sending delegations to the island.\n\nSince the Taiwan Travel Act was signed into law by then-US President Donald Trump in March 2018, US officials and lawmakers have embarked on more than 20 trips to the island, according to a CNN tally. The 2018 law encourages visits between officials of the US and Taiwan at all levels.\n\nTaiwan figured prominently in Xi and Biden’s two-hour-and-17-minute phone call, with the Chinese leader urging Washington to honor existing agreements with Beijing both “in word and in deed,” according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry. The statement added that China would “resolutely safeguard” its national sovereignty.\n\nFor his part, Biden reiterated that US policy “had not changed,” according to a White House readout of the call.\n\n“The United States strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” Biden said, according to the statement.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why one former diplomat is worried about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan 02:58 - Source: CNN Why one former diplomat is worried about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan 02:58\n\nHas a US House speaker ever visited Taiwan?\n\nPelosi’s trip isn’t the first time a sitting US House speaker has visited Taiwan.\n\nIn 1997, Newt Gingrich visited Taipei only days after his trip to Beijing and Shanghai. China’s Foreign Ministry criticized Gingrich after his Taiwan visit, but the response was limited to rhetoric.\n\nFormer US House Speaker Newt Gingrich meets with Taiwanese Vice President and Premier Lien Chan during a brief visit to Taiwan in April, 1997. Central News Agency/AP\n\nBut twenty-five years on, China is stronger, more powerful and confident, and its leader Xi has made it clear that Beijing will no longer tolerate any perceived slights or challenge to its interests.\n\n“China is in a position to be more assertive, to impose costs and consequences to countries that don’t take China’s interest into consideration in their policymaking or actions,” said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\n\nBut the decision not to include Taiwan on the official itinerary released by the delegation “preserves the unofficial nature of the visit,” and should be a “good outcome for Beijing and US-China relations,” Thompson added on Twitter following the release of Pelosi’s statement Sunday listing her itinerary.\n\nWhat about the timing?\n\nPelosi’s visit comes at a sensitive time for China.\n\nThe House speaker had previously planned to lead a US congressional delegation to Taiwan in April, but postponed the trip after she tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe Chinese military celebrated its founding anniversary on August 1, while Xi, the country’s most powerful leader in decades, is preparing to break conventions and seek a third term at the Communist Party’s 20th congress this fall.\n\nIn August, Chinese leaders are also expected to gather in the seaside resort of Beidaihe for their annual summer conclave, where they discuss personnel moves and policy ideas behind closed doors.\n\n“It’s a very tense time in Chinese domestic politics,” Shirk said. “(Xi) himself and many other members of the elite in China would view the Pelosi visit as a humiliation of Xi Jinping (and) his leadership. And that means that he will feel compelled to react in a way to demonstrate his strength.”\n\nWhile the politically sensitive timing could trigger a stronger response from Beijing, some experts believe it could also mean the Communist Party would want to ensure stability and prevent things from getting out of control.\n\n“Honestly, this isn’t a good time for Xi Jinping to provoke a military conflict right before the 20th party congress. It’s in Xi Jinping’s interest to manage this rationally and not instigate a crisis on top of all the other crises he has to deal with,” Thompson said, citing China’s slowing economy, deepening real estate crisis, rising unemployment, and constant struggle to curb sporadic outbreaks under its zero-Covid policy.\n\nHow has China reacted?\n\nChina’s military will start exercises around Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the self-governed island and launch a series of “targeted military operations to counteract the situation,” according to statements released by its Eastern Theater Command and Ministry of Defense Tuesday.\n\n“Starting from the evening of August 2, the Eastern Theater Command will carry out a series of joint military operations around Taiwan Island, and conduct joint air and sea exercises in the sea and air spaces of the northern, southwestern and south-eastern Taiwan Island, conduct long-range live ammunition firing in the Taiwan Strait, and organize regular-guided-fire testing in the eastern waters of Taiwan Island,” Col. Shi Yi, spokesman for the Eastern Theater Command, said.\n\n“This action is a solemn deterrent against the recent major escalation of the negative actions of the United States on the Taiwan issue, and a serious warning to ‘Taiwan independence’ forces,” the statement added.\n\nThe Eastern Theater is one of the five joint commands of the People’s Liberation Army with jurisdiction over China’s eastern coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, which sit opposite and above Taiwan.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China sends warplanes into Taiwan's air defense zone amid Pelosi's visit 02:33 - Source: CNN China sends warplanes into Taiwan's air defense zone amid Pelosi's visit 02:33\n\nPrior to her arrival, national security officials quietly worked to convince Pelosi of the risks her trip to Taiwan could pose, while the Pentagon developed a security plan to use ships and aircraft to keep her safe.\n\nThe constant worry among US officials is that miscalculations or inadvertent incidents or accidents could occur if China and the US significantly increase their air and maritime operations in the region.\n\nBut US does not expect direct hostile action from Beijing during a visit by Pelosi. At least five defense officials, speaking prior to her arrival, described this as a very remote possibility and said the Pentagon wants to see the public rhetoric lowered.\n\nWhat has Taiwan said about Pelosi’s trip?\n\nPelosi was welcomed at the airport by Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, and the iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper was lit up with a welcome message for the speaker praising “US-Taiwan friendship forever.”\n\nTaiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen will receive Pelosi and her delegation at the Presidential Palace on the morning of August 3, according to a statement from the president’s office.\n\nPresidential Spokesperson Xavier Chang said that Speaker Pelosi had not only supported Taiwan for a long time, but also paid attention to Taiwan’s democratic development and regional peace and security.\n\nBut prior to her arrival, Taiwan had been tight-lipped about the situation. When Pelosi’s visit was first reported by the Financial Times last week, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had “received no information” about the visit.\n\nDuring a regular news briefing on Thursday, a ministry spokeswoman reiterated it had not received any definite information on whether Pelosi would be visiting the island and had “no further comment” on the matter.\n\n“Inviting members of the US Congress to visit Taiwan has long been a focus of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan and our Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States,” spokeswoman Joanne Ou said.\n\nThough international media is closely watching events, the escalating tension barely made headline news in Taiwan this week. Taiwan’s media has mostly focused on upcoming local elections and Taiwanese military drills.\n\nPreviously, Taiwanese officials have publicly welcomed visits by US delegations, seeing them as a sign of support from Washington.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan Selina Wang Eric Cheung Simone Mccarthy", "Nectar Gan", "Selina Wang", "Eric Cheung", "Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/12/us/immigration-records-lawsuit-limestone-caves-cec", "title": "Their records were locked in limestone caves during the pandemic ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt sounds like a scenario from another era.\n\nMillions of paper immigration files are stored in a sprawling network of limestone caves around Kansas City. Some of those underground storage facilities operated with reduced staffing during much of the pandemic.\n\nAnd now, a group of people are suing the government, arguing their citizenship applications are still stuck in limbo due to an “unreasonable delay” in getting their records out of the caves and into the hands of immigration officials.\n\n“It does seem somewhat mind-boggling and shocking that we’re still dealing with paper, but we are,” says Leslie Dellon, a senior attorney at the American Immigration Council who’s representing the 13 people who recently filed a lawsuit over their naturalization applications. “It’s just very frustrating for these people, whose lives are on hold, and it’s just dragging on and on.”\n\nThe case highlights how difficult the US immigration system can be to navigate, with layers of bureaucracy and a reliance on paper files that officials have acknowledged slows processing and deepened backlogs during the pandemic.\n\nA complaint filed in federal court says all 13 plaintiffs are stuck “in a stress-filled limbo” and still waiting for US Citizenship and Immigration Services to schedule them for citizenship interviews more than two years after they applied. If their immigration history records, known as A-files, aren’t retrieved and their interviews aren’t scheduled soon, Dellon says, they could lose the chance to take their citizenship oaths and register to vote in time to participate in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\n“They want to be able to vote in November, and the window’s closing,” Dellon says. “We felt this is the time to take action and to file suit and to get the government to prioritize these applications and get these people scheduled for interviews.”\n\nDellon says it’s likely the continued delays are affecting additional people as well. Her organization has heard from many others since announcing the lawsuit late last month, she says, and is considering whether to add them to the case.\n\nAgencies say the backlog is shrinking and they’ve made major progress\n\nThe lawsuit comes months after a Wall Street Journal report detailed a backlog in citizenship application processing due to pandemic operating restrictions that reduced staffing at Federal Records Centers (FRC) run by the National Archives and Records Administration. At that time, the Journal reported there were 350,000 requests pending for immigration files held at the centers, located in underground caves around Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nNow, officials say that backlog is down to about 40,000 pending requests concentrated at centers in Kansas City and Lee’s Summit. Both locations are on track to eliminate the backlog by the end of July, the National Archives said.\n\nThe National Archives and USCIS declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing their policies of not commenting on ongoing litigation. But both agencies said in statements to CNN that they’d made significant progress in addressing the delays.\n\n“Now that we have returned to full staffing, we have effectively made all remaining requests a priority and are on the verge of eliminating the backlog,” the National Archives said.\n\nThe Lee's Summit Federal Records Center houses millions of immigration files. National Archives\n\nUSCIS has conducted initial processing on naturalization applications while it waits to receive the A-files, the agency said, to allow for quick completion once it gets the documents. And most of the applications would be near the front of the line for interviews and adjudication because they’ve been pending beyond normal processing times, USCIS said.\n\nEarlier this year, the situation drew concern from Massachusetts’ congressional delegation, which sent a letter to the National Archives in February.\n\n“Our constituents have already been waiting many years for the opportunity to be eligible to naturalize,” the lawmakers wrote. “It is truly unfortunate — and unacceptable — that many are now forced to wait significantly longer simply based on where their A-file is located.”\n\nUsing the records centers for storage allows government agencies to meet requirements in a cost-effective manner, the Archives’ statement said, noting that USCIS stores more than 2 million cubic feet of A-files there.\n\n“Digitizing these records is currently cost prohibitive,” the statement said.\n\nWhy these caves are used for storage\n\nLimestone caves in the Kansas City area have been used to store immigration records for years.\n\nUSCIS opened its National Records Center in a cave in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, in 1999. As the facility celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2014, officials said they had more than 20 million files in storage there and add 1.5 million new files every year.\n\nThe Archives’ records centers located in limestone caves nearby house more than 50 million A-files transferred there by USCIS, including more than 1 million A-files of immigrants who were born more than 100 years ago and more recent records.\n\nThe caves are the result of extensive mining of limestone that was used for paving and building materials in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nA stack in the Federal Records Center in Lenexa, Kansas, one of three National Archives facilities in caves in the Kansas City area that store immigration records. National Archives\n\nAccording to the Archives’ historian, the caves were largely abandoned after a building boom in the area ended, and businesses started using the caves for storage in the 1950s. The Archives opened their first FRC in a mine in 1997, historian Jessie Kratz wrote in a 2016 article.\n\n“Because the temperature is naturally around 60 to 70 degrees, there is significant savings in temperature and humidity control,” Kratz wrote. “And underground storage is also less expensive than above-ground storage, with plenty of room for expansion and enhanced security.”\n\nThe Kansas City FRC, one of the facilities that stores immigration records, is located in a vast underground business complex known as SubTropolis. The complex boasts more than 7.3 million square feet of industrial space for lease, and more than 6.7 million square feet available to grow into – far larger than the country’s biggest malls and stadiums, and on par with some of the world’s largest buildings.\n\nIts caves also house auto suppliers, data servers, food distributors, a pharmaceutical company and even a paintball and laser tag course.\n\nHe’s afraid to leave the country while his case is pending\n\nThe Biden administration has said it’s committed to making the naturalization process “welcoming and accessible to all who are eligible.”\n\nBut the lawsuit argues delays have left applicants feeling frustrated and uncertain.\n\nSome plaintiffs say they’re scared their families could end up getting separated and afraid to travel out of the country while their cases are pending.\n\nAli Mohammed, 28, told CNN he hasn’t returned to Iraq, even though his parents still live there and have had health problems. Without the guarantee of citizenship, he says, he’s worried he could be blocked from returning to the United States by a sudden policy change, like travel restrictions that were put into place during the Trump administration.\n\n“It’s very concerning to me … I don’t want to risk it,” he says.\n\nAli Mohammed, 28, says he applied to be come a US citizen more than two years ago and is still waiting for an interview. Courtesy Ali Mohammed\n\nMohammed, a Kurdish refugee, came to the United States in 2015. He applied to become a citizen in April 2020, as soon as he was eligible, eager to vote in elections and improve his professional prospects.\n\nSince then, other people he knows have applied and already become citizens, he says. The lawsuit notes that when a congressman asked about Mohammed’s case last year, USCIS responded that the case was undergoing “extended review” and the agency could not decide “until certain issues are resolved.”\n\nWhen Mohammed asked USCIS again about delays in his case several months ago, authorities told him they were still waiting to get his A-file from storage and noted they were working closely with the National Archives to reduce backlogs at the Federal Records Centers.\n\nMohammed, who lives in Miami Beach, Florida, says he has a clean record and can’t think of any reason in his background that would hold up his case. He works in cybersecurity, and says it’s been surprising to see a system so dependent on pen and paper.\n\n“I know things can be very efficient with technology,” he says. “It’s not supposed to be this way.”", "authors": ["Catherine E.

Days morphed into long, painful weeks. Then agonizing months.\n\nStill, Lysa Gindinova clung to hope. A hope that somehow, somewhere amid the tangled mountains of mud-caked debris along the South Toe River in Western North Carolina the bodies of her 13-year-old cousin, Yevhenii Segen, and their grandmother, Tatiana Novitnia, would be found.\n\nThe two were swept away by floods spawned by Hurricane Helene last year. Rescue crews found the bodies of an aunt and uncle who were missing. But not Yevhenii and Novitnia.\n\nNearly 10 months later, there’s still no sign of them – and the family, who fled the fighting in Ukraine for the serene mountains of North Carolina, still wrestles with the fact that they may never see them again.\n\n“It doesn’t feel real,” Gindinova told USA TODAY.\n\nGindinova and her family are among countless residents across the United States whose loved ones are presumed dead but never found months or years after natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, mudslides and earthquakes.\n\nFamilies in Texas are starting to face that same haunting realization after the deadly Hill Country flash floods as volunteers continue to scour the region for the missing.\n\nAt least 120 bodies have been recovered since heavy rainfall turned the Guadalupe River into a torrent of destruction in the early hours of July 4. Ninety-six of those killed were in Kerr County, the hardest-hit in Central Texas where the toll includes at least 36 children.\n\nThe catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe, which rose to more than 35 feet in some places, pushed homes off their foundations and obliterated campsites and RV parks as if by dynamite.\n\nMore than 160 people were still missing in the county, authorities said July 10, and hopes of finding survivors dwindle with each passing day. County authorities say they haven't made a \"live rescue\" since the day of the flood.\n\nMuch like last year’s North Carolina floods, the Texas floods left behind mountains of debris: piles of crushed trailers and cars, stacks of downed cypress trees and walls of hardened mud that make recovery challenging.\n\nEach day, hundreds of rescuers – many of them volunteers from across the state and country – traverse flood-mauled riverbanks searching for victims. But the amount of debris and destruction have made the grim task slow and taxing.\n\n“It’s possible there are victims in that debris pile,” Kerrville Police Department Sgt. Jonathan Lamb told reporters earlier in the week, urging residents not to touch mounds of wreckage before it’s properly searched. He said it was getting “harder and harder to become optimistic.”\n\n'We are heartbroken': Texas flood victims remembered by families and communities\n\n‘One of the most horrific experiences’\n\nPast disasters of similar scope have left families waiting for months, years and even decades to recover loved ones, said Chris Boyer, executive director of the National Association for Search and Rescue.\n\nHe pointed to Hurricane Helene, where at least five people, including Yevhenni and Novitnia, were never found. And two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, killing more than 1,800 people, about 30 have yet to be identified, said Jason Melancon of the Orleans Parish Coroner’s Office.\n\nFor authorities on the ground, deciding when to call off search parties or shift them into full recovery mode is “a highly emotional decision,” especially in more rural areas, Boyer said.\n\n“There’s no describing how to tell a family that you’re done searching for their loved one and that they may never get the remains back,” said Boyer, who has led recovery crews in aviation disasters.\n\nFor a search and rescue organizer, he said, “it’s one of the most horrific experiences you’re going to have.”\n\n‘A lot more violent’\n\nTroy Tillman, 34, is a burly sheriff’s detective from just outside Lubbock, Texas.\n\nHe arrived in Kerr County on July 6 to help search for missing people. He has done this before. Tillman helped rescue more than 100 people stranded in homes after floods in Vidor, Texas, in 2017 in the wake of Hurricane Harvey and took part in missions during last year’s wildfires in the Texas panhandle.\n\nOne of his first searches in the Texas Hill Country revealed just how different this disaster would be: He and his crew noticed a glimmer in a rocky bank along the Guadalupe in Center Point, about 10 miles downriver from Kerrville.\n\nAs they dug around the object, they realized it was a Ford F-250 pickup – completely submerged in mud and rock.\n\nIf a 3-ton truck like that is buried, Tillman thought, what else could be entombed at their feet?\n\n“(Hurricane) Harvey didn’t move people 10 miles from where they were,” he said. “This was a lot more violent.”\n\nOn July 10, Tillman and others were scouring a stretch of riverbank in Center Point when they came upon a field of crumpled RVs, cars and camper trailers stretching about 200 yards. They radioed in for heavy equipment, including an excavator and skid-steer loaders.\n\nHe planned to keep at it until told to go home.\n\n“If we do find a kid or someone’s mother or sister, it’s closure for that family,” Tillman said.\n\nAnother volunteer searching through the debris was Jonathan McComb, who knows firsthand the pain disasters can deliver.\n\nMcComb was vacationing with his family and friends in a riverside home in Wimberley, Texas, about 80 miles east of Kerr County, during Memorial Day weekend 2015, when violent floods ripped the home off its pilings and sent it roaring down the Blanco River.\n\nMcComb was the only one of the nine people at the home to survive.\n\nThe bodies of his wife, Laura, and son, Andrew, 6, were recovered. But his 4-year-old daughter, Leighton, was never seen again. Later that year, McComb joined TEXSAR, a search and rescue volunteer group that deploys to disasters around Texas.\n\nHe arrived in Kerr County on July 4 to help search for the missing and has been doing so every day since.\n\n“We weren't able to recover my daughter from 10 years ago, and I know what that feels like,” McComb told USA TODAY. “I want to do what I can to help.”\n\nIn disaster this big, not all are found\n\nDuring his decades of experience, Boyer said, flood survivors are almost always found within hours of the disaster, even if they’re swept miles from where they entered the water.\n\nHe said he didn’t know of any major floods of similar scale in which survivors were found past the first 24 hours. He noted the power of the rushing water and the large debris – cars, trees, mobile homes – carried in the raging torrent.\n\n“If you’re caught in that, your odds of survival are very minimal,” Boyler said.\n\nWith so many people missing, it’s likely not everyone will be found – at least not immediately, Boyer said.\n\n“In disasters like this, there's a high probability you won’t find everyone,” he said. “There are 50-foot walls of dead trees, boulders and silt that people could be under. Those areas may not be exposed again until the next big flood 50 years from now.”\n\nIn Texas, state authorities and scientists are trying to identify the bodies they’ve recovered using rapid DNA tests – a tool commonly employed in the wake of natural disasters.\n\nAs of July 9, at least 15 adults and 13 children remained unidentified in Kerr County alone, Sheriff Larry Leitha said.\n\nTexas Rangers are in charge of collecting DNA from family members and the dead and flying them to the University of North Texas near Dallas for analysis, Col. Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety said this week.\n\nAs drones have made it easier to peer into hard-to-reach areas, advancements in DNA technology have greatly improved the ability of authorities to identify disaster victims, Boyer said.\n\nFar less material is needed to find a DNA match, he said, and rapid tests allow labs to return results in a matter of days – not weeks.\n\n“Since Katrina, that technology has exploded and moved light-years ahead,” he said.\n\nA new flood resurrects old memories\n\nBut to identify anyone, first you need the body.\n\nMitch Hampton, a longtime river guide and volunteer in Western North Carolina, spent weeks last year leading search teams on his inflatable rafts down the French Broad River, first leading the rescue of 11 people at the height of the floods then helping recover three of the five bodies found in his county.\n\nAfter four weeks, he and his raft-rescue team shifted their focus to the South Toe River and its tributaries in neighboring Yancey County, where he spent another two weeks scouring riverbanks and poking through debris piles, looking for the missing Ukrainian family members.\n\nThey were never found.\n\nHampton said images of the disaster unfurling in Texas resurrected painful memories. One photo in particular – of a first responder next to a towering debris pile, his face buried in his hand – recalled the frustration of working 12-hour days along the French Broad and South Toe rivers and often coming up with nothing, how the flood debris seemed to just swallow people whole, and how rescue crews he ferried on his raft would at times bow their head and cry.\n\n“It reminded me of the feeling of wanting to do something and feeling helpless at the same time,” Hampton said. “My heart’s torn looking at what’s happening out there. It’s a tough thing to deal with.”\n\n‘Don’t think there will ever be closure’\n\nIt took 10 days for Gindinova to learn that her aunt and uncle, Anastasiia and Dmytryo Segen, had been found dead miles down the South Toe River. She traveled from New York to Micaville, North Carolina, to identify the bodies.\n\nWith no word about the Segens’ son Yevhenii, Gindinova still hoped her young cousin would be rescued. For days, she continued to search the riverbanks herself and stayed in close contact with volunteer groups scouring the mountains.\n\nBut after a while, the search parties disbanded. The calls stopped coming. Authorities told her Yevhenii and her grandmother probably were gone forever.\n\nIn the months after the storm, Gindinova said, she leaned on her faith and reread the Book of Job for guidance. She found some comfort in vivid memories of her loved ones, like how Yevhenii made small animals with his 3-D printer or her grandmother’s colorful cross stitches that she gifted to friends and loved ones.\n\nBut the pain of their absence lingers.\n\n“I don’t think there will ever be closure,” Gindinova said.\n\nOnce the bodies were recovered, the family cremated the Segens and spread their ashes across a high point of the Blue Ridge Mountains near their home.\n\nIf Yevhenii and Novitnia are ever found, they’ll receive the same ritual.\n\nFollow Jervis and Cann on X: @MrRJervis, @Chris__Cann.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/09/texas-flooding-death-toll-missing-live-updates/84515867007/", "title": "Texas scours for more than 170 missing after flooding: Updates", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Texas floods for Wednesday, July 9. For the latest news on the Texas flooding, read USA TODAY's coverage for Thursday, July 10.\n\nHopes for finding some of the 170-plus missing people in the wake of devastating flooding along Texas' Guadalupe River were dwindling Wednesday as officials in the hardest-hit county say they haven't rescued anyone alive since the day of the flood.\n\nThe July 4 flash flooding has claimed the lives of at least 119 people, a toll that has steadily risen as search and rescue teams and volunteers comb through debris. At least 27 of those deaths were children and counselors at Camp Mystic, a beloved girls' Christian camp that sits along the river. Along with homes and campgrounds in the area, the camp was inundated early Friday morning with little time to act.\n\nOn Wednesday, the death toll in hard-hit Kerr County increased to 95, including 36 children. At least 161 people are missing in Kerr County alone, Gov. Greg Abbott told reporters Tuesday. Among them are five campers and one counselor from Camp Mystic, officials said.\n\nThe last \"live rescue\" was made Friday, said Jonathan Lamb with the Kerrville Police Department, and the chances of finding survivors dwindle as time passes.\n\n\"The hearts of our fellow Texans are breaking every single day because of what people in this community and the surrounding area are going through,'' Abbott said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the impacts of catastrophic flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico, were becoming clear as authorities said at least three people were killed, including two young children, after torrential rains overwhelmed the Ruidoso River on Tuesday.\n\nHow to help tragedy victims without getting scammed\n\nHigh-profile tragedies like the one now afflicting parts of central Texas often pull at the hearts of Americans, who may respond by donating to relief and recovery efforts.\n\nBut those calamities also present an opportunity for scammers to try to take advantage of the public's good intentions for their own benefit.\n\nWhat are the best ways to help fellow Americans at times of trouble, and how to separate the legitimate relief organizations from the fraudsters? Read here to find out.\n\nThe current FEMA 'needs to be eliminated,' Noem says\n\nEven as FEMA rushes to support the response to the flooding catastrophe in central Texas, the head of the federal department in charge of the disaster-relief agency says it should be eliminated in its current form.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem reiterated Wednesday the Trump administration's position that FEMA should be phased out and the tasks it performs be left up to the states.\n\n\"Federal emergency management should be state and locally led, rather than how it has operated for decades,\" Noem said at a meeting of a government-review council. \"It has been slow to respond at the federal level. It's even been slower to get the resources to Americans in crisis, and that is why this entire agency needs to be eliminated as it exists today, and remade into a responsive agency.\"\n\nFEMA has sent search and rescue teams to hard-hit Kerr County, along with numerous experts and supplies to bolster the state's emergency headquarters in Austin. The agency also authorized activation of the Army Corps of Engineers, according to the FEMA daily operations briefing.\n\nVigil service held at Kerrville high school football stadium\n\nCrowds gathered Wednesday evening at the high school football stadium in downtown Kerrville, among the areas hardest hit by the floods, to sing worship songs and pray for the people who died and remain missing.\n\n“Our communities were struck with tragedy literally in the darkness in the middle of the night,” said an early speaker at the service. “So many of us have been called into action to serve in our communities, in our churches, and in our own homes.”\n\nAntler Stadium is located about a mile away from the Guadalupe River as it runs through Kerrville. The city of about 25,000 is located about 60 miles outside San Antonio and is the seat of Kerr County, where at least 95 people died.\n\nJosh Smithson, a director at Young Life, a Christian youth outreach organization, led the service. Smithson gave a sermon where he praised the response of local residents to the flood.\n\n“The kingdom of God looks like thousands of volunteers walking along the riverbanks clearing a path,” said the 20-year Kerrville resident. “The kingdom of God looks like Kerr County rising together in a time of need.”\n\nSmithson closed the service by directing attendees to different counselor groups at the stadium that people could go to for help dealing with the emotional impact of the floods.\n\nIntensive effort to find Burnet County fire chief\n\nOfficials in Burnet County, where five people died in the flooding, are focusing their resources on locating the only resident still unaccounted for, longtime Volunteer Fire Chief Michael Phillips.\n\nPrivate helicopters, the Texas National Guard and Coast Guard, drones, boats, cadaver-detecting dogs and personnel on the ground are involved in the search, the sheriff's office told USA TODAY in an email Wednesday.\n\nThe effort is being conducted around Cow Creek, where Phillips was last seen Saturday as he was responding to a rescue call before he and his vehicle were swept into the raging waters. The vehicle has been located but Phillips was not inside.\n\nPhillips served the Marble Falls area in the fire department for more than 30 years, holding several positions before becoming chief, the sheriff's office said, adding that he instructed and mentored numerous young firefighters during his tenure.\n\nTale of tragedy, but also heroism, mayor says\n\nIn the early morning hours of July 4, a Kerrville patrol sergeant who lives in nearby Hunt along the Guadalupe River found himself stranded in an \"island\" when the river flooded out low-water crossings. He discovered dozens of other people trapped in vehicles or on rooftops as the catastrophic flooding unfolded, according to Lamb of the Kerrville Police Department.\n\nThe unidentified sergeant woke up a Kerrville detective who lived nearby and the two spent the next 13 hours conducting rescues and communicating with first responders to evacuate people, Lamb said. They waded into water to rescue people, cleared debris for evacuations and rendered first aid along with some Hunt volunteer firefighters and an emergency room doctor they found along the way.\n\n\"They were by themselves on that island that was Hunt, Texas, doing what they do, serving, protecting and helping,\" Lamb said.\n\nIn Kerrville, as flooding quickly became catastrophic, officers went door-to-door waking people up and convincing them to evacuate within the first hour, he said.\n\n\"Folks, I don't know how many lives our KPD team saved in an hour in Kerrville, but I know that this tragedy, as horrific as it is, could've been so much worse,\" Lamb said.\n\nVictims' bodies may be in debris piles, Kerrville warns\n\nThe Kerrville Police Department asked people on Wednesday not to disturb debris piles before first calling for a search team to look through it, in case there's a victim in there.\n\n\"Do not use heavy equipment to tear down debris piles,\" said the police department, which provided a phone number for residents to call and ask a search team to check a pile before doing their own cleanup.\n\nHow staff at all-boys camp rescued campers\n\nAfter a sun-filled day at Camp La Junta, 11-year-old Beau Brown was roused awake by a counselor on July 4 and led outside into the early-morning darkness. From the doorway, Beau could see floodwaters beginning to engulf cabins closer to the Guadalupe River, where the younger boys slept. With a group of other campers, he reached a high point on a nearby hillside and watched as counselors rushed into the raging floodwaters.\n\nThe torrent of water blew out the walls of at least one cabin and forced counselors to move children into the rafters above their bunk beds. When the water slowed, counselors formed a line and pulled some of the boys to safety. Several counselors slung children over their shoulders and swam them to higher ground.\n\nWithin a few hours, each of the nearly 400 children and counselors at the all-boys camp was safe and accounted for. Acting on their own, staff had taken decisive action, rushing the children into cabins up the hill from the racing river. Parents who spoke with USA TODAY credit them for saving their children's lives.\n\n\"If it hadn't of been for them, it would have been a very different scenario with our boys,\" said Beau's mother, Georgie Brown. \"They didn't have anyone telling them what to do, they just did it and saved a lot of our boys.\" Read more here.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nOfficials deflect swirling questions of blame in Texas flooding\n\nTexas officials have been dodging questions about whether more should have been done to warn residents of the affected areas about the catastrophic flooding about to surround them.\n\nAt a morning news briefing Wednesday, Sheriff Larry Leitha was pressed about how long it took for officials to respond to \"Code Red\" alerts about the flash flooding, and he again said his focus was on locating those who are missing.\n\n\"We will answer those questions,\" he said. \"We're not running, we're not going to hide from everything. That's going to be checked into at a later time. I wish I could tell you that time.\"\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference, Abbott said an investigation into the events surrounding the tragedy may begin in an upcoming special session of the legislature, and he took umbrage at a question about who's to blame for the heavy toll of the calamity in an area known for flash floods.\n\n\"That’s the word choice of losers,\" Abbott said before launching into an analogy about the state’s most beloved sport, football, and how different teams respond to hardships. \"The losing teams are the ones that try to point out who’s to blame,'' he said. \"The championship teams are the ones that say, 'Don’t worry about it, man, we’ve got this. We’re going to make sure that we go score again and we’re going to win this game.'\"\n\nStormy weather, heat could impact search. Drier days ahead\n\nDrier weather is on the horizon for parts of central Texas, but scattered storms and showers along with hot weather could impact search efforts on Wednesday, forecasters said.\n\nHigh temperatures in the upper 80s to 90s are anticipated across the region, the National Weather Service office covering Austin and San Antonio said. Temperatures will feel even hotter in the coming days, more like they're in the low 100s, AccuWeather said. Near Kerrville, scattered thunderstorms could make an appearance Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThough these storms will carry less moisture than those on July 4, already saturated ground is prone to flash flooding, AccuWeather warned. Storm and shower activity should recede after Wednesday night and through the end of the week, though isolated activity could still spell danger, forecasters said.\n\nOdessa police officer killed in flood\n\nA police officer from Odessa, Texas, died in the July 4 flooding near Kerrville, officials said.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened to share with our community that Odessa Police Officer Bailey Martin has been found and, tragically, is deceased,\" the police department said, adding that his body was identified on July 7.\n\nMartin was reported missing over the weekend after he took a trip with family members to the Guadalupe River near Kerrville, over 275 miles away from Odessa, for the Fourth of July holiday weekend, the police department said. \"Several\" of Martin's family members were also lost in the flooding, police said.\n\nOdessa police officers are wearing mourning bands over their badges and asked residents to light up their porches with blue lights for the rest of the week in remembrance of Martin.\n\nWhere did the Texas flooding deaths happen?\n\nThe hardest-hit area from flooding was Kerr County, particularly Kerrville, a city about 60 miles outside San Antonio with just over 25,000 residents. Here's the breakdown of where the deaths occurred by county:\n\nKerr County: 95\n\nTravis County: 7\n\nKendall County: 8\n\nBurnet County: 5\n\nWilliamson County: 3\n\nTom Green County: 1\n\n3 dead in New Mexico flooding\n\nThe south-central New Mexico resort town of Ruidoso was hit by devastating flash flooding Tuesday as slow-moving storms pounded areas still reeling from burn scars left by wildfires last year. The flooding came just four days after Texas' tragedy unfolded.\n\nThree people have been confirmed dead, according to the village of Ruidoso. Two children, 4 and 7 years old, and a man between the ages of 40 and 50 were swept downstream and later found dead, the village said.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken for the families who have lost their loved ones in this terrible tragedy,\" Mayor Lynn Crawford said in a statement.\n\nThe flooding left people trapped in homes and prompted multiple water rescues after the Ruidoso River rose a record-breaking 20 feet in Ruidoso, a mountain town about 180 miles southeast of Albuquerque, in the Sierra Blanca mountain range, officials said. Emergency crews conducted dozens of swift-water rescues and searches were underway, Crawford said Tuesday.\n\nVideo of a house being swept away in floodwaters spread widely on social media and was acknowledged by Danielle Silva, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, who said the department didn't know if anyone was inside it.\n\n− Natassia Paloma and Anthony Robledo\n\nHow to stay safe in a flood\n\nIt only takes 6 inches of rapidly moving water to knock you off your feet. And according to Weather.com, water flowing at just 6 mph exerts the same force per unit area as air blowing at EF5 tornado wind speeds. Water moving at 25 mph has the pressure equivalent of wind blowing at 790 mph, faster than the speed of sound.\n\nIn Texas on July 4, relentless rain overwhelmed the Guadalupe River, causing it to surge over 26 feet in less than an hour, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said.\n\nHere are some ways to stay safe in a flood:\n\nBe careful in your car: \"Turn around, don't drown.\" Most U.S. flash flood deaths occur in vehicles, when people try to drive through flooded water and eventually drown.\n\nStay informed about the weather. Use cell phones or radios to monitor weather conditions, and be sure to pay attention to wireless emergency alerts (WEA) on the phone, which are messages sent by authorized government alerting authorities through mobile carriers.\n\nIf you're caught in a flood, immediately head to higher ground.\n\nAvoid walking or driving through floodwaters.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/12/texas-flooding-deaths-search-rescue-missing/84769402007/", "title": "Texas flooding deaths rise; Saturday flood watch", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the devastating Texas floods for Saturday, July 12. For the latest news, view our story for Sunday, July 13.\n\nOver a week since an inundated Guadalupe River sent floodwaters tearing through homes and youth camps in Texas, optimism for rescuing any of the dozens of people still missing from Hill Country on July 12 has steadily faded as the death toll continued to rise.\n\nHundreds of rescuers, many of them volunteers, have scoured miles of destruction for any sign of the missing. But they haven't rescued anyone alive since July 4, the day of the flood, officials in the hardest-hit Kerr County said. Some 160 people are missing from the county alone.\n\nAs of the morning of July 12, the death toll had risen to at least 129, with authorities in Kerr and Travis counties reporting more bodies recovered. The toll in Kerr County rose to at least 103, including 67 adults and 36 children, according to the county's Joint Information Center. In Travis County, the toll rose to nine from eight, spokesperson Hector Nieto confirmed to USA TODAY. Officials previously said at least 27 campers and counselors from Camp Mystic, the beloved all-girls Christian camp, were among the dead.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this, and I've seen a lot of bad ones,\" President Donald Trump said as he and first lady Melania Trump surveyed the damage on Friday. \"It’s hard to believe the devastation.\"\n\nHow many people are still missing in Texas?\n\nAuthorities in Texas, including the governor, have pledged that crews will not stop their search until every missing person is accounted for. Dozens remain missing in Hill Country, with the majority lost from Kerr County. Experts say that the number of people reported missing in the wake of disasters is often inflated, however.\n\nAbout 170 people are believed to be missing, including 161 missing in Kerr County. Other counties have reported on a few missing, including one in Burnet County: Volunteer Fire Chief Michael Phillips.\n\nPhillips was last seen one week ago as he was responding to a rescue call before he and his vehicle were swept into the raging waters. The vehicle has been located but Phillips was not inside.\n\n\"Specialist teams and equipment continue to deploy into the search area and work themselves to exhaustion or until nightfall in the effort to find him,\" the Burnet County Sheriff's Office said Saturday.\n\nFlood watch in effect for Texas Hill Country, National Weather Service office says\n\nThe hard-hit Texas Hill Country has a flood watch in effect through the evening of July 13, according to the National Weather Service office serving Austin and San Antonio.\n\nBetween 1 and 3 inches of rain could fall, with isolated amounts of nearly 6 inches possible in areas, the weather service said in an X post the morning of July 12. Runoff may result in dangerous flash floods of low-lying areas, which can include rivers, creeks and other low-water crossings.\n\nOfficials said the watch includes the southern Edwards Plateau, which includes Kerr County, and along the Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and San Antonio. The watch is in effect until 7 p.m. July 13.\n\n19 million under some form of flood watch in central U.S., including Texas\n\nMore than 19 million people are under flood watches in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico on July 12, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe weather service office serving Austin and San Antonio warned of the potential for locally heavy rainfall and flash flooding in hard-hit areas of Texas Hill Country through July 13.\n\n\"Locally heavy rain on already saturated ground is capable of causing flash flooding this weekend,\" the Kerr County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.\n\n- Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nGov. Abbott thanks states for support in Texas search and rescue\n\nFrom Arkansan Black Hawk helicopters to Wisconsin K-9 teams, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott gave thanks to states aiding in response to the Hill Country floods.\n\nThe efforts following the deadly floods have required scores of resources to assist in searching for missing people.\n\n“Our ongoing recovery operations are boosted by the support of other states,” Abbott posted to X on July 12.\n\nAbbott also thanked California, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Virginia for providing their resources. The support also included swift water boats and drones to aid Texas officials.\n\nMissing Camp Mystic counselor found among the dead, family says\n\nThe family of Katherine Ferruzzo, a counselor at Camp Mystic who remained among the missing for the last week, said her remains were found Friday.\n\nFerruzzo was a recent graduate of Memorial High School in Houston and was headed to the University of Texas at Austin in the fall. She planned to become a special education teacher, the family said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"We are incredibly grateful to all the search and rescue professionals and volunteers who have remained steadfast in their efforts to locate the victims of this tragedy. We would especially like to thank the Texas Rangers,\" the family said in the statement provided by a spokesperson, Paige Donnell.\n\nDozens of children and staff members from Camp Mystic were among the dead, authorities have said. The nearly century-old camp in Hunt, Texas, is one of several along the Guadalupe River and saw some of the worst flooding on July 4. Also among those reported dead were the camp's owner, Dick Eastland, campers Sarah Marsh, 8; Hanna and Rebecca Lawrence, 14; and counselor Chloe Childress, 19.\n\n\"Katherine has a fierce and loving spirit, and we have no doubt she did all she could to save the lives of the girls in her cabin,\" her family said in a previous statement.\n\nIn Kerrville, community's generosity has surpassed some needs\n\nThe overwhelming response from community members near and far has become perhaps too generous, officials in Kerrville said on Saturday. The Kerrville Police Department said so many people have brought food for its staff, some has gone to waste. All its needs, including meals, are taken care of, the police department said.\n\nThe police department also asked law enforcement officers in the region to stop showing up unannounced to help, as it is coordinating with agencies to assign officers to certain tasks.\n\nOn Friday, the city of Kerrville asked volunteers to stop coming to help, as the most urgent needs are being handled by first responders and families within the community who were affected by the flooding.\n\n\"Your generosity and support mean more than words can express,\" the city said. \"Please don’t lose heart – your help WILL be needed. As the days and weeks unfold, there will be many opportunities to step in and support our neighbors. We promise to share updates as specific volunteer needs arise.\"\n\nWhat happens if they aren't found? Grim reality sets in\n\nMore than 10 months after Hurricane Helene spawned floods that ripped through western North Carolina last year, the bodies of Lysa Gindinova's 3-year-old cousin, Yevhenii Segen, and their grandmother, Tatiana Novitnia, have still not been found. The two were swept away by floodwaters, and the family wrestles with the fact they may never see them again.\n\n“It doesn’t feel real,” Gindinova told USA TODAY.\n\nFamilies in Texas are starting to face that same haunting realization after the deadly Hill Country flash floods as volunteers continue to scour the region for the missing.\n\nMuch like last year’s North Carolina floods, the Texas floods left behind mountains of debris: piles of crushed trailers and cars, stacks of downed cypress trees and walls of hardened mud that make recovery challenging. The amount of debris and destruction have made the grim task slow and taxing.\n\nTroy Tillman, 34, a sheriff’s detective from just outside Lubbock, Texas, described uncovering a Ford F-250 pickup – completely submerged in mud and rock along the Guadalupe in Center Point, about 10 miles downriver from Kerrville. If a 3-ton truck like that is buried, Tillman thought, what else could be entombed at their feet?\n\nRead more.\n\n‒ Rick Jervis and Christopher Cann\n\nVolunteers expected to help with recovery Saturday\n\nKerr County said it is expecting a large number of \"spontaneous volunteers\" to help with recovery efforts on Saturday. Volunteers have been a key part of search and rescue in the days since the flood, with officials sometimes asking volunteers to stay away so qualified personnel can conduct some of the grueling work.\n\nVolunteers are asked to register with Texas Community Recovery and check in at Tivy Antler Stadium in Kerrville before attending a safety briefing.\n\nOfficials continue to grapple with question of blame\n\nOfficials in Texas have faced relentless questions about what could have been done to prevent the high death toll and short amount of warning time in the Hill Country flooding. In Kerr County, Sheriff Larry Leitha has said he's not dodging the questions, but is focusing on the top priority of locating each missing person and identifying each victim found.\n\nTrump on Friday rejected concerns about whether communities along the Guadalupe River were adequately prepared for the disaster.\n\n“I think everybody did an incredible job under the circumstances,” Trump said. “Only a very evil person would ask a question like that.”\n\nGov. Greg Abbott earlier in the week said \"blame\" was the \"word choice of losers.\"\n\nIs more flooding on the way?\n\nAs cleanup and recovery continues in Texas Hill Country, a renewed threat of flash flooding is in store over the weekend, forecasters said. Scattered showers are expected to develop Saturday afternoon and evening in south-central Texas, including parts of areas that already flooded. Heavy rain can quickly run off already wet ground, forecasters said.\n\nIn Kerrville, there is about a 35% chance of an inch of rain falling through Sunday morning, the weather service office serving Austin and San Antonio said.\n\n\"The expected heavy rainfall totals along with already sensitive, wet antecedent conditions may lead to scattered to potentially numerous instances of flash flooding,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nAbbott activated emergency response resources on Friday at the Texas Division of Emergency Management in response to the forecast: \"Texas continues to stand ready to deploy all necessary resources to support Texans as severe storms move across our state,” he said.\n\nOver 13.5 million people were under flood watches from the National Weather Service across parts of Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico on Saturday morning.\n\nHow many died in Texas flooding?\n\nHere's a breakdown of the Texas flooding death toll, according to county officials:\n\nKerr County: 103\n\nTravis County: 9\n\nKendall County: 8\n\nBurnet County: 5\n\nWilliamson County: 3\n\nTom Green County: 1\n\nContributing: Christopher Cann, Joey Garrison, Bart Jansen, Karissa Waddick and Michael Loria, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/07/09/live-updates-austin-texas-flood-flooding-victims-death-toll-survivors/84517650007/", "title": "Live: Texas Gov.

For the latest news on the Texas floods, read USA TODAY's coverage for Tuesday, July 8.\n\nRescue teams in central Texas scoured storm-ravaged terrain Monday looking for survivors as the death toll from last week's catastrophic flooding rose to at least 104 and bouts of heavy rain battered hard-hit areas.\n\nThe Kerr County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Monday that the county’s fatality count is now 84, including 56 adults and 28 children. Identification is pending for 22 adults and 10 children.\n\nThe area hardest hit by the floods was Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River was rapidly overwhelmed by heavy rain on July 4. The river rose to more than 20 feet in a matter of hours at several locations as it rushed downstream toward Kerrville, a city of 24,000.\n\nAmong the dead were at least 27 children and counselors from Camp Mystic, a beloved all-girls summer camp in Kerr County, where the worst of the flooding broke out. At least 10 girls and one counselor remain missing, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at a news conference Monday.\n\n\"Texas is grieving right now. The pain, the shock of what has transpired these last few days has broken the heart of our state,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Cruz said he was heartbroken by the loss of children at Camp Mystic, describing it as \"every parent’s nightmare.\"\n\nThere were about 700 children at the camp when relentless rain caused the nearby Guadalupe River to surge over 26 feet in less than an hour on Friday, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said. Photos taken at the scene show a building, where some of the children slept, with broken windows and a blown-out wall. Among the mud-covered debris were pink blankets and stuffed animals.\n\nAs rescuers resumed searches for missing people by air, land, and water, officials warned those in Central Texas that there remains a danger of \"life-threatening flooding.\" Multiple flash flood warnings were active across the Hill Country as storms drenched the region, inundating roads and waterways.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Potent, slow-moving storms over central Texas have begun to trigger flooding in areas already hard-hit by the state. Forecasters with the National Weather Service have issued flash flood warnings and said that several more inches were expected to fall through the rest of the day. Drier weather is forecasted for the middle to end of the week.\n\n∎ Authorities have rescued over 850 people since the devastating flooding began last week, Cruz said at a news conference.\n\n∎ President Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday that he plans to visit Texas later this week. Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, unlocking federal funding for first responders and offering FEMA assistance to victims of the flash floods.\n\nOfficials urge public to not use private drones amid search efforts\n\nKerr County officials and the Williamson County Sheriff's Office urged the public on Monday not to fly personal drones and keep them grounded as search and rescue operations continue.\n\n\"As a reminder, please do not fly personal drones,\" the Williamson County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. \"They interfere with Public Safety operations and put lives at risk. Leave the skies clear for emergency responders.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, Kerr County officials reported that a private drone was illegally operating in restricted airspace and collided with a helicopter involved in emergency operations. The helicopter made an emergency landing, according to the county.\n\nNo injuries were reported, but the county said a \"critical piece of response equipment\" was now out of service until further notice.\n\n\"This was entirely preventable. Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) are not suggestions. They are federal airspace rules designed to protect lives during emergency situations,\" the county said in a statement. \"When you fly a drone in restricted areas, you’re not just breaking the law -- you’re putting first responders, emergency crews, and the public at serious risk.\"\n\nAt least 62 people rescued in Burnet County\n\nDuring a news conference on Monday, Burnet County Sheriff Calvin Boyd said at least 62 people were rescued in the county, including some who were stranded in attics and trees, and on top of vehicles and roofs.\n\nFour deaths have been confirmed in the county, and authorities were still searching for two missing people, the sheriff said.\n\nBoyd noted the difficulties of the searches due to the county's location in Texas Hill Country. The region is known for its rugged, rolling terrain, in which heavy rains collect quickly in shallow streams and rivers.\n\n\"With all the debris that the flood brought downstream, we're having to helicopter a lot of (rescue workers) in,\" Boyd said at the news conference. \"With the humidity and the heat, it doesn't take long for these folks to get wore out. So we're having to shuffle people in every couple of hours down there.\"\n\nFlood watch expires, advisories continue along river areas\n\nA flood watch for Hill Country and the Interstate 35 corridor expired at 7 p.m. CT, according to the National Weather Service. The agency extended riverside flood watches and warnings, with some advisories lasting through Thursday.\n\nSome isolated activity was expected late Monday and overnight east of the I-35 corridor, according to the weather service. More locally heavy rainfall is also possible on Tuesday, but mainly east of the I-35 corridor where run-off impacts were not as severe.\n\n\"While the atmosphere will likely not be as supportive of the very high rain rates seen over the past few days, remain vigilant as these coastal showers could push over highly saturated ground,\" the weather service office in Austin and San Antonio said in a forecast discussion.\n\nDespite the forecast of less rain, AccuWeather warned that dangerous conditions remain a concern into Monday night.\n\n\"There is a concern we have into Wednesday; there are additional flare-ups or clusters of thunderstorms in parts of central and eastern Texas,\" according to AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno.\n\nOver 20 Texas agencies responding to flooding\n\nMore than 20 state agencies are currently responding to flooding threats across Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement on Monday. The state has also deployed over 1,750 personnel and more than 975 vehicles and equipment assets, including rescue boat teams and Blackhawk helicopters.\n\nAbbott urged residents to monitor local forecast information due to the ongoing risk of flooding for large portions of the state, such as Central Texas, the Hill Country, Big Country, and the Concho Valley.\n\n\"Texans are urged to remain weather aware, heed the guidance of local officials, and regularly monitor weather forecasts,\" Abbott said. \"Texas will remain engaged until every missing person is found and every Texan recovers from this disaster.\"\n\nLost pets could also signal the depth of destruction\n\nNon-profit pet shelter Austin Pets Alive! has taken in over 230 animals, primarily from shelters impacted by the floods. Lindsay O'Gan, the shelter's instructional design manager who is in Kerrville with the rescue and reunification efforts, told USA TODAY on Monday that the magnitude of loss could be foreshadowed in their work.\n\n\"It happened so fast. In the same way, we are seeing so much human missing and casualty ... I think the numbers are going to be much higher than we realize,\" O'Gan said. \"Maybe 80%, 90% of the animals that are reported to us are lost, their owners are also lost or deceased.\"\n\nShe added that animal organizations working in the Hill Country will need help long after the waters recede.\n\n\"We're going to be working on this for the next months after the news moves on,\" she added. \"Hopefully, they'll keep us in their thoughts and keep sending those donations because they are going to be needed for the foreseeable future.\" Read more here.\n\n— James Powel\n\nMexico, several states send crews to assist in search operations\n\nVolunteer firefighters from the Mexican border town of Acuña are helping search and rescue crews in the Kerrville area. Search-and-rescue operations continue around the clock, as hundreds of emergency personnel on the ground contend with debris, mud, and other challenges.\n\nThe team of firefighters is working in conjunction with the nonprofit organization Foundation 911 to assist in search efforts in Kerrville, according to a protective services government agency in Acuña. The crews arrived in the area early Sunday.\n\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said on Monday that he is sending a 45-member search and rescue team to help crews in Central Texas for up to 14 days. The team includes two canine teams as well as boats and vehicles.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis also said that his state will deploy three swift water rescue teams through an Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) to assist with response and recovery. And Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry sent 14 state swift water rescue personnel to help with efforts.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he was deploying search-and-rescue teams to Texas to help with response efforts. The teams are highly experienced in major disaster rescue operations, including the 9/11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, according to the governor.\n\nTexas county where campers died denied money to boost warning systems\n\nNearly a decade before catastrophic flooding in Texas, the state’s Division of Emergency Management denied requests from the county where the summer camp is held for a $1 million grant to improve its flood warning system.\n\nSummer camps were top of mind during county leaders’ discussions of the project, meeting minutes show. Then-County Commissioner Tom Moser envisioned designating point people at each camp who would monitor a website and alert camp counselors and attendees if evacuation was needed.\n\nThe Texas Division of Emergency Management denied Kerr County’s 2017 application, according to meeting minutes. Kerr County applied again in 2018 when more federal funding became available after Hurricane Harvey.\n\nBut meeting minutes indicate that Texas' emergency authority again did not approve it.

Camp Mystic was right on the edge of a Special Flood Hazard Area, as designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Porter noted.\n\nBut even knowing the risks may not be enough to protect American homeowners.\n\nIn Kerr County, where Camp Mystic is located, only 2,650 properties fall in FEMA’s hazard area, meaning they are required to have flood insurance. Homeowners’ insurance doesn’t cover damage from flooding. First Street’s own models find 4,592 properties with what it calls “100-year risk” in the county – nearly double the number FEMA counts.\n\nBut there are no checks on whether homeowners do carry flood insurance, and experts like Porter say only about 50% of all potentially affected homeowners do buy it. First Street's models differ from FEMA's in that they incorporate the effects of extreme precipitation, which FEMA does not account for. First Street also uses climate-change models to extrapolate changing risk into the future.\n\n– Andrea Riquier\n\nGuadalupe River sets record high crest at Hunt\n\nThe Guadalupe River set a record high crest of 37.52 feet at Hunt, Texas, on July 4, the U.S. Geological Survey said. This broke the previous record of 36.60 feet, set on July 2, 1932. Hunt is about six miles from Camp Mystic, the site of some of the worst devastation.\n\nAccording to the USGS, flood impacts of 32 feet or higher at that gage location will lead to \"disastrous life-threatening flooding (that) puts water over the roads of lowest camps and resorts from the headwaters of the North and South Forks to below Comfort.\"\n\nFrom Hurricane Katrina to dam disasters: A look at some of the worst floods in US history.\n\nWhite House calls blaming Trump’s cuts for flood response a 'depraved lie'\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the National Weather Service’s performance during the Texas floods and lashed out at Democrats who have suggested Trump’s recent cuts to the agency prevented floods victims from getting alerts sooner.\n\n“Unfortunately, in the wake of this once-in-a-generation natural disaster, we have seen many falsehoods pushed by Democrats such as Sen. Chuck Schumer and some members of the media,” Leavitt said in a Monday briefing with reporters. “Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning.”\n\nLeavitt pointed to “timely and precise forecasts and warnings” from the weather service on July 3 and on the morning of July 4, when she said the agency gave preliminary lead times of more than three hours before flash-flooding conditions occurred.\n\n\"The National Weather Service did its job,\" Leavitt said. \"They gave out timely flash flood alerts. There were record-breaking lead times in the leadup to this catastrophe. There is ongoing flood monitoring. And these offices were staffed. In fact, one of the offices was actually overstaffed.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nSchumer wants probe of National Weather Service response in Texas\n\nThe Senate's top Democrat on Monday asked a government watchdog to investigate whether cuts at the National Weather Service affected the forecasting agency's response to catastrophic and deadly flooding in Central Texas.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, asked the Department of Commerce's acting inspector general Monday to probe whether staffing vacancies at the weather service's San Antonio office contributed to \"delays, gaps or diminished accuracy\" in forecasting the flooding. He asked the watchdog to scrutinize the office's communications with Kerr County officials.\n\nThe weather service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Schumer's letter. It defended its forecasting and emergency management before, during and after the flood, in a statement Sunday.\n\nTexas Hill Country, known as 'flash flood alley,' is prone to flooding\n\nThe catastrophic flooding in the Texas Hill Country took place in a region that's known as \"flash flood alley,\" a geographic area that also includes many of the state's major metropolitan areas, such as San Antonio, Dallas, Austin and Waco.\n\nThis region is among the nation's most prone to flash flooding, known for its propensity for fast and furious flooding when extreme rain falls, Alan Gerard, CEO of weather consulting company Balanced Weather said. As bountiful, moist air from the Gulf moves over the steep hills, it can dump heavy rain.\n\nExperts said the devastating flash flooding was not a surprise, based on historical and prehistorical data.\n\n\"The flooding was certainly extreme but it should not have been historically unexpected,\" said Roger Pielke, Jr., a political scientist who has written about disaster preparedness and climate change. \"The documented record of extreme flooding in 'flash flood alley' goes back several centuries.\" Read more here.\n\nWhat we know about Texas flood victims\n\nA director of a Texas summer camp for girls who was known as the \"heart and soul\" of the program. Two sisters found together after being swept away by floodwaters. A beloved teacher from the Houston metropolitan area. A local high school soccer coach and his wife.\n\nThey are among the dozens who have died in the destructive flooding that tore across central Texas late last week and over the weekend. State and local officials said search and rescue efforts were still underway, including for 10 children and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp at the edge of the Guadalupe River.\n\nThe many victims include summer camp directors, teachers, grandparents, parents and children. Read about them here.\n\n'If we could go back and do it again, we would evacuate'\n\nAnswering questions about the emergency warnings that came too late for many, Cruz said a review of what happened will come after those still missing are found and recovered.\n\nCruz said the National Weather Service issued emergency warnings just after 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. and noted that many were asleep when the alerts were sent out. He said reviews of the timeline will focus on whether there are tools that would enable earlier detection of major floods – a challenge when floodwaters rise as quickly as they did on Friday.\n\n\"If we can go back and do it again, we would evacuate particularly those in the most vulnerable areas – the young children in the cabins closest to the water ... the people in RVs,\" Cruz said.\n\n“Next time there is a flood, I hope we have in place processes to remove especially the most vulnerable from harm’s way,” he said. “But that will be a process that will take careful examination of what happened.”\n\nHow many people have died in the Texas floods?\n\nBelow are the latest numbers of reported fatalities from state and local officials across central Texas.\n\nKerr County: 84 deaths\n\nTravis County: 7 deaths\n\nKendall County: 6 deaths\n\nBurnet County: 4 deaths\n\nWilliamson County: 2 deaths\n\nTom Green County: 1 death\n\nFlooding ongoing as storms ramp up in central Texas\n\nAcross the rain-soaked Texas Hill Country, thunderstorms have triggered additional flooding, inundating roadways and trapping motorists in their vehicles, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings, which indicate that flooding is either ongoing or imminent, across multiple central Texas counties, including Burnet, Bell, Coryell, and Lampasas. Federal forecasters say 2 to 5 inches of rain has fallen and several more inches are expected.\n\n\"Multiple roads are becoming impassable due to flood waters, and there have been several reports of vehicles stranded on flooded roadways,\" the weather service said in a flood warning set to expire at 10:15 a.m. local time. \"Flash flooding is already occurring.\"\n\nRapid DNA being used to identify Texas flood victims\n\nWhile rescue crews are searching for missing people, authorities are also scrambling to identify the bodies of victims recovered in the aftermath of the Independence Day floods.\n\nIn a statement Sunday evening, the Kerr County Sheriff’s Office said 18 adults and 10 children are at a funeral home and still need to be identified.\n\nTexas Rangers are collecting DNA from family members and deceased victims and flying them to the University of North Texas near Dallas for analysis, said Col. Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\n“We will have answers with rapid DNA in hours – not days – to get some closure and information back to these families,” Martin said.\n\nA scream that saved lives as floodwaters barreled across Texas\n\nWhen Matthew Crowder got to work at Texas Paintball around 4 a.m. on July 5, the floodwaters had already begun to rise. He noticed the water was encircling a nearby home, so he called 911 and later began to scream.\n\nInside, Chrissy Eliashar was awoken by her son and quickly sprang into action, gathering her three children, a family friend and her four dogs and headed for the porch. There, she watched helplessly as her car floated away. They tried to go through the backyard, but it had \"already become a lake.\"\n\nCrowder, who was clinging to a nearby chain-link fence, yelled for the family to make their way to him. The family waded into the knee-deep water and Eliashar's young daughter fell and lost her shoe. They managed to reach a nearby pickup truck, where Crowder pulled them to safety.\n\n\"I'm so grateful that he screamed and was able to wake us up and be that guide to safety for us,\" Eliashar told USA TODAY. \"He really saved us.\" Read more here.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nHow much rain fell during Texas floods\n\nHow to donate to Texas flood victims\n\nIn the wake of the deadly Texas floods, a variety of aid groups, nonprofits and other organizations are accepting donations to help victims and assist in the recovery effort.\n\nThe Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country started a Kerr County Flood Relief Fund, which will provide aid to vetted organizations in Hunt, Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, and other areas. Crowdfunding website GoFundMe has an updated page for verified fundraisers connected to flood victims and their families.\n\nOther organizations accepting donations include World Central Kitchen and the Salvation Army, which is distributing supplies and has set up a mobile kitchen in the disaster area.\n\n– James Powel\n\nHow you can help: How to assist flood victims\n\nWarnings for deadly Texas flash flooding came with little time to act\n\nFor the meteorologists and hydrologists tracking the weather patterns that led to the deadly floods across Texas Hill Country, the most urgent advisories weren’t deployed until it was almost too late, according to interviews and advisories.\n\nForecasters said they pushed out warnings as fast as they got the data. But the hilly terrain and the trickiness of predicting flash floods made forecasting and alerting communities along the Guadalupe River in real time particularly challenging.\n\n\"This is a problem that we are constantly trying to work on: how to better communicate,\" Greg Waller, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service’s West Gulf River Forecast Center in Fort Worth, told USA TODAY. \"We can issue the best forecast in the world, but if it's not put in the hands of the individuals so they can make the best decision, that forecast has little value.\" Read more here.\n\n– Rick Jervis\n\nGuadalupe River rose nearly 30 feet in less than an hour\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson and Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/10/05/asheville-nc-live-updates-latest-on-helene-recovery-harris-visit-saturday/75531124007/", "title": "Asheville, NC live updates: Latest on Helene recovery and Harris visit", "text": "Asheville Citizen Times\n\n(This article will be updated.

This information will allow emergency crews to respond faster and with more accuracy. Access the tool and submit photos at report.buncombecounty.org. Do not use the 'Take Photo or Video' option as it will not transmit location info.\n\nGuidance for Open Burning\n\nAsheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency encourages residents to wait at least three days to let materials dry out before burning as that will help reduce emissions. Be sure to be at least 15 feet away from structures and in three-foot piles.\n\nOpen burning of leaves, brush, and yard trimmings is permitted on burning days between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. To find out if it is a burn day, check abairquality.org or call 828-250-6767.\n\nYou are allowed to burn anywhere that does not receive public yard waste pick-up.\n\nThe burning of household trash, building materials, asphaltic materials, cardboard, processed wood, and papers is always PROHIBITED.\n\nBurning is not allowed in the City of Asheville, and the Towns of Biltmore Forest, Black Mountain, Montreat, Weaverville or Woodfin.\n\nWell Water Safety\n\nEnvironmental Health is working to ensure flooded wells or wells that were damaged during the storm provide safe water for use at home. A flooded well is a well where water was over the top of the well at any point during the storm. Wells may also receive structural damage. If a well was either flooded or damaged during the storm, it must be disinfected. Instructions can be found on buncombeready.org.\n\nOnce the well is disinfected, call 828-250-5016 and some will come out to collect a water sample.\n\nWater preservation: put a filled 2-liter bottle in the back of your toiler, reuse water by using dishwashing water in the back of the toilet for flushing. At this time, we ask that you do not use water from rivers, streams, or creeks due to contamination from the storm.\n\nRestaurants\n\nEnvironmental Health staff is visiting food service establishments and providing information to operators on how they can reopen for business as safely and as quickly as possible. Establishments can call or text 828-772-2820 to request an assessment. They can also email ehrequest@buncombecounty.org and include \"restaurant\" in subject line.\n\nFEMA\n\nThere are more than 700 FEMA personnel on the ground in North Carolina, and 1,300 urban search and rescue personnel. In Buncombe County, FEMA has approved 14,000 applications and more than $12 million has been dispersed to disaster survivors. To register for Disaster Assistance, call 1-800-621-FEMA or visit disasterassistance.gov. FEMA Disaster Survivor Assistance Teams are out in the community today at the WNC Agricultural Center at 1801 Fanning Bridge Road in Fletcher, Pack Square Park at 80 Court Plaza in Asheville, A-B Tech at 340 Victoria Road in Asheville, and Black Mountain Ingles.

Our Arden Campus at 35 Clayton Rd has been operating as a receiving and distribution hub. Many of the resources that are coming into the Arden Campus are also being distributed throughout the community. Below are some ways the local community can get involved.\n\nHow People Can Get Involved:\n\n● Relief: If you need relief in the area you can check 828strong.com for pickup times.

We have been working with all of our partners on the response, including FEMA. They are on the ground and coordinating with us and over 1,000 personnel, all working together to help our community. Unfortunately, some people take advantage of a disaster and spread false and misinformation. First and foremost, understand that all federal, state, and local governments along with our private sector and voluntary organizations, are working to help our community.\n\nMisinformation hurts the response and recovery process. Help keep yourself, your family, and your community safe after Hurricane Helene by being aware of rumors and scams and sharing official information from trusted sources. Rumors about FEMA turning away donations, stopping trucks or vehicles with donations, and confiscating and seizing supplies often spread after a disaster. These are all false.\n\nIf you have an emergency or believe that someone is in danger, please call 911 to report that. Call the Family Assistance Center if you have a loved one who you have not been able to be in contact with. That number is 828-250-6100 or you can visit buncombeready.org for more information.\n\nTeams Continue Working: Do Not Disturb Storm Debris Near Waterways\n\nFairview Fire Department is continuing to respond to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. The department is continuing to gain access to isolated families and search for missing people.\n\nNumerous homeowners and volunteers have begun to clear the debris left over from the flooding. Professional teams from around the country are working to search the areas along waterways and landslides.\n\nWe need for everyone to please leave debris that was in the waterway alone until we provide instructions on when any cleanup can proceed. Do not hire private companies to move or disturb any ground or debris near the waterways until authorized. The successful recovery of missing people depends on allowing the teams to work in an organized process.\n\nIf you are in need of any supplies such as food, medicine, or water; or are in need of shelter refer to the following source(s):\n\nwww.buncombeready.org\n\n(828) 250-6100 (24/7 call center)\n\nFire Chief Scott Jones: 828-628-2001\n\nfairviewfirefd3@gmail.com\n\nSupport and resources for Mission Health\n\nThe city of Asheville and the surrounding areas continue to work through infrastructure challenges caused by Hurricane Helene. HCA Healthcare’s Mission Health hospitals have remained open and caring for patients since the storm thanks to the tremendous efforts of our colleagues and physicians.\n\nHCA Healthcare colleagues, including approximately 400 nurses from Tennessee, Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Texas, Kansas, Utah and California, arrived to provide support and relief for our Mission Hospital caregivers\n\nMore than 40 physicians from HCA Healthcare hospitals have been dispatched from other regions to support the community\n\nWe have cared for more than 1,800 patients and delivered more than 50 babies since the start of the storm.\n\nWe have the staff and resources to treat all patients, including trauma patients, that come to our hospital via ambulance or through our emergency room\n\nVisit Missionhealth.org/Helene for information on services, regional hospitals, clinics and more\n\nWe are providing daily necessities to Mission Hospital including: Water trucks that supply more than 200,000 gallons of water per day\n\nHundreds of thousands of bottles of water\n\nTens of thousands of gallons of fuel\n\nSatellite data networks\n\nMobile units including kitchens, bathrooms and handwashing stations\n\nWe set up Mini Marts inside our hospitals to provide our colleagues with free groceries including food, water and toiletries. We have also set up laundry, sleep and shower facilities.\n\nSo far more than 550 HCA Healthcare colleagues have received nearly $600,000 in emergency financial assistance from the HCA Healthcare Hope Fund, an employee-run, employee-supported 501(c)(3) charity that provides financial aid and resources to employees after an extended illness, injury, or disaster\n\nWe are contributing $1 million toward disaster relief efforts, including $250,000 to the United Way of Asheville and Buncombe County, $250,000 to the American Red Cross of North Carolina and an additional $500,000 to other community partners that provide direct support for hurricane related issues\n\nThis is a difficult time, and we are doing all we can to bring help and relief to those in need. Given the ongoing water issues in the city of Asheville, it is important to preserve as much potable water as possible for general hospital use. We are exploring alternative ways, including the drilling of additional wells, to provide water to cool our HVAC units so we can continue to maintain proper temperatures in our hospital. We are hopeful that the Asheville community’s infrastructure will be restored soon, but we have contingency plans in place and will continue to evaluate how best to take care of our patients and our colleagues.\n\nAsheville curbside collection of regular bagged household waste starts Monday, Oct. 7\n\nOn Monday, October 7, the city of Asheville Sanitation will have crews out servicing both regular Monday and Tuesday trash customers. If your regular pick-up day is Monday or Tuesday, set your carts out by 7 a.m. on Monday for collection. Asheville Sanitation customer’s carts will have a city logo on them. If your cart does not have a city logo on it, you are a county customer, not a city customer.\n\nDo not put limbs, yard debris, construction debris, carpet, concrete, or other bulky or hazardous items in your trash cart. These materials will be collected separately by a contractor. See debris collection Information below for details.\n\nYou may use both your recycling cart and trash cart for trash at this time. Any carts placed at the curb this week will be processed as trash. You may see both city trash trucks and Curbie Recycling trucks out collecting trash, but all material will be landfilled at this time. Collection of recyclables will resume in the near future.\n\nPlace carts where staff can access them to roll to their trucks for disposal. Trucks will only drive on roads that are safely accessible.\n\nDue to numerous factors, we may or may not get to everyone, even on accessible roads. We will communicate information out at the end of the day, Monday, regarding progress and service areas for Tuesday.\n\nDEBRIS COLLECTION INFORMATION\n\nDebris collection is estimated to begin mid-October. Debris should be SEPARATED at the curb according to these guidelines. Ensure staff can still access your trash/recycling carts. Do not block the roadway and ensure access for large trucks & emergency vehicles. To the greatest extent possible, please do not set debris to the curb until we have collected the first round of residential trash/recycling carts unless you have sufficient space for proper separation.\n\nDebrisTech, a contracted company with the city of Asheville and Buncombe County, is hiring Hurricane Debris Collection Monitors to assist in monitoring the debris clean-up process. These positions will be filled immediately. No prior experience needed and the ability to earn up to $1,000 per week. More information regarding these positions can be found here.\n\nVice President Harris to arrive in WNC today\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will arrive in North Carolina today, Oct. 5, to survey the impacts of Tropical Storm Helene and receive an on-the-ground briefing about the continued recovery efforts that are occurring in communities across the state, according to an Oct. 4 news statement from the White House.\n\nHelene touched down in Western North Carolina Sept. 27, with resulting record rainfall, river cresting and flooding that has washed away whole towns and knocked out power, water supplies, cell service and WiFi for much of the region, including Asheville. WNC is under a major federal disaster declaration.\n\nPresident Biden flew over the region with Mayor Esther Manheimer Oct. 2.\n\nOn her visit today, Harris will also provide updates on federal actions that are being taken to support emergency response and recovery efforts in North Carolina and other states throughout the Southeast.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oct. 2, Vice President Harris was on the ground in Augusta, Georgia where she spoke with impacted families, surveyed damage, helped distribute meals, visited an Emergency Operations Center, and received a briefing from local and state officials.\n\n-- Karen Chávez, Asheville Citizen Times", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/10/12/officials-hope-weather-time-their-side-junction-flood-search/1615071002/", "title": "Officials hope weather, time is on their side in Junction flood search", "text": "Staff reports\n\nSan Angelo Standard-Times\n\nKimble County officials are working to cover as much ground as possible in the search for two missing people before some state resources run out Sunday.\n\n“Right now we just need good clear weather, and no more rain,” said Kimble County Emergency Coordinator Randy Millican. “We should be good for a while, according to the weather bureau, and our search is ongoing, concentrating on a couple of different areas, and things seem to be going according to plan at the moment.”\n\nTwo of four missing people were found dead Thursday afternoon, about 9 miles downstream from an RV park that was swept away Monday by sudden flooding of the South Llano River.\n\nAuthorities have not released the identities of the victims.\n\nThe people reported missing were San Angelo resident Darin Hartman and Flomaton, Alabama, residents Mike McGee, Charlotte Moye and Joey Huss.\n\nMillican said searchers continued to be well provisioned Friday, thanks to the public’s generosity.\n\n“We are well stocked,” he said. “The community has opened their hearts and their storehouses, and we’re doing fine. All of our meals are being furnished by the church, and our lodging and accommodations for the searchers. … This morning they opened up the laundromat free of charge so all the responders and the victims’ families could do their wash free of charge.\n\n“We’re just hoping to be able to find these two missing folks pretty soon.”\n\nMillican said they have plenty of searchers on hand now, but if the missing people have not been found by Sunday, they may need volunteers to keep the effort going.\n\n“Most of our search teams are going to be committed to other locations after that point, so we’re working them pretty hard right now, but our resources will deplete pretty quickly after they go, so if people who want to volunteer, they should call the call the Sheriff’s Office then.”\n\nMillican said conditions along the river are dangerous, with plenty of snakes on the move after the flood.\n\nFriends and family of the missing are part of the search, which so far has included 14 people and two rescue dogs from the Texas Military Department; helicopters from the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department and Border Patrol; Parks & Wildlife personnel with a K-9, a drone and a boat with sonar capabilities; and a fixed-wing Cessna 208-B provided by a private company, L3 Technologies.

The Llano River crested at 31.2 feet, the sixth-highest level in Junction history. The highest was 43.3 feet, recorded June 14, 1935.\n\nNineteen people were rescued by air and boat Monday, and another 45 were rescued by officials giving them life jackets and throw ropes before the flooding reached its peak.\n\nAmong the rescued were two women who were pushed down the violent torrent for 20 miles or more before they were found separately.\n\nSteve Turner, brother of Charlotte Moye, said his sister came to Texas with their cousin Janet Shultz. The two were meeting up with Shultz's husband, who was working in Junction.\n\nHartman, McGee and Huss are employees of Tulsa-based Cypress Energy Management-TIR, LLC, and part of a crew inspecting a pipeline near Junction, said Richard Carson, senior vice president and general counsel for parent company Cypress Energy Partners, LLC.\n\nThe three had been on that assignment since July, Carson said. Hartman is a utility inspector, Huss an assistant chief inspector and McGee a lead welding inspector.\n\nCarson said other members of the crew and their companions were among those rescued Monday, and all were recovered or recovering.\n\nThe search initially concentrated on a 30-mile radius around the RV park.

Roy Cooper made a stop in downtown Asheville Monday, Sept. 30, on his rounds of Western North Carolina, parts of which were decimated by Tropical Storm Helene.\n\nCooper, a Democrat in his last year of office after two terms, stopped into Flour, an eatery in the S&W Building, with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.\n\nCooper was on his way to the Asheville Regional Airport to speak to the media.\n\nIn a quick grab outside Flour, the Citizen Times asked Cooper what he was doing immediately to help the residents of Asheville. The city of some 95,000 in the Blue Ridge Mountains has been largely without power, cell service and water since the start of Helene’s advance rage of rain and flooding on the evening of Thursday, Sept. 26.\n\n“We have every resource coming into the city, water, food, supplies,” Cooper said.\n\n“These people are really pulling together and working hard,” he said, gesturing to Buncombe County Sheriff Chief Deputy Herbert Blake and other local and state emergency management officials.\n\nWe will have more from the governor’s press conference this afternoon.\n\n— Karen Chávez\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park: Here's what is closed\n\nThe National Park Service is continuing to assess conditions and address damage in Great Smoky Mountains National Park following Hurricane Helene.\n\nAs of Monday, Sept. 30, park staff were prioritizing assessments of high-use roads and trails as well as radio repeaters and historic structures throughout the park, according to a news release.\n\nSeveral park roads, including Newfound Gap Road/U.S. 441, remain closed.

The detritus of homes and businesses lay scattered along the roads and bridges spanning the rivers.\n\nDown Swannanoa River Road, near Asheville's Walmart, a cow had seemingly been pummeled by an overturned tractor trailer and its body bloated, the smell of death emanating from the carcass. Outside of the Aldi on Swannanoa River Road, a group of people wandered around the building, peering inside the gutted building. Some picked over the things they could salvage, mostly necessities like food, water and medicine.\n\nYou can read Will Hofmann's full story here.\n\nAnother death in Henderson County, bringing total dead to 6\n\nThe death toll in Henderson County is now six, indicating that another person has died as a result of the historic flooding caused by Tropical Storm Helene, Henderson County spokesperson Mike Morgan said Sept. 30.\n\nHe provided more information about the status of shelters in the county, noting that both are still open but the Athletics and Activities Center has been full while they've had people \"coming and going.\"\n\nEdneyville Elementary is also open and has space, he said.\n\nMorgan reiterated that resource hubs are opening at noon Sept. 30 and will stay open until 6 p.m. The locations are:\n\nEtowah Elementary, 320 Etowah School Road Etowah, NC 28729\n\nRugby Middle School, 3345 Haywood Road, Hendersonville, NC 28791\n\nEast Henderson High School, 150 Eagle Pride Drive, East Flat Rock, NC 28726\n\nNorth Henderson High School, 35 Fruitland Road, Hendersonville, NC 28792\n\nMills River Town Hall, 124 Town Center Drive.

It also damaged a water treatment plant across the river.\n\nMost of the town was without power and cellular service. Marshall Mayor Aaron Haynie told ABC-13 there have been \"some\" fatalities but vowed to rebuild.\n\nThe damage also extended to some businesses that in recent years have become part of an artistic renewal in the downtown area.

For the latest news on the Texas flooding, read USA TODAY's coverage for Saturday, July 12.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he’d never seen destruction from a disaster as bad as what he saw in Texas after he surveyed the damage of catastrophic flooding that tore across the state's Hill Country and as authorities and volunteers continued to search for the missing.\n\nDuring a roundtable after meeting with victims' families and local officials, Trump recounted how the Guadalupe River overflowed – “a little narrow river becomes a monster.”\n\n\"This is a tough one,\" Trump said. “It’s hard to believe the devastation.\"\n\nThe president applauded emergency officials for their response and rejected concerns about whether communities along the Guadalupe River were adequately prepared for the disaster.\n\n\"Only a very evil person would ask a question like that,\" Trump said.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump said she was moved by meeting with victims' families.\n\n\"We are grieving with you,\" she said at the roundtable. \"Our nation is grieving with you.\"\n\nOver 120 people have been recovered since heavy rainfall overwhelmed the Guadalupe River and flowed through homes and summer camps in the early morning hours of July 4. Ninety-six of those killed were in the hardest-hit county in central Texas, Kerr County, where the toll includes at least 36 children.\n\nState officials vowed to continue searching for over 160 people still missing but have acknowledged the dwindling chances of finding survivors alive a week after the disaster. The last time rescue teams made a \"live rescue\" was on the day the flood broke out.\n\nThe president, first lady and a host of lawmakers and cabinet members made the trip to Texas Friday as questions linger over what could have been done to save more lives from one of the deadliest floods of the last 25 years.\n\nTrump praises 'competence' and 'unity'\n\nTrump dismissed a reporter’s question about whether emergency alerts went out in time before the flooding surged to crisis levels and said people should instead focus on the \"unity” and “competence” displayed after the floods.\n\n“I think everybody did an incredible job under the circumstances,” Trump said. “Only a very evil person would ask a question like that.”\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called it a once-in-a-1,000-year flood. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said the reporter's question was \"ridiculous.\"\n\n“We’ll figure out how to make our systems the best they can be,\" he said. Roy said the \"enduring images\" of the flood will be of girls from Camp Mystic singing as they evacuated the scene. “That’s who the people of Texas are,\" he said.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, described a horrifying scene at Camp Mystic, where the water line on a cabin showed the floodwaters rose 8 feet, blowing out the windows and sweeping away the girls inside.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything more horrible in my life,” said Cruz, who said he broke down and wept.\n\nMore potential flooding? Abbott activates state emergency response\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott activated emergency response resources July 11 at the Texas Division of Emergency Management.\n\n\"Texas continues to stand ready to deploy all necessary resources to support Texans as severe storms move across our state,” said Governor Abbott. \"I urge Texans to remain weather-aware and heed the guidance of state and local officials to ensure the safety of themselves and their loved ones.\"\n\nEmergency resources include swiftwater rescue team boats capable of rescuing people swept up in floodwaters.\n\nAbbott activated emergency resources in response to heavy rainfalls the National Weather Service predicted for parts of Northwest Texas, far West Texas, North Texas, the Big Country, Permian Basin, Concho Valley and the Hill Country, the same area devastated by the Fourth of July floods.\n\nRainfall is expected to begin overnight and continue through the weekend, Abbott said.\n\nOfficials vow to rebuild\n\nJohn Dunn, the longtime owner of The Hunt Store in Kerrville, told Trump he planned to rebuild the beloved spot despite concerns from patrons that it was a total loss.\n\n“I’m absolutely going to bring it back,” Dunn said of the store he sold earlier this year. “We’re going to get it opened very quickly.”\n\n“We will rebuild the Hunt Store right here,” Gov, Greg Abbott said, doubling down on Dunn's remarks. “We are going to rebuild this community.”\n\nMore than 12,000 volunteers have flocked to Kerrville County to help with search and recovery efforts and 19 states have sent resources, Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas division of emergency management, told Trump.\n\nTexas flags fly at half-mast from Alamo\n\nOfficials at the Alamo fort in San Antonio lowered the Texas state flag to half-mast, according to videos shared by staffers on social media.\n\n“Our hearts are with the families and communities of the Hill Country,” fort staffers said in a post from the official Alamo X account.\n\nThe fort is a U.S. National Historic Landmark and UNESCO World Heritage Site, according to the National Park Service.\n\nAmong Texans it holds a deeply symbolic significance. A small group fighting for independence from Mexico was “annihilated” there in 1836, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. The death of figures at the fort, including former Tennessee congressman David “Davy” Crockett, became a rallying cry for the state: “Remember the Alamo.”\n\nTrump spoke with families of victims\n\nThe president arrived at a roundtable discussion with first responders late Friday afternoon after meeting with the relatives of the flood victims. Trump sat behind a black banner marked with the phrase “Texas Strong.”\n\n“I think this is a good reason to be late,” Trump said, sitting behind a black banner that read “Texas Strong.”\n\nThe first lady said young girls gave her a bracelet they made to honor victims of the floods and vowed to return to Texas' Hill Country.\n\n\"We are here to honor them,\" she said of the campers and counselors who passed away.\n\nTexas man threatens Trump: ‘I won’t miss’\n\nA San Antonio man was charged July 10 for allegedly threatening President Donald Trump, the Justice Department announced.\n\nRobert Herrera, 52, commented on a San Antonio news outlet’s Facebook post pertaining to Trump’s planned visit to the Texas Hill Country, according to court records.\n\n“I won’t miss,” Herrera allegedly posted, along with a picture of Trump surrounded by Secret Service agents immediately after the July 13, 2024, assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter an exchange with another poster, Herrera allegedly posted a picture of an assault rifle with loaded magazines.\n\nHerrera was charged with making threats against a president and making interstate threatening communications. He faces a maximum five years in prison on each charge if convicted.\n\n“To be clear, these types of threats will not be taken lightly, and we will always take a swift, aggressive approach, as was done here,” U.S. Attorney Justin Simmons said in the Western District of Texas.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nTrump talks with first responders in Kerrville, Texas\n\nShortly after Trump arrived in Texas, his motorcade stopped near the Guadalupe River in Kerrville, where an overturned tractor trailer and numerous downed trees littered the area, according to reporters traveling with him.\n\nSimilar debris was visible throughout the president's drive from the Kerrville-Kerr County airport to the river. Pockets of residents standing in strip-mall parking lots waved as the president drove by them.\n\nAt Louise Hays Park, Trump, the first lady and Gov. Greg Abbott stood next to a red-and-white engine from the Kerrville Fire Department as they listened and nodded to a 10-minute briefing. Trump shook hands with about 30 emergency workers after the briefing and posed for pictures.\n\nTrump and the first lady then met with dozens of federal, state and local officials at the Happy State Bank Expo Hall in Kerrville, where he later hosted a round table. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and GOP Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz were among the attendees.\n\n- Bart Jansen and Joey Garrison\n\nHouse Democrats request comms related to Texas flood response\n\nDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee have called on multiple government agencies to produce documents and communications about the lead-up and response to the deadly Texas floods.\n\nIn a series of letters, Texas Reps. Greg Casar and Jasmine Crockett – backed by ranking member Robert Garcia, of California, – expressed concern over FEMA's response to the crisis and the potential impacts of DOGE cuts on the National Weather Service.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned not only that Secretary Noem may have effectively crippled the agency’s ability to respond to this crisis, but also that she failed to personally act to ensure a timely response,\" the members wrote in a letter to FEMA. Other letters were sent to the Department of Commerce Inspector General and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe White House on Friday said that FEMA has $13 billion in reserves that it can draw on to assist victims of the Texas floods.\n\nHow many deaths from Texas flooding?\n\nHere's a breakdown of the Texas flooding death toll, according to county officials:\n\nKerr County: 96\n\nTravis County: 8\n\nKendall County: 8\n\nBurnet County: 5\n\nWilliamson County: 3\n\nTom Green County: 1\n\nAbbott announces crisis line for Texas flood victims\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday announced a 24/7 crisis support line for residents impacted by the deadly floods that pummeled the state one week ago.\n\nThe Texas Flooding Emotional Support Line will provide callers with professional crisis counseling at no cost, according to the governor's office. Counselors will also help residents review their disaster recovery options and provide referrals to other programs. \"This new statewide crisis support line will ensure survivors, families, and first responders have access to emotional support and crisis counseling as they work to heal and recover,\" Abbott said in a statement.\n\nPresident Trump departs for Texas Hill Country\n\nAboard Air Force One, Trump left Washington Friday morning en route to Texas, where he plans to meet with family members of flood victims, first responders and local officials.\n\nAccompanying Trump on the trip are Republican Texas U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner and Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler.\n\n\"Nobody can even believe it, such a thing,\" Trump said before boarding Air Force Once. \"That much water that fast – without a dam break. You’d think a dam would have break for it to happen. A terrible thing.\"\n\nOver $30 million in donations received by Kerr County flood relief fund\n\nThe Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country has received more than $30 million in donations through the Kerr County Flood Relief Fund, organizers announced Friday.\n\nTexas Rep. Chip Roy thanked those who've donated to the fund and said he expects the donation totals to grow in the coming days as recovery operations continue across the region. He urged more people to donate to the relief fund, citing a challenging road to recovery.\n\n\"We're going to rebuild and we're going to be back better than ever,\" he said.\n\nWhite House says FEMA has enough money for Texas flood relief\n\nAhead of Trump’s Friday visit to Texas, the White House’s budget chief told reporters the Federal Emergency Management Agency has the funding to assist in flood recovery efforts even as the Trump administration has talked about eliminating FEMA.\n\nRuss Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said FEMA has about $13 billion in its reserves to pay for necessary expenses in Texas.\n\n“The president has said to Texas, anything it needs it will get,” Vought said, adding that, “We also want FEMA to be reformed. We want FEMA to work well … The president is going to continue to be asking tough questions of all of his agencies.\"\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday continued her call for FEMA to be eliminated in its current form. Her push comes as FEMA has deployed specialists and distributed supplies to the flooded areas in Texas.\n\n\"Federal emergency management should be state and locally led, rather than how it has operated for decades,\" Noem said.\n\n\"It has been slow to respond at the federal level. It's even been slower to get the resources to Americans in crisis, and that is why this entire agency needs to be eliminated as it exists today, and remade into a responsive agency.\"\n\nKerr County was denied money to upgrade flood warning system\n\nNearly a decade before disastrous floods ravaged the Texas Hill Country, the state’s Division of Emergency Management denied requests from Kerr County for a $1 million grant to improve its flood warning system, records show.\n\nIn 2017, Kerr County requested the funds to build a flood warning system that would have upgraded 20 water gauge systems, added new water level sensors and posts, and created software and a website to distribute the information to the public in real-time.\n\nThe Texas Division of Emergency Management denied Kerr County’s initial application, meeting minutes show. Kerr County applied again the following year, in 2018, when more federal funding became available after Hurricane Harvey. But meeting minutes indicate that Texas’ emergency authority again did not approve it.\n\nThe Division of Emergency Management did not answer USA TODAY's specific questions about why the county's applications were rejected.\n\n– Kenny Jacoby\n\nFAA issues flight restrictions over Texas Hill Country amid search effort\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary flight restriction for counties in the Texas Hill County where search teams are traversing mangled riverbanks to recover victims of the deadly floods. The order restricts the use of aircrafts and drones operating without permission over the search area.\n\nWhile drones have enabled rescuers to scour parts of the disaster zone that are otherwise inaccessible, unauthorized aircraft have hindered recovery efforts.\n\nOn Monday, July 7, a drone illegally operating in restricted airspace crashed into a helicopter involved in emergency operations. The helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing and is out of service “until further notice,” according to Kerr County. No injuries were reported.\n\nOfficials urge residents not to touch large debris piles amid search\n\nKerr County officials asked residents to avoid large debris piles until they've been searched thoroughly by crews scouring for flood victims.\n\n\"We are still looking for victims. If a pile is large enough to need heavy equipment to clean ... have the city send a search team to check the pile first,\" read a statement on the flood taskforce website. \"This applies to big tangles where a person could be. Smaller piles are fine to be cleaned up.\"\n\nThis week search crews have shifted their focus to untangling towering mounds of wreckage along the Guadalupe River and throughout Kerr County, where at least 96 people have been killed.\n\nWhat we know about the Texas flood victims\n\nA director of a Texas summer camp for girls who was known as the \"heart and soul\" of the program. Two grade-school age sisters found together after being swept away. A 23-year-old Texas police officer celebrating the Fourth of July with his family.\n\nThese are some of the more than 120 people killed by the disastrous floods that swept across the Texas Hill Country one week ago. Flooding-related deaths have been reported in at least six counties. The victims include summer camp directors, teachers, grandparents, parents and dozens of children.\n\nRead the stories of those who lost their lives here.\n\nTrump says expresses support for alarm system after Texas floods\n\nIn an interview on NBC's Meet the Press on Thursday, Trump said the Texas flood was a \"once-in-every-200-year\" event and said he supported the installation of an alarm system to warn of such emergencies.\n\n\"After having seen this horrible event, I would imagine you’d put alarms up in some form,\" Trump told NBC’s Meet the Press on Thursday ahead of the trip, noting, \"local officials were hit by this just like everybody else.\"\n\nQuestions remain about what more could have been done to warn residents of the flooding, which surged the Guadalupe River nearly 30 feet in less than an hour. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's legislative agenda for an upcoming special session includes discussions on flood warning systems, communications and natural disaster preparation and recovery.\n\nWhat we know about Trump's Texas visit\n\nTrump plans to visit the area on Friday, July 11, and meet with family members of flood victims and first responders during his trip, according to a White House official. Trump will also participate in a briefing and roundtable from local elected officials, the official said.\n\nTrump and the first lady will land in Kerr County at 12:20 p.m., according to an official schedule.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, Kathryn Palmer, Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2025/07/07/live-guadalupe-river-flooding-death-toll-rises-to-84/84489796007/", "title": "Guadalupe River flood live updates: Death toll rises to 84"}]}

Tens of thousands descended upon Indianapolis for the final three U.S. shows of the tour, and the city is absolutely abuzz with Swiftie spirit.\n\nIndyStar journalists were back out on the streets for Day 2 of Eras Tour weekend, meeting fans, exchanging friendship bracelets and bringing you all the sights and sounds of downtown Indianapolis.\n\nEditor's note: Read this story from the bottom up to relive the night as it unfolded.\n\nTakeaways from Taylor Swift N1: Taylor Swift's Eras Tour a whole new experience the second time around\n\nTravis Kelce attends N2 in Indy\n\n\"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\" Swift sang as photos of the NFL star circulated on social media. One shot appeared to show the tight end wearing a black cap and long-sleeved shirt, smiling.\n\nNormally, Swift sings \"Karma is the guy on the screen, coming straight home to me.\" She first altered the lyric in November 2023, and she's since sang it the same way every time Kelce's been in the audience — now at least 14 times.\n\n— Ryan Murphy\n\nSurprise songs from Eras Tour N2 Indy\n\nOn her second night in Indianapolis, Swift performed a mashup of \"The Prophecy\" from \"The Tortured Poets' Department\" and \"This Love\" from \"1989\" on the guitar.\n\nShe then moved to the piano, where she played a mashup of \"Maroon\" from \"Midnights\" and \"Cowboy Like Me\" from \"Evermore.\"\n\n— Ryan Murphy\n\nWill Indy get a 'Reputation (Taylor's Version)' announcement?\n\nFans have speculated that Swift uses the number 112 to plan her announcements.\n\nThe theory isn't without evidence. \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\" was released 112 days after the Eras Tour began; \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" came out 112 days after the re-recorded \"Speak Now.\" And 112 days after Swift performed \"If This Was a Movie\" as her surprise song in Minneapolis, the Eras Tour film opened at the box office.\n\nWhile it's been more than 112 days since Swift's last album release, Saturday night's concert takes place exactly twenty years after she first met Scott Borchetta, the then-chief of Big Machine Records, on Nov. 2. 2004 — a date that could also be written as 11/2.\n\nThere are even more Easter eggs: Will Taylor Swift announce \"Reputation (Taylor's Version)\" in Indianapolis? What we know\n\n— Ryan Murphy\n\nTaylor says N2 beats N1's concert attendance record: 'You guys are the best'\n\n\"They told me some really cool news earlier, which I wanted to pass on to you, because you're the reason it happened,\" Swift told fans. \"Last night, before I went on stage, everybody was so excited because they were like the crowd has broken the all-time concert attendance record for the stadium. And tonight, you broke last night's record.\n\n\"So cool that there's just never been this many people in this stadium for a concert before. You guys are the best. Thank you for doing that.\"\n\n— Bryan West\n\nN2's 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together' was even more Midwestern\n\nWhen Swift sings \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" backup dancer Kam Saunders chimes in with a different interjection after Swift speaks during the song's bridge. On N1, Saunders said \"No, yeah, no\" — a phrase fans were quick to recognize as quintessentially Midwestern.\n\nOn N2, Saunders said \"Ope, no,\" in what seemed to be a nod to the Hoosier State — seeing as \"ope\" is one of the most Midwestern words there is.\n\n— Ryan Murphy\n\nCaitlin Clark returns to Lucas Oil Stadium for N2 of the Eras Tour\n\nNo. 22 was spotted back at Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday night to watch Swift perform for a second time this weekend.\n\nClark was spotted N1 at the Eras Tour by fans and shared her excitement on her Instagram story.

For Night 1, Swift took the stage at 8:05 p.m. Expect Night 2 to be right around 8 p.m. again.\n\n— Evan Frank\n\nWhat to know about N2 show timing: What time does Taylor Swift go on stage for Eras Tour Night 2 in Indianapolis?\n\nConcertgoers remain hopeful outside stadium\n\nDozens of people hoping to snag last minute-tickets stood outside Lucas Oil Stadium less than 90 minutes before Taylor Swift was set to go on stage. Many held up signs saying they were in search of tickets.\n\nAnne Henry, 36, flew in from Orlando with two friends for less than 24 hours to try for tickets knowing that not attending the concert was a real possibility. Henry tried for tickets multiple times when the surprise Ticketmaster drops went online but failed to snag any.\n\nWithout a hotel room for the night, she said the trio are planning to go get a bite to eat and hang out once the concert starts.\n\n“Being around the community is always good and we are having a good time despite being sad about how Ticketmaster went down,” Henry said.\n\n— Alysa Guffey\n\nLooking to buy last-minute Eras Tour N2 tickets in Indy?\n\nWith opener Gracie Abrams expected to take the stage in less than an hour, there are still tickets available for purchase via third-party sites like StubHub.\n\nA little less than an hour before the show was scheduled to start, the cheapest ticket available for purchase was through Vivid Seats for $2,213 located at Lower Level 249, Row 5 with an obstructed view.\n\n— Katie Wiseman\n\nMaking flower crowns to honor Swift\n\nDemarise Abbett’s admiration for Taylor Swift stretches back to a 2008 Verizon Wireless Music Center concert when the singer-songwriter opened for Tim McGraw.\n\nAt the time, Abbett was 15 years old and had curly hair she was a little unsure of.\n\n“In her first self album cover, (Swift’s hair) is just down and frizzy and curly and just there. She’s just not afraid of herself,” Abbett said. “I just always looked up to that.\"\n\nDuring the Eras Tour weekend, the Little Flower resident was selling handmade flower crowns through her business, Cellar Creations by Demarise. At her booth at the Indiana State Museum’s TAY/gate, Abbett displayed several types of crowns inspired by Swift’s eras.\n\nFor example, “Fairytale” — with its daisies, spray roses and baby’s breath — evoked the “Fearless,” “Folklore” and “Evermore” eras. The “Cruel Summer” crown nodded to the “Lover,” “1989,” “Speak Now” and debut album eras with mums, roses, waxflower and carnations.\n\nAs for Abbett’s favorite era? That’s tough to choose, she said. But she’s particularly fond of the singer-songwriter’s early songs — the ones Swift would have performed at that 2008 concert, like “Picture to Burn” and “Our Song.”\n\n“I think it’s just so relatable — like being a teenage girl and wanting to dream about the future but also being so frustrated,” Abbett said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nFans love the stories Swift tells with her music\n\nJordan Eltzroth, who’s from Morristown, has been listening to Swift since her debut album. And now, her 3-year-old daughter Evelynn loves to listen, too — especially to “Shake It Off,” “Paper Rings,” “Reputation,” “Cruel Summer” and “Lover.”\n\nSo what does Evelynn like best about Swift? “My shirt!” she replies.\n\nWhat to know: Your guide to Taylor Swift in Indianapolis for Eras Tour shows\n\nColorful letters on the black background spell out “In My Swiftie Era.” Her mom’s sweatshirt depicts Swift’s album titles on books.\n\n“I just love her overall music and the message behind all of her music,” said Eltzroth, 30. “It’s all of the albums but they’re books, so it tells a story.”\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nTalk about a wild era\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, what looked to once be a large paper friendship bracelet was no more. Inside a chimpanzee lair at the Indianapolis Zoo, an “o” and “u” were strewn across the enclosure near other colorful pieces of paper.\n\nThree chimps calmly sat nearby, giving no hint as to what happened. But their message appeared to be clear.\n\n“They’re not Swifties,” one bystander said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nA view from above: See the J.W. Marriott's Taylor Swift decal from the sky\n\nHow long is the wait for Eras Tour merch in Indy?\n\nJust three hours before the Saturday night show, merchandise lines topped three hours inside the Indiana Convention Center and some sizes of certain items were running out, according to fans exiting the line.\n\nHayley Turnbaugh, 32, of Baltimore, waited two and a half hours to shop. Blue crewnecks were beginning to sell out along with various sizes of t-shirts, she said.\n\nStands inside the convention center close at 8 p.m. and will not be open Sunday, meaning Saturday is Swifties' last chance to buy merchandise without a ticket.\n\nMerchandise is available at Lucas Oil Stadium Saturday and Sunday night.

One popular shop has been Francis and Fern Boutique, 421 Massachusetts Ave., which went viral on TikTok this week.\n\nThe store has had a constant, hourslong line to shop custom-made items like shirts, mugs and necklaces, owner Kim Pauszek said.\n\n“We’ve always carried Taylor Swift and we have a huge Swiftie following, so we knew we had to go nuts,” Pauszek said.\n\nElla Klaus and Andi Reiser from Pittsburgh waited for three hours to shop. Both bought custom mugs, with one reading “With some Indy record that’s much cooler than mine,” a play on a lyric from “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.”\n\nThe friends traveled to the Circle City with tickets for Night 1 of the Indianapolis shows and were meandering about downtown continuing to soak up the Swiftie spirit.\n\nIt wasn’t their first time seeing Swift, but the night was one to remember.\n\n“The set-up was so much better, and it was so different with the 'Tortured Poets Department' set,” said Reiser. And the surprise songs were amazing, she added.\n\n— Alysa Guffey\n\nDarius Rucker took daughters to Eras Tour Indy N1\n\nThe singer, who is known for his solo work as a country artist and for fronting Hootie & the Blowfish, posted to social media that he took his two daughters to the show, with the stage and a Lucas Oil banner appearing in the background.\n\nHe wasn't the only celeb in attendance for N1: Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was also at the show.\n\nSee Swift's 2019 Teen Choice Awards look on display at The Childrens Museum\n\nA multicolored outfit once worn by Swift drew crowds at The Children’s Museum on Saturday.

Kate, 10, especially loves the high notes in the song “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me.”\n\n“We decided we wanted to make a Taylor Swift day anyway,” Leisure, 40, said, “so we came down and we’re making bracelets and we dressed up together and we’re going to the dance party, and after we’re done here, we’re going to go to the zoo’s Wildest Era party.”\n\nLeisure’s own fandom began before she had kids, and now she shares a love for Swift’s work with her daughter. The two wore matching outfits and red lipstick on Saturday at The Children’s Museum.\n\n“I think before kids, (it was) just like, ‘Oh, women empowerment — she’s amazing.’ Now that I have my daughter — she has three older brothers, and then, I got Kate. So I enjoy this with her so much. Like, I was so glad that she became a Swiftie by choice, not just by birthright,” Leisure said with a laugh.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nSwifties starting young\n\nJordan Mowrer and Sarah Toombs share a friendship that began at Marian University and a love of the Swift song “Clean.”\n\n“The song ‘Clean’ got me through a breakup,” Mowrer said. “We probably both used that one to go through a breakup.”\n\n“Which is kind of funny,” Toombs added, laughing.\n\nThey’re passing their love of Swift’s work on to their kids, 4-year-old Andy Mowrer and 3-year-old Lainey Toombs. The four of them made friendship bracelets at The Children’s Museum on Saturday morning, and Mowrer and Toombs, both 32 and from Indianapolis, held out hope that they’d be able to score last-minute tickets to the Eras Tour.\n\nLainey has a Swift book of her own, and Andy knows all the words to his favorite song by the singer: “Welcome to New York.”\n\n“He’ll sing it,” Mowrer said, as Andy belted out the title lyrics.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nFans excited to be 'breathing the same air' as the star\n\nCousins Rhylynn Little and Violet Shamblin, both 11, didn’t have tickets to the Eras Tour concerts, but they still relished being part of the festivities.\n\nAt The Children’s Museum on Saturday morning, the two made friendship bracelets and participated in one of the scheduled dance parties before heading downtown to the Indiana Convention Center. They dressed in matching heart sunglasses and T-shirts, nods to Swift’s “Reputation” and “Fearless” albums.\n\nEven without tickets, the drive from Columbus, Ohio, was worth it, they said.\n\n“I’m breathing the same air as (Swift),” Rhylynn said.\n\n“I think the reason we did it was just so at least they could experience what it’s like close to it, a part of the Eras Tour stuff even though we can’t actually go to the concert,” mom Amanda Little, 40, said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nOur takeaways from Taylor Swift N1 Indianapolis\n\nWhile Post Malone did not show, Caitlin Clark did.

Certified reseller websites including StubHub, Vivid Seats and Seat Geek all have last-minute tickets for the last U.S. Eras Tour concert for fans willing to pay more than face value.\n\nStubHub has tickets starting at about $2,000 each, while Vivid Seats and Seat Geek each have tickets starting in the $1,800s each as of 5:20 p.m. Sunday.\n\n- Ana Rocio Alvarez Brinez\n\nJohn Green signals he may be attending N3 of Eras Tour\n\nIndianapolis author John Green dropped a social media hint that he may be attending the last night of the Eras Tour at Lucas Oil Stadium. Green posted a photo of himself on X wearing a T-shirt that says \"Indy going on at the moment,\" in the style of the shirts Swift wears during the \"Red\" portion of her setlist. One of her tees says \"A lot going on at the moment.\"\n\nAn avid Swiftie, Green has given high praise to Swift's latest album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" released in April.\n\nPart-time Indy limo driver works 3 days straight for Swifties\n\nDriving downtown during one of Indianapolis’ busiest weekends in decades might sound you're in a new hell, but it’s not so bad, Ray Albee said.\n\nAlbee might have as much authority to speak on downtown traffic as anyone — the 77-year-old part-time limousine driver has been snaking through the gridlock of Mile Square for the last two days of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. As he waits Sunday in his sleek black limo outside Conner’s Kitchen and Bar to pick up his next group of Swifties, Albee shows no signs of stress, even if his fellow drivers don’t always share his placid demeanor.\n\n“They’re not polite,” Albee said. “Courtesy is dead. Died years ago.”\n\nStill, Albee is happy to be among the crowd buzzing around Lucas Oil Stadium. His clientele has ranged from a group of four parents with 12 young children to troupes of rowdy college-aged women in sequined dresses and cowboy boots. Albee is hardly a Swiftie, but the way he way he sees it, there are worse gigs than ferrying around happy concertgoers.\n\n“Oh, I think they’re fantastic,” Albee said. “It’s too bad the venue wasn’t three times the size so more people could go.”\n\n- Bradley Hohulin\n\nIndianapolis weather today\n\nScattered rain showers could hit Indianapolis late Sunday afternoon into the evening. According to the National Weather Service's forecast for Sunday, Swift fans can expect scattered showers after 4 p.m. with a high of 70. The overnight low is hovering at 61.\n\nWhat time will Taylor Swift take the stage on N3?\n\nSwift's opener, Gracie Abrams, takes the stage at 6:45 p.m. ET sharp.\n\nSwift herself usually takes the stage around 8 p.m. On Night 1, Swift began the show at 8:05 p.m. ET. On Night 2, she started a few minutes early at 7:55 p.m. ET.\n\nDon't forget that Indianapolis clocks \"fell back\" an hour overnight with the end of Daylight Savings Time.\n\n- Evan Frank\n\nWhy Taylor Swift said Indianapolis is last U.S. Eras Tour stop\n\nTaylor Swift confirmed at her first Indianapolis show that this weekend will be her last U.S. stops for the Eras Tour.\n\n\"We decided we have got to end this tour in front of the most dedicated, passionate, beautiful, enthusiastic, excitable crowd,\" she said Friday night in front of nearly 70,000 fans. \"So we decided that the very last U.S. city of the Eras Tour would be right here in Indianapolis, Indiana. And I can already tell we made the best decision possible.”\n\n- Bryan West\n\nSwifties hunting around Indy for last-minute tickets\n\nLess than 48 hours from Election Day, Democrats and Republicans aren’t the only ones seeking last-minute support around Indianapolis.\n\n“Need 1 ticket,” reads the sign being waved along Georgia Street downtown by Meredith, a 28-year-old Swiftie from Cincinnati.\n\n“We’re campaigning,” she said. “Just need one.”\n\nMeredith was among the millions who scrambled for Indianapolis Eras Tour tickets. Her friends lucked out — sixth-row seats on the floor for tonight’s concert. Meredith, not so much. She traveled to Indy with her friends, but instead of getting ready with them at their hotel she swung by CVS to pick up poster board and markers. She hit the streets around noon today.\n\nMeredith, who last saw Swift perform in Cincinnati in summer 2023, got into Swift’s music as an early teenager with the popstar’s 2008 album “Fearless.” Lately, as she works through her recent divorce, Meredith has found solace in Swift’s more melancholy, introspective tracks.\n\nWhile she doesn’t love her odds of snagging a ticket with just hours left before Swift’s final Eras Tour stop in the United States, Meredith isn’t ready to give up yet.\n\n“I’ll pay for a ticket,” she said. “I just need to find one.”\n\n- Bradley Hohulin\n\nWill Taylor Swift have surprise guests on N3 in Indy?\n\nUSA Today Taylor Swift reporter Bryan West thinks it is possible Swift could bring out Post Malone to sing their song \"Fortnight.\" This has yet to happen on the tour since the song was released.\n\nWest also said it is possible she will bring out other collaborators from her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, such as Jack Antonoff or Aaron Dessner.\n\nSee Taylor Swift, fans and crowds on N2 in Indianapolis\n\nTaylor Swift delighted young fans on N2 at Lucas Oil Stadium\n\nIt's no secret teenagers and tweens love Taylor Swift, and IndyStar learned firsthand what younger fans love about the popstar when senior news director Cindi Andrews attended the concert with her 13-year-old daughter Katie Saturday night.\n\nEven having seen the show many times previously via the 2023 concert film \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" and the terrible livestreams on social media, Katie was surprised and impressed by the staging in person. Meanwhile, her mom Cindi appreciated hearing what new ways Eras Tour dancer Kam Saunders would find to say \"no\" during the song \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" bringing a Midwest twist with his \"Ope, no.\"\n\nHer also famous boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce made an appearance in the stadium toward the end of her set Saturday night, sending fans in Indianapolis and around the world into a frenzy. All of a sudden, the yellow and red Chiefs-inspired outfit Swift wore during the \"1989\" set made sense.\n\n- Cindi Andrews and Katie Wissman\n\nWhere can I find Eras Tour merch on N3?\n\nLucas Oil Stadium is the only place to buy official Eras Tour merchandise on Sunday. The stands inside the convention center closed at 8 p.m. Saturday.\n\nMerchandise will be for sale on all levels of Lucas Oil Stadium. Some products can be bought online at store.taylorswift.com.\n\nLucas Oil Stadium bag policy\n\nGenerally, fans should expect to be able to enter with clear bags no larger than 12\" x 6\" x 12\".

Fans can also bring one gallon-size clear plastic bag.\n\nNot allowed are backpacks, briefcases, luggage and non-clear and clear bags larger than the previously stated dimensions.\n\n- Holly V. Hays\n\nEras Tour rideshare and pickup locations, downtown Indianapolis road closures\n\nThere will be a slew of road closures to manage traffic around Lucas Oil Stadium this weekend, so if you're trying to get in or out of downtown, take heed. Many surface streets and some interstate exits will be closed, mostly after 11 p.m.\n\nList of road closures: How to navigate closed roads, traffic after Taylor Swift concerts in downtown Indy\n\nA standalone rideshare pickup zone on South Street between Missouri and West streets will operate from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. Friday through Sunday.\n\nOnly Uber, Lyft and other rideshare drivers will be given access to this area. Rideshare drivers will have to drive down South West Street to pick up riders and then can either continue south, going under I-70, or travel westbound on Kentucky Avenue to get out of the zone.\n\n- Jade Jackson\n\nWhat surprise songs did Taylor Swift sing on N1?\n\nOn Night 1, Swift performed a mashup of \"The Albatross\" from \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and \"Holy Ground\" from \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" on the guitar.\n\nShe then performed a mashup \"Cold As You\" and \"Exile\" on the piano.\n\nShe was wearing the red and blue dress she wore the first time in Miami on Oct. 18.\n\nWhat surprise songs did Taylor Swift sing on N2?\n\nOn Night 2, Swift performed a mashup of \"The Prophecy\" from \"The Tortured Poets' Department\" and \"This Love\" from \"1989\" on the guitar.\n\nShe then moved to the piano, where she played a mashup of \"Maroon\" from \"Midnights\" and \"Cowboy Like Me\" from \"Evermore.\"\n\nTaylor Swift adds surprise songs: See all the songs she's played so far\n\nSee photos of Gracie Abrams from Eras Tour N1 at Lucas Oil Stadium\n\nLooking for things to do in Indianapolis?\n\nIndyStar reporters Holly V.

Her fans ...", "text": "Will Taylor Swift announce her next \"(Taylor's Version)\" album in Nashville this weekend? That's what sleuthing Swifties believe.\n\nFans of the beloved pop star often spend hours dissecting cryptic messages in songs, social media posts and performances that at times provide clues to the next chapter in her career. Now, these sharp-eyed followers bet on Swift announcing \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\" — an expanded re-recording of her 2010 album — when she returns this weekend for a three-night \"Eras\" tour stop in the city that helped launch her career.\n\nAre you ready for it?: Rain expected for Taylor Swift concerts in Nashville this weekend\n\nLet's get into the evidence (and this is complete speculation. We don't know if Swift plans to announce anything this weekend in Nashville):\n\nAt each show, Swift's touring team provides multi-colored wristbands that flash synchronized lights during the show. Some TikTok sleuths noted that the wristbands flash purple at the end of the show. The number of flashes depend on how many weekends remain until Swift brings \"Eras\" to Nashville, and followers believe purple represents Swift's \"Speak Now\" era.\n\nIn Tampa last month, Swift played \"Speak Now\" during the rotating song segment of her tour. According to NME, she told onlookers: “I’ve been thinking a lot about one of my albums recently. One of my albums has been on my mind a lot… Lots going on in my brain about it.”\n\nSwift signed off from her Atlanta tour stop last weekend with a post to social media post that read: \"Hey Nashville you're NEXT.\" The sentence included a purple heart emoji, which some believe to be the icing-on-the-cake indication that \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\" may be confirmed in Music City.\n\nNeed a break?

It’d be Swift’s first release since parting ways with Nashville label Big Machine Records last year.\n\nMaddie Gann, a 20-year-old Belmont student from Chicago, was among the fans on hand that morning. She had a final in venture management at 2 p.m. but couldn’t miss a chance to see Taylor.\n\n“I love her music, and she’s great to her fans so I know if she sees us she would come and talk to us and it’d be really great to talk to her,” Gann said.\n\nIf Taylor didn't appear, Gann said she would head to her test. “Then I’m gonna go take a final. It’s better to show up and not have anything happen then to have it happen and not be there.”\n\nMary Cooke Wiley came from work in MetroCenter when she saw the notifications about Swift.\n\n\"I had to leave.

The video was deleted shortly after sending Swifties into a frenzy.\n\nParamore is Swift's opening act as she makes her way through 18 European cities. During the live, the technical director cut to different tight shots of the instruments, wide shots of the massive set-up and medium shots of lead singer Hayley Williams owning the stage. The livestream was filtered through Restream.io, a company that enables Fortune 500 companies, media, politicians and celebrities to reach, engage and monetize their audiences.\n\nAlexander Khuda, Restream.io's CEO and co-founder, told Forbes Magazine in 2015 that his company delivers \"video content live to 30+ services like Youtube, Twitch and Ustream simultaneously.

Joining them is civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn and Bezos' fiancée Lauren Sánchez.\n\nWhen the crew of six women get off the ground as early as Monday morning, they'll reach the edge of space on the company's 11th human spaceflight.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe trip will see them following in the footsteps of plenty of notable people, including household names like actor William Shatner and NFL legend Michael Strahan. Even Bezos, the founder of Amazon, took a trip on the New Shepard's maiden crewed voyage in 2021.\n\nHere's a look back at those three first spaceflights, along with a list of all 52 people who have so far booked passage with Blue Origin:\n\nBlue Origin launch: Gayle King, Katy Perry among crew of all women launching to space\n\nJeff Bezos launches with first crew of New Shepard\n\nThe New Shepard flew 15 times without a crew beginning in 2012 before Bezos joined the first human flight in 2021 to ride atop the rocket as part of NS-16.\n\nThe trip on July 20, 2021 coincided with the anniversary of the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing.\n\n\"Happy, happy, happy!\" Bezos said from space. \"You have a very happy crew up here!\"\n\n\"Best day ever,\" Bezos added after touchdown as he was greeted by a sea of cheering Blue Origin employees and others at the company's campus.\n\nBezos' flight made history in myriad ways, with female aviator Wally Funk, at 82 years old, becoming the oldest person at the time to reach the edge of space, and student Oliver Daemen, Blue Origin's first paying customer, becoming the youngest at 18 years old. Bezos and his brother Mark Bezos also became the first siblings to go to space together.\n\nWilliam Shatner becomes oldest person to reach space\n\nActor William Shatner surpassed Funk's milestone with his own Blue Origin trip later that same year on Oct. 13.\n\nBest known for his role in the original \"Star Trek\" series and the first six films in the \"Star Trek\" movie franchise, Shatner at 90 years old rocketed to space with five others.\n\nWhen the crew safely landed back on Earth several minutes later, Shatner could be heard saying the experience was \"unlike anything they described.\"\n\nShatner, now 94, also appeared the next day on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" where he expressed that the flight left him \"overwhelmed by all the things we need to do and the loves and the losses.\"\n\n\"It was an enormous moment for me that I never expected,\" he said while he appeared virtually.\n\nMichael Strahan flies on Blue Origin's 3rd human spaceflight\n\nMichael Strahan then flew on the company's third human spaceflight overall, and final of 2021 on Dec. 11.\n\nPrior to the flight, the former NFL defensive end told his \"Good Morning America\" co-hosts that after covering the first Blue Origin launch, he had been \"enamored\" with human space travel. He said Blue Origin approached him about booking his seat, and he didn't hesitate.\n\n\"It’s going to take a while, but I do believe it will bring a lot of technological breakthroughs and also innovations to us here on earth … and I just wanted to be a part of it,\" Strahan told his \"GMA\" co-hosts before the flight.\n\nAfterward, he took to Instagram to say \"it was surreal.\"\n\n\"It was unbelievable. It's hard to even describe it. It's going to take a little bit to process it.\"\n\nOther passengers on Blue Origin spaceflights\n\nA total of 56 tickets have been punched for flights on the New Shepard, including four people who were repeat passengers.\n\nThe spacecraft's most recent crewed flight was Feb. 25 on a mission known as NS-30.

What to know about 'planet parade'", "text": "Stargazers who have heard of an amazing planetary alignment coming later in January may be in for a letdown if they look up at the night sky expecting to be dazzled.\n\nYes, six planets will be visible in the January night sky. And yes, they'll be in a line.\n\nBut because planets always appear in a line from our Earth-bound vantage, the alignment isn't anything out of the norm. What's less common, according to astronomers, is seeing so many bright planets at once.\n\nHere's what to know about this month's so-called planetary parade, including how and where to see it.\n\nWill the planets align in January?\n\nThe planets in our solar system orbit the sun essentially along a line across the sky in a plane called the ecliptic.\n\nFor that reason, planets in our Earthly sky always appear somewhere along a line, according to EarthSky, a website dedicated to cosmic news. These events, while commonplace, are often referred to as planetary alignments.\n\nThe ecliptic is also the reason that we on Earth sometimes observe planets appearing to approach closely to each other in the sky \"while they careen around the cosmic racetrack,\" according to NASA.\n\nWhile alignments themselves aren't special, what could be noteworthy for stargazers is the six planets that will be visible this month – including four with the naked eye. Such an event is commonly known as a \"planet parade,\" though NASA noted that the moniker is not a technical astronomical term.\n\nWhat is a planet parade, and what will be visible?\n\nPlanet parades are how astronomers and stargazers refer to the events when the planets form a straight line and look like they're marching across the night sky, such as a similar parade that took place in June.\n\nIn January, four bright planets and two faint planets will be visible in the night sky.\n\nHere's a list of the planets that will be visible in some for this month:\n\n◾ Venus\n\n◾ Saturn\n\n◾ Jupiter\n\n◾ Mars\n\n◾ Uranus\n\n◾ Neptune\n\n\"These multiplanet viewing opportunities aren’t super rare, but they don’t happen every year, so it’s worth checking it out,\" NASA said in a rundown of January sky-watching tips.\n\nHow and when to see the planetary parade\n\nVenus and Saturn already had their close approach, called a \"conjunction,\" last week.\n\nBut all month after dark, spectators can find Venus and Saturn in the southwest for the first couple of hours, while Jupiter shines brightly high overhead and Mars rises in the east. All four planets will be visible to the naked eye.\n\nUranus and Neptune will also be around, but they won't be appearing as brightly and will require a telescope to see, according to NASA.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

For a time, the odds of impact fluctuated around 1% before suddenly jumping in recent days to 2.3%.\n\nThe unsettling odds are the highest any asteroid has had of impacting Earth in more than two decades since the infamous Apophis was first discovered and later ruled out as a threat. But astronomers still aren't too concerned yet about YR4, and they insist that you shouldn't be, either.\n\nIn the weeks, months and years ahead, space agencies around the world plan to monitor YR4 to better calculate a trajectory that more than likely will be harmless. And on the slim chance that the asteroid does indeed pose a threat, it may be time for Earth to implement its planetary defense strategies that agencies like NASA and the European Space Agency have spent years readying.\n\nWhat to know about 2024 YR4: Scientists taking 'active measures' for asteroid with slight chance of hitting earth.\n\nWhat is asteroid 2024 YR4 and why are scientists paying attention to it?\n\nAsteroid 2024 YR4 has been a source of alarm because it carries an uncommonly high risk of colliding into Earth – an event that would be catastrophic, even if it wouldn't cause a mass extinction.\n\nStill, among the more-than 37,000 known large space rocks, it's the only one right now with any chance of hitting Earth anytime soon.\n\nThe space rock was spotted late last year and reported on Dec. 27, 2024 to the Minor Planet Center, the official authority for observing and reporting new asteroids, comets and other small bodies in the solar system. The object eventually caught the attention of NASA and other astronomers when it rose on the U.S. Space Agency's Sentry Impact Risk Table, which tracks any known asteroids with a non-zero probability of hitting Earth.\n\nInitial projections gave the asteroid little more than a 1% chance of impacting Earth on Dec. 22, 2032. Asteroid 2024 YR4 also rated 3 of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, a method for astronomers to categorize and rate the threat of near-Earth objects.\n\nThe International Asteroid Warning Network also put out a list of possible impact locations, which ranges from uninhabited or sparsely populated areas to densely populated areas in the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, parts of Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.\n\nWhat are the latest odds of YR4 hitting Earth?\n\nAs additional observations came in, the risk of asteroid 2024 YR4 hitting Earth went up. Last week, the impact probability stood at 2.3%, according to NASA.\n\nThe asteroid will continue to be visible from Earth through April, giving astronomers some time to gather data with ground-based telescopes. While the asteroid won't again be observable from Earth until June 2028, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope will be able to study it in March from orbit.\n\n\"As more observations of the asteroid’s orbit are obtained, its impact probability will become better known,\" NASA said in a recent blog post. \"It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will be ruled out as an impact hazard, as has happened with many other objects.\"\n\nAmong those objects is Apophis, the cruise ship-sized asteroid first discovered in 2004.\n\nAsteroid 2024 YR4’s rating of 3 on the Torino Scale is the second-highest an asteroid has ever reached after the Apophis briefly hit a rating of 4. The risk of Apophis impacting Earth during its 2029 flyby even rose as high as 2.7% on the Sentry Impact Risk Table.\n\nIn the case of Apophis, further observations eventually allowed astronomers in 2021 to rule out the possibility of an impact when the asteroid makes a close flyby to Earth in 2029 and again in 2036.\n\nNASA, other space agencies build planetary defense from asteroids\n\nIn the coming years, both NASA and the European Space Agency plan to take advantage of the rare flyby by sending uncrewed spacecraft to observe Apophis.\n\nIt's one of the many plans the agencies have in place as part of a larger effort to build a defense to protect humanity from threats posed by asteroids and other inbound space rocks.\n\nIn September 2022, NASA demonstrated that it was possible to nudge an incoming asteroid out of harm's way by slamming a spacecraft into it as part of its Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART.\n\nLaunched in November 2021, DART traveled for more than 10 months before crashing into Dimorphos at roughly 14,000 mph. Though the tiny asteroid posed no threat to Earth, NASA had set out to test a method of redirecting threatening objects hurtling toward Earth.\n\nIn October, a craft from the European Space Agency is on the way to get an up-close look at the asteroid's remnants.\n\nNASA is additionally working on an asteroid-hunting telescope known as the NEO Surveyor to find near-Earth objects capable of causing significant damage. Set to launch no earlier than June 2028, the telescope is designed to discover 90% of asteroids and comets that are 460 feet in size or larger and come within 30 million miles of Earth’s orbit.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

In March, a group of famous women that included pop star Katy Perry and broadcast journalist Gayle King made headlines − and some controversy − for their highly publicized spaceflight.\n\nBut since then, the last two Blue Origin human spaceflights have not included any household names.\n\nThe passengers on the next mission, whose names Blue Origin announced Friday, June 13, are a group mostly conservationists and business leaders. Though a target date for the launch has not been made public, the mission was announced less than a month after the last Blue Origin human spaceflight got off the ground May 31.\n\nHere's everything to know about the upcoming mission, which would be New Shepard's 13th human spaceflight and 33rd overall.\n\nDoes Jeff Bezos own Blue Origin? What to know\n\nBillionaire Jeff Bezos, best known for founding Amazon, is the founder of the private space technology company Blue Origin.\n\nBezos himself even boarded Blue Origin's New Shepard for its maiden crewed voyage in July 2021, which came after the spacecraft flew on 15 flight tests beginning in 2012. For nearly four years since its first crewed mission, the New Shepard spacecraft has served as a powerful symbol of Blue Origin's commercial spaceflight ambitions amid a growing space tourism industry.\n\nIn addition to sending space tourists on brief joy rides to the edge of space, Blue Origin has also increasingly sought to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nBlue Origin's massive New Glenn rocket, which flew on its inaugural flight test in January, is also being developed for future spaceflights. At 320 feet tall, the spacecraft rivals SpaceX's 400-foot Starship in size.\n\nEven Amazon is competing with SpaceX by developing its own Kuiper internet satellite constellation in a direct challenge to Starlink.\n\nWhen is the next Blue Origin launch?\n\nBlue Origin New Shepard rocket launches take place from the company's private ranch facility known as Launch Site One. The facility is located 30 miles north of the town of Van Horn in Culberson County – more than 140 miles east of El Paso near the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nHowever, Blue Origin had not yet announced a target launch date at as Monday, June 16.\n\nWho is the crew of next Blue Origin mission?\n\nWhen the New Shepard gets off the ground again, the six people selected to board it will join 64 others who have flown on the spacecraft across 12 previous human spaceflights.\n\nHere's a look at the passengers:\n\nAllie Kuehner , an environmentalist who serves on the board of Nature is Nonpartisan, a nonprofit organization advocating for bipartisan solutions to environmental issues\n\n, an environmentalist who serves on the board of Nature is Nonpartisan, a nonprofit organization advocating for bipartisan solutions to environmental issues Carl Kuehner , who chairs Building and Land Technology, a real estate development, investment and property management firm\n\n, who chairs Building and Land Technology, a real estate development, investment and property management firm Leland Larson , a philanthropist and former CEO of School Bus Services and Larson Transportation Services – both family-owned public transportation businesses based in Oregon\n\n, a philanthropist and former CEO of School Bus Services and Larson Transportation Services – both family-owned public transportation businesses based in Oregon Freddie Rescigno, Jr. , CEO of Commodity Cables, an electrical company he founded in 2001\n\n, CEO of Commodity Cables, an electrical company he founded in 2001 Owolabi Salis , an attorney and a financial consultant\n\n, an attorney and a financial consultant Jim Sitkin, a retired lawyer from California\n\nWhat happens during a Blue Origin rocket launch?\n\nEach spaceflight on a New Shepard vehicle lasts about 11 minutes from liftoff to capsule touchdown.\n\nNamed after astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American in space, the 60-foot-tall New Shepard rocket is topped with the gum drop-shaped crew capsule. The spacecraft operates completely autonomously, meaning no pilots are aboard.\n\nDuring its ascent, the spacecraft reaches supersonic speeds surpassing 2,000 mph before the rocket booster separates from the crew capsule. At that point, those aboard the capsule become weightless as the spacecraft continues toward its highest point on its brief voyage above the Kármán Line – the 62-mile-high internationally recognized boundary of space.\n\nWhile experiencing a few minutes of microgravity, passengers have the opportunity to unstrap themselves from their seats to gaze out the capsule’s large windows and take in a stunning view of Earth.\n\nMeanwhile, the rocket booster heads back to the ground while firing its engines and using its fins to slow and control its descent to land about two miles from the launchpad.\n\nThe capsule itself eventually begins what Blue Origin refers to as a \"stable freefall” – plummeting back to Earth as three massive parachutes deploy and the capsule makes a soft landing in the desert, sending up plumes of dust.\n\nHow much does it cost to ride Blue Origin?\n\nIf you have dreams of blasting off to orbit on a Blue Origin spacecraft, you likely need to either have very deep pockets or a name that's recognizable enough to get you invited as an honored guest.\n\nThough Blue Origin does not publicly list prices on its website, a form to reserve a seat requires customers to agree to a $150,000 deposit alone.\n\nAnd if the price of the first ticket sold for a Blue Origin spaceflight in 2021 is any indicator, seats likely cost in the millions of dollars. The $28 million ticket price was the winning bid in an auction that included 7,600 people registered to bid from 159 countries.\n\nHowever, a select few passengers over the years have had their seats aboard New Shepard paid through grants and other funding methods from large institutions.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

How to watch Aquarids", "text": "The ETA Aquarids, one of the most anticipated meteor showers known for sending fiery balls of space debris flying across the sky, is set to peak this week.\n\nThe Aquarids (also sometimes spelled Aquardiis) meteors are created by debris left behind by the famous Halley's Comet that then fall to Earth, creating \"shooting stars\" that leave long glowing trails behind.\n\nThe meteor shower is one of the best astronomical viewing events of the year and can be seen across the globe, though those in the Southern Hemisphere are treated to the best view. Luckily, the event can still be seen from every U.S. state, giving stargazers one final chance to watch a shower until the next expected one in July.\n\nHere's what to know about the ETA Aquarids meteor shower, including what time to look up.\n\nWhen is the ETA Aquarids meteor shower peaking?\n\nThe Aquarids, which first became active April 19, are due to peak between May 5 and May 6 as Earth passes through the densest part of Halley's cosmic debris, according to the American Meteor Society. While the meteors won't be as bright or dazzling after the peak, stargazers should still be able to catch some of the light show until about May 28.\n\nWhat time can I see the Aquarids meteors?\n\nLike all meteor showers, the Aquarids are best viewed during the dark hours between midnight and dawn. According to NASA's Watch the Skies blog, the best time to view the peak starts at 2 a.m. on May 6 and lasts until dawn.\n\nTime and Date also provides detailed information about where and when to see the phenomenon based on your specific location.\n\nHow to See the Eta Aquarids\n\nThe Aquarids should be visible around the globe, anywhere in the sky, assuming clouds and a bright moon do not obscure the view.\n\nHowever, the meteors are best seen from the Southern Hemisphere. This is because the meteors seem to emerge, or radiate, from the constellation Aquarius, which is higher up in the sky in the Southern Hemisphere than it is in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, ETA Aquarid meteors appear as what NASA refers to as \"Earthgrazers,\" or long meteors that appear to skim the surface of the Earth at the horizon.\n\nSome more tips for getting a better look from NASA and Date and Time include:\n\nFind a viewing spot away from cities' light pollution and street lights. Get there in advance to settle and give your eyes time to adjust, which can take 15 to 30 minutes.\n\nLie down on the ground and look at the sky. You can use Date and Time's Interactive Meteor Shower Sky Map or the table above to find the direction of the radiant to look towards.\n\nBring a blanket, chair, comfortable clothes and maybe some snacks or drinks. Catching a meteor shower can be a waiting game.\n\nIf the moon is out, look at areas of the sky away from the moon to prevent its light from washing out the show.\n\nKnow the peak time and how many meteors you can expect to see per hour. You can check EarthSky’s meteor guide for that information.\n\nWhat is the ETA Aquarids meteor shower?\n\nMost meteor showers are the result of Earth passing through debris left by comets, explains NASA. These broken-up meteoritic materials fall to Earth and burn up in Earth's atmosphere, creating what we know as \"shooting stars.\"\n\nThis happens daily (NASA scientists estimate that 48.5 tons of material fall on Earth each day), and if you watch closely, you should be able to see a few per hour on an average night. When the number of meteors entering Earth's atmosphere increases significantly, that's what's called a meteor shower.\n\nMeteor showers are usually named after a star or constellation closest to where the meteors appear in the sky; in this case, Aquarius.\n\nThe debris that makes the ETA Aquarids meteors come from Halley’s Comet, which can only be seen from Earth once every roughly 76 years (the next time will be 2061). When it returns to the inner solar system, it leaves behind the rocky dust that eventually creates the ETA Aquarids meteor shower each May and the Orionids every October.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/06/27/fireball-meteorite-georgia-house-hit/84383016007/", "title": "Fireball, meteorite reported across Southeast US, Georgia house hit", "text": "A possible meteorite was sighted across multiple states in the southeastern U.S. on June 26.\n\nThe event coincided with reports of an \"earthquake,\" later identified as a sonic boom.\n\nA Henry County, Georgia resident reported damage to their home, believed to be caused by a piece of the object.\n\nA man in Henry County, Georgia reported rocky debris punching through his roof the same time reports of a fireball in the sky came in around noon on June 26 from North Florida to North Carolina.\n\nThe bright streak may have been a meteorite, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA resident in Henry County , southeast of Atlanta, reported a hole in their roof and rocky debris on their floor at the same time that reports of an \"earthquake\" were coming in.\n\n\"Did you feel that today?

It marks the start of the Pagan holiday Litha, also known as Midsummer, which is famously celebrated at the ancient Stonehenge ruins in Wiltshire, England, where many gather to herald the season.\n\nHere's what to know about the solstice.\n\nWhat is the summer solstice?\n\nThe summer solstice marks the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the longest day of the year. Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere will greet winter with its winter solstice.\n\nWhen is the summer solstice?\n\nThe summer solstice will take place on Friday, June 20, at 10:42 p.m. ET, according to Space.com.

Solstices are often associated with pagan religions and draw revelers of different faiths.\n\nPagans come by the thousands to Stonehenge, the prehistoric ruins of a monument built between approximately 3100 and 1600 BC in Wiltshire, England. It is one of the most famous landmarks in the U.K., but little is known about the civilization that built it or why, as these ancient peoples left no written records behind.\n\nIt was during the 20th century that Stonehenge became a site of religious significance to people who subscribed to New Age beliefs, including Neopaganism and Neo-Druids, according to USA TODAY's previous reporting. When constructed, the stone circle was aligned with the sun, and to this day, thousands of people gather to witness the moment the sun peeks perfectly through its pillars.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/11/13/congress-ufo-uap-hearing-2023/76249252007/", "title": "Congress UFO hearings: What's happened since July 2023 session?", "text": "More than a year has passed since elected leaders in Congress last heard from experts about mystifying objects outmaneuvering our military and claims of shadowy government programs to study alien spaceships.\n\nThe now-infamous congressional hearing was one filled with sensational claims about UFOs. Despite the government's rebranding of UFOs with a less-stigmatized acronym – unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP – the hearing still captivated a public long obsessed with ideas of flying saucers and little green men.\n\nSo, when military officers spent hours providing compelling testimony about not just strange craft whizzing unchecked through U.S. air space, but about a concerted effort of our government to capture and study those craft, the public was hooked.\n\nThe hearing served to reignite long-held public suspicions that the U.S. military and other high levels of government are suppressing information about extraterrestrial activity and galvanized a movement for transparency. Now that a little more than a year has gone by, the government has signaled that after years of secrecy, it's slowly coming around to the idea of sharing more information publicly.\n\nBut some lawmakers and advocates say it hasn't been enough. And now, they're on the verge of delving into the topic of UAP once again Wednesday.\n\nAhead of the next congressional hearing, here's what has happened since Congress' last foray into UFOs.\n\nWatch Wednesday's hearing\n\nUSA TODAY is providing a livestream of Wednesday hearing at the embed below:\n\nJuly 2023: Military officials testify about UFOs at last congressional hearing\n\nIn the July 2023 hearing, House members heard testimony from two former Navy pilots who came forward with information about objects routinely violating U.S. airspace.\n\nLt. Ryan Graves and Cmdr. David Fravor each provided accounts of specific incidents they had either witnessed over the years or heard about from other pilots they deemed credible. Some of the accounts they described were of aircrafts displaying capabilities they believed were beyond any known human technology.\n\nFravor himself was among Navy pilots who spotted the now-famous Tic Tac-shaped object that was captured in 2004 on video during a flight off the coast of Southern California. In testifying about the well-known sighting, Fravor described the oval object as \"perfectly white, smooth, no windows,\" and displaying flight capabilities that were unheard of.\n\nBut the most sensational part of the hearing came when former Pentagon intelligence official David Grusch offered testimony about an alleged shadowy \"multi-decade\" Pentagon program to retrieve and study not only downed spacecraft, but extraterrestrial pilots. Without offering hard evidence, Grusch accused the Pentagon under oath of being aware of extraterrestrial activity since the 1930s and hiding the program from Congress while misappropriating funds to operate it.\n\nThe Pentagon has repeatedly denied that such a program exists.\n\nAugust 2023: Pentagon unveils UFO website with declassified info\n\nWithin about two months of the hearing, the Pentagon's office to investigate UFOs revealed a new website for the public to access declassified information about reported sightings.\n\nThe site, operated by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) – a relatively new Pentagon program established to analyze UAP reports – also has a mechanism for military pilots to report sightings.\n\nMore than a year after launching, the site includes a handful of videos, some of which have been explained as commercial craft and some of which have been labeled as \"unresolved.\" Each video contains a short description with an explanation by AARO of where it was captured and what characteristics the object was exhibiting.\n\nThose who visit the site can also access an assortment of laws, memos, congressional briefings and press releases related to UAP.\n\nBut if you're going to the site to look for evidence of aliens, you'll be disappointed. In January, outgoing AARO director Sean Kirkpatrick – since replaced by Jon T. Kosloski – appeared on a podcast and made one thing clear:\n\n\"There is no evidence of aliens and there's no evidence of the government conspiracy,\" he said.\n\nSeptember 2023: NASA releases UAP report, appoints research head\n\nWeeks later, NASA released a long-awaited UFO report affirming that no evidence existed to confirm that alien spaceships have visited Earth.\n\nHowever, in what Administrator Bill Nelson described as a signal of the agency's transparency, NASA appointed a director of UAP research.\n\nBecause of the potential threat posed to national security and air safety, NASA embarked in 2022 on the space agency's first-ever study of UFOs, For the report, experts commissioned by the the space agency outlined ways in which NASA can partner with the U.S. government and private commercial organizations to better study and understand unidentified flying objects.\n\nLegislation aims to declassify records, make reporting easier\n\nIn the wake of the hearing, Congress has sought to take action in the form of bipartisan legislation to demystify UFOs for the public.\n\nLast December, President Joe Biden signed into law a watered-down version of a bill seeking the release of the executive branch's UFO records, which was included in an annual defense policy bill.\n\nHowever, lawmakers like Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) and many UFO transparency advocates derided the legislation as disappointment. While the measure directs the government to disclose to the public at least some records about UAP, it grants various agencies wide latitude in concealing certain information.\n\nDid America get 'ripped off'? UFO disclosure bill derided for lack of transparency\n\nThen, under a House bill introduced in January, commercial airline pilots who witness crafts flying through the skies in unexplainable ways would be able to report the UFO sightings to the federal government. Rep. Robert Garcia (D-California) and Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wisconsin) both sponsored the bill, which would create a mechanism for civilian pilots and other airline workers to report sightings to the the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nHowever, the bill appears to have since stagnated since its introduction.\n\nAlien renaissance in pop culture\n\nThe fiery Congressional hearing served to reignite a public obsession with UFOs that first came to focus after the infamous 1947 Roswell incident.\n\nIn the past year, Netflix released a docuseries. Brands like MoonPie jumped on the bandwagon. And conspiracy theories flourished. Even the tourism bureau in Lexington, Kentucky, capitalized on the craze with a tongue-in-cheek marketing campaign to encourage extraterrestrials to vacation in the city.\n\nThe idea that, absent any immediate logical explanation, strange crafts sighted whizzing through our skies must surely be alien visitors seems to only continue gaining momentum – even as astrophysicists caution that the absence of obvious natural explanations for UFOs doesn't make extraterrestrial ones likely.\n\nSome experts even see the UFO hoopla as \"a widespread societal problem.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Firefly Aerospace, the Texas-based company that built and is operating the spacecraft, was hired by NASA to carry a fleet of scientific instruments to the moon's Earth-facing side to study its environment ahead of plans for astronauts to return in the years ahead.\n\nThe landing precedes by just four days the planned arrival of a second uncrewed American spacecraft built and operated by Intuitive Machines. The space exploration company, also based in Texas, etched its name in the history books a year ago when its spacecraft, Odysseus, became the first commercially-built lunar lander in the U.S. to ever make it to the moon.\n\nIntuitive Machines' second lander, Athena, is targeting a Thursday, March 6 touchdown on the lunar south pole following a Feb. 26 launch from Florida.\n\nWere astronauts to step foot on the moon as early as 2027 under NASA's Artemis campaign, they'd be the first Americans to do so in five decades since the space agency's Apollo era came to an end in the 1970s.\n\nBut as nostalgic as humanity's return to the moon would be, NASA's lunar interests are far from being merely sentimental. Once astronauts can return to the moon – and uncrewed landers like Blue Ghost and Athena are considered vital in laying that groundwork – they'd then fuel up and prepare to continue onward to Mars.\n\n“This incredible achievement demonstrates how NASA and American companies are leading the way in space exploration for the benefit of all,” NASA acting Administrator Janet Petro said in a statement. “The technological and science demonstrations onboard Firefly’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 will improve our ability to not only discover more science, but to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments for future human exploration – both in the short term and long term.”\n\nFirefly Aerospace lands Blue Ghost spacecraft on moon\n\nAfter arriving more than two weeks ago to lunar orbit, the Blue Ghost lander, standing more than 6 feet tall, took about an hour to descend in the early Sunday hours. The landing, which NASA and Firefly both livestreamed, concluded by 3:34 a.m. EST with the spacecraft landing in an \"upright, stable configuration,\" Firefly Aerospace said on its mission blog.\n\nPowered by three solar panels, the spacecraft was designed to stick the landing with shock-absorbing feet, a low center of mass and a wide footprint, according to Firefly Aerospace.\n\nThe landing site is near a volcanic feature called Mons Latreille. The region is located within Mare Crisium, a 300-mile-wide basin in the northeast quadrant of the moon's near side, that is believed to have been created by early volcanic eruptions and flooded with basaltic lava more than 3 billion years ago.\n\n“Firefly is literally and figuratively over the moon,” said Jason Kim, the CEO of Firefly Aerospace in a statement. \"Our Blue Ghost lunar lander now has a permanent home on the lunar surface with 10 NASA payloads and a plaque with every Firefly employee’s name.\"\n\n'Literally, figuratively over the moon': Firefly's Blue Ghost lands on lunar surface\n\nLunar landing comes after 45-day trip through space\n\nThe landing concludes a more-than 2.8 million-mile journey that began Jan. 15 when Blue Ghost hitched a ride aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket for a launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on the historic launch pad 39A – the site of the space agency's Apollo moon mission launches.\n\nFirefly Aerospace has since been regularly providing online updates on the mission, which it's dubbed Ghost Riders in the Sky after the popular country song. Among those updates are many stunning images and videos Firefly has shared that the lander captured throughout its 45-day expedition.\n\nOn Jan. 27, Blue Ghost captured the first images of the moon in the distance days after it fired its engines in a critical burn to raise its apogee – the point when it is furthest from Earth in its orbit of the planet – as it prepared to enter the moon's orbit.\n\nThe lander also observed and documented the Earth eclipsing the moon – from its vantage, at least – and on Feb. 3 beamed back an incredible \"selfie\" with Earth in the background.\n\nBlue Ghost then captured some striking images of the moon shortly after it entered lunar orbit Feb. 13.\n\nLast week, Blue Ghost got a look of the moon's far side, an area not visible to Earth, that shows our planet rising and setting behind our celestial neighbor. Firefly Aerospace shared the imagery following Blue Ghost's maneuvers to get the spacecraft closer and closer to the lunar surface ahead of the landing.\n\nWhat's next for Blue Ghost lunar lander?\n\nNow that Firefly Aerospace's spacecraft has made it to the surface, it can begin its mission to deliver and help test a fleet of NASA's scientific instruments to study the moon's environment before humans return.\n\nThe 10 instruments Blue Ghost transported to the moon constitute what NASA said is the largest delivery to date under its Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS. The CLPS program allows the U.S. space agency to find lower-cost methods to finance lunar deliveries without having to develop spacecraft of its own, as it historically has done.\n\nThe technology will next be put to use for a complete lunar day, equivalent to about 14 Earth days.\n\nThe instruments Blue Ghost carries, many of which were tested in transit to the moon, are for things like lunar subsurface drilling, sample collection, X-ray imaging and dust mitigation. The data NASA hopes to collect should also provide insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect Earth.\n\nAdditionally, Blue Ghost plans to capture high-definition imagery of a total lunar eclipse as the Earth blocks the sun above the moon's horizon just before a lunar sunset ushers in frigid lunar night a couple days later. The total lunar eclipse will be visible to millions from Earth on March 13-14.\n\n“The science and technology we send to the moon now helps prepare the way for future NASA exploration and long-term human presence to inspire the world for generations to come,” Nicky Fox, associate administrator for science at NASA's headquarters in Washington, D.C. said in a statement. “We’re sending these payloads by working with American companies – which supports a growing lunar economy.”\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Ahead of the spacecraft, known as a sounding rocket, is a quick trip to space to study one of the most complex regions of the sun's atmosphere.\n\nHere's everything to know about soundings rockets and the upcoming NASA mission from New Mexico near the Texas border.\n\nNASA to launch sun-studying mission from New Mexico: Can you see it?\n\nThe upcoming launch of the sounding rocket is slated for Friday, July 18 at NASA's White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, located near the border of Texas about 60 miles north of El Paso.\n\nLiftoff is being targeted for 1 p.m. local time, a NASA spokesperson confirmed to the USA TODAY Network. Residents in the local area around White Sands may be able to see the sounding rocket and its contrail when it launches if the weather is clear, the spokesperson added.\n\nThe mission is expected to last no more than about 15 minutes, NASA said in a press release. After launching, the sounding rocket will take about 90 seconds to reach space and point toward the sun, another eight minutes to conduct the experiment on the chromosphere, and no more than five minutes to return to Earth’s surface.\n\nUpon landing, the rocket will drift between 70 to 80 miles from the launchpad so mission operators on the ground can ensure it will land safely in the large, empty desert, according to NASA.\n\nWhat are sounding rockets?\n\nNASA's sounding rocket program has for more than 40 years carried out missions to launch scientific instruments into space.\n\nSounding rockets are much smaller than an average spacecraft that may launch on an orbital flight from major spaceports like the Kennedy Space Center in Florida or the Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California.\n\nNASA's fleet of sounding rockets range anywhere in height from about 16 feet tall to about 70 feet tall. The Black Brant IX, the sounding rocket selected for the upcoming launch from New Mexico, stands nearly 60 feet tall.\n\nFor comparison, SpaceX's famous two-stage Falcon 9 rocket – one of the world's most active for both human and cargo missions alike – stands at 230 feet tall when fully stacked. And the commercial spaceflight company's Starship megarocket, which is still in development, stands at an imposing 400-feet tall when both the crew capsule and Super Heavy rocket booster are integrated.\n\nBecause of their diminutive stature, NASA says soundings rockets are ideal for quick trips at lower speeds to regions of space that are too low for satellites and other spacecraft to conduct observations. And because sounding rockets don't require expensive boosters, missions costs also tend to be substantially less than other orbiter missions, according to NASA.\n\nWhat does NASA launch from White Sands in New Mexico?\n\nOf the approximately 20 sounding rocket missions scheduled in the U.S. in 2025, most get off the ground from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska.\n\nOccasionally, though, a sounding rocket will launch from a missile range at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. The most recent mission at White Sands came Nov. 23, 2024 when NASA launched a Black Brant IX sounding rocket to test a spacecraft's performance in Earth's low-density magnetosphere.\n\nSpacecraft to study solar chromosphere\n\nFor its next mission from White Sands, a Black Brant IX sounding rocket will carry new technology to study the sun's mysterious chromosphere, located between the sun's visible surface, known as the photosphere, and its outer layer, the corona.\n\nThe corona, which became widely visible from Earth in April 2024 during a total solar eclipse, is a region where powerful solar flares and coronal mass ejections can erupt to cause space weather that can disrupt Earthly technologies.\n\nNASA's SNIFS mission aims to learn more about these events by observing how energy is converted and moves through the chromosphere to power such explosions.\n\nThe mission is the first to carry technology combining a standard imager to capture capture photos and videos with a spectrograph, which dissects light into its various wavelengths, according to NASA. This reveals which elements are present in the imaged light source.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Medical experts aren't buying it.\n\n\"You see these dramatic posts on social media where somebody looks like they have a frog neck and then all of a sudden they have this perfectly defined jawline,\" says plastic surgeon Dr. David Shafer. \"Whether that's also involving some selective editing, it's hard to tell.\"\n\nHere's why people online can't stop talking about mewing – and what you need to know about it.\n\nWhat is mewing?\n\nMewing is \"the process of placing the tongue at the roof of the mouth and applying pressure to cause bony changes in the jawline,\" says Dr. Catherine Chang, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and founder of NakedBeauty MD.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhy are people doing it? In short, because they want their jawlines to look more defined.\n\n\"Basically, it's a way of repositioning anatomy in your neck and lower face,\" Shafer says. \"When you look in the mirror, you can practice and push your tongue up in the roof of your mouth and pull underneath your chin up to make it look slimmer. You can see a difference. When we're taking a picture, people consciously or subconsciously do it.\"\n\nBelow is a video of how it's done. Though some on social media have claimed to achieve dramatic results, experts warn against believing everything you see on the internet.\n\nWhy mewing is controversial\n\nThe term \"mewing\" was coined by British dentist John Mew and his son, Mike Mew. They preached the idea of altering face shapes and jawlines through facial exercises, though most dentists agree in denouncing their claims – one dentist told The New York Times that Mew was \"a total idiot.\"\n\nThe elder Mew, who founded the London School of Orthotropics, stepped down in 2017 after losing his license from the General Dental Council in the U.K. \"on grounds of misconduct for publicly denigrating the traditional practices of orthodontic tooth movement,\" according to the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.\n\nThe younger Mew is currently awaiting results from a General Dental Council hearing held earlier this month after treatments for 2-year-old and 6-year-old patients were deemed \"inappropriate and/or misleading,\" per hearing documents.\n\nDoes mewing actually work?\n\nExperts say it makes sense that everyone is thinking more about their lower face right now – \"for the last three years, we've all been on Zoom,\" Shafer says, noting his office has seen a large spike in appointments for neck liposuction and chin or jaw augmentations.\n\nMewing is viewed online as a free alternative to plastic surgery or orthodontia, which can cost up to tens of thousands of dollars. But those in the industry say the results aren't what they're made up to be. And even the Mews originally intended for the treatment to focus on children, not fully-developed adults.\n\nFortunately, experts say there aren't any major negative side effects to mewing – \"except being disappointed,\" Chang says. \"If it’s too good to be true, it generally is.\"\n\nIf your goal is to look different while taking a single photo, mewing is a quick fix. But those hoping it can bring about the same kind of sustained change as surgery are mistaken.\n\n\"If it's not something you're going to be disciplined and keep up with, then you're not going to see sustained or long-term results and it's definitely a result that will go away once you stop doing the motion,\" Shafer says. \"It's not something that's risky. It's not something that's going to cause you harm. (But) I think people need to have guarded expectations.\"\n\nMore on social media and viral beauty trends\n\nAnd: Natalia Dyer, that controversial TikTok and when cosmetic 'advice' backfires\n\nEverybody wants to influence the world: Inside the fame, money and evolution of influencers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2021/05/23/ombre-lips-beauty-experts-how-to-create-two-toned-lipstick/5174178001/", "title": "National Lipstick Day 2021: Experts on how to create two-toned lips", "text": "Why settle for just one lipstick shade when you can wear two?

If you’re reflecting on old selfies and questioning how you ever thought overlined or over-plucked eyebrows were fashionable, you may be a victim of a phenomenon coined by TikTok users as “eyebrow blindness.”\n\nWhat is eyebrow blindness?\n\nEyebrow blindness doesn’t mean that you can’t see how your brows actually look on your face, but that you chase the next trend rather than thinking of what works for your own features, according to Cassandra Bankson, a medical esthetician and YouTube skin care personality.\n\nBankson describes eyebrow blindness as “being blind to something that is trendy,\" but \"not necessarily good for long-term health or beauty.” TikTok users have gone viral for sharing that they were oblivious to how awful their eyebrows looked as they mindlessly followed arching, filling in and plucking trends.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n“Instead of defining beauty for ourselves or leaning into our diversity, it's wanting to become a cookie-cutter image of beauty,” Bankson says.\n\nDo you have eyebrow blindness?\n\nRushing to follow microtrends without investigating your personal motives can be a telltale sign of eyebrow blindness.\n\n“Ask yourself, am I just doing what I see is popular on social media?” Bankson says. “Am I actually choosing beauty looks that make me feel good, or are you just looking at what the Kardashians are doing to their eyebrows and laminating them in the same way?”\n\nHow to curb eyebrow blindness\n\nBankson recommends always consulting with an expert before proceeding with a treatment, procedure, or drastic change. Alternatively, technology can help you “test” your look before committing to bleaching your brows or grabbing the tweezers. With increased accessibility to photo imaging tools, it’s easy to use photo editing to avoid beauty mishaps.\n\nBoard-certified dermatologist Dr. Dina Strachan says eyebrow blindness may not be something you can identify at the moment. Instead, she advises people to weigh the pros and cons before making changes to their personal appearance, especially if they are considering permanent alterations like tattooing or laser hair removal.\n\n“You're always going to have a different opinion as you go through your trajectory of life,” Strachan says. “You don't want to necessarily commit yourself to (a trend) that might change.”\n\nWhat does the ‘eyebrow blindness’ trend say about changing beauty standards?\n\nThe constant shift in microtrends also signifies the inability of women to keep up with ideal beauty standards. Participation in the trend isn’t a symbol of blindness, but actually of a hypersensitivity to how well we fit into the ideal beauty standard.\n\nOther trends like “money-piece blindness,” “blush blindness” and “lip blindness” have since emerged, showing how easy it is to fall susceptible to ever-changing trends.\n\nWhat is 'mewing'? People on TikTok are 'mewing.' Experts weigh in on this controversial beauty hack\n\nBankson and Strachan have seen a recent increase in cosmetic procedures and treatments that may lead to negative health effects in the future – particularly with lip fillers, which Bankson calls “the eyebrow blindness of tomorrow.’\n\nStrachan says it’s important to keep in mind that trends change.\n\n“We look at old hairstyles, shoulder pads and makeup trends, especially if they’re a little bit more to the extreme, and it always looks funny later,” Strachan adds. “That’s just human nature and the nature of fashion.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/beauty/2025/02/13/morning-shed-skincare/78415807007/", "title": "Morning shed: Trend encourages elaborate nightly skincare routine", "text": "In a TikTok video that has garnered more than 2.6 million views, Kristina Dmytrenko removes layer after layer of beauty product from her face as part of a viral skincare trend known as the \"morning shed.\"\n\nThe trend, which gained traction on TikTok last summer, features content creators − typically young women − removing a variety of skincare products, like face masks, mouth tape, hair bonnets and chin straps, to reveal glowing skin and flawless hair after a night's sleep. Creators \"shed\" these products off in the morning − hence the name.\n\nThe trend rides the wave of the prevalence of multi-step skincare routines, which have become increasingly popular over the past decade, especially among girls and young women. In these routines, several skincare products are used to cleanse, exfoliate, moisturize and tone the face. The result? Radiant skin − at least as far as content creators are concerned.\n\nThe idea, Dmytrenko and many other creators said, is \"the uglier you go to sleep, the prettier you wake up.\"\n\nBut not all agree.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nBeauty writer and critic Jessica DeFino said she finds the trend \"really sad,\" feeling like it is a \"real encroachment on the dream space, the relaxation space.\"\n\nTo dive in, here's why some people are taking part in the \"morning shed\" and why others wish to stay away.\n\nWhy are women 'shedding'?\n\nDmytrenko, 28, said she began \"morning shedding\" after learning about the routine last year.\n\n\"Seeing girls wake up with the most glowy skin made me want to give it a try,\" she said. \"I decided to do the morning shed because lathering my face in products, then just going to sleep and letting the products work while I sleep seemed a lot more efficient that sitting around, waiting for the products to work while I was awake.\"\n\nUSA TODAY video producer Kendall Malinchock also has a morning shed routine. She said initially, she thought adding more products to a nightly skincare routine seemed silly, but once she saw the results, she was convinced.\n\nMalinchock commits to a full morning shed two to three times a week, as it takes her about 20 minutes to put blowout rollers in her hair, secured with a silk bonnet; apply an overnight facemask and mouth tape; rub castor oil on her stomach; add a foot mask with fuzzy socks; and finally, put on a silk eye mask.\n\n\"I truly view it as a way to destress and take a moment for myself to wind down from the long day,\" Malinchock said. \"I find that this nighttime routine of prep actually helps my body's internal clock know that it's about time to go to sleep.\"\n\nDeFino, on the other hand, finds the \"morning shed\" to be a continuation of societal beauty standards placed on women and gender non-conforming people.\n\n\"Not even when you're asleep can you forget about all the societal pressures and meeting a particular standard of beauty,\" she said. \"Even during this time when you're not conscious you have to take pains and precautions before you slip away into unconsciousness to make sure you're maximizing and optimizing that time so that you wake up as beautiful as possible.\"\n\nWhat products are typically a part of a 'morning shed' routine?\n\nThough a morning shed differs per person, there tend to be a few commonly used products: face masks, mouth tape, hair curlers and bonnets, eye masks and chin straps.\n\nMouth tape is a skin-safe tape that is placed over the mouth to prevent mouth breathing during sleep. While it has not been proven to help a specific health issue, there are benefits of nose breathing. Breathing through the nose filters allergens and debris, unlike the mouth, and it makes the air one breathes more humid, keeping the throat moist, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nMalinchock said she uses The Skinny Confidential's mouth tape. The tape is made from rayon and spandex to stretch over the mouth. The tape also features a small slit in the middle, allowing wearers to breathe slightly through their mouths, if necessary.\n\nBut mouth tape isn't for everyone. People who are sick, have consumed alcohol, are obese, deal with heart or lung problems or have sleep apnea should not use mouth tape, according to WebMD.\n\nAnother popular morning shed item is a chin strap, which claims to prevent mouth breathing. A stretchy strap is placed over the entire head, fitting under and over the chin, around the ears and over the top of the head, holding the jaw in place. Like mouth tape, chin straps have not been proven to aid any specific health conditions.\n\nDeFino said she has never tried a morning shed and doesn't plan to. As for her nightly skincare routine, she washes her face with jojoba oil, which can sooth skin and unclog hair follicles, and manuka honey, an anti-inflammatory.\n\n\"Then I leave it completely bare when I go to sleep,\" she said.\n\nWhat happens to our skin when we sleep?\n\nThe science of skin and sleep is \"so incredible,\" DeFino said.\n\n\"When you're sleeping, your skin goes out of defense mode. When you're walking around all day, the skin is constantly bombarded with outside aggressors, whether that's sunlight, pollution, just all of the things around us. I'd even say our cosmetic chemicals are a part of that bombardment,\" she said. \"When you go into bed, the skin enters into this regeneration mode. It takes time off from those defenses it's had throughout the day and it really starts to regenerate, repair.\"\n\nAccording to Healthline, during sleep, the skin's blood flow increases and the organ rebuilds its collagen (the building block protein for skin, muscles and bones) and repairs damage from the aggressors DeFino mentioned.\n\nMulti-step skincare routines. DeFino said, are \"nonsensical.\"\n\n\"The application of all of these over-the-top necessary products is damaging our skin barrier,\" DeFino said. \"We can even see that reflected in the skin barrier boom in the skincare industry. We've all really damaged our faces and now the industry that has been responsible for this damage is swooping in and saying, 'No, just add a barrier repair cream.'\"\n\nThe skin barrier is the dead, outer layer of skin which protects the living skin underneath. Though its often likened to a brick wall, the skin barrier can be damaged, leaving our living skin vulnerable. Different aggressors can damage a person's skin barrier, including harsh chemicals and soaps and strong exfoliates, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nWhat kind of skincare should we be using?\n\nThough an across-the-board recommendation can't really be shared because everyone's skin has different needs, Cleveland Clinic Dermatologist Melissa Piliang recommends a few key steps that can work for anyone.\n\nFirst, use a mild, soap-free cleanser with warm water. Soap may sound like a good thing, Piliang wrote for the Cleveland Clinic, but it can actually damage the skin barrier. And avoid over cleansing.\n\nDifferent beauty trends over the years have encouraged people to wash their face for 60 seconds to ensure the products are soaked in completely, but this isn't necessary.\n\nPiliang wrote that the best way to cleanse the face is to massage in the cleanser and then immediately wash it off. There's no benefit to leaving it on longer, she said.\n\nFinally, Piliang encouraged for people to keep their skin moisturized and wear sunscreen to help protect the skin barrier even further.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

My internet addiction is both a blessing and a curse, but it's one that's enabled me to develop a strong shopping radar and sniff out the trendiest TikTok products that are actually worth the hype—and backed by very real reviews.\n\nTo help guide you in the direction of your next favorite TikTok-approved purchase I'll be coming to you every Friday with a breakdown of the week's most viral TikTok products, including reasoning behind why certain items are trending, what professional shoppers (like myself) really think about them and why they deserve a spot in your online shopping cart.\n\nIn this week's installment, I take a look at viral items like the infamous Trader Joe's mini totes (now available in new colors), a genius product hack for your next home renovation project and the polarizing beef tallow skincare staple that's super effective (albeit a little weird).\n\nShop this week's most viral TikTok products\n\n1. Anthropologie just dropped new Icon Juice Glasses for spring\n\nAnthropologie Icon Juice Glass Get the Anthropologie Icon Juice Glass in new spring designs before they inevitably sell out! Get the Anthropologie Icon Juice Glass in new spring designs before they inevitably sell out! $16 at Anthropologie\n\nAnthropologie's Icon Juice Glass is truly the gift that keeps on giving. Each new season, the brand drops the TikTok-viral glass in a bevy of new iterations, all inspired by the most prominent designs and colors of the season. Devout Anthro shoppers (like myself) have been eagerly awaiting for the retailer's spring launches, and have been pleasantly surprised to see a number of new Icon Juice Glass styles on the site this week.\n\nMy verdict? As someone who loves hosting a themed dinner party, these are the absolute best glasses to have on hand for every occasion or season—I know, because I have a pretty large assortment myself.

Ice bath mania has officially peaked, with TikTok users investing in their own models for at-home use. The IceDoo Recovery Pod remains one of the app's most popular models at the moment, but one scroll through the #IceBath tag on TikTok will introduce you to a range of options.\n\nMy verdict? With an under-$100 price tag, you really can't beat the Amazon deal on this top-rated ice bath. Plus, I'm all for atypical wellness practices that can transform your health, especially when they have the cosign of my favorite athletes (hi, Serena Williams).\n\nIs wellness your goal?

Revamp your skincare routine and remedy even the toughest dry spots with this popular TikTok product. $30 at Amazon\n\nBy now, you've probably heard all about the craze surrounding beef tallow skincare—or at least seen it play out on your TikTok feed. The video explainers, the surge in beef tallow beauty products—the ingredient has quickly reached hyaluronic acid-levels of popularity online, with users raving about its naturally hydrating properties and ability to revive even the driest skin. This Heart and Homestead Handmade Whipped Tallow Balm has emerged as one of the TikTok trend's most viral products, with over 20,000 bought last month on Amazon alone.\n\nMy verdict? Never in my life did I think that my skincare routine would (unironically) revolve around snail mucin, beef tallow and goat milk—but alas, TikTok trends have led me into some seriously bizarre corners of the beauty world. And as skeptical as I was about trying this product in particular (or really any beef tallow skincare for that matter), the balm has worked total wonders on my skin, especially in areas where I'm more prone to peeling or flakiness—like my elbows or ankles. Trust me: You need this in your skincare arsenal for summer.\n\n4. Shoppers are obsessed with this peel-and-stick tile for home renovating\n\nNexus Self Adhesive 12-Inch Vinyl Floor Tiles With these genius vinyl floor tiles, you don't need to be a home renovation master in order to upgrade your space and give it a fun refresh for spring.

Rather than fully gutting their spaces, users are relying on these Nexus Vinyl Floor Tiles to upgrade their home without the price commitment (or hassle) of a proper restoration. The peel-and-stick tiles make it easy to redecorate the backsplash in a kitchen or the flooring in a bathroom, even for those who are working on a tighter budget.\n\nMy verdict? With over 22,000 rave reviews on Amazon's site, these peel-and-stick vinyl tiles are a dream solution for renters (like myself) who struggle with committing to more permanent renovation projects (also me) and don't have the budget to finance them in this economy anyway (it's me again).

The famous Trader Joe's mini totes are back in stock—and in pastel colors\n\nTrader Joe's Mini Pastel Canvas Tote Bags Stock up on the TikTok-viral Trader Joe's mini Easter totes while they're still in stock. Stock up on the TikTok-viral Trader Joe's mini Easter totes while they're still in stock. $3 at Trader Joe's\n\nOf all the viral TikTok products that are trending this week, the Trader Joe's mini tote has undoubtedly gotten the most traction online. While Trader Joe's canvas bags certainly aren't new, this week, the retailer relaunched the cute accessory in a slew of new spring colors—including pastel pink, green and a lavender purple. The Trader Joe's bag drop (unsurprisingly) caused mayhem both in stores and online, as shoppers rushed to get their hands on the coveted reusable totes.\n\nMy verdict? You can never have too many tote bags, especially when they're made from a durable canvas material that's designed to last—as this one is. I love using these types of bags for grocery shopping or whenever I'm running errands, and these new shades feel like such a fun departure from the branded colorways of past Trader Joe's totes. While the new pastel-hued mini totes are pretty much sold out everywhere, you can still try your luck in-store or opt for the original tote at Amazon!\n\nCan't find the pastel mini tote?

Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\n\nCNN —\n\nYears of long hours, understaffed companies and burned-out employees have all led to the latest TikTok trend: quiet quitting.\n\nThe catchphrase quiet quitting is misleading, however, making some people think it means workers doing the bare minimum at their jobs.\n\nThis is unequivocally false, said Kathy Caprino, a Connecticut-based women’s career and leadership coach and author of “The Most Powerful You: 7 Bravery-Boosting Paths to Career Bliss.”\n\n“It’s about stopping doing work that people think is beyond what they were hired to do and not getting compensated for,” she said.\n\nEmployees still excel at their jobs, but they aren’t working overtime to do it, former engineering consultant Paige West told CNN.\n\n“While I was in my 9-to-5 job, I was still working my 40 hours a week. I was still fulfilling my job duties. I was just taking away that feeling of stress I had,” she said.\n\nThe drastic workforce shift during the pandemic largely brought on the rise of this behavior, said S. Chris Edmonds, founder and CEO of The Purposeful Culture Group, a Colorado-based consultancy that helps senior leaders create a positive work culture.\n\nCompanies have pushed additional responsibilities on employees because some organizations were unprepared for the pandemic and great resignation, he said.\n\nMany people were also frustrated when managers insisted on certain rules like going back to in-person work, which created more burnout and frustration, Edmonds said.\n\nOnly 24% of Americans thought their managers had their best interests at heart, according to a Gallup poll released in March 2022.\n\nQuietly dropping some of your work tasks you think are beyond your description is not a sustainable solution, but there are other ways to achieve what you want, Edmonds said.\n\nEvaluate your priorities\n\nIn order to set boundaries in your career, you need to learn what your boundaries are, said Octavia Goredema, career coach and author of “Prep, Push, Pivot: Essential Career Strategies for Underrepresented Women.”\n\n“The fastest way to burn out is if you don’t respect what matters most to you,” she said.\n\nFor some, that may be clocking out of work on time instead of staying two hours later, Goredema said.\n\nEmployees should ask themselves what tasks make them feel fulfilled and which ones don’t matter as much, she said.\n\nFrom there, you can home in on what your priorities are and what you need to be fulfilled in your career, Goredema said.\n\nShare your needs\n\nAfter you determine what you need your position to be for you to be successful and happy in your role, it’s best to speak with your manager to gain some understanding, Edmonds said. Communication is key.\n\nYou may have one idea of what your job responsibilities are, and your boss may have another, Caprino said. If you stop doing some tasks because you feel they’re outside your scope, it could look like you’re slacking if your manager thinks those are part of your job, she said.\n\n“Even running my own team, if I suddenly stopped doing work that everyone assumes I’d be doing, there would be trouble and things would fall through the cracks,” Caprino said.\n\nIf you’re aiming to get fairly compensated for any additional work you’ve taken on, present facts to your manager about your job performance and what you’ve accomplished so far, she said.\n\nReach out to your employees\n\nFrom the manager’s perspective, it’s important to understand your employees and make sure they feel supported in their respective roles, Edmonds said.\n\n“The responsibility of employers is to find out what people perceive as fair, then don’t do anything less than that,” he said.\n\nLeaders should focus on engaging in regular conversations and building relationships with their employees, Edmonds said.\n\nTalks could expand beyond work to include some of their personal interests and priorities because that can often affect their work life, Caprino said.\n\n“If you don’t understand the internal state of your employees, things are going to happen that you’re going to be blindsided by,” she said.\n\nManagers should consider setting up one-on-one meetings with their workers at least once a quarter, Goredema said.\n\n“We have to show that we are committed as leaders, that we’re involved and that we’re invested,” she said.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2021/12/11/glute-pumping-lip-plumping-skin-smoothing-viral-tiktok-trends-insist-body-always-something-improve-w/6454863001/", "title": "Glute pump, lip plumping: TikTok trends and body image harms", "text": "The body is a project. Just look at TikTok. Videos on #glutepumping are at 82 million views, #lipplumping has more than 300 million and #skintok 1.7 billion.\n\nLook at the beauty companies, part of a billion-dollar industry that thrives because we believe not so much in the products they sell, but in the legitimacy of the problem they're trying to solve – we don't look young enough or taut enough or perfect enough.\n\nLook at gyms and personal trainers, which exist ostensibly to promote health, but profit because we feel we must morph our bodies to suit what's in style, currently in unnatural ways – large butts and small waists, thick thighs with \"thigh gaps\" (the trick being that much of this isn't actually achieved in the gym, but by costly surgical procedures).\n\nBeauty standards are not new, but sociologists who study the body say they may be changing more rapidly, insisting more fervently that we constantly adjust to them. These trends are exacerbated by social media's pressure to present our bodies and lives in ways that deny messy realities and are aided by democratized access to technology, like Facetune, that helps us easily rid our bodies of natural imperfections.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"What is novel is that now, body shape ideals change as quickly as fashions in hairstyles,\" said Cary Gabriel Costello, an associate professor of sociology and director of LGBTQ+ Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. \"In the aughties, people plucked or lasered their eyebrows into thin arches. Now those same people 'have to' go get microblade eyebrow tattoos to have the lush eyebrow look approved today. Every few years now, celebrities and influencers have to go get new plastic surgical procedures on their faces, because if they don't, everyone will see they are wearing an outdated facial style. And before the 21st century, that sentence would sound like science fiction – dystopian science fiction at that.\"\n\nIf the body is a project, can it ever be complete?\n\nBeauty ideals shift for each generation, but a standard always remains\n\nThe culture has shifted toward greater visibility for more diverse bodies, which sociologists say can be viewed as a positive change for inclusivity, but which may not be enough to stop people from feeling compelled to keep up with trends.\n\nUCLA sociology professor Abigail Saguy says expansive beauty standards can be freeing but still present traps.\n\n\"For whatever body type a lot of women are going to think is impossible or unattainable, there's going to be some other woman for whom that body type is their body. It can be really liberating for it to be in fashion,\" said Saguy, but she noted it's a problem when the transitory nature of beauty ideals leaves people uncomfortable when their bodies aren't in fashion.\n\nStandards of beauty evolve. Costello points to the differences between Gen X teens and Gen Z teens. In the 90s, thin was ideal. Big butts, while appreciated by some, were mocked in mainstream culture.\n\nJust a few decades later, Gen Z teens are experiencing what Costello calls a pursuit of the \"thicc\" form – big, firm butts and thighs with small waists. Thicker lips, too. Glute pumping (which uses resistance exercise to increase blood flow to the butt), Brazilian butt lifts and butt implants all relate to the trends of which the Kardashians have become figureheads.\n\n\"This aesthetic is ostensibly more 'multiethnic,' and less Eurocentric, which sounds like an improvement. But it can also be viewed as an appropriation by white people of features typical of Black and brown people – with white people getting all of the benefit and none of the discrimination when taking on these trending looks,\" Costello said.\n\nWhat about body positivity?\n\nBody positivity was positioned as the alternative to beauty ideals: Love your body at any size and any shape. But some experts argue that despite the movement's success in expanding visibility for more diverse bodies, and occasionally showing truly authentic ones (wrinkles, pimples, cellulite, ingrown hairs), many body positive influencers may be perpetuating their own kind of damage, as Costello notes their aesthetic is so often a lie. He points to the \"no makeup\" trend.\n\nLizzo criticized body positivity: Here's what you need to know about body neutrality\n\n\"The supposed message is to celebrate body positivity by asserting to social media users that they can be beautiful just the way they are, since the celebrities are beautiful without makeup. But in reality, the influencers are often wearing subtle 'no-makeup makeup' – and that's just the tip of the iceberg,\" he said. \"They have spent tens of thousands of dollars, or hundreds of thousands, or more, on plastic surgeries, and lip-plumpers, and line-fillers, and Botox, and implants, and extensions, and skin peels and body lifts.\"\n\nWhen regular people take off their makeup and don't look like celebrities or influencers, they wonder what's wrong with them.\n\nCostello said people of all genders feel anxiety about their bodies – but men to a lesser degree, because they are defined more by their accomplishments than their looks.\n\nThe exception, gender study experts say, is queer men. A 2016 study found gay men are much more likely than heterosexual men to report feeling pressure to look attractive and to desire cosmetic surgery.\n\nWomen are especially susceptible to these anxieties, as their worth has long been associated with their appearance, creating pressure to achieve the current culturally desirable look. Trans and nonbinary people face even more pressure around the management of their appearance than cisgender people, because society is constantly policing their bodies.\n\n'How does my body feel?'\n\nStandards of beauty are still largely driven by celebrity and influencer culture, made up of those often privileged enough to afford the interventions necessary to not only meet the current beauty standard, but to adopt the next one. Many people driving these trends are reluctant to admit the surgeries and procedures they use to achieve their looks. When ordinary people try to do the same, they're often left disappointed or ashamed.\n\nBeauty standards are also maintained by a consumer capitalist culture, which profits off people's desire to constantly improve.\n\n\"Under consumer capitalism, it's necessary to get people to buy more and more things, in order to increase profits and expand the economy,\" Costello said. \"And it turns out that a great way to do that is to make people feel shame about something, then offer to sell them a product that will supposedly reduce that.\"\n\nSaguy said her hope is for people to focus less on how their bodies appear, and more on what their bodies can do. That, she said, can be a worthier project.\n\n\"It's important to focus less on the visual and more on, 'how does my body feel?,\" she said. \"We look in the mirror to make sure there's nothing in our teeth, but other than that, hopefully, we're outward-facing.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/perspectives/jobs-recession-federal-reserve", "title": "Opinion: The Fed doesn't have a choice anymore.

On the one hand, GDP growth has slowed significantly, and some argue, even entered a recession. On the other hand, overall employment growth has been much stronger than normal.\n\nWhile GDP declined at an annualized rate of 1.1% in the first half of 2022, the US economy added 2.3 million jobs in the last six months, far more than in any other six-month period in the 20 years prior to the pandemic.\n\nThis tight labor market – and the rapid wage growth it has spurred – is causing inflation to become more entrenched.

The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimate for real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2022 is 2.3%, suggesting that while the economy is now growing much more slowly than it did last year, we are still not in a recession. When the demand for goods and services strengthens, so does the demand for workers producing these goods and services.\n\nSecond, despite the slowing of the economy and the growing fears of recession, layoffs are still historically low. Initial claims for unemployment insurance, an indicator highly correlated with layoffs, were 219,000 for the week ended October 1 – higher than the week prior, but still one of the lowest readings in recent decades. After years of increasingly traumatic labor shortages, many employers are reluctant to significantly reduce the number of workers even as their businesses are slowing. That’s because companies are worried that they will have trouble recruiting new workers when they start expanding again.\n\nThird, many industries are growing faster than normal because they are still recovering from the pandemic. Convention and trade show organizers, car rental companies, nursing homes and child day care services, among others, are all growing fast because they are still well below pre-pandemic employment levels.\n\nFourth, just as some industries are growing because they are still catching up, others are experiencing high growth as they adjust to a new normal of higher demand. Demand for data processing and hosting services, semiconductor manufacturing, mental health services, testing laboratories, medical equipment and pharmaceutical manufacturing is higher than before the pandemic. And it’s likely that these represent structural changes to buying patterns that will keep demand high.\n\nFifth, during the pandemic, corporate investments in software and R&D reached unprecedented levels, which drove a rapid increase in new STEM jobs. Because these workers are especially well paid, they have had plenty of disposable income to spend on goods and services, which has supported job growth throughout the economy.\n\nThese factors are spurring positive momentum that will not disappear overnight. Employment growth is likely to slow down from its historically high rates, but it will still remain solid in the coming months. ManpowerGroup’s Employment Outlook Survey shows that the hiring intentions for the fourth quarter are still very high, despite dropping from the previous quarter.\n\nNext year, however, will look very different. Many of the industries that are still recovering from the pandemic will have reached pre-pandemic employment levels. With demand saturated, those industries may revert to slower hiring. But this alone is unlikely to push job growth into negative territory. What will do that is monetary policy.\n\nThere are two ways to rein in the labor market: Either reduce demand for workers or increase the labor supply. But it’s hard to engineer a boost in labor supply. That takes the kind of legislative action needed to increase immigration, drive people into the labor force or grow investment in workforce training. This is likely to prove elusive in today’s polarized political environment.\n\nThe only option that leaves the Fed is to engineer a recession by continuing to raise interest rates. Expect to see that happen in 2023.", "authors": ["Opinion Gad Levanon For Cnn Business Perspectives"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2022/12/29/buccal-fat-removal-latest-controversial-plastic-surgery-trend/10950814002/", "title": "'Buccal fat removal' is the latest controversial plastic surgery trend", "text": "On TikTok, millions are being exposed to homogenous images of what modern beauty is supposed to be. Instead of round full faces, we're now seeing chiseled jawlines. Hollowed cheekbones. Defined chins.\n\n\"A common beauty goal is to mimic a fashion model look,\" Dr. Steven Pearlman, a board-certified facial plastic surgeon, says about the latest fad. \"Models tend to have high cheekbones and narrow sculpted cheeks. Makeup artists spend a lot of time contouring or demonstrating on social media how to contour under the cheekbones for this sculpted look.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone can attain this angular appearance naturally, which is why many are turning to plastic surgery to remove their \"buccal fat,\" located in the lower cheek and jaw area.\n\nIf you hadn't heard of buccal (pronounced \"buckle\") fat until now, you're not alone. Expectations for beauty are becoming more and more niche, and even psychologist Elizabeth Daniels, who has been studying body image for over two decades, wasn't aware such a particular body part existed.\n\n\"It's interesting that something as specific as the fat laid under our cheekbones needs to be altered to meet a beauty standard,\" says Daniels, an associate professor of Developmental Psychology at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe surgery is nothing new: Model Chrissy Teigen jumped on the trend in October 2021. But a recent photo of Lea Michele sparked social media interest in the cosmetic procedure. Michele has not commented on speculation about her appearance.\n\nIt's a stark contrast from the previous trend of fuller cheeks popularized by injectable fillers, but the ever-changing standards of beauty are no surprise.\n\n\"We see these messages about beauty that are pretty narrow and repeated and unattainable, and this prevalence is what regularly exposes people to new insecurities.\"\n\nSo what is 'buccal fat'?\n\nBuccal fat refers to the natural fat tissues in the midface and lower face, responsible for the rounded soft jaw shape. Functionally, it serves as a cushion between two of the chewing muscles: the buccinator and masseter muscles.\n\nRemoving it through surgery, which takes approximately one hour, is purely cosmetic, resulting in a slimmer, more chiseled appearance for many. A surgeon will create \"a small incision inside the cheek, below the saliva duct… for the buccal fat pad to be gently teased out into the mouth,\" Pearlman describes.\n\nSocial media is a large driver of its sudden popularity, as more and more users are documenting their experience and results – without properly warning about the dangers and caveats of a permanent procedure.\n\nThe obsession with creating a \"narrower, slimmer silhouette\" may also stem from \"selfie culture,\" in which people are constantly staring at a distorted reflection of the way they look.\n\n\"When you're kind of cropped in or zoomed in on the face, it makes sense that one would alter their face in a specific way, in a way that seems trendy,\" Daniels says, likening the buccal fat removal look to a \"duck face.\"\n\nIs 'skinny' making a comeback?: Pilates, low-rise jeans and the Kardashian weight loss\n\nWhat social media, influencers aren't telling you about buccal fat removal\n\nUnlike lip fillers or BBLs, buccal fat removal is not reversible – a cause for concern as more young people are opting for the controversial plastic surgery.\n\n\"As we age, we tend to lose midface volume,\" Pearlman explains. \"So if this is reduced at too young an age, you might look too gaunt and advance the aging appearance of your face.\"\n\nFor this reason, Pearlman says he only performs buccal fat removal for patients above the age of 30. But on TikTok, some as young as 21 are documenting the procedure for millions to see.\n\nPossible albeit \"rare\" complications, Pearlman says, include prolonged post-operative swelling, hematoma, muscle weakness and rarely but not unheard of, damage to the saliva duct if the incision is too high.\n\n\"People at 19, 20 years old don't have the full brain development to really think about all the possible side effects and long-term effects of getting this procedure now,\" Daniels warns. \"The fact that even teens are getting a permanent procedure in pursuit of a beauty standard does concern me.\"\n\nBella Hadid regrets nose job at 14: How young is too young for plastic surgery?\n\nIt's buccal fat removal now. But 'what's next?'\n\nIn the age of social media, it's hard to resist the new wave of insecurities that we didn't know we were supposed to have. Look at BBLs marketed toward those who weren't born with wide hips and a small waist. Or fillers posing as solutions for what TikTok called a \"gummy\" smile. And now, buccal fat is taking over social media.\n\nThese endless cosmetic options are often advertised as ways to achieve society's definition of \"perfection.\" The reality is that beauty ideals, constantly evolving yet always unattainable, \"often profit off of dissatisfactions\" by creating more imperfections to constantly improve.\n\n\"What's next?\" asks Daniels. \"Is it going to be a cuticle on your pinky toe?

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThis week, convicted January 6 rioter Guy Reffitt, who brought a gun to the Capitol building and threatened House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. It’s the longest insurrection-related sentence to date – and one that his 19-year-old son, Jackson, has said he fully agrees with. “I haven’t been happy through this whole situation,” Jackson, who warned the FBI about his father both before and after the insurrection, told CNN in an interview.\n\nCourtesy of Peggy Drexler\n\n“But to say I’m surprised would be a lie. Everything my dad did, he’s his own person, and his actions have consequences.”\n\nSince the earliest days of Trump-era politics, many have had to reconcile their emotions of love with ones of confusion, disappointment and betrayal over family members’ ideologies – ones that are often new or more extreme than they previously were. This created divisions between loved ones that have become even more pronounced in the wake of January 6, when the threat that former President Donald Trump’s style of politics poses to the nation became undeniable.\n\nPeople like Jackson Reffitt have been forced to choose between loyalty to their family and to their own personal beliefs. To wit, when asked if he’s had any second thoughts about turning his father in, Jackson replied, “absolutely not,” while acknowledging that he bears considerable guilt, especially given his father’s “deteriorating” mental state, which Jackson fears could worsen in the prison system.\n\nIt’s understandable that Jackson feels this way; it’s extremely hard to reconcile feelings when a parent or other loved one behaves in a way we find unacceptable or even unfathomable. Questions arise: What does that mean about our love for them? Their love for us? Which parts of them have we inherited, and will we be self-aware enough to recognize them? How can someone who raised us behave in so very different ways than we would?\n\nAnd, perhaps most sweepingly: Does loving a family member mean accepting those behaviors, at all costs?\n\nIn the case of violent behavior, there may also be a fear of retribution or alienation from other members of the family. Jackson told CNN that his relationship with his mother and sisters over the last few years has been “really polarizing…. It feels like we’re each pulling on a string one way.”\n\nJust as difficult is the fear of losing someone we love to a person, situation or ideology we don’t. Jackson – like others who have found themselves in similar, if less extreme, circumstances with their loved ones – may be reflecting on his whole relationship with his family and wondering about how and where to put his trust going forward. It’s extremely difficult to have empathy for both ourselves and those who disappoint us, especially if they are part of our family of origin. And it is extremely difficult to face behaviors we find reprehensible when they come from people we love.\n\nBut it’s not impossible, as the younger Reffitt has shown. Throughout the interview, he expressed concern that his father was manipulated into doing what he did, while acknowledging that his father is an adult who decided to make certain choices.\n\nIn doing so, Jackson shows us that it is possible to still love our families and also know when we need to follow our own moral compass and separate from them. He shows us that we can see someone for who they are without endorsing their behaviors; we can even care for them even when it feels agonizing.\n\nThe truth is that while we cannot change the behavior of another – and we even acknowledge that we would never behave in the same way – we can find a way to understand it. But understanding needn’t mean accepting. “What my father did is far from politics,” said Jackson. “This is completely off-the-rails violence. Whether it had a political motive at this point doesn’t matter.”\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nStanding up to your parents is undoubtedly a lot for a 19-year-old, and a lot for many of us, but the need to do so is an increasingly common reality in our current world. Family ties may be strong, but they needn’t be binding. “I would love to talk to him again,” Jackson admitted at the end of the interview. “He’s still my father. But that doesn’t justify anything that he’s done.”", "authors": ["Peggy Drexler"], "publish_date": "2022/08/05"}]}

The biggest of the bunch is expected to be a fruit-infused Mountain Dew Sangrita Blast, that will be available only at Taco Bell. Other new offerings: Manzanita Sol (an apple-flavored, carbonated drink); Diet Mountain Dew Baja Blast; SoBe Lifewater Yumberry Pomegranate; Brisk Mango iced tea and Brisk Half and Half (half tea, half lemonade.)\n\nThe national rollout is just getting underway.\n\n\"We asked ourselves: Why can't we make our beverages as crave-able as our food?\" says Chris Brandt, chief marketing officer. \"That's been our mission for the past 18 months.\"\n\nFor the fast-food giants, drinks matter. About 56% of fast-food purchases involved a beverage last year, says NPD Group/CREST. \"Beverages are a significant portion of profits,\" says Christopher Muller, who teaches at Boston University's School of Hospitality Administration. \"You're basically serving water with ice.\" Drinks can account for 30% to 40% of sales — and can quickly boost profits 10% to 15%, he says.\n\nThe beverage move by Taco Bell comes less than two years after it nearly turned the fast-food business upside down with its wildly successful Doritos Locos Tacos — which puts tacos inside Doritos-flavored taco shells. The product line is widely considered one of the most successful in the brand's history and one of fast food's most innovative in years.\n\nBut Taco Bell has been somewhat on the sidelines in recent years while other fast-food chains — particularly McDonald's and Starbucks — have vastly expanded their beverage lines, mostly hoping to lure Millennials for late-day and late-night snacking. McDonald's has rolled out various smoothies and frappés even as Starbucks has rolled out a unique line of Refreshers. Also, the new Coca-Cola Freestyle drink machine — which can mix and match 127 different drinks — is catching on as it shows up at some retailers that sell Coke products\n\nWhile Taco Bell — which sells Pepsi products — has expanded its line of Freezes, the creative growth of its beverage menu arguably hasn't kept up with the growth of its foods over the past few years.\n\nNow, with an eye on Millennials, who demand more creative — and healthy — carbonated and non-carbonated drinks, Taco Bell is trying to move the beverage needle. But will folks choose a fast food because of the drinks?\n\n\"I do,\" says Boston University's Muller. And when it's a tossup between one fast-food outlet and another, the beverages can be the deciding factor, he says.\n\nThe beverage move also is about attracting customers into stores during off-peak hours — like late afternoon or late night. At least, that's what it did when Taco Bell tested the drinks at some locations last year, says Brandt.\n\nThe way Muller figures it, bolstering the beverage menu certainly can't hurt. \"We're going from the year of the carbs, to the year of the beverages.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2025/03/06/taco-bell-new-menu-items-2025/81757302007/", "title": "Taco Bell releases new menu items for 2025: What can you order?", "text": "Taco Bell has announced a collection of new menu items, slated to release in restaurants this year.\n\nNew items include a Flamin' Hot Burrito, made with a new Flamin' Hot rice, and a Quesocrisp Taco, an all-new taco shell made entirely out of crispy cheese.

(By the way, that milestone is happening later this month.)\n\nIn-N-Out sells burgers, fries, sodas and shakes. Nothing else. In previous interviews, the chain has said the last significant menu change came more than 15 years ago when restaurants added lemonade.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIt appears nostalgia is what prompted the hot cocoa addition to In-N-Out’s 328 restaurants in California, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Nevada and Oregon.\n\nCompany president Lynsi Snyder, whose grandparents founded In-N-Out in 1948, said hot cocoa was previously sold at the chain in the 1950s.\n\n“This is actually the return of hot cocoa,” she said in a statement. “My grandparents, Harry and Esther Snyder, served it for many years beginning in the ‘50s. I’m not sure how it fell off the menu but it’s part of our culture and something special for kids, and I’m happy that we’re bringing it back.”\n\nShe said the company sources cocoa powder from Ghirardelli Chocolate Company to make the hot chocolate.\n\nDuring a visit to a restaurant in Orange, the sweet beverage was poured from a thermal dispenser labeled “Hot Cocoa” in the chain’s signature red font. The drink, served in a white cup with the signature In-N-Out palm trees, comes topped with a packet of mini marshmallows. (Marshmallows can be requested on the side.)\n\nThe employee said the $1.60 drink is made with hot water, not milk. By comparison, McDonald’s sells a 12-ounce hot chocolate made with milk for $2. McCafe does not sell any drinks smaller than 12 ounces.\n\nAdding hot cocoa is one of two major business decisions made by the privately-held company in recent weeks. In late November, In-N-Out announced plans to expand to Colorado — the seventh state the chain has entered in 69 years.\n\nIt will likely take at least three years before Colorado sees its first Double-Double.\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/06/27/taco-bell-value-meal/74217697007/", "title": "Taco Bell value meal combo: What's in the $7 Luxe Cravings Box?", "text": "Taco Bell has a new combo meal deal meant to address the affordability of fast food with inflation still on the front burner for consumers.\n\nThe new $7 limited-time Luxe Cravings Box hits the Taco Bell menu Thursday. The meal comes with a Chalupa Supreme, Beefy 5-Layer Burrito, Double Stacked Taco, chips and nacho cheese sauce, and a medium drink. The restaurant chain says the combo is priced about 55% lower than the price for the menu items bought separately.\n\nMany major fast food chains have sought to address consumer concerns over prices. Last week, McDonald's began selling a $5 limited-time Meal Deal, which includes a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, 4-piece Chicken McNuggets, small fries and a small soft drink.\n\nLast month, Wendy's began offering a $3 breakfast deal for an English muffin breakfast sandwich and side of seasoned potatoes, and Burger King debuted the $5 Your Way Meal with a choice of three sandwiches, plus chicken nuggets, fries and a drink.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThis isn't Taco Bell's first attempt to bring affordability to its menu as consumers look for cheaper food options. The $5 Taco Discovery Box – a Crunchy Taco, Doritos Locos Taco, Cantina Chicken Crispy Taco and a medium drink – was available in April to June 4. In January, Taco Bell launched a new Cravings Value Menu with 10 items for $3 or less.\n\nSince then prices on some of those menu items have increased slightly. But there's still 10 items priced at less than $3, Taylor Montgomery, the chief marketing officer for Taco Bell North America, said in a statement sent to USA TODAY. \"Our Cravings Value Menu is one of the leading value menus within the industry … because we believe consumers shouldn’t have to choose between affordability and abundance,\" he said.\n\nWith the new $7 Luxe Cravings Box, \"we’re giving consumers our most craveable items at an affordable price point and living up to our commitment on value to satisfy cravings with fan favorite full-sized menu items,\" Montgomery said.\n\nTaco Bell Luxe Cravings Box nutritional information\n\nHere are nutrition details on Taco Bell's Luxe Cravings Box, according to the restaurant chain:\n\nChalupa Supreme (Beef): Calories (360); Total fat (20 grams; 26% of daily value); Cholesterol (25 mg; 8%); Sodium (570 mg; %); Total carbohydrates (31 g; 11%); and Protein (12 g).\n\nCalories (360); Total fat (20 grams; 26% of daily value); Cholesterol (25 mg; 8%); Sodium (570 mg; %); Total carbohydrates (31 g; 11%); and Protein (12 g).
