Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his successor have ruled out any changes to the current legal definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n\n“We will try and maintain a balance…to uphold a stable society with traditional, heterosexual family values, but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and contribute to society,” Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said in parliament this week.\n\nBoth the repeal and the constitutional amendment were passed with an overwhelming majority, thanks to the ruling People’s Action Party’s dominance in parliament. There is no timeline yet for when the new laws take effect.\n\nThe changes do, however, leave room for a future parliament to expand the definition of marriage to include same-sex relationships.\n\nBryan Choong, chair of LGBTQ advocacy group Oogachaga, said it was a historical moment for activists who have been campaigning for a repeal of the law known as Section 377A for 15 years. But he added that LGBT couples and families also “have the right to be recognized and protected.”\n\nIn Singapore, attitudes to LGBT issues have shifted toward a more liberal stance in recent years, especially among the young, though conservative attitudes remain among religious groups. Of those aged 18-25, about 42% accepted same-sex marriage in 2018, up from 17% just five years prior, according to a survey by the Institute of Policy Studies.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/07/11/iowa-legislature-special-session-six-week-abortion-ban-fetal-heartbeat-pregnancy-republicans-gop-law/70398531007/", "title": "Iowa passes 6-week 'heartbeat' abortion ban in volatile special ...", "text": "In a late-night marathon session punctuated by heated protests, the Iowa Legislature passed a bill Tuesday that will ban nearly all abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy, severely curtailing Iowans' access to the procedure.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds has announced she will sign the measure Friday at the Family Leadership Summit, in front of an audience of conservative Christians. Several Republican presidential candidates are also slated to speak at the summit.\n\nThe ban will go into effect with her signature, requiring health care providers to comply immediately.\n\nIowa abortion providers have already filed a lawsuit challenging the ban.\n\nThe final Senate vote, shortly after 11 p.m., was punctuated by boos and shouts of \"shame\" from onlookers. As waves of shouting continued, several Iowans were escorted out of the gallery by state troopers. Some called Republicans fascists and yelled profanities, shouting that blood was on their hands. Others were in tears as they were led away.\n\nThe votes came in a marathon one-day special session that was punctuated by protesters' angry shouts in the Iowa Capitol and hours of emotional testimony from supporters and opponents.\n\nThe legislation would prohibit abortions after cardiac activity is detected in an embryo, which doctors say can happen as early as six weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. Republicans stressed that the timing would vary based on the individual.\n\nThat marks a sharp deviation from Iowa's current law, which allows abortion up to 20 weeks after conception (or 22 weeks after the last menstrual period).\n\n\"This bill protects unborn children in Iowa,\" said Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta. \"This bill sets a clear standard where the state has an interest in the life of the child: when the baby’s heart starts beating. Where there is a heartbeat, there is life.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters flooded the Capitol rotunda Tuesday, chanting for hours. Ahead of a \"Rally for Reproductive Rights,\" arguments broke out between supporters and opponents of the bill, becoming so heated at one point that a state trooper had to break them up.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, told reporters following the vote that \"Iowa women have fewer rights to make their own bodily decisions\" because of Republicans and that \"we're not going to let them get away with it.\"\n\n\"There are 483 days until Election Day 2024 and there won’t be a day that Iowa House Democrats aren’t reminding voters that Republicans took away their rights and acted against the will of more than half of Iowa voters,\" Konfrst said.\n\nThe House voted 56-34 shortly after 9 p.m., after about five hours of debate. Every Democrat was opposed. All Republicans were in favor except Reps. Mark Cisneros, R-Muscatine, and Zach Dieken, R-Granville. Ten representatives were absent.\n\nDieken authored a post this month for the Iowa Standard, a conservative blog, calling the \"heartbeat\" legislation \"window dressing to make ourselves feel good about ultimately falling short to act on this issue.\" And Cisneros wrote on Facebook that he agreed with Dieken.\n\nThe Senate voted 32-17 to pass the legislation, sending the bill to Reynolds for her signature. Every Republican voted in favor except Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville. Every Democrat was opposed. One senator was absent.\n\nWhat does the 6-week abortion bill do? What happens when it passes?\n\nThe \"fetal heartbeat\" law passed by Republicans would ban nearly all abortions after cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo. That occurs at about six weeks of gestation — measured as six weeks after a woman's last menstrual period began.\n\nThe legislation is nearly identical to a law signed by Reynolds in 2018, which was permanently blocked by the courts. Reynolds called the special session after the Iowa Supreme Court deadlocked 3-3 last month, leaving the law blocked.\n\nMedical professionals say it's misleading to call those early electric pulses a \"fetal heartbeat,\" as the embryo is not yet a fetus, and the cells that will become a heart do not yet move blood.\n\nUnder Iowa's current law, which allows abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, individuals must wait 24 hours between an initial appointment and an abortion procedure.\n\nMarathon one-day special session concludes late Tuesday night\n\nRepublican leaders set an ambitious schedule for Tuesday's one-day special session, advancing the bill through the entire legislative process in just under 15 hours.\n\nBitter floor debate waged through the evening, as Democrats vehemently opposed the bill. Supporters and opponents each shared deeply personal stories from their own lives and those of their constituents.\n\nRep. Luana Stoltenberg, R-Davenport, told the story of her own three abortions.\n\n\"I was told that it was just a blob of tissue, that it was easy and it was safe,\" she said. \"That was a lie. Those abortions caused me not to be able to have children. Every day I live with the reality that I killed the only children I would ever have.\"\n\nRep. Elinor Levin, D-Iowa City, said the decision about whether or not to have a child should always be in the hands of the person who is pregnant.\n\n\"No government should ever have the power to force a human to go through a pregnancy and give birth,\" she said.\n\nRep. Brad Sherman, R-Williamsburg, said \"the baby is not being considered very much\" in the discussion.\n\n\"Abortion is never safe for a baby. Ever,\" he said. \"Abortion always results in a death.\"\n\nSherman said if someone doesn't want to get pregnant, they shouldn't have sex.\n\n\"Everyone is free not to have sex,\" Sherman said. \"If they’re not prepared to have a baby they shouldn’t have sex, if they’re that concerned about it. I will stand for everyone’s right to practice abstinence.\"\n\nKonfrst said women are not free when they can't make their own health care decisions and \"after today, women will be less free.\"\n\n\"Everyone deserves the right to make their own health care decisions, especially when it comes to reproductive care and abortion,\" Konfrst said. \"None of us have any business being in a doctor’s office when these decisions are made.\"\n\nDemocrats also criticized Republican leaders for constraining the session to a single day.\n\n“Do you have somewhere you need to be at midnight? Does someone in this chamber have somewhere you need to be tomorrow?” asked Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines. “You make women wait 24 hours for abortion care, but you’re going to give them less than 3 hours … to make the case of why their bodies should matter?”\n\nSenate President Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, argued that lawmakers passed a nearly identical law in 2018 following extensive public comment and debate.\n\n\"There has not been a rushed process,\" she said in a Senate committee. \"In fact, I would suggest that perhaps this has gone on too long, given the nature and the contents of the law.\"\n\nSinclair said in floor debate that the 2018 law was only \"in limbo\" because of \"overreach by the judicial branch.\"\n\n\"So here we are, needlessly forcing the Legislature to repass a law that is already enacted in an effort to protect the lives of every single individual across our state who has a beating heart,\" she said.\n\nSen. Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, said the immediate implementation of the law shows \"incredible disrespect and potentially disdain for the medical profession.\" She questioned whether the new restriction was constitutional.\n\nWhat exceptions does Iowa's 'fetal heartbeat' bill have?\n\nThe bill has several exceptions.\n\nFor rape, if the rape is reported to law enforcement or to a public health agency or doctor within 45 days.\n\nIf the pregnancy is the result of incest, if the incest is reported to law enforcement or a public health agency or doctor within 140 days.\n\nIf \"the attending physician certifies that the fetus has a fetal abnormality that in the physician's reasonable medical judgment is incompatible with life.\"\n\nFor a miscarriage \"if not all of the products of conception are expelled.\"\n\nFor a \"medical emergency,\" defined as \"a situation in which an abortion is performed to preserve the life of the pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy\" or when continuing the pregnancy \"will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\"\n\nThe medical emergency exception does not include psychological, emotional or familial conditions or the woman's age.\n\nDemocrats offered a range of amendments to extend Medicaid coverage to mothers for one year after they give birth, to create additional exceptions to allow minors and people with mental health difficulties and developmental disabilities to access abortions, to provide over-the-counter birth control, and to state that Iowans have a right to reproductive freedom. The amendments were voted down along party lines.\n\nRepublicans voted against those amendments, arguing that the exceptions outlined in the bill would be sufficient.\n\n\"Democrats would lead differently,\" said Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames. \"We would make sure that a full spectrum of reproductive health care is available for Iowa women.\"\n\nIowans share personal stories, medical arguments during 90-minute public hearing\n\nIowans packed into rooms to plead their case directly to lawmakers, speaking both for and against the bill at a 90-minute public hearing in the House and then in a Senate subcommittee.\n\nSome emotionally shared their experiences with abortion, and several expressed their dismay and anger with the proposed law.\n\nIn the Capitol rotunda Tuesday, protesters clanged bells and chanted: \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, abortion bans have got to go,\" and \"My body, my choice\" and occasionally pounded on the frosted glass of the room's door.\n\nDr. Francesca Turner, an OB-GYN and member of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said the language in the bill is ambiguous about when doctors can intervene in cases of pregnancy complications.\n\n“At what point when your wife or your daughter or your sister is having a medical emergency during a pregnancy do I get to save her life?” she said. “At what moment do I get to intervene? It’s unclear in this bill.”\n\nKatie Buck, a West Des Moines resident, brought her 7-year-old son, Alex, to the hearing. Alex was born with trisomy 18, a genetic complication caused by an extra chromosome. The condition can be fatal.\n\nBuck said it qualifies as one of the fetal abnormality exceptions allowed in the bill. She urged lawmakers to remove the exception from the bill.\n\n“Alex is 7 years old. How can he be incompatible with life?” she said. “You have no idea how hard we had to fight against this fatal fetal anomaly label to get him the medical care he needed to survive.”\n\nAmy Bingaman, another OB-GYN, said passing the bill would force women into lifelong obligations that will affect their education, careers and families. She said it will also worsen Iowa’s OB-GYN shortage.\n\n“Pass this law and we will lose well-qualified providers from our community,” she said. “Take away our ability to practice full-spectrum health care, and providers will choose to practice in another state, and many will leave Iowa. As a physician, I would not dare think I could put on a black robe and be a judge. Let us wear our white coats and properly care for our patients.”\n\nTerry Pollard, pastor at Des Moines’ Eastside Church of the Nazarene, urged lawmakers to consider the value of human life.\n\n“Human life is of the greatest value to God, the creator of life,” he said. “And it should be of value to us as moral beings who have life. Life is a gift of God as God is the giver of life. The sanctity of human life gives inviolable and equal value to every life.”\n\nHouse Democrats said, as of Monday night, 1,025 people had left comments online opposed to the bill, and 37 had left comments supporting it.\n\nAdvocates pack Capitol rotunda as tempers run high and state troopers intervene\n\nThe atmosphere in the rotunda grew tense at times in the morning, after one man holding a Bible approached a crowd of abortion rights advocates and screamed that they were \"killing babies\" and asked, \"Why do you hate yourselves?\"\n\nSeveral advocates approached him and screamed back, eventually leading a state trooper to break up the scrum.\n\nThose gathered to support abortion rights, many donning pink shirts from Planned Parenthood that read \"no bans ever,\" chanted \"abortion bans have got to go\" and \"separate the church and state.\"\n\nAs Republican lawmakers walked to and from committee meetings, protesters greeted them with shouts of \"shame\" and \"vote them out.\" Some called Republicans fascists and shouted profanities.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, Planned Parenthood and the Interfaith Alliance of Iowa, who have condemned the special session and legislation to restrict abortion, set up tables and supplied advocates with coffee.\n\nCarrie England, a retired nurse from Van Meter, was one of those in attendance, wearing a pink shirt and holding a sign alongside her granddaughter, Sylvia Visser of Des Moines.\n\nEngland said she had a child — Visser's mother — when she was 16, and Visser was born when her mother was 19. She chose to keep the child, but she wanted other women in Iowa to have a choice.\n\n\"I believe that abortion is health care,\" England said. \"And banning and putting even further restrictions on abortion is not going to stop abortions. It's only going to make them unsafe.\"\n\nShe believes abortion restrictions will put medical professionals \"in an awkward position,\" saying if she was still active in the medical field, she would want to \"go rogue.\"\n\nSome anti-abortion advocates were also present: A small group of abortion opponents gathered to sing \"Amazing Grace\" nearby, and several younger women held \"pro-life\" signs.\n\nJosephine Talley, a Des Moines resident who attends Creighton University in Omaha, said she came to show that \"there are Iowans here that are pro-life, especially young women.\" She praised the proposed bill to restrict abortion at about six weeks of pregnancy but said she would like to see it go further.\n\n\"I would prefer one that is earlier, but I think it is a really great step in the right direction,\" Talley said. \"So I'm thrilled that they are calling this special session for it.\"\n\nHow do Iowans feel about whether abortion should be legal?\n\nPolling shows a majority of Iowans believe abortion should be legal.\n\nA March Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll found 61% of Iowans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 35% say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases.\n\nEighty-nine percent of Iowans say abortion should be legal if the pregnant person's life is in danger, and 85% say abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest, according to an Iowa Poll from October.\n\nThe October poll also asked Iowans whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement: \"Abortion should be illegal once a so-called fetal heartbeat is detected, about six weeks after conception.\"\n\nNearly half of Iowans, 49%, said they disagreed with that idea, while 45% agreed.\n\nRegister reporter Michaela Ramm contributed to this story.\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

The worst hurricane to hit the island, Maria also took homes, shoreline, crops, livestock and left millions struggling to survive without power, water, cash and jobs.\n\n“All the flowers are gone. The bees are going crazy,” said Gerry Giles, a New Mexico native who moved to the Aguadilla area more than 40 years ago.\n\n“It’s a cash-only society right now,” he said, gently shooing the bees away as he waited for a pizza lunch at one of the few open restaurants in Aguadilla.\n\nA woman nearby agreed that the bees have been terrible.\n\n“I leave an overripe banana outside in my yard so they have something sweet to eat,” she said.\n\nAt a roadside stand in nearby Anasco, Rey Martos-Rivera asked for a bottle of water and was met with laughter. More than two weeks after the hurricane, like flowers for bees, drinking water remains by far the No. 1 need.\n\n“Bottled water? Forget it,” Giles said. “You won’t find that anywhere. Once we get water people will start feeling a lot better.”\n\nNo complaints\n\nDriving through Aguadilla and neighboring towns like Anasco, Mayaguez, Rincon and elsewhere, people appeared to be managing without complaint.\n\nI have seen utility workers only once. I have not seen the Red Cross or FEMA. That’s not to say they aren’t here and doing an amazing job. I just haven’t seen them.\n\nSure, gas lines remain long but get shorter every day. Temporary ATMs have popped up here and there. Food trucks and roadside stands are slowly reopening.\n\n“This was a natural disaster,” said Carlos Pena Brito in Anasco. “What can we do? We just have to try and take care of those who need more help than us.”\n\nBrito, who manages the pastoral care unit at his church, said those suffering the most are in the rural, mountainous areas. These small villages are hard to get to on good days. Now with mudslides covering roads, downed trees and little communication, they need the most attention.\n\nFive days after the storm, word trickled down of a family in Rincon that had not had any water to drink besides a meager amount of rain water in five days. The normally 45-minute trip to see them took eight hours.\n\nBrito says people have not wasted energy complaining — but he fears for the near future.\n\n“A lot of people are anxious,” he said. “The crops were destroyed. The cows were washed away and killed and now contaminate the water.”\n\nHoping he is wrong, Brito said he thinks things will get worse before getting better.\n\n“I spoke to several small business owners in Mayaguez who decided to close their businesses after they heard it may take six months to restore their power,” he said. “They can’t afford to keep their places and will lose all their inventory if they stay open.”\n\nRaymond Ortiz in Mayaguez celebrated having his running water turned on Thursday. But he still does not know about the future.\n\n“My work is only part-time now,” he said with a shrug. “We are waiting for a package that relatives have sent us from the mainland.”\n\nAnd still, he asked me if I would like something to eat.\n\nThe longest night\n\nAt the very western part of the island in Mayaguez, Monserrate Ramos thought the night of the storm would never end.\n\n“I cried all night,” she said from inside her darkened concrete home. “I didn’t know what to do. Everything was shaking.”\n\nThe storm was impossible to sleep through.\n\nGiles, in Aguadilla, said he stepped outside as the eye passed through, believing the storm had passed. He drove around and assessed damage before the second and more devastating portion of the storm came through.\n\n“Man, it was scary. If you looked out the window — any window that you could look out of — everything was bent over. It was just God awful,” he said. “The windows were shaking, and we moved the sofa and the cushions between the glass and the sofa and moved all the other furniture up against it to keep it from rattling. That calmed my wife down because she was worried it would bust wide open. The south part of the storm hit us with a vengeance all night long.”\n\nWhen the storm was finally over, Giles said the streets were covered with debris and impassable.\n\n“It was mayhem,” he said.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe stench driving through parts of Anasco is unbearable. The roads are covered with mud and so are the dead horses and cows whose stiff legs stick out like battered flags of defeat.\n\n“Look, look at that,” Matos-Rivera said. “That entire field was a plantain field and now that crop is gone.”\n\nHernan Gonzalez, 78, rode out the storm in his Aguadilla home even as the waters rose down the street and started coming into his home.\n\nHe and his wife, Nancy Nazario, took two-hour shifts resting while the other worked non-stop mopping and sweeping the water away. When the long night finally ended, the couple was OK with food, bottled water and cash for a few weeks.\n\nHow much longer they can go is uncertain.\n\n“I don’t know how long it will take for things to get back to normal. We are OK without air conditioning,” he said with a smile. “But I would love something cold to drink.”\n\nFew people are talking about normal, though. Right now, just making it through each day is the daily struggle that commands all their attention.\n\nFor now it’s life without many of the most basic necessities: no water, no power, not much food, no work. And even the flowers are gone.\n\nContact Torres at 321-242-3684\n\nor jtorres@floridatoday.com.\n\nTwitter: @johnalbertorres\n\nFacebook: /ftjohntorres", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/10/10/ny-puerto-rico-influx-hurricane-maria/736317001/", "title": "Puerto Ricans in New York plan for new arrivals from battered island", "text": "Myrna Gonzalez's northeast Rochester house is about to undergo a transformation: A cozy home for four people will morph, overnight, into a crowded home for eight.\n\n\"We will sleep on the couch, sleep on the floor, and put more water in the soup,\" said Gonzalez, anticipating the doubling of her household. \"We don't leave family in the street.\"\n\nGonzalez and her husband, Luis Vazquez, and their two children are from Puerto Rico. So are Francis Cordero, whom Gonzalez regards as a sister, and Cordero's three children, who are expected to arrive in Rochester later this week and begin sharing Gonzalez's home.\n\nThey are at the beginning of a wave of people who are expected to leave hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico in the coming weeks and months and move to the mainland United States.\n\n\"We have a lot of people who are talking about that. We know there are a lot of kids coming, kids who were traumatized,\" Gonzalez said. \"Rochester needs to prepare. You're going to see more people coming — with nothing.\"\n\nThe Caribbean island of 3.4 million residents was struck hard by Hurricane Irma in early September and then devastated by Hurricane Maria two weeks later.\n\nThousands of homes were destroyed. Electricity, water and sewer services were disrupted, food and medicine became scarce and an already-weak economy was left in a shambles.\n\nMore:\n\nFEMA officials say they're 'slowly starting to make progress' in Puerto Rico\n\nNearly 3 weeks after Hurricane Maria, distributing aid across Puerto Rico is a mess\n\nWeeks after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico struggles to find a new normal\n\nWith a bleak future in front of them there, a large number of Puerto Ricans are expected to leave the devastation behind and move to the United States, many headed for communities where they have family or friends.\n\nNew York state already is home to the largest Puerto Rican population on the mainland, and officials here say they are indeed making plans to deal with a large influx of residents from Puerto Rico.\n\n\"People are saying 'OK, we're going to go to New York. We're going to live with Gramma or Auntie or a cousin or a friend,'\" Gonzalez said.\n\nThe migration is not yet in full swing because flights out of San Juan, Puerto Rico's capital, have been hard to come by. When the airport fully opens to residents seeking to leave in the next week or two, Gonzalez expects the migration to escalate sharply.\n\nIn fact, the out-migration of a considerable number of Puerto Rican residents has been underway for several years, driven largely by the flagging economy there.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015, nearly 720,000 Puerto Rican natives moved to the mainland, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.\n\nThe greatest growth in the Puerto Rican population took place in other parts of the country, most notably Florida. But New York continued to lead the states with 1.1 million residents who were born in the island commonwealth.\n\nAmong metropolitan areas, New York City (whose Census-defined MSA includes parts of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania) is tops, with nearly 1.3 million Puerto Rican residents.\n\nThe population there grew by about 40,000, or 3 percent, between 2010 and 2015. But other metro areas in New York grew much more on a percentage basis — Syracuse 25 percent, Albany 23 percent, Buffalo 22 percent and Rochester — the city has the largest Puerto Rican population outside New York City — 15 percent.\n\nA challenging transition\n\nThe transition from the island to the mainland has always carried challenges for Puerto Ricans, even under less dire circumstances. Many who left the island over the past decade were fleeing an economic downturn and sought a better life for their families in the U.S.\n\nBut many Puerto Ricans who left in recent years struggled to find work and housing, had difficulty learning the language, and had to adapt to a higher cost of living and a faster-paced lifestyle. Despite its status as a U.S. territory, many on the island are not fluent in English.\n\nLuis Santos, 31, a native of Cayey, Puerto Rico, said he didn’t find work for months after arriving in Yonkers in 2007. He had no friends besides his wife, and was so disoriented by his new surroundings that he got lost taking a walk in his neighborhood.\n\n“My biggest challenge was how to help my family,” Santos said. “We came over here for a better future. But the first few months I didn’t have a job. Adapting was difficult in the sense that I didn’t have friends, I didn’t know where I was. I got lost on my own block.”\n\nFor Emanuel Bonilla Rivera, who is from Carolina, Puerto Rico, his move to the U.S. mainland five years ago resulted in some harsh realizations. He learned that one has to work harder to make ends meet in New York.\n\n“Over there we have time, we have the beaches close by, the rivers, the pools,” said Rivera, 30. “And when you’re here it’s work and work and work and you don’t have a life. So, before the weekend you just disappear.”\n\nHe also learned that the weather in the Northeast is far from the tropical climate he grew up with.\n\n“The first thing is the cold,” he said. “You have to get used to the cold, because the cold is unbearable.”\n\nSantos and Rivera did adapt. Rivera took a construction job and has made a good life for his wife and 3-year-old son. Santos found work in landscaping, and later moved to a better job at the Westchester County Airport, and now he works as a mechanic at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.\n\nHe and his wife had two children, Angelina, 4, and Luis Sebastiano, 7 — all of them with strong emotional ties to the Caribbean island.\n\nLast weekend, they helped raise money and supplies for those still in Puerto Rico, thousands of whom may soon relocate to the mainland under more urgent circumstances.\n\n“I know sometimes we come and we migrate and we’re looking for a better life, a better way of living,” said Vanessa Caplloch, Santos’ wife. “But sometimes we don’t understand the struggles that we have to face in order to get there.”\n\n“They’re going to come, they’re going to be hopeful, but they need to be patient,” said Caplloch, 31. “It’s not easy. It’s not easy for the Puerto Rican community here, it’s not easy for a minority, it’s not easy for us now. But with patience and perseverance, hopefully we can be stable in the Puerto Rican community here and also help the island restore itself.”\n\nNew arrivals should seek ways to engage with the community they move in to, whether it's through a house of worship or job, suggested Maria Santini of West Nyack, who was born in Puerto Rico and came to New York City in the mid-1980s for college.\n\n“You have to find where you fit. You have to allow yourself to develop relationships and friendships … and then you will make it your home, as I did,” Santini said.\n\nShe added: “I think New York offers more understanding of cultural differences than other states …. I don’t know if it’s because New York is so cosmopolitan and so used to other cultures that you don’t feel like a stranger.”\n\nSantini — who co-owns the restaurant Roost in Sparkill, Rockland County, with her boyfriend Kevin Reilly, who is also the chef — said the biggest hurdle for her when arriving in the region was mastering English, which was essential for her success in previous careers in the fashion and the healthcare industries.\n\n“It was critical for me that I assimilate, especially the language,” she said. “I needed to be able to express myself, and that was my main goal of learning English.”\n\nMigration numbers will depend on recovery efforts\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo said it’s too soon to know how many Puerto Ricans may relocate to New York, saying it depends in part on how well cleanup efforts are progressing on the island.\n\n“If the relief efforts go well, and people see the situation’s being stabilized, I think you’ll see fewer people wanting to leave,” Cuomo told reporters Sept. 27.\n\n“On the other hand, the inverse is true, and they are panicked, or if they see despair setting in, or if they think the relief efforts are either wanting or inadequate, then I think you’ll see people starting to leave and New York would be a logical location and destination for them. If that happens, we’ll handle it when it comes.”\n\nThe State University of New York and the City University of New York are planning, at the request of Cuomo, to allow Puerto Ricans to be eligible for in-state tuition if they come to New York to continue their education. The same eligibility will be extended to those who come from the U.S. Virgin Islands after Hurricane Irma hit there last month.\n\nThe largest public university system in the nation took similar steps after Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.\n\nCuomo said students in Puerto Rico face the potential of a long-term displacement in their education.\n\n“This action will alleviate a huge burden for these families as they try to repair and rebuild their lives,” Cuomo said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the state Education Department said it is in conversation with schools across New York as it expects more students from Puerto Rico.\n\n\"We anticipate that families from these devastated areas, and their school-aged children, may relocate to New York in the coming weeks and months,” said Emily DeSantis, the department’s spokeswoman.\n\n“The department stands ready to help districts with this process and to support students and their families who are facing a very difficult time. Further information about this important issue is being developed and will be shared with districts.”\n\nLocal impact and FEMA\n\nThe federal government should already consider helping states who may face a surge in Puerto Ricans, said Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, D-Bronx, who heads the state Assembly’s Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force.\n\nHe wrote a letter to President Donald Trump last month urging the administration to let FEMA provide housing assistance to residents who leave for New York or other states.\n\nThe federal government should also provide Medicaid or Medicare waivers so people who come to the mainland can retain health-care services, as well as give housing and food aid to families who leave Puerto Rico, he said.\n\n“Despite people not wanting to leave their homes, many will be displaced, and they will look for refuge and assistance and family members in communities, like New York, where there are strong ties and some familiarity,” Crespo said on The Capitol Pressroom, a public-radio show in Albany.\n\nCrespo recognized that New York has already seen an influx of Puerto Ricans in recent years prior to the hurricane.\n\nHe said the state Legislature, when it returns in January, should consider an aid package for Puerto Ricans who may end up moving to New York, including waivers for people who may move with family members in public housing.\n\n“The state of New York will see an impact,” Crespo said. “We’ve seen it already with the folks who left because of the economic issue, and now there is going to be a greater exodus of families — whether temporary or long term — who are going to need a place to be, and New York is going to need to fill that gap.”\n\nNew York already expects its efforts in Puerto Rico, which includes more than 400 personnel deployed there, to be covered by the federal government through FEMA.\n\nCuomo, who headed the Housing and Urban Development agency during the Clinton administration, said a reimbursement formula between a state and the federal government would be negotiated — typically either 90 percent or 100 percent picked up by the federal government.\n\nHe expects a similar ratio for Puerto Rico relief, but New York has also received many in-kind contributions from major corporations, such as free flights sponsored by Delta and JetBlue from New York to the island carrying supplies, troops and State Police.\n\nAlso, some of the personnel have gone to Puerto Rico on their own time as volunteers, state officials said.\n\n“The real cost to New Yorkers are the contributions, the donations, which are significant,” Cuomo said. “But the cost to New York state government and taxpayers is de minimis.”\n\nNew York’s attention to Puerto Rico, though, is not without its critics.\n\nAssemblyman Joseph Errigo, R-Conesus, Livingston County, said Cuomo’s call for in-state tuition to Puerto Rican and U.S Virgin Island residents is a political ploy.\n\nCuomo is seeking re-election next year and is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2020.\n\n“The devastation in Puerto Rico is tragic, but the governor’s moves today are not as genuine as they might seem,” Errigo said in a statement Thursday.\n\n“Cuomo is heading into an election year and is seeking the nod for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, making these decisions nothing more than political maneuvering,” Errigo continued.\n\n“Despite what the governor says, Puerto Rico’s problems are not New York state’s problems, and we need to be focused on maintaining funding to keep our infrastructure and schools running and well financed.”\n\nIncludes reporting by Michael D'Onofrio and Jorge Fitz-Gibbon.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/31/students-find-haven-schools-hurricane-maria-aftermath/470229002/", "title": "Hurricane Maria aftermath: Puerto Rico students see schools as ...", "text": "SAN LORENZO, Puerto Rico — Luz Rodriguez routinely teaches her ninth-grade science class at José Campeche High School in the dark for fear that rainwater pooled in the ceiling will spark a fire if she turns on the lights.\n\nCellphone chargers line the wall of Wanda Calderon’s 12th-grade Spanish class. Calderon allows her students to charge during class since most of them lack power at home.\n\nRoof tiles, sheet rock, dead branches and other storm debris rot in a large pile outside the school and water streams from classroom ceilings during heavy rains.\n\nAll throughout José Campeche, tucked into this mountainous hamlet in southeast Puerto Rico, are reminders of the destruction and sluggish recovery from Hurricane Maria six months ago. The storm’s impact on schools can be felt throughout the island as thousands of students have fled Puerto Rico and many schools still struggle to provide basic needs, such as electricity and hot meals.\n\nJosé Campeche is one of the luckier ones: The building escaped major damage and power returned to campus just two months after the storm. Still, students and faculty here have struggled in a school and home environment that’s far from normal.\n\nThe school only lost around 40 of its 634 of its pre-storm student population, but many who stayed still lack electricity at home and often show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, among other mental ailments, teachers said.\n\n“Students thought they would just be without classes for a few days,” Calderon said. “What they didn’t expect was what came after the hurricane: They were left without classes, without houses, without food, the family dispersed, no Internet, no refrigerator, no power.”\n\nShe added: “All that creates a ticking time bomb in our students.”\n\nMore than 25,000 students have left the island in the wake of Hurricane Maria, according to Puerto Rico’s Department of Education. But students were fleeing even before the storm, and state education officials had planned to close hundreds of schools by the next school year.\n\nIn February, state officials proposed a widespread overhaul of the school system, including introducing charter schools and decentralizing control, leading to angry protests by teachers.\n\nWithout schools, children lack a key coping device to deal with the psychological impact of big storms, said Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health and president of the Children’s Health Fund, who has studied the impact of hurricanes on children.\n\n“Children will suffer very directly and personally,” he said. “I’m afraid we’re going to pay a steep price in the future.”\n\nShortly after Maria struck the island on Sept. 20 and with no sign of outside help, the faculty at José Campeche began clearing campus of storm debris and sweeping water out of classrooms. The outdoor basketball court — the school’s only recreational area — had a damaged roof and was deemed a no-go zone by federal inspectors. The storm also tore off chunks of the school's roof, leading to leaks when it rains, which is often.\n\nThe school still hasn’t seen any recovery money — from state or federal agencies — for repairs, said Candido Rivera, the school’s director.\n\n“Everything we’ve done, we’ve done by ourselves,” he said.\n\nTeachers reached out to non-profit and church groups, and soon boxes of clothes, bottled water, solar lamps, meals, mosquito nets and toys began piling up in classrooms. When power returned to the school in late November, the school reopened on its full-time schedule. Teams of social workers and psychologists were brought in and students were paired up and encouraged to talk about their experiences.\n\nSome students talked about witnessing their homes pulled apart by Maria, others complained of headaches and other symptoms from breathing in generator exhaust. “Some students lost family members,” said Rodriguez, the science teacher. “It’s difficult, as teachers, to motivate them while at home they have nothing.”\n\nAfter Maria destroyed his home, Steven Vazquez, 16, became withdrawn. He didn’t want to go outside or talk to anyone. His mother sent him to Florida to live with an older brother for a few months until school started.\n\nNow back, Vazquez, an 11th-grader and aspiring filmmaker, lives with his mother in a rented apartment with no electricity. The hardest part, he said, has been sleeping on a mattress on the floor. He does homework by solar lamplight and looks forward to school each morning.\n\n“Coming to school is the best thing I can do right now. I have someone to talk to, someone to vent with,” he said. “I try to clear my mind here and not think about everything that’s happened.”\n\nHis teacher, Calderon, said the faculty has learned resiliency from their students and she's grateful for the donations that have brought them water and supplies. But she yearns for the days when all they need to do is focus on teaching.\n\n“I would love to imagine Puerto Rico as it was before the hurricane,” she said. “But it’s hard to do.”\n\nFollow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/29/maria-ravaged-puerto-rico-still-struggling-provide-health-care-residents/717513001/", "title": "Maria-ravaged Puerto Rico still struggling to provide health care", "text": "Sarah Toy\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPuerto Rico’s health care system is being pushed to its limits in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria as hospitals and clinics grapple with crippling losses of power, fuel and medical supplies.\n\nResidents and aid workers have described a battered island struggling with significant fuel and power shortages, making it difficult for health care facilities to meet the needs of the sick and elderly. Much of the island’s communications is also down, they say, compounding the crisis.\n\n“If you’re someone who is in need of emergency medical care or urgent medical care, it’s a very difficult situation,” said Garrett Ingoglia, vice president of emergency response of AmeriCares, a relief organization that sent a team to Puerto Rico in recent days.\n\n“People are being turned away from health facilities. There are long waits. Or it’s just very difficult to get to health facilities because of debris or damage or lack of fuel.”\n\nParticularly vulnerable are patients who rely on refrigerated medications such as insulin, or patients who rely on treatments multiple times a week, such as those on dialysis.\n\n“Every day, in some clinic, we run out of diesel and have to stop treatments,” said Bob Loeper, head of the disaster response team at Fresenius Medical Care, whose 28 clinics normally provide dialysis to 4,000 of the 6,000 dialysis patients in the territory. “Or we run out of water and have to stop and wait for the water truck.”\n\nDialysis machines filter out toxins and remove excess water from the body in patients with kidney failure, said Lisandro Montalvo, the medical director for Fresenius Medical Care in Puerto Rico.\n\n\"If the patients are not dialyzed adequately, they will build up toxic substances and accumulate fluid that can end up in the lungs and lead to respiratory failure and other complications,\" he said.\n\nCalling from a dialysis center in San Juan on Friday morning, Loeper said every one of Fresenius' clinics is running on a generator. They are desperate for a consistent supply of diesel and water to run their machines, he said.\n\nLack of gas is also an issue, especially for clinic staff, he added. The governor set a nightly curfew, so if staff run low on gas, they must wait hours in line during the day for a refill, which prevents them from coming to work and slows things down further.\n\n“This is unprecedented,” said Montalvo.\n\nOn Thursday, the Trump administration temporarily waived shipping restrictions for Puerto Rico at the request of its governor and after criticism from members of Congress. The waiver lifts the Jones Act, which does not allow foreign vessels to pick up and deliver fuel between U.S. ports.\n\n“We are doing as much as we can and as quickly as we can,” Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Robert Kadlec told USA TODAY on Thursday.\n\nHe acknowledged: \"But we do recognize that for people in need, it will never be fast enough.\"\n\nMedical centers in the region are slowly getting back on their feet. Fifty-nine of the island’s 69 hospitals were accepting new patients or maintaining patient care, though they were still running on generator power, Kadlec said during a press call Friday.\n\nPower was recently restored to Centro Médico Hospital in San Juan, the main hospital on the island. The USNS Comfort, an 894-foot Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds and 12 operating rooms, is expected to arrive in the area Tuesday.\n\nFollow Sarah Toy on Twitter: @sarahtoy17", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/10/13/75-000-army-veterans-live-puerto-rico-many-struggle-shelters-after-hurricane-maria/761180001/", "title": "Hurricane Maria: Army veterans are struggling in shelters after storm", "text": "Jasmine Garsd and Andrea Crossan\n\nPRI.org\n\nIt’s early in the morning, and the entire city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, seems to be gazing at the sky with concern. It looks like rain but the island just can’t handle any more flooding.\n\nOn the highway, under the dark, heavy clouds, a small car makes its way through traffic. In it are four women, Ghislaine Rivera, Mia Lind, Janine Smalley and Katie Blanker, with whom I'm spending the day — it's Oct. 5.\n\nOur first stop? A school that’s been turned into a hurricane shelter.\n\nLind, an occupational therapist for the VA Caribbean Healthcare System in San Juan, goes to the door, asking, “Are there any veterans here?”\n\nEvery day since the hurricane hit, she and her team have been roaming from shelter to shelter, looking for veterans who need medical attention.\n\nThere are somewhere around 75,000 U.S. Army veterans living in Puerto Rico. Most served during the Vietnam War. After Hurricane Maria, many are now living in shelters. Thousands of people, not just veterans, have been displaced by the storm, and the shelters are packed.\n\nAt the school, a supervisor answers: Yes, there's a veteran here.\n\nThe VA team finds 70-year-old Luis Torres lying in bed. His dress shirt is wide open and his baseball cap is flipped backward. His bed is surrounded by piles of clothing and some bags of food.\n\nThe Air Force veteran was honorably discharged; he has his military ID, but the other paperwork was lost in the storm. “My house ... it disappeared,” he says, breaking down in tears.\n\nHis teenage son, Andrew Torres, who is also staying here, pulls out his phone to show us pictures of what's left of their house. It’s like the roof and the walls were just plucked out. On the second floor, a toilet stands alone in the open.\n\nJanine Smalley takes Luis Torres's vitals. His blood pressure is 130 over 80, so that’s \"perfect,\" she says, asking, \"Do you take any meds?\" Smalley is the VA team’s registered nurse and Disaster Emergency Medical Personnel trained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. She’s here from Cleveland, Ohio. She volunteered to come help. She says when she saw what was happening in Puerto Rico, she asked to be sent here.\n\nMeanwhile, Katie Blanker, who also volunteered for this assignment, brings Torres toothbrushes, heating pads and food. Blanker is from Stevens Point, Wisconsin. She’s a social worker with the VA and a veteran herself.\n\nTorres cheers up. “Where’s the T-bone steak?” he jokes. At least for a few minutes, the mood has lightened up.\n\nLind says that she, too, had been thinking about steak, just the day before. There is a meat shortage on the island. \"I really want to have a meal for my kids that includes beef. That was my goal. To get my kids not canned food. When you have chaos like this, the only right you have is to stay alive. You stay alive, and you survive,\" she says.\n\nLind fights back tears. The others from her team hug her. Then she smiles and announces the next neighborhood they’re heading to: “Let’s go to Rio Grande!”\n\nLet’s go “before we’re all crying. I was hoping to wait till noon to cry again,” Smalley says.\n\nThe next shelter is even more packed than the last one.\n\n“May we come in and ask if anyone is a vet?” Lind asks.\n\nA man says there aren't any vets there.\n\nLind asks the man how he knows.\n\nThe man bristles, saying, “I can’t force them to talk to you.”\n\nLind thanks him, and the team leaves. Later on, in the parking lot, Lind tells me she suspects some shelters just don’t want the VA team coming in. She and her colleagues represent the federal government. And they have to report it if a hurricane shelter isn’t providing enough food and water. Or if it’s overcrowded.\n\nA lot of these shelters are just repurposed schools, places for people to lie down and rest, with no running water or electricity. This is the new normal. Which is why the last shelter we go to takes us a little by surprise.\n\nThe team walks right in. There’s a radio blasting pop music. There are kids painting murals. And then there’s Benny Molina.\n\nThe residents cheer his name as he sits down for a checkup by nurse Smalley. Molina, 61, is a veteran — “National Guard in Riverdale, New Jersey. Specialized in tanks. Driving the tanks,” he says.\n\n“Benny that’s perfect!” interrupts Smalley. Benny’s blood pressure is normal. He jokingly offers to do pushups — in a while — he just had a big meal. The room erupts in laughter.\n\nGhislaine Rivera, a social worker, asks him what happened to his home. It’s gone. Benny lost everything he owned to the storm. The team offers to give him aid packages, with basic supplies, but he refuses. “Right now, we have food and everything ... but some other people are sleeping on the street and they have nothing to eat.”\n\nAs he fills out his paperwork, Smalley and Blanker take a quick break in the shade. They are red from the heat and visibly tired. They’ve come a long way, from Ohio and Wisconsin. But, they say, this is a responsibility they have. All of us do.\n\n“We don’t know them all, but we owe them all,” says Smalley.\n\n“All of the veterans we’re here for served for the United States,” says Blanker. “This is Americans helping Americans. These veterans were stationed in the US, went to war with the US.

Her home had been decimated by Hurricane Maria and she, like thousands of others, had used up what little money she had to try and find a new life in New York. FEMA initially placed her and her children in a single hotel room at a Holiday Inn, but the agency eventually denied her a voucher because she couldn’t prove she had lost her home.\n\nToday, she and her children are stuck in New York’s homeless shelter system. There are still thousands living across the country just like her, and I have to ask myself, “Whose values are guiding our policymakers?” They certainly aren’t the values passed down by my great-grandmother, Abuelita Cookie as we called her, who was born in Puerto Rico in 1893.\n\nShe was 111 years old when she passed away in 2004. She was 5 years old when the United States first invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War. She was 24 when she and all Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens.\n\nIn the 1950s, Abuelita Cookie and my grandmother Abuela Beba were part of a wave of Puerto Ricans who migrated to New York City’s Lower East Side in search of opportunity. But Abuelita never let us forget our roots and never, ever let us leave her house hungry.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nShe regaled me with stories from the homeland.

Sadly, due to America’s gross negligence, we now know what Puerto Rico is like after electricity.\n\nWhen Maria hit last year, I was on the first available flight in November to the island to check on family. My father and his parents still live there, and I grew up spending my summers playing with kids in the streets there.\n\nI remember the sense of dread that filled my chest while driving through Old San Juan, seeing everything still boarded up, split trees, totaled cars, the majority of the island still without power and Constitution Row, the main strip of San Juan, completely decimated.\n\nThere is a sizable retirement community in Vega Baja, where my grandparents live. Both my father and grandfather are cancer survivors with chronic health problems, and I hustled to make sure they both had what they needed. But I watched helplessly as hundreds waited hours to buy a generator, water or food only to be told there were no generators. There was no water. There was no food.\n\nAnd all the while, the United States stood by and our president extolled America’s virtues over a death count it claimed had reached only 16 two weeks after the hurricane had ended. It took nearly a year before U.S. officials would admit that a much larger number had perished; the death toll was actually 2,975 and counting.\n\nPuerto Ricans, and soon residents in North and South Carolina, need this administration to put our tax dollars to good use, which means funding FEMA fully so that we’re providing real housing to taxpayers who need it — rather than diverting that money to pay for placing child refugees at the border in the prisons we call detention centers.\n\nJorge Luis Vasquez Jr. serves as associate counsel for LatinoJustice PRLDEF.

Though hiring reportedly rebounded in 2022, agencies are losing officers faster than they can replace them and total staffing is declining, according to a survey of 182 police agencies across 38 states and Washington from the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\nDepartments that previously never had to worry about filling their academies are paying attention to how they market themselves, according to Alex Johnston, co-founder of Epic Recruiting, a content creation company that works with law enforcement agencies nationwide. Johnston said when departments approach his company for help with marketing, attracting diverse candidates is often a priority.\n\nMore than 14,700 law enforcement agencies employed over 708,000 full-time sworn officers in 2020, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In local police departments, about 14% of full-time sworn officers were women, 14% were Hispanic and 12% were Black. Though experts have said diversity alone is not enough to address all of the issues with policing, some research has shown that Black and Hispanic officers make fewer arrests and use force less often than their white counterparts and female officers take those enforcement actions less often than men.\n\n“If this next generation doesn't choose law enforcement, then we're in a really not only dangerous path, but also a path that's probably going to end in further inequity,” said Andy Saunders, co-founder and CEO of New Blue, which supports officers interested in reform.\n\nSome departments are offering as much as $75,000 in signing bonuses to attract recruits, but Saunders said more money may not be enough to attract diverse candidates. When New Blue first launched, Saunders said he tried to recruit college students of color into the profession, but an analysis of those efforts found that even when they were offered an extra $30,000 a year, many would not commit to policing. He said one of the most powerful reasons given was fear of what their loved ones would think of them.\n\nSaunders said some departments have also tried to attract diverse talent by relaxing grooming requirements or updating the application process.\n\n“Allowing tattoos and dreadlocks does not make Gen Z say, ‘Oh, that was the thing holding me back,’” he said. “It's the deeper values.”\n\nSaunders explained departments may find themselves in something of a Catch-22: they want to hire more diverse candidates, but young people of color may not want to join an organization that is and historically has been predominantly white and male. But, he said, in addition to diversity, Gen Z candidates also value transparency, social justice, and civic engagement and they are more likely to join a department that shares and demonstrates those values.\n\n“Just having a chief say, ‘I agree that law enforcement doesn't currently serve everyone and I would like to recruit diverse folks that can help me solve this issue,’ and then publicly committing to that change can also show Gen Z officers that department is willing to listen to feedback and take action to address their concerns,” he said.\n\nPolice try to entice HBCU students through internships, scholarships, advertising\n\nHBCUs are one of the major targets for police recruiters looking to diversify their ranks. Johnston, of Epic Recruiting, recalled creating a recent ad campaign for the Norfolk Police Department in Virginia aimed at a nearby HBCU that featured several of the department's African American officers.\n\n“We created specific content for that specific audience, and we featured individuals that represented them and could speak to them and inspire them to pursue this as a successful career,” he said.\n\nHowever, recruiting from these schools can be a challenge for some departments. Since 2018, 44 HBCU students have expressed interest in applying for the college scholarship offered by the Winston-Salem Police Department in North Carolina. But after learning about the requirements, which include completing a summer internship and agreeing to work for the department for at least three years after graduation, just five of them applied, according to Kayla Carleton, a recruiting sergeant with the department.\n\n“We're serious about diversity, so we're working hard, and that's why we budgeted for this scholarship,” said Chief William H. Penn Jr. “And we want to give that scholarship out more, so that's been a challenge for us.”\n\nWhile internship programs alone can’t fully solve the nationwide staffing shortage, when they successfully attract candidates, they can be an important part of improving officer recruitment and retention, according to a report from the Police Executive Research Forum. Much like Nwanegwo, every intern who responded to a survey after going through the program agreed the experience had positively changed their opinion of policing in general and as a career, with 65% expressing a desire to apply for a position as a sworn officer, PERF said.\n\n\"By helping students gain a better understanding of both policing and police, internships can also help build public trust in the profession, as the PERF-HBCU Internship Program showed,\" the report said.\n\nDepartments look for bilingual recruits in Puerto Rico\n\nPolice departments in several states including Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, South Carolina, Texas, and Tennessee have announced plans to attract more Spanish-speaking officers through recruiting in Puerto Rico. Dallas Police Department Chief Eddie Garcia, who was born on the island, has gone back with his department twice in search of recruits and plans to return in April.\n\n“Nearly half of our population here in Dallas is Latino and there are a lot of individuals that are Spanish-speaking,” Garcia said. “It's incredibly important for us to ensure that we have as diverse a workforce as we can possibly have.”\n\nGarcia said some of the recruits he encounters are hesitant to move to the state, and the department tries to entice them by offering assistance with housing and bringing the other officers from the area, “so that these young men and women from Puerto Rico can see people that resemble themselves, that took the chance, got it and are successful.”\n\nMuch like the efforts aimed at HBCUs, not all of the campaigns targeting Latinos are successful. In July, officials in the city of Memphis went to Puerto Rico to fill positions at the police department and other agencies and no one was hired, the Daily Memphian reported.\n\n“It was a strategy used by some other cities – Louisville, Dallas, and Baltimore – to recruit bilingual employees,” city spokesperson Arlenia Cole said in a statement to USA TODAY. “However, it was not successful for us.”\n\nThe Prince George’s County Police Department in Maryland has had to put plans for a recruiting trip to Puerto Rico on hold, but in the meantime, the agency is making a \"concerted effort\" to reach out to the local community, according to spokesperson Brian Fischer.\n\n“We try to reach out to our Hispanic residents in Spanish and on a vehicle like Telemundo and Univision,” Fischer said.\n\nNina Medina, president of the Latino Peace Officers Association, said the group is also working with local police agencies to spread the word about job openings to its members and mentor recruits through the process. Medina said it is important to not focus on one group of Latinos when thinking about the challenges of increasing diversity in the profession.\n\n“We're not just talking about Mexican Americans. We're also talking about Puerto Ricans, people from Honduras, Guatemala,” said Medina, a retired detective from the San Diego Police Department. “We're talking about Latinos across the nation.”\n\nHundreds of agencies join initiative to recruit more women\n\nMore than 360 law enforcement agencies around the country have signed onto the 30x30 initiative, a campaign that aims to get police recruit classes to have 30% women by 2030, according to co-founder Maureen McGough. McGough, executive director of the Excellence in Policing and Public Safety Program at the University of South Carolina’s School of Law, said advocates aren’t simply telling departments to hire more women but to think more critically about the skills needed for fair and effective policing.\n\n“If you do that, we're very confident, you'll see an increase in the representation of women in your ranks,” she said.\n\nEffective changes in recruitment could include looking beyond criminal justice majors or military veterans and targeting nurses, psychologists and educators, rethinking when and how recruits are tested on certain physical fitness requirements and making marketing campaigns more accurately reflect the community service aspects of policing, McGough said.\n\n“When I first started getting into this work in 2018, I heard the story about a law enforcement agency, they didn't have any aviation assets, they didn't even have a drone, but the commercial that they put out to get people to go work for them was a giant dude hanging out of a helicopter with guns strapped to his chest, right,” she said. “So that's reaching a very small subset of the population with a message that isn't accurate about what policing is and what it takes to do it well.”\n\nOne of the first 25 agencies to join the 30x30 initiative was the Mesa Police Department in Arizona. The department has built a recruitment team with several women, including Elisha Gibbs, who said she is working to do more outreach and education in the community to help potential female recruits better understand what police work entails.\n\nThat outreach includes targeted advertisements that help illustrate the department’s commitment to work/life balance, something she's heard women who have or want children are concerned about. While some departments have changed or eliminated certain physical requirements that presented a barrier to women, Gibbs said she’s focused on helping female recruits learn the proper technique to passing a test that once intimidated her: scaling a 6-foot wall.\n\nSince 2020, the number of female officers in the department has risen from 90 to 113. Though the increase is small, Gibbs said the new approach has helped.\n\n“Getting them in on ride-a-longs, if they apply and they’re in the process, bringing them in and talking to them, showing them videos, putting it out on our social media or TikTok or Instagram the different jobs that you can have throughout the profession has been a really big help or push to break past those barriers,” she said.\n\nMcGough acknowledged that there’s more work to be done to reach the thousands of law enforcement agencies in the U.S. To make the biggest impact, she said her organization is trying to target state-level agencies and ensure their work is intentionally intersectional, despite a “frustrating lack” of research on how the experiences of female law enforcement officers of different ethnic and racial groups differ.\n\n“We've got to make sure that we stay committed to that intersectional analysis because we know that women aren't a homogenous group and we want to make sure everybody's unique needs are met and everyone's unique value is understood and celebrated,” she said.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/11/04/after-hurricane-fiona-puerto-rico-debates-best-recovery-plan-poor/10531488002/", "title": "After Hurricane Fiona, Puerto Rico debates best recovery plan for poor", "text": "Some Puerto Ricans are worried Hurricane Fiona recovery aid won't be distributed fairly to communities across the island.\n\n“We had Hurricane Maria five years ago, and we saw how structural racism and inequities put our most vulnerable communities in danger,” said one resident. “But now we’re seeing it all happen again.”\n\nRecent policy changes reflect lessons learned from Hurricane Maria. Compared to that storm, more than 100,000 more survivors have received aid so far after Fiona, a FEMA spokesperson said.\n\nWeeks after Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico, floodwaters have mostly receded in the hard-hit town of Loíza, but mud, debris and collapsed roofs remain. Power has been restored in some areas but is still unstable.\n\n“Families have lost everything,” said Gloriann Sacha Antonetty Lebrón, founder of Revista Étnica, Puerto Rico's first magazine for Black women and a leader of a mutual aid operation providing support to Loíza.\n\nYet when President Joe Biden initially approved an emergency declaration after the hurricane, Loíza and many other hard-hit communities were not included, experts told USA TODAY. The exclusion prompted concerns that the recovery effort will once again leave behind some of Puerto Rico's poorest areas five years after those same communities struggled to receive federal and local disaster aid when Hurricane Maria pummeled the U.S. territory.\n\nThe Hurricane Fiona emergency declaration originally included 55 municipalities, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In the days after the disaster, communities were added to the declaration until the most recent version included all 78 municipalities, including Loíza.\n\nThe initial disaster declaration was \"based on the available data and assessments at the time,\" Jeremy Edwards, the agency's press secretary, said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"The intent was to get resources to survivors as quickly as possible. As the assessments continued and were completed, additional municipalities were added.\"\n\nBut among many communities initially excluded, there is still a feeling of being left behind that builds on the trauma of Hurricane Maria, experts said.\n\n“We had Hurricane Maria five years ago, and we saw how structural racism and inequities put our most vulnerable communities in danger,” Lebrón said. “But now we’re seeing it all happen again.”\n\nWhat happened after Hurricane Maria?\n\nFor many Puerto Ricans, Hurricane Fiona was a grim reminder of the disaster that struck five years before when Hurricane Maria, the deadliest natural disaster on the island in 100 years, left about 3,000 people dead and shattered the country’s electrical system.\n\nWhile parts of the San Juan metropolitan area had power within days of the hurricane, many communities, often more rural and poorer municipalities, waited more than 300 days for power restoration crews to be sent to their communities, said Fernando Tormos-Aponte, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTormos-Aponte’s research, based on power restoration data and published in the journal Energy Policy last year, found that vulnerable communities and communities that were not as supportive of Puerto Rico’s governing party in previous elections were significantly less likely to be prioritized in relief efforts. The study used a social vulnerability index from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on factors including poverty levels and minority status.\n\nTOURISM IN PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico crippled with closures and outages post-Fiona. What travelers can expect\n\nThe study found the more affluent Condado in San Juan had power restored in less than 40 days, while the nearby Luis Lloréns Torres public housing project waited more than 100 days. And about 62% of the municipalities that went more than 150 days before power restoration crews were deployed to them were municipalities that did not support the governing party in the previous election.\n\n“These systems that govern how we respond to disasters can be unequal by design and they tend to exclude marginalized communities, to neglect them,” said Tormos-Aponte, who moved to the mainland United States from Puerto Rico in 2011.\n\nThere are “major discrepancies in the way Puerto Rico has prioritized the response to Maria and Fiona,” said Miguel O. Román, a climate scientist with research company Leidos based in Virginia who uses satellite images to spot persistent power outages.\n\nRomán's research shows rural and poorer municipalities shouldered the longest outages after Hurricane Maria. He said first responders arriving in Puerto Rico start by settling in crisis centers that are concentrated in the island’s wealthier tourist centers.\n\n“Looking at what happened after Hurricane Maria and the inequities that existed can help us understand how different degrees of damage impacts specific communities and what the needs are for different communities,” Román said. “We need to learn from Hurricane Maria.”\n\nNational research has shown disasters often exacerbate existing disparities marginalized communities face and “have more lasting impacts on communities that were disadvantaged prior to the disaster,” according to a 2022 report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which reviewed federal responses to Hurricanes Harvey and Maria.\n\nA reason cited by the report is that damage assessments are based on property ownership, which leads to concentrating federal resources in wealthier areas, said Kathleen Tierney, a research professor at the Institute of Behavioral Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. Disaster aid also typically makes up a small proportion of the funds needed for individual recovery and the remaining funding comes from loans that are \"extremely burdensome and difficult to access,\" she said.\n\nPuerto Rico has little political representation on mainland U.S., which makes it more vulnerable to being sidelined, Tierney said.\n\nAs a result, federal disaster aid “is wholly inadequate in terms of recovery,” she said.\n\nRepeating history in Puerto Rico?\n\nThere are already signs history is repeating itself, Tormos-Aponte said. In the initial emergency declaration, nine of the excluded municipalities – Hormigueros, San Sebastian, Moca, Rincon, Aguaba, Isabela, Quebradillas, Hatillo, Barceloneta – were also those with the highest levels of social vulnerability on the island, he said. Many of them also were led by opposition party leaders.\n\nRomán said he immediately thought of his grandmother in Hormigueros when the first declaration was released.\n\n'WE OWE PUERTO RICO A HELL OF A LOT': Biden visits to assess Fiona recovery efforts\n\n“Her home was underwater, but her community was not included in the first declaration,” he said.\n\nFEMA has since mobilized more than 30 disaster recovery centers on the island, including in Rincon, Isabela and Barceloneta, Edwards said. He said the agency collects data to determine what communities may be most vulnerable, including low-income populations and people 65 and older.\n\nIn addition, hundreds of FEMA representatives going door to door to help survivors apply for assistance have visited all Puerto Rican municipalities, he said.\n\nEdwards said these efforts and recent policy changes meant to expand criteria for aid eligibility and simplify eligibility verification processes for people seeking aid reflect lessons learned from Hurricane Maria. Compared with Maria, more than 100,000 more survivors have received aid so far after Fiona, he said.\n\n\"FEMA remains committed to helping survivors recover from Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico, ensuring that they have equal access to our programs and that the federal disaster assistance process is more accessible,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nRomán applauded the efforts and expressed hope that FEMA under President Joe Biden's administration has made progress in addressing equity in aid response, though more work is needed.\n\nDespite some improvements since past disasters, Elvia Meléndez-Ackerman, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Puerto Rico, said low-income, rural and minority communities in Puerto Rico are once again being left behind in crisis response, leading many to leave Puerto Rico altogether. She said that of the University of Puerto Rico’s 11 campuses, three are in cities initially excluded but were among the hardest-hit. All three are also governed by opposing parties, she said.\n\n\"Some communities are being emptied out,\" she said. \"Many are buying plane tickets and leaving. And those that stay, they are left to repair their homes with little help.\"\n\n'It sends a message that some lives don't matter'\n\nLoíza, a town on the island’s northeastern coast known for its African heritage and for having one of the largest Black populations on the island, is “a snapshot” of these inequities, said Tania Rosario-Méndez, executive director of Taller Salud Inc., a feminist social justice advocacy organization supporting grassroots aid in the area.\n\nRosario-Méndez said Puerto Rico’s poor, rural and Afro-Latino communities are bearing the brunt of the crisis without adequate aid. She said Loíza’s initial exclusion from the declaration was an early sign the town, with roofs still covered with blue tarps from Hurricane Maria, may be left behind again.\n\n“The shock of having your home 5 feet underwater and then seeing that your community isn't even listed on the disaster declaration – that hits you,” she said. “It was violent. I can't express the shock.”\n\nShe is thankful the declaration was amended, “but that feeling still lingers,” especially after local governments and organizations had to fight to prove they needed aid amid an unfolding crisis, she said.\n\n“You realize that if you don't fight, you lose the possibility of surviving in a dignified manner. ... It sends a message that some lives don't matter,” she said.\n\nIn the first week after Hurricane Fiona, Lebrón of Revista Étnica said she only saw one FEMA truck in Loíza. As a result, Lebrón said, neighbors and community groups are working together to fill in the gaps, creating mutual aid networks to help rebuild homes, repair water damage and share food.\n\n\"We're doing this work because governments have not been here for these communities,\" Lebrón said.\n\nHow can disaster relief be improved?\n\nTo better protect vulnerable communities after disasters, experts told USA TODAY, utility companies and governments should move away from prioritizing power restoration based on only how densely populated an area is. Authorities should identify the most vulnerable communities as priorities for power restoration, they said.\n\nPUERTO RICO INDEPENDENCE EFFORTS: After Hurricane Fiona, will Puerto Rico ever become a state or an independent nation?\n\n“The problem with that is that utility officials usually don't take into consideration race, gender, ethnicity, class and economics,” Tormos-Aponte said. “By virtue of ignoring these things and using only the density-based approach, they may be reproducing inequalities that already exist.”\n\nOther steps include changing the federal aid application process to be less burdensome for municipalities already struggling during a crisis and more accessible to areas without ready access to internet and Spanish-speaking communities. More data transparency and long-term data collection on how aid is allocated, especially among marginalized communities, also would make a difference, experts said.\n\n“It's a matter of life or death,” Lebrón said. “We all deserve the opportunity to live in wellness and dignity. Our people deserve better.”\n\nContact Christine Fernando at cfernando@usatoday.com or follow her on Twitter at @christinetfern.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}]}

Boosted by a 60-foot-tall rocket, they soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. Their capsule vaulted past the Kármán Line at 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) altitude, which is widely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins. And at the peak of the flight, they experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and, out their window, sweeping Earthly views.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the trip cost the five paying customers. Blue Origin has not publicly disclosed a fixed per-seat price point, though it had auctioned off a ticket for $28 million. But that was for a seat to ride alongside Bezos himself, and the auction winner didn’t end up going. (He is slated to fly later this year, however.) Blue Origin’s direct competitor, Virgin Galactic, is currently selling seats for $450,000, up from its previous price point of around $250,000.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31. It includes Marty Allen, Sharon Hagle, Marc Hagle, Jim Kitchen, Gary Lai, and Dr. George Nield. Blue Origin\n\nThis flight had been slated to include Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, but he dropped out of the mission after Blue Origin announced a schedule change earlier this month. The company cited the need for additional ground tests on the New Shepard rocket as the reason for the delay.\n\nGary Lai, who has been with Blue Origin for 18 years and holds several patents related to the New Shepard rocket’s design, flew in Davidson’s place and was the sole non-paying customer on the flight. Lai’s crewmates included Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer, and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31.

Blue Origin\n\nThe passengers’ New Shepard capsule, which is fully autonomous, deployed plumes of parachutes after diving back into the thickest part of the Earth’s atmosphere and landed with a puff of sand in the Texas desert.\n\nOn the livestream, the passengers could be heard cheering as the capsule made its touchdown, and moments later, they exited the capsule, smiling and waving.\n\n“It was intense, and I did get a little bit of a feeling of vertigo,” Lai told Blue Origin’s Sarah Knights, who heads communications with the passengers during flight. “I did feel a little bit nauseous, for sure.”\n\nOther passengers on the livestream described the view as “incredible.”\n\n“Unreal, just unreal,” Allen said. “I can’t put it into words.”\n\n“It was an out-of-body experience,” Kitchen said. He described outer space as the “blackest black I’ve ever seen,” adding that it was “breathtaking.” Nield called it “the thrill of a lifetime.”\n\n“Pictures don’t do it justice,” he added.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nBusiness activity in space — largely led by SpaceX — is booming. From building cheaper rockets and designing new uses for satellites to imagining futuristic space hotels, the industry has attracted record levels of investment, according to data collected by analytics firm Space Capital.\n\nAfter years of quiet development, Blue Origin’s space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, as well as his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer.\n\nSince then, Blue Origin made headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan.\n\nStrahan wrote a message for the passengers on Thursday’s flight that was read to them by ground control: “This is the best ride you will ever have, but it’s way too short.”\n\nBlue Origin’s goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joyride to invited guests — who thus far have mostly been celebrities — and anyone else who can afford it.\n\nBlue Origin is the first company to begin offering regular suborbital space tourism flights. Its chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, notably had its first crewed flight — which included founder Richard Branson — before Bezos’ flight last July. But Virgin Galactic has yet to follow up that flight with another crewed flight after it later became clear that the company’s space plane had traveled out of its designated flight path. The company now says it’s undergoing unrelated technology upgrades and may return to flight later this year.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31. It includes Marty Allen, Sharon Hagle, Marc Hagle, Jim Kitchen, Gary Lai, and Dr. George Nield. Blue Origin\n\nSpaceX is the only private company that offers trips to orbit. The company completed the first-ever all-civilian flight to orbit last September, taking a billionaire and three of his chosen crewmates on a three-day trip. And next week, the company plans to take four paying customers on a flight to the International Space Station, which orbits about 200 miles above Earth.\n\nBlue Origin does have plans to build a rocket powerful enough to reach orbit, called the New Glenn. And, in light of the news that Russia may no longer sell rocket engines to the United States, those plans are more pressing than ever. The engines Blue Origin plans to use for the New Glenn, the BE-4, will also be used on an upcoming launch vehicle designed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that is responsible for significant US national security launches. ULA currently relies on Russian RD-180 engines. Its new rocket with the US-made BE-4 engines is scheduled to make its debut this year.\n\nBlue Origin did not have specific updates on BE-4 when reached for comment.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/01/tech/space-business-year-in-review-scn/index.html", "title": "2021: The year of billionaires going to space | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nWhen future generations write about the history of space travel, 2021 may well get its own chapter. “The year of the billionaires,” it might be called.\n\nJeff Bezos and Richard Branson each took supersonic joy rides to the edge of space, finally bringing their competing private-sector spacecraft into operation after around two decades of promises. Celebrities such as 90-year-old “Star Trek” actor William Shatner and “Good Morning America” co-host Michael Strahan followed soon after. Another billionaire self-funded a historic, three-day mission aboard a SpaceX orbital capsule that flew higher than any human has traveled in decades.\n\nAnd all that promises to just be the beginning.\n\nThe trio of space billionaires — Branson, Bezos and Elon Musk — have their eyes set squarely on the future. Over the past year, their visions continued to bump up against one another, stirring up plenty of controversy and one-upmanship.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the most memorable moments the commercial space industry had to offer in the last year.\n\nBranson v. Bezos\n\nBranson’s and Bezos’ space companies have for years been working to develop spacecraft capable of taking paying customers on brief, supersonic trips to the edge of space, promising to usher in an age in which booking a flight to view the Earth from space is as easy as jetting across the Atlantic. (Musk’s SpaceX, it should be noted, is not in the suborbital tourism game. Its rockets and spacecraft take much longer and more dangerous treks into Earth’s orbit.)\n\nWe’re not quite there yet. But both billionaires pledged to kick off their respective suborbital space tourism businesses by taking the rides themselves, both as a show of their confidence in their vehicles’ safety and some strategic PR.\n\nJeff Bezos spoke about his flight on Blue Origin's New Shepard into space during a press conference on July 20, 2021 in Van Horn, Texas. Bezos and the crew that flew with him were on the first human spaceflight for the company. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nBezos, founder of the rocket firm Blue Origin, planned to become the first person ever to travel to space aboard a spacecraft his own company developed, setting his sights on a July 20 launch. (Blue Origin even auctioned off a ticket to ride alongside him for a whopping $28 million, though that auction winner did not ultimately fly.)\n\nThen, Branson swooped in, announcing days later that he planned to hop on the next flight of the rocket-powered space plane developed by his company, Virgin Galactic, on July 11 — nine days before Bezos’ mission.\n\nThat set off an immediate wave of speculation that — although Branson has repeatedly said in interviews he doesn’t view his competition with Bezos as a “race” — there was a bitter rivalry brewing behind the scenes.\n\nRichard Branson takes off on July 11, 2021 from a base in New Mexico aboard a Virgin Galactic vessel bound for the edge of space. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBoth billionaires’ flights ended without apparent issue, with the men emerging from their respective spacecraft outfitted in custom flight suits and beaming for the cameras.\n\nAdding to the spectacle, both flights also carried some notable crewmates for the billionaires.\n\nBezos was joined by 82-year-old Wally Funk, who famously trained for NASA’s Mercury program in 1961 but never went to space, and then-18-year-old Oliver Daemen, the son of a wealthy businessman. The pair became the oldest and youngest people, respectively, ever to travel to space. (Funk’s record was bested shortly after by the 90-year-old William Shatner.)\n\nBranson took with him Virgin Galactic executive Sirisha Bandla, who became only the second Indian-born woman to fly to space and back.\n\nShaping up suborbital space\n\nBezos’ successful July launch catapulted the company into a busy rest of the year spent flying some high-profile figures as “honorary guests” — meaning they didn’t have to pay for tickets. Shatner took his suborbital excursion in October, a feat widely celebrated by “Star Trek” fans that was followed by an Amazon video special on the flight. Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the daughter of famed astronaut Alan Shepard, flew in December.\n\nWilliam Shatner and the NS-18 crew inside the capsule, floating around. Blue Origin\n\nWhile Blue Origin was sending celebrities to space, Virgin Galactic faced significant delays. A report from the New Yorker revealed that warning lights had gone off in the cockpit during Branson’s flight and the space plane had traveled outside its designated airspace for 41 seconds. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights pending a review, which concluded in September and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear. Still, the company is delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades.\n\nBlue Origin, meanwhile, has faced its own controversies, though none that have indicated specific safety issues with its rocket or spacecraft.\n\nRather, a group of 21 current and former employees co-signed a letter alleging the company operates a toxic work environment where “professional dissent” is “actively stifled.” Blue Origin responded to the claims by saying it has “no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind.”\n\nInspiration4 flies higher\n\nThough Musk does not have any apparent plans to join one of SpaceX’s missions, his company continued to prove its technology chops. It drastically expanded its space-based internet service, Starlink, growing the constellation to include roughly 2,000 satellites. Its Dragon spacecraft also launched and returned astronauts to and from the International Space Station this year, and it topped the billionaire space tourism competition with a historic space tourism mission of its own.\n\nSpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission, self-funded by billionaire payments platform CEO Jared Isaacman, sent Isaacman and three other people, none of whom were professional astronauts, on a three-day trip to orbit that traveled even higher than the International Space Station — higher than any human has traveled this century.\n\nThe passengers floated around the capsule, played songs, created works of art and kept in touch with ground control as their 13-foot-wide capsule whisked around the planet once about every 90 minutes, traveling at more than 17,500 miles per hour.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Inspiration4 crew launched from Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida on September 15, 2021. Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe mission was intended to raise money for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, a cause to which Isaacman donated $125 million and a public fundraiser fetched more than $118 million. Musk promised to donate $50 million.\n\nThe whole thing went off (almost) without a hitch.\n\nStill, all the billionaires-in-space news generated plenty of backlash, including from high-profile figures such as the United Nations secretary general and Prince William.\n\nA “disease is spreading in our world today: a malady of mistrust,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in September, adding that includes “billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on earth.”\n\nBezos v. Musk\n\nPlaying out in the background of all the space tourism hype was a tense battle pitting the two wealthiest people on the planet against each other.\n\nBezos and Musk each want their own companies to be at the center of NASA’s plans to return astronauts to the moon this decade. But after initially planning to bring on more than one contractor to build the lunar lander for the job, NASA later said it only had enough money for one — and it went with Musk’s SpaceX. It awarded $2.9 billion to the company.\n\nBlue Origin fought that decision all year, saying NASA unfairly favored SpaceX. Meanwhile, the PR offensives and twitter battles began.\n\nBut a federal judge delivered a major blow to Blue Origin in November by ruling in favor of NASA and SpaceX. That put the future of the Bezos-owned company’s plans to build a lunar lander into question.\n\nThe ordeal highlighted how important government contracts are to the viability of the commercial space industry. Though these companies are private, their revenue streams still rely heavily on taxpayer money.\n\nAnd the battle over NASA’s moon lander contract queued up what are sure to be more high-profile battles and an interesting few years ahead, as NASA and its contractors map out a path back to the lunar surface for the first time in half a century.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/01/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/12/blue-origin-spaceflights-new-shepard-rocket/83007319007/", "title": "What to know about Blue Origin spacecraft sending celebrities to ...", "text": "Named after astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American in space, the New Shepard is composed of both a rocket and a crew capsule and is designed to be fully reusable.\n\nThe New Shepard's crew capsule can hold up to six people for a brief voyage to the edge of space where they can experience a few minutes of weightlessness and incredible views of Earth.\n\nNew Shepard doesn't just take celebrities on joy rides to the edge of space. Blue Origin regularly launches it with scientific payloads and other cargo on board from paying customers, including NASA.\n\nBlue Origin's famed New Shepard launch vehicle is on the cusp of ferrying its next crew of celebrities and notable people to the edge of space, where its passengers will have a front-row seat of Earth from more than 60 miles high.\n\nThe commercial spaceflights are ones billionaire Jeff Bezos's space technology company has been offering since 2021, ever since the Amazon founder himself boarded the spacecraft for its maiden crewed voyage. The upcoming flight is also the first in nearly four years with veritable household names that this time includes pop artist Katy Perry and \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King.\n\nThe spacecraft that Perry, King and four other women are set to fly aboard as early as Monday morning is the same one that 52 others have ridden to space on 10 previous human spaceflights. Joining them is civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn and Lauren Sánchez, an Emmy-winning journalist and fiancé of Bezos.\n\nThe New Shepard, composed of both a rocket and crew capsule, will blast off at supersonic speeds after it lifts off from Blue Origin's private ranch facility in west Texas, taking the notable all-women crew high above Earth's atmosphere.\n\nFor nearly four years since its first crewed spaceflight, New Shepard has served as a poignant symbol of Blue Origin's commercial spaceflight ambitions amid a growing space tourism industry. Bezos' company is increasingly becoming a major player in the commercial space arena, competing with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX for NASA's business, as well as the business of other private companies.\n\nHere's everything to know about the New Shepard rocket that will be at the center of what is sure to be a headline-grabbing flight.\n\nBlue Origin launch: Gayle King, Katy Perry among crew of all women launching to space\n\nWhat is the New Shepard spacecraft?\n\nNamed after astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American in space, the gum drop-shaped New Shepard launch vehicle is designed to be fully reusable, with a capsule that returns to Earth via three parachutes. The rocket itself is powered by one BE-3PM engine, which propels it to suborbit before restarting to slow the booster to just 6 mph for a controlled landing back on the launch pad.\n\nThe spacecraft operates autonomously – meaning no pilots are aboard – after taking off from the company's Launch Site One in rural west Texas, more than 140 miles east of El Paso.\n\nBut New Shepard doesn't just take celebrities on joy rides to the edge of space. In fact the majority of spaceflights Blue Origin has conducted to date with New Shepard haven't even had a crew.\n\nBlue Origin has launched the New Shepard plenty of times with scientific payloads and other cargo on board from paying customers, including NASA.\n\nFor instance, in early February, New Shepard successfully simulated the moon's low gravity on board its capsule during a brief flight. On board was cargo belonging to NASA, which helped fund the mission as the U.S. space agency prepares to send humans back to the moon in the years ahead under its Artemis campaign.\n\nHow long will the crew be in space? Here's what happens on a Blue Origin spaceflight\n\nThe New Shepard's crew capsule can hold up to six people for a brief voyage above the Kármán Line – the 62-mile-high internationally recognized boundary of space.\n\nEach spaceflight lasts about 11 minutes from liftoff to capsule touchdown, allowing passengers to experience a few minutes of weightlessness while in microgravity. The capsule also comes outfitted with large windows for them to enjoy the stunning view of Earth.\n\nDuring each launch, the rocket reaches initial speeds exceeding 2,000 mph – much faster than the speed of sound – before the booster separates within a few minutes of takeoff. As the booster lands, firing its engines and using its fins to slow and control its descent, the capsule continues its journey for a few additional minutes.\n\nOnce the capsule makes a parachute-assisted landing in a remote area, a Blue Origin team is deployed to recover the spacecraft and pick up its passengers.\n\nWhen did Blue Origin begin New Shepard launches?\n\nBezos joined the spacecraft's first crewed flight in 2021 as part of the NS-16 mission, which came after New Shepard flew on 15 flights tests beginning in 2012.\n\nWith the vehicle's latest crewed flight Feb. 25, 10 of Blue Origin's 30 missions have now carried people to the edge of space. A total of 52 people have flown on the New Shepard, including four repeat passengers.\n\nHowever, the launch vehicle's spaceflights were paused for nearly two years when the rocket was grounded in September 2022 following a failed mission without a crew on board.\n\nDespite the mishap, Blue Origin officials have insisted that the capsule is designed to safely abort a spaceflight by ejecting from the rocket and deploying parachutes early if needed – as happened in 2022. The rocket itself crashed back to Earth during the flight with no reported injuries or damage.\n\nBlue Origin spaceflights with human aboard then resumed in May 2024 after the Federal Aviation Administration closed its investigation and ordered the company to make 21 corrective actions.\n\nWhat other notable people have flown on Blue Origin launches?\n\nPassengers on Blue Origin's New Shepard have hailed from a variety of backgrounds, and have included tech executives, entrepreneurs, scientists and even a few well-known celebrities.\n\nIn 2021, both \"Star Trek\" actor William Shatner and NFL legend Michael Strahan boarded the New Shepard on separate flights.\n\nShatner, who was 90 at the time, embarked on his voyage Oct. 13 that year, becoming the oldest person to ever make a spaceflight. He was joined by former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, a Blue Origin vice president Audrey Powers and entrepreneur Glen de Vries.\n\nWhen the crew safely landed back on Earth several minutes later, Shatner could be heard saying the experience was \"unlike anything they described.\"\n\nStrahan's spaceflight then came toward the end of 2021 on Dec. 11, when he flew with a crew that included Laura Shepard Churchley, Alan Shepard's daughter. Also on the flight were tech CEO Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, venture capitalist Lane Bess and his child, Cameron Bess.\n\nAfter the flight, Strahan took to Instagram to say \"it was surreal.\"\n\nBlue Origin also developing massive New Glenn rocket\n\nBlue Origin also is developing its massive New Glenn rocket, which launched in January on its maiden flight.\n\nThe 320-foot-tall heavy-lift launch vehicle, which launched without a crew on Jan. 16 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, is meant to challenge SpaceX in regularly deploying satellites and other cargo into orbit.\n\nNamed after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, New Glenn rivals SpaceX's 400-foot Starship in size. Its first stage, powered by seven Blue Origin engines known as BE-4, is designed to be reusable for 25 missions.\n\n(This story has been updated to correct a misspelling/typo.)\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAstronauts have for decades described their trips to space as “breathtaking” and humbling, a reminder of the Earth’s fragility and humanity’s need to serve as stewards of our home planet.\n\nActor William Shatner, who joined a suborbital space tourism flight last year, experienced the same phenomenon, but he had a very distinct observation when he turned his gaze from the Earth to black expanse of the cosmos: “All I saw was death,” he wrote in a new book.\n\nShatner’s biography, called “Boldly Go,” which he co-wrote with TV and film writer Joshua Brandon, is filled with similarly grim anecdotes about Shatner’s experience bolting above the Earth’s atmosphere aboard a real-life rocket after his memorable stint playing a spaceship captain on the 1960s TV show “Star Trek” and several franchise movies in the following decades.\n\n“I saw a cold, dark, black emptiness. It was unlike any blackness you can see or feel on Earth. It was deep, enveloping, all-encompassing. I turned back toward the light of home. I could see the curvature of Earth, the beige of the desert, the white of the clouds and the blue of the sky. It was life. Nurturing, sustaining, life. Mother Earth. Gaia. And I was leaving her,” reads an excerpt from “Boldly Go” that was first published by Variety.\n\n“Everything I had thought was wrong,” it reads. “Everything I had expected to see was wrong.”\n\nWhile he had expected to be awed at the vision of the cosmos, seen without the filter of the Earth’s atmosphere, he instead became overwhelmed by the idea that humans are slowly destroying our home planet. He felt one of the strongest feelings of grief he’s ever encountered, Shatner wrote.\n\nShatner’s book was released October 4 by publishing house Simon & Schuster. CNN interviewed him in June about the book, his trip to space with the Jeff Bezos-backed space tourism company Blue Origin, and what’s next for the 91-year-old. A transcript of the interview, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nCNN: We all saw how emotional you were when you stepped out of the Blue Origin spacecraft after landing. How did that experience change you?\n\nWilliam Shatner: Fifty-five or 60 years ago I read a book called “Silent Spring” by Rachel Carson. She wrote about the environmental issues that are still happening today. I’ve been a verbal ecologist since then. I’ve been aware of the changing Earth and my apprehension for all of us.\n\nIt’s like somebody owing money on a mortgage, and they don’t have the payments. And they think, “Oh, well, let’s go to dinner and not think about it.”\n\nBut it’s so omnipresent! The possibilities of an apocalypse are so real. It’s hard to convince people — and especially certain political people — that this is not on our doorstep any longer. It’s in the house.\n\nWhen I got up to space, I wanted to get to the window to see what it was that was out there. I looked at the blackness of space. There were no dazzling lights. It was just palpable blackness. I believed I saw death.\n\nAnd then I looked back at the Earth. Given my background and having read a lot of things about the evolution of Earth over 5 billion years and how all the beauty of nature has evolved, I thought about how we’re killing everything.\n\nI felt this overwhelming sadness for the Earth.\n\nI didn’t realize it until I got down. When I stepped out of the spacecraft, I started crying. I didn’t know why. It took me hours to understand why I was weeping. I realized I was in grief for the Earth.\n\nI don’t want to ever forget, nor have I forgotten, the momentousness of that occasion.\n\nCNN: What else have you realized about the experience in the months since you took your spaceflight?\n\nShatner: I had an awareness that human beings may be the only species alive on this planet that is aware of the enormity and the majesty of the universe.\n\nThink about what we’ve discovered in just the last 100 years given the 200,000 years that humans have existed. We’ve discovered how mountains have formed, the Big Bang. And I kept thinking about how mankind is evolving rapidly into a knowledgeable creature at the same time it’s killing itself.\n\nIt’s a race.\n\nCNN: Space tourism companies such as Blue Origin have also received a lot of criticism from people who view those efforts as more of a vanity project for wealthy individuals rather than something that can be truly transformational. How do you respond to that criticism?\n\nShatner: The whole idea here is to get people accustomed to going to space, as if it’s like going to the Riviera. It’s not only a vanity – it’s a business.\n\nBut what Jeff Bezos wants to do and what is slowly accruing because of our familiarity with space is get those polluting industries up into orbit and get the earth back to what it was. (Editor’s note: Bezos has routinely talked about moving heavy industries into orbit to help preserve the Earth, and that idea also has its skeptics and critics.)\n\nCNN: What do you think about the ‘astronaut’ title. Are people who pay for brief, suborbital flights to space astronauts?\n\nShatner: I call them half astronauts.\n\nCNN: What should we be doing in space next?\n\nShatner: The ability to go to Mars which is lurking in the background, which I think that should take a backseat to going to the moon, setting up the moon as a base and mining whatever the moon has to offer, rather than mining it here.\n\nThose are just my own opinions. What’s-his-name would not agree. He wants to go to Mars. (Editor’s note: SpaceX CEO Elon Musk founded his company with the goal of setting up a colony on Mars.)\n\nStar Trek actor William Shatner speaks to the news media after his flight with three others in a capsule powered by Blue Origin's reusable rocket engine New Shepard on a landing pad near Van Horn, Texas, on October 13, 2021. Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nCNN: Are you are you anxious to go back to space?\n\nShatner: If you had a great love affair, could you go back? Or would that demean it?\n\nCNN: You mentioned you got a chance to speak with famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking before he died. What was that experience like?\n\nShatner: I was never able to ask him about String Theory, which I wanted to. We had to get him all the questions in advance. And he had said when we made the arrangement, ‘I want to ask Shatner a question.’\n\nFinally, I’m leaning in, you know, we’re sitting side by side looking at the cameras.\n\nSo he laboriously typed out, ‘What is your favorite Star Trek episode?’ which is the question every fan asks, and I started laughing. He didn’t have the ability to laugh (because of his degenerative disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS).\n\nBut his laughter showed in the redness of his face and he got so red. He then invited me to dinner. I had a beautiful moment with him.\n\nCNN: What are you doing next?\n\nShatner: I should take the opportunity to say I have an album out there called “Bill.” And I kept making songs with my collaborators. The song “So Fragile, So Blue,” is very much about my experience in space. I recently performed with (musician) Ben Folds at the Kennedy Center. That could be a TV show or an album.\n\nI also have a really wonderful show called “The UnXplained” on the on the History Channel.\n\nAnd then I have my book, called “Boldly Go,” coming out in the fall.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2023/06/23/what-missing-titanic-submarine-means-space-tourism/70342979007/", "title": "Titan submersible: How space tourism will be affected by the tragedy", "text": "A deep sense of adventure and daring.

The announcement comes after CNN confirmed earlier that Davidson was in talks with the company for a seat aboard its supersonic rocket, which launches vertically from a rural Texas launch pad on Bezos’ ranch.\n\nAfter years of quiet development, Blue Origin’s space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer.\n\nSince then, Blue Origin has been making headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan.\n\nBlue Origin’s goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joy ride to welcomed guests — which thus far have mostly been celebrities — and anyone else who can afford it.\n\nDavidson will be joined on his flight by five paying customers. They include Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit.\n\nThe crew will spend a few days training at Blue Origin’s facilities in West Texas before the flight day, when they’ll climb into the New Shepard crew capsule that sits atop the rocket. After liftoff, the rocket will tear past the speed of sound, and near the top of its flight path, will detach from the capsule. As the rocket booster heads back toward the Earth for an upright landing, the crewed capsule will continue soaring higher into the atmosphere to more than 60 miles above the surface where the blackness of space is visible and the capsule’s windows will offer sweeping views of the Earth.\n\nAs the flight reaches its apex, the passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Bezos notably spent his time in weightlessness throwing Skittles and flipping around in the cabin. Others have been glued to the window.\n\nAs gravity begins to pull the capsule back toward the ground, the passengers will again experience intense g-forces before sets of parachutes are deployed to slow the vehicle down. It will then touch down at less than 20 miles per hour in the Texas desert.\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard lifts off from the launch pad carrying 90-year-old Star Trek actor William Shatner and three other civilians on October 13, 2021 near Van Horn, Texas. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nBecause the flights are suborbital — meaning the don’t generate enough speed or take the right trajectory to avoid being immediately dragged back down by Earth’s gravity — the whole show will last only about 10 minutes.\n\nBlue Origin is the first company to begin offering regular suborbital space tourism flights. Its chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, notably had its first crewed flight — which included founder Richard Branson — before Bezos’ flight last July. But Virgin Galactic has yet to follow up that flight with another crewed flight after it later became clear that the company’s space plane had traveled out of its designated flight path. The company now says its undergoing unrelated technology upgrades and may return to flight later this year.\n\nSpaceX is the only private company that offers trips to orbit. The company completed the first-ever all-civilian flight to orbit last September, taking a billionaire and three chosen crewmates on a three-day trip. And later this month, the company plans to take four paying customers on a flight to the International Space Station, which orbits about 200 miles above Earth.\n\nBlue Origin does have plans to build a rocket powerful enough to reach orbit, called New Glenn. And, in light of the news that Russia may no longer sell rocket engines to the United States, those plans are more pressing than ever. The engines Blue Origin plans to use for New Glenn, the BE-4, will also be used on an upcoming launch vehicle designed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that is responsible for significant US national security launches.

I really believe everyone who wants should have this opportunity.\"\n\nWatch liftoff of Blue Origin's New Shepard\n\nThe scheduled New Shepard flight lifted off at 9:07 a.m. ET into cloudy skies from Bezos' Launch Site One in rural West Texas over 140 miles east of El Paso.\n\n\"A successful crewed mission,\" the NASA-awarded company posted on X after the flight .\n\nFlight marked 26th in New Shepard program, 8th mission to carry people\n\nThe New Shepard flight marked the 26th in the program's history, according to Blue Origin, and the eighth mission to carry people.\n\nNew Shepard flights, which take place on a fully reusable suborbital rocket system, last 10 to 12 minutes from liftoff to capsule touchdown, according to the Washington-state based company.\n\nWho else was on the Blue Origin launch?\n\nIn addition to Jahangir, also on board: entrepreneurs Eugene Grin, Ephraim Rabin, and Nicolina Elrick; Rob Ferl, a professor and director of the Astraeus Space Institute at the University of Florida; and Karsen Kitchen − a 21-year-old college student now the youngest woman ever to cross the Kármán line (the start of outer space).\n\nKitchen, a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is majoring in communications and astronomy. After graduating, she plans to pursue a career in the space industry, according to her Blue Origin online bio.\n\nWhen was the last Blue Origin flight?\n\nThe most recent mission took place on May 19, following a nearly two-year layoff after a previous failed uncrewed test flight by the space exploration company.\n\nThe rocket, which flies cargo and humans on short trips to the edge of space, had been grounded since a fall 2022 mission failed in Texas about a minute after liftoff, forcing the rocket's capsule full of NASA experiments to eject mid-flight, as previously reported by the El Paso Times, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nNo injuries were reported when the rocket crashed back to earth, per the Federal Aviation Administration, which announced it would open an investigation in the incident.\n\nFulfilling a life-long dream\n\nBefore moving to Nashville at age 4, the doctor lived \"in war-torn Iran looking up into the sky for rockets as his family hustled to safety in a basement after air raid sirens went off in capital of Tehran,\" the Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nBut he was not scared. He was fascinated.\n\nFast forward to adulthood and Jahangir got a spot on Blue Origin's rocket, but it was no easy feat.\n\nHe applied five times and made it to final interviews, but was rejected. He ended up joining an online space community called MOONDao that crowdfunded two spots on Blue Origin's tourist flights.\n\nOn April 9, Jahangir told USA TODAY, he learned he'd been selected to blast off into space − a life-long dream.\n\nThis week, his parents, his wife, their two children and his brother, fellow Vanderbilt physician Dr. Alex Jahangir, all made the trip to The Lone Star State to watch his dream come true.\n\nFor more information about flying on New Shepard visit BlueOrigin.com.\n\nContributing: Brad Schmitt, The Tennessean\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

Liftoff is planned for 8 a.m. Central Time on Tuesday, July 20.\n\nAccess to the launch site and the rocket's landing pad are restricted, with public viewing limited to a live stream.\n\nMembers of the public will also be prevented from gathering by the side of state highway 54, as they have to glimpse previous launches: the Texas Department of Transportation says the public can expect road closures between 7 and 11 a.m., with details still being worked out as of Friday.\n\nA live stream will be available on Blue Origin's website, http://blueorigin.com/, beginning 6:30 a.m. Central Time.\n\nIn nearby Van Horn, a public watch party is planned at the Karen D. Young Auditorium at 801 Houston St. beginning at 7:30 a.m. Central Time. The event is free.\n\nWho's on the crew?\n\nJeff Bezos, 57, is Blue Origin's founder. Bezos founded Amazon, the dominant online sales and cloud services company, in 1994. According to the Forbes wealth index, his net worth stands at over $200 billion, making him the richest man in the world.\n\nMark Bezos, 53, is Jeff Bezos' younger brother, and likely a multimillionaire in his own right. According to a Business Insider profile, Mark Bezos cofounded a private equity firm, has been active in nonprofit leadership and is a volunteer firefighter in New York's Westchester County.\n\nOliver Daemen, 18, will soon begin his first year at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, where he plans to study physics and innovation management, according to the release by Blue Origin. He will be the youngest person yet to travel to space, and Blue Origin's first paying customer. He takes the place of the anonymous winner of a $28 million auction for a seat on the New Shepard, who had a reported scheduling conflict.\n\nMary Wallace \"Wally\" Funk, 82, was among the female pilots who trained as astronauts in the 1960's, known as the \"Mercury 13,\" but were not selected for NASA missions. A champion of female inclusion on space flight crews, Funk was invited by Bezos to be an honored guest on Tuesday's flight.\n\nWhat's at stake for Blue Origin?\n\nBezos and his crew of civilian astronauts will fly on July 20, the anniversary of the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing.\n\nIf successful, Blue Origin will become the second private company to fly regular passengers into space, and the first to do so on a reusable rocket and capsule.\n\nEven if aborted, the mission may demonstrate the safety of New Shepard's flight system. Minutes after vertical takeoff, the crew capsule separates from the rocket, providing its crew of up to six people a few minutes of weightlessness and a view of the Earth's curvature.\n\nThe rocket, meanwhile, lands itself on a pad back in Culberson County, Texas.\n\nNew Shepard, which does not have pilots on board, has been flight tested 15 times without a crew since 2012, including abort and escape tests. The capsule is designed to separate from the rocket at any point and parachute to a safe landing.\n\nTopping competitor Virgin Galactic\n\nIt will also be an opportunity for Bezos to top his rivals in what has been a race for space by private, billionaire-funded rocket companies.\n\nIn 2015, Blue Origin was the first reusable rocket to complete a soft ground landing, edging out Elon Musk's SpaceX by weeks.\n\nIts other competitor, Virgin Galactic, has achieved crew flights to space using a different technology that reaches lower altitudes than New Shepard.\n\nInstead of a rocket that launches vertically, Virgin Galactic uses a horizontal launch system in which a large aircraft flies the space plane VSS Unity to an altitude of 50,000 feet before releasing it.\n\nThe Unity then engages its rocket in mid-air, climbing vertically to an apogee exceeding 50 miles above sea level before falling back to Earth in a glide landing.\n\nAlthough the American space agency NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration recognize 50 miles as the threshold of space, internationally many agencies place the line at 100 km or 62 miles, known as the Kármán Line.\n\nThat means Blue Origin can claim that, while Branson flew first, Bezos is actually the first to pass the internationally recognized line.\n\nIn the days leading up to Virgin Galactic's launch, Blue Origin's official Twitter account took potshots at its competitor, boasting of its lower economic impact, larger viewing windows and redundant safety systems.\n\n\"Only 4% of the world recognizes a lower limit of 80 km or 50 miles as the beginning of space,\" the company wrote. \"New Shepard flies above both boundaries.

Adults, particularly older ones, are increasingly being encouraged to get vaccines, too.\n\nIn addition to the annual flu shot taken by about two-thirds of older Americans every fall and winter, older adults are now encouraged to get a vaccine against the pneumococcus bacteria and a two-dose regimen against shingles.\n\nCOVID-19 boosters are considered particularly important for those in higher decades.\n\nAnd as of Thursday, people 60 and older are eligible for a vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, too.\n\n\"We have the opportunity as we never have before to prevent much more disease,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nAlthough \"vaccine fatigue\" is common after COVID-19 shots and boosters, experts say, many older adults are eager to get immunized – often so they can safely see or care for their grandchildren.\n\nDiseases like flu and RSV are especially dangerous at each end of life – early childhood and older age, said William Hanage, an expert in the evolution of infectious diseases at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe human immune system evolved to enable most younger children to get mildly ill and then develop immunity when exposed to pathogens. The immune system weakens with advancing age, though, and older people often have a worse response to never-before-seen pathogens, like the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, he said.\n\n\"There was never any evolutionary benefit to making old people who are good at fighting off viruses,\" Hanage said \"For most of our history, most of us didn't live that long.\"\n\nWhy older Americans want to get vaccinated\n\nAmericans over 65 are increasingly seeing the value in staying protected against diseases; data shows those people are more likely to work and raise grandkids compared with previous generations.\n\nThat became more evident during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when getting vaccinated was their ticket to escaping lockdown and seeing their loved ones, said Bob Blancato, executive director of the National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services Programs.\n\n“Older adults care about being vaccinated so they can maintain contact with their kids and grandkids,” he said. “There’s a greater focus on healthy aging, what constitutes healthy aging and what things are preventative.”\n\nMore than 7 million grandparents are living with grandchildren under 18, U.S. census data shows, and nearly half in the labor force and one third say they're responsible for their grandkids.\n\nThough this older generation can’t afford to get sick, experts say, they’re also more likely to have multiple medical conditions that put them at greater risk.\n\n“Boomers who are turning 65 are more focused on a Medicare that prevent them from getting sick versus a Medicare that treats them when they get sick,” Blancato said.\n\nOlder adults are \"receptive and eager to get vaccinations,\" said Anita Patel, Walgreens vice president of pharmacy services development.\n\nThey come into the pharmacy more often than younger people because they're more likely to need prescription refills, she said, and they tend to have a strong relationship with their pharmacist.\n\nStill, they are tired of getting shots, and their hesitation often comes from confusion about what they need and when, Patel said. Educating them about their risks and administering several shots at the same time can help, she said.\n\n\"These can be really lifesaving conversations,\" she said.\n\nChanging minds and hearts\n\nHealth care providers and public health officials need to do more to \"encourage, persuade, educate, support, make comfortable the population that should be vaccinated,\" Schaffner said. \"We've got a lot of work to do out there.\"\n\nIn his own practice, he tells patients that he and his wife and all the workers in his office are vaccinated against the flu and other pathogens and that he wants his patients to have the same protection. \"We personalize it,\" he said.\n\nIf someone has other ailments, such as heart disease, he tells them it's \"doubly important\" to get protected.\n\n\"Information is absolutely fundamental, but information alone rarely is sufficient to change behavior,\" Schaffner said.\n\nPeople have to be convinced by someone they trust, whether it's a health care professional or a member of their own community, such as a religious leader, a barber or a fellow bridge club member. \"Dr. Bill is not sufficient. I need a lot of help in doing this.\"\n\nMore to come\n\nAs vaccine technology advances, adults can expect more vaccines to come their way.\n\nAlthough companies certainly stand to make a profit as more older adults get shots, Schaffner said, other drugs are far more profitable than vaccines, which typically cost less than $150 a shot and often under $100.\n\nThe federal government started funding childhood vaccinations after a measles outbreak in the early 1990s, and now half of all shots for children are paid for by the government.\n\nThe same is not true for adults, said Dr. Leonard Friedland, vice president and director of scientific affairs and public health for GSK Vaccines. Although insurers are required to cover approved vaccines, people without insurance have to pay out of pocket or go without.\n\n\"We still need a safety net for adults,\" Friedland said. \"We have the tools, and everybody should benefit.\"\n\nStill, flu clinics and federally funded COVID-19 vaccine bridge programs can help provide vaccines for people without access, Patel said.\n\nVaccines already are available for adults who travel to countries with diseases that are largely unfamiliar in the United States, such as dengue and hepatitis B.\n\nGSK is developing a vaccine against gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection that causes an estimated 82 million cases globally a year.\n\nModerna and Pfizer-BioNTech are studying the possibility of combining their COVID-19 vaccines with flu and possibly RSV so people would need one shot instead of three.\n\nAnd mRNA vaccines, which proved effective during the pandemic, are being developed to prevent cancer recurrences and other viruses. Those include cytomegalovirus, which can affect people across their life span, and Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis and was recently implicated in multiple sclerosis. It may be behind chronic fatigue and some cases of long COVID as well.\n\nVaccines against more pathogens would be great, Hanage said. \"But I would also love to see more people making use of the things that we have,\" Hanage said. \"That would be a great public health benefit and a reminder to us all of how much more we can do to help more people.\"\n\nHere are the vaccines available for older adults:\n\nRSV\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, infects nearly everyone by age 2 and typically causes cold symptoms.\n\nIt’s the leading cause of hospitalizations among newborns and younger children, but it also strikes later in life, causing more than 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among older adults each year.\n\nThe FDA approved the world’s first vaccine to combat RSV in May. Arexvy, the new vaccine developed by GSK, formerly known as GlaxoSmithKline, was approved for adults 60 and older. Later that month, the agency approved Pfizer’s vaccine for older adults, Abrysvo.\n\nA federal advisory panel said last week that all Americans 60 and older may receive an RSV shot in consultation with their doctor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director signed off on the recommendation Thursday, and vaccines will be available this fall.\n\n“Our immune system changes as we get older … we’re not able to be as efficient in fighting off infections,” said Dr. Tochi Iroku-Malize, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. “The idea of getting an extra boost to help fight off infections is important.”\n\nShingles\n\nShingles, or herpes zoster, is a viral infection caused by the varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It causes a painful rash of blister-like sores, which can also be accompanied by a fever, headache and chills.\n\nPeople who have had chickenpox before are at risk of developing shingles. After a person recovers from the infection, the virus stays inactive in the body and can become reactive years later, causing shingles, Iroku-Malize said.\n\nAbout 1 in 3 people in the U.S. will develop shingles in their lifetime, according to the CDC, and shingles rates are increasing in the United States.\n\nData shows more than 99% of people who were born in the United States before 1980 have had chickenpox, suggesting more people are entering ages that increase their risk of developing shingles.\n\nThe shingles vaccine – Shingrix – is recommended for all Americans over 50, regardless of whether they’ve had shingles before or received the chickenpox vaccine.\n\n“As we have a growing geriatric population, this is an important process of ensuring health and preventive care,” Iroku-Malize said.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nOlder people will always be at highest risk from COVID-19, Hanage said.\n\nIt's impossible to predict how well previous infections and vaccinations will protect people against whatever variant will circulate later this year when infection rates are expected to rise again, Hanage said.\n\n\"We just won't know exactly what that looks like until we get to the fall or winter,\" he said. \"As a result of that, COVID boosters are still something which is likely to be very helpful for those older individuals.\"\n\nHanage, who is far younger than 65, said he will get another booster in the fall, not because he's worried about dying from COVID-19 or even having severe disease but because he's a professor and doesn't want to miss his own classes. He hopes health care workers get boosted for the same reason ‒ so they're not sick at the worst possible time.\n\nOther coronaviruses, which circulate widely and cause the common cold in most people, can cause deadly outbreaks in nursing homes, which suggests previous infections don't provide long-term protection among older people.\n\n\"COVID is heading in that direction, and we don't know yet how serious it's going to turn out to be in the older age group as a whole,\" he said.\n\nPneumococcus\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus bacteria, can cause pneumonia, ear infections, meningitis and other infections. There are 100 known strains. The most recent vaccine, which older adults need only once, can protect against 20 of the most serious of them.\n\nUnfortunately, each time the vaccine is introduced to protect against certain strains, other strains take over, Hanage said. Although cases have actually increased, overall there has been a benefit, he said, because the newer strains are less dangerous.\n\nThe introduction of the first pneumococcus vaccine, which addressed seven strains, cut childhood infection rates in half from 2000 to 2001. Now there are only 9 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease out of every 100,000 American children, compared with 79 at the turn of the century.\n\nThis drop in childhood infections also protected their grandparents, Hanage said ‒ so much so that it's unclear how important it is to vaccinate older adults. \"It's definitely worth vaccinating children, without any question,\" he said. \"The net additional benefit of vaccinating adults is pretty minimal.\"\n\nFlu\n\nAbout two-thirds of people 65 and up get an annual flu vaccine, Schaffner said, which means one-third don't, even though it's usually free and potentially lifesaving.\n\n\"They have to roll up their sleeve − they don't have to reach for their wallet,\" he said.\n\nSometimes people underestimate the seriousness of the flu because the term is thrown around so much and because most people have caught and survived it earlier in their lives, said Nicole Creanza, who studies the evolution of behavior at Vanderbilt University.\n\nAlso, if someone's annual physical is in the spring or summer, they might not think to get a flu shot months later when flu season rolls around, she said.\n\n\"The more positive people's attitudes are toward vaccines, the more likely they are to be vaccinated,\" she said. \"But people don't necessarily apply the same heuristic to every vaccine they're offered.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com and Adrianna Rodriguez at adrodriguez@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Researchers are now running dozens of clinical trials of therapeutic mRNA vaccines for pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma, which frequently responds well to immunotherapy.\n\nCompanies looking to use mRNA to treat cystic fibrosis include ReCode Therapeutics, Arcturus Therapeutics, and Moderna and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which are collaborating. The companies’ goal is to correct a fundamental defect in cystic fibrosis, a mutated protein.\n\nRather than replace the protein itself, scientists plan to deliver mRNA that would instruct the body to make the normal, healthy version of the protein, said David Lockhart, ReCode’s president and chief science officer.\n\nNone of these drugs is in clinical trials yet.\n\nThat leaves patients such as Nicholas Kelly waiting for better treatment options.\n\nKelly, 35, was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as an infant and has never been healthy enough to work full time. He was recently hospitalized for 2½ months due to a lung infection, a common complication for the 30,000 Americans with the disease. Although novel medications have transformed the lives of most people with CF, they don’t work in 10% of patients. About one-third of patients who don’t benefit from the new medications are Black and/or Hispanic, said JP Clancy, vice president of clinical research for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n\n“Nobody wants to be hospitalized,” said Kelly, who lives in Cleveland. “If something could decrease my symptoms even 10%, I would try it.”\n\nPredicting Which Covid Patients Are Most Likely to Die\n\nAmbitious scientific endeavors have provided technological windfalls for consumers in the past; the race to land on the moon in the 1960s led to the development of CT scanners and MRI machines, freeze-dried food, wireless headphones, water purification systems, and the computer mouse.\n\nLikewise, funding for AIDS research has benefited patients with a variety of diseases, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, a professor of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine. Studies of HIV led to the development of better drugs for hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus, or CMV; paved the way for successful immunotherapies in cancer; and speeded the development of covid vaccines.\n\nOver the past two years, medical researchers have generated more than 230,000 medical journal articles, documenting studies of vaccines, antivirals, and other drugs, as well as basic research into the structure of the virus and how it evades the immune system.\n\nDr. Michelle Monje, a professor of neurology at Stanford University, has found similarities in the cognitive side effects caused by covid and a side effect of cancer therapy often called “chemo brain.” Learning more about the root causes of these memory problems, Monje said, could help scientists eventually find ways to prevent or treat them.\n\nJames hopes that computer technology used to detect covid will improve the treatment of other diseases. For example, researchers have shown that cellphone apps can help detect potential covid cases by monitoring patients’ self-reported symptoms. James said she wonders if the same technology could predict flare-ups of autoimmune diseases.\n\n“We never dreamed we could have a PCR test that could be done anywhere but a lab,” James said. “Now we can do them at a patient’s bedside in rural Oklahoma. That could help us with rapid testing for other diseases.”\n\nOne of the most important pandemic breakthroughs was the discovery that 15% to 20% of patients over 70 who die of covid have rogue antibodies that disable a key part of the immune system. Although antibodies normally protect us from infection, these “autoantibodies” attack a protein called interferon that acts as a first line of defense against viruses.\n\nBy disabling key immune fighters, autoantibodies against interferon allow the coronavirus to multiply wildly. The massive infection that results can lead the rest of the immune system to go into hyperdrive, causing a life-threatening “cytokine storm,” said Dr. Paul Bastard, a researcher at Rockefeller University.\n\nThe discovery of interferon-targeting antibodies “certainly changed my way of thinking at a broad level,” said E. John Wherry, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Immunology, who was not involved in the studies. “This is a paradigm shift in immunology and in covid.”\n\nAntibodies that disable interferon may explain why a fraction of patients succumb to viral diseases, such as influenza, while most recover, said Dr. Gary Michelson, founder and co-chair of Michelson Philanthropies, a nonprofit that funds medical research and recently gave Bastard its inaugural award in immunology.\n\nThe discovery “goes far beyond the impact of covid-19,” Michelson said. “These findings may have implications in treating patients with other infectious diseases” such as the flu.\n\nBastard and colleagues have also found that one-third of patients with dangerous reactions to yellow fever have autoantibodies against interferon.\n\nInternational research teams are now looking for such autoantibodies in patients hospitalized by other viral infections, including chickenpox, influenza, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, and others.\n\nOverturning Dogma\n\nFor decades, public health officials created policies based on the assumption that viruses spread in one of two ways: either through the air, like measles and tuberculosis, or through heavy, wet droplets that spray from our mouths and noses, then quickly fall to the ground, like influenza.\n\nFor the first 17 months of the covid pandemic, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the coronavirus spread through droplets and advised people to wash their hands, stand 6 feet apart, and wear face coverings. As the crisis wore on and evidence accumulated, researchers began to debate whether the coronavirus might also be airborne.\n\nToday it’s clear that the coronavirus — and all respiratory viruses — spread through a combination of droplets and aerosols, said Dr. Michael Klompas, a professor at Harvard Medical School and infectious disease doctor.\n\n“It’s not either/or,” Klompas said. “We’ve created this artificial dichotomy about how we think about these viruses. But we always put out a mixture of both” when we breathe, cough, and sneeze.\n\nKnowing that respiratory viruses commonly spread through the air is important because it can help health agencies protect the public. For example, high-quality masks, such as N95 respirators, offer much better protection against airborne viruses than cloth masks or surgical masks. Improving ventilation, so that the air in a room is completely replaced at least four to six times an hour, is another important way to control airborne viruses.\n\nStill, Klompas said, there’s no guarantee that the country will handle the next outbreak any better than this one. “Will we do a better job fighting influenza because of what we’ve learned?” Klompas said. “I hope so, but I’m not holding my breath.”\n\nFighting Chronic Disease\n\nLauren Nichols, 32, remembers exactly when she developed her first covid symptoms: March 10, 2020.\n\nIt was the beginning of an illness that has plagued her for nearly two years, with no end in sight. Although Nichols was healthy before developing what has become known as “long covid,” she deals with dizziness, headaches, and debilitating fatigue, which gets markedly worse after exercise. She has had shingles — a painful rash caused by the reactivation of the chickenpox virus — four times since her covid infection.\n\nSix months after testing positive for covid, Nichols was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME/CFS, which affects more than 1 million Americans and causes many of the same symptoms as covid. There are few effective treatments for either condition.\n\nIn fact, research suggests that “the two conditions are one and the same,” said Dr. Avindra Nath, clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of the National Institutes of Health. The main difference is that people with long covid know which virus caused their illness, while the precise virus behind most cases of chronic fatigue is unknown, Nath said.\n\nAdvocates of patients with long covid want to ensure that future research — including $1.15 billion in targeted funding from the NIH — benefits all patients with chronic, post-viral diseases.\n\n“Anything that shows promise in long covid will be immediately trialed in ME/CFS,” said Jarred Younger, director of the Neuroinflammation, Pain and Fatigue Laboratory at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.\n\nPatients with chronic fatigue syndrome have felt a kinship with long covid patients, and vice versa, not just because they experience the same baffling symptoms, but also because both have struggled to obtain compassionate, appropriate care, said Nichols, vice president of Body Politic, an advocacy group for people with long covid and other chronic or disabling conditions.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“There is a lot of frustration about being written off by the medical community, being told that it’s all in one’s head, that they just need to see a psychiatrist or go to the gym,” said Dr. David Systrom, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nThat sort of ignorance seems to be declining, largely because of increasing awareness about long covid, said Emily Taylor, vice president of advocacy and engagement at Solve M.E., an advocacy group for people with post-infectious chronic illnesses. Although some doctors still refuse to believe long covid is a real disease, “they’re being drowned out by the patient voices,” Taylor said.\n\nA new study from the National Institutes of Health, called RECOVER (Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery), is enrolling 15,000 people with long covid and a comparison group of nearly 3,000 others who haven’t had covid.\n\n“In a very dark cloud,” Nichols said, “a silver lining coming out of long covid is that we’ve been forced to acknowledge how real and serious these conditions are.”", "authors": ["Liz Szabo"], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/health/ms-epstein-barr-vaccine-khn-partner/index.html", "title": "Epstein-Barr: Researchers speed efforts for vaccine against virus ...", "text": "Maybe you’ve never heard of the Epstein-Barr virus. But it knows all about you.\n\nChances are, it’s living inside you right now. About 95% of American adults are infected sometime in their lives. And once infected, the virus stays with you.\n\nMost viruses, such as influenza, just come and go. A healthy immune system attacks them, kills them, and prevents them from sickening you again. Epstein-Barr and its cousins, including the viruses that cause chickenpox and herpes, can hibernate inside your cells for decades.\n\nThis viral family has “evolved with us for millions of years,” said Blossom Damania, a virologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. “They know all your body’s secrets.”\n\nAlthough childhood Epstein-Barr infections are typically mild, exposure in teens and young adults can lead to infectious mononucleosis, a weeks-long illness that sickens 125,000 Americans a year, causing sore throats, swollen glands, and extreme fatigue. And while Epstein-Barr spends most of its time sleeping, it can reawaken during times of stress or when the immune system is off its game. Those reactivations are linked to a long list of serious health conditions, including several types of cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n\nScientists have spent years trying to develop vaccines against Epstein-Barr, or EBV. But recently several leaps in medical research have provided more urgency to the quest — and more hope for success. In just the past year, two experimental vaccine efforts have made it to human clinical trials.\n\nWhat’s changed?\n\nFirst, the Epstein-Barr virus has been shown to present an even greater threat. New research firmly links it to multiple sclerosis, or MS, a potentially disabling chronic disease that afflicts more than 900,000 Americans and 2.8 million people worldwide.\n\nThe journal Science in January published results from a landmark 20-year study of 10 million military personnel that offers the strongest evidence yet that Epstein-Barr can trigger MS. The new study found that people infected with Epstein-Barr are 32 times as likely as people not infected to develop MS.\n\nAnd shedding new light on the mechanisms that could explain that correlation, a separate group of scientists published a study in Nature describing how the virus can cause an autoimmune reaction that leads to MS. The disease, which usually strikes between ages 20 and 40, disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body and is often marked by recurring episodes of extreme fatigue, blurred vision, muscle weakness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. At its worst, MS can lead to impaired speech and paralysis.\n\nAmplifying that newfound urgency, several new studies suggest that reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus also is involved with some cases of long covid, a little-understood condition in which patients experience lingering symptoms that often resemble mononucleosis.\n\nAnd just as crucial to the momentum: Advances in vaccine science spurred by the pandemic, including the mRNA technology used in some covid vaccines, could accelerate development of other vaccines, including ones against Epstein-Barr, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Hotez co-created a low-cost, patent-free covid vaccine called Corbevax.\n\nSome researchers question the need for a vaccine that targets a disease like MS that, while debilitating, remains relatively rare.\n\nEliminating Epstein-Barr would require vaccinating all healthy children even though their risk of developing cancer or multiple sclerosis is small, said Dr. Ralph Horwitz, a professor at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University.\n\nBefore exposing children to the potential risks of a new vaccine, he said, scientists need to answer basic questions about MS. For example, why does a virus that affects nearly everyone cause disease in a small fraction? And what roles do stress and other environmental conditions play in that equation?\n\nThe answer appears to be that Epstein-Barr is “necessary but not sufficient” to cause disease, said immunologist Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National MS Society, adding that the virus “may be the first in a string of dominoes.”\n\nHotez said researchers could continue to probe the mysteries surrounding Epstein-Barr and MS even as the vaccine efforts proceed. Further study is required to understand which populations might benefit most from a vaccine, and once more is known, Hotez said, such a vaccine possibly could be used in patients found to be at highest risk, such as organ transplant recipients, rather than administered universally to all young people.\n\n“Now that we know that Epstein-Barr is very tightly linked to MS, we could save a lot of lives if we develop the vaccine now,” Damania said, “rather than wait 10 years” until every question is answered.\n\nModerna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched separate clinical trials of Epstein-Barr vaccines over the past year. Epstein-Barr vaccines also are in early stages of testing at Opko Health, a Miami-based biotech company; Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; and California’s City of Hope National Medical Center.\n\nScientists have sought to develop vaccines against Epstein-Barr for decades only to be thwarted by the complexities of the virus. Epstein-Barr “is a master of evading the immune system,” said Dr. Jessica Durkee-Shock, a clinical immunologist and principal investigator for NIAID’s trial.\n\nBoth MS and the cancers linked to Epstein-Barr develop many years after people are infected. So a trial designed to learn whether a vaccine can prevent these diseases would take decades and a lot of money.\n\nModerna researchers initially are focusing on a goal more easily measured: the prevention of mononucleosis, which doubles the risk of multiple sclerosis. Mono develops only a month or so after people are infected with Epstein-Barr, so scientists won’t have to wait as long for results.\n\nMono can be incredibly disruptive on its own, keeping students out of class and military recruits out of training for weeks. In about 10% of cases, the crippling fatigue lasts six months or more. In 1% of cases, patients develop complications, including hepatitis and neurological problems.\n\nFor now, the clinical trials for Epstein-Barr immunizations are enrolling only adults. “In the future, the perfect vaccine would be given to a small child,” Durkee-Shock said. “And it would protect them their whole life, and prevent them from getting mono or any other complication from the Epstein-Barr virus.”\n\nThe NIAID vaccine, being tested for safety in 40 volunteers, is built around ferritin, an iron-storage protein that can be manipulated to display a key viral protein to the immune system. Like a cartoon Transformer, the ferritin nanoparticle self-assembles into what looks like a “little iron soccer ball,” Durkee-Shock said. “This approach, in which many copies of the EBV protein are displayed on a single particle, has proved successful for other vaccines, including the HPV and hepatitis B vaccine.”\n\nModerna’s experimental vaccine, being tested in about 270 people, works more like the company’s covid shot. Both deliver snippets of a virus’s genetic information in molecules called mRNA inside a lipid nanoparticle, or tiny bubble of fat. Moderna, which has dozens of mRNA vaccines in development, hopes to learn from each and apply those lessons to Epstein-Barr, said Sumana Chandramouli, senior director and research program leader for infectious diseases at Moderna.\n\n“What the covid vaccine has shown us is that the mRNA technology is well tolerated, very safe, and highly efficacious,” Chandramouli said.\n\nBut mRNA vaccines have limitations.\n\nAlthough they have saved millions of lives during the covid pandemic, the antibody levels generated in response to the mRNA vaccines wane after a few months. It’s possible this rapid loss of antibodies is related specifically to the coronavirus and its rapidly evolving new strains, Hotez said. But if waning immunity is inherent in the mRNA technology, that could seriously limit future vaccines.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDesigning vaccines against Epstein-Barr is also more complicated than for covid. The Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses are comparatively huge, four to five times as large as SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes covid. And while the coronavirus uses just one protein to infect human cells, the Epstein-Barr virus uses many, four of which are included in the Moderna vaccine.\n\nEarlier experimental Epstein-Barr vaccines targeting one viral protein lowered the rate of infectious mononucleosis but failed to prevent viral infection. Targeting multiple viral proteins may be more effective at preventing infection, said Damania, the UNC virologist.\n\n“If you close one door, the other door is still open,” Damania said. “You have to block infection in all cell types to have a successful vaccine that prevents future infections.”", "authors": ["Liz Szabo"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/03/17/covid-research-leads-breakthroughs-chronic-disease-cancer/7049315001/", "title": "COVID-19 research leads to breakthroughs for chronic disease ...", "text": "Liz Szabo\n\nKaiser Health News\n\nThe billions of dollars invested in mRNA vaccines and COVID-19 research so far are expected to yield medical and scientific dividends for decades, helping doctors battle influenza, cancer, cystic fibrosis and far more diseases.\n\n“This is just the start,” said Dr. Judith James, vice president of clinical affairs for the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. “We won’t see these dividends in their full glory for years.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/12/29/emily-marrison-looks-back-at-2024-and-ahead-to-2025/77109447007/", "title": "Less is more with 2025's word of the year", "text": "Emily Marrison\n\nColumnist\n\nThe wall next to my desk is plastered in calendar pages labeled 2025. But before I fill the squares with plans, I need to pause and reflect on this past year. It is an essential practice for me. It reminds me of what is most important and helps to shrink my striving.\n\nBecause I am a lifelong learner, I relish the opportunity each week to explore a new topic with you. These issues help us to live healthy lives with our finances, our relationships and our physical, mental and spiritual health. This year we’ve talked about organizing family photos, bird watching, skin cancer awareness, the solar eclipse, air fryers, benefits of eating fish and lessons I learned in Saskatchewan.\n\nHere is a quick recap of the top three columns I’ll remember from 2024.\n\n3. There is certainly a need to explore topics with mixed opinions. My colleague Myriam Shaw Ojeda has a joint position with the College of Pharmacy and OSU Extension. She discussed wonderful information with our Dining with Diabetes participants about benefits and concerns of vaccination, especially for those with diabetes. Some key vaccines for adults to consider are flu, RSV and shingles.\n\n2. I shared that the FDA has a thorough fact sheet about the common perceived health benefits of raw milk. I encourage people to consider the food safety risks, especially of giving raw milk to children.\n\n1. This summer I taught a freeze-drying fundamentals workshop at Schumaker Farms. I enjoyed sharing about this latest, greatest food processing technology for home use. The freeze dryer can be used to save produce and other foods in a shelf stable form that maintains nutritional content and lasts for years.\n\nFor a dozen years now, my tradition has been to choose “one word” on which to focus the next year. This year my word came quite quickly and was solidified last week as I visited a winery with our Ohio State University viticulture specialist.\n\nA winery owner showed us some grape vines that were not very productive last summer. Maria examined the tangled branches, then grabbed two in her hands. “These two,” she said. “These are the only two branches you need for next year. Cut all the rest back and it will do great next season.”\n\nExperts recommend grape growers prune 90% of the wood produced in the previous season. It seems counterintuitive if we want highly fruitful, healthy plants. But when we cut a branch it produces a chemical response that triggers the plant to develop new foliage and branching.\n\nAs I examine my life, my branches need pruning. Over time I have practiced more addition than subtraction. More indulgence than denial. This takes a lot of forms, but I’ve narrowed it to three main categories I will focus on: material things, service activities and my thoughts.\n\nMy word for 2025 is prune. I want to intentionally prune the things and attitudes that prevent me from bearing fruit. I know this will mean saying no and saying goodbye to some good things. Maybe for a season, maybe forever. But it is a necessary step of obedience for a more thoughtful, intentional, joy-filled life. Less really is more.\n\nMy branch must connect to true life. Jesus said, “I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.”\n\nToday, I’ll leave you with this quote from Leonard Sweet, “No one likes the process of pruning and the pain of loss, but fruit only grows on new wood.”\n\nEmily Marrison is an OSU Extension Family & Consumer Sciences Educator and may be reached at 740-622-2265.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/gsk-biopharma-2024/2025/02/24/what-faith-martin-wants-people-50-years-and-older-to-know-about-shingles/76930100007/", "title": "What Faith Martin wants people 50 years and older to know about ..."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/pfizer/2023/02/21/innovation-pfizer-adults-uncontrolled-moderate-severe-eczema/10614953002/", "title": "An innovation from Pfizer for adults with uncontrolled moderate-to ...", "text": "By Pfizer\n\nFor people living with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, the hallmark persistent itch can be truly debilitating, according to Dr. Peter Lio, a practicing dermatologist at Medical Dermatology Associates of Chicago who also serves as an emeritus member of the National Eczema Association’s Scientific & Medical Advisory Council.[1,2]\n\nOther AD symptoms can include inflamed skin that looks discolored depending on skin tone, and bumpy, oozing, thickening, or scaly skin. But the persistent, intense itch is usually the most bothersome symptom of all, said Lio.\n\n“It’s constant for many people. It never, ever, relents,” he said. “For a long time, we had quite a lack of good treatments for this condition. So, there are whole generations of people who have been suffering in relative silence because we just haven’t had that many tools in our toolbox.”\n\nNow, dermatologists like Lio have another tool they can use: CIBINQO® (abrocitinib), a once-a-day pill for adults with moderate-to-severe AD who didn't respond to previous treatment and when other treatments, including oral or injected medicines, haven't worked well or are not right for them. Here’s what Lio had to say about the drug, how it works and who might be a good candidate to try it.\n\nCIBINQO may cause serious side effects, including serious infections, increased risk of death, cancer and immune system problems, major cardiovascular events, and blood clots. Learn more about the risks in the Important Safety Information at the end of this article.\n\nHow CIBINQO works\n\nCIBINQO belongs to a treatment category known as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which block some inflammatory pathways in the body that play a role in some of the underlying causes of AD.\n\nThe cells that make up these inflammatory pathways use a signaling process involving JAK proteins to “talk” to one another, passing along the message that inflammation should keep building, said Lio. Blocking the JAK proteins is believed to reduce irregular and runaway skin inflammation responsible for bothersome AD symptoms. It is not currently known how inhibiting specific JAK proteins can affect AD.\n\n“If you can imagine the cells are all calling, ‘Send more troops! Make more inflammation!’ a JAK inhibitor sort of quiets that down and unplugs those phone lines. And the inflammation, the itch, the skin damage can start to settle down,” he said. And that can mean a lot for patients who have been dealing with symptoms for a long time – sometimes even for years.\n\nClearing skin and quickly reducing itch\n\nTo gain FDA approval, CIBINQO had to demonstrate effectiveness during rigorous clinical testing, Lio noted. The main effect they were looking for was a reduction in the severity of AD symptoms after three months, with one of the measures used being the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) to assess skin clearance.\n\n“The goal is for people to get at minimum a 75% improvement in skin clearance while on the medication — it’s a hard bar to reach. And you see when you look at the data that people treated with CIBINQO experienced greater improvement than those treated with placebo. It was able to get many of these people so much better, at least 75% better,” Lio said. “Many people saw clear or nearly-clear skin with CIBINQO.”\n\nThe clinical testing also showed that after just two weeks, more people felt itch reduction with CIBINQO than those treated with placebo.\n\nLike many medicines, CIBINQO comes with potentially serious side effects, including serious infections, increased risk of death, cancer and immune system problems, major cardiovascular events, and blood clots, that dermatologists should counsel their patients about, Lio advised. Additionally, patients should undergo blood tests before and during treatment — and if their lymphocyte, neutrophil, red blood cell, or platelet counts are too low, their dermatologist may recommend stopping CIBINQO.\n\n“As a powerful medicine it is capable of doing amazing things. But we have to use it with respect,” said Lio.\n\nIn addition to the serious potential side effects, the most common side effects seen in the clinical trials include common cold, nausea, headache, herpes simplex including cold sores, increased blood level of creatine phosphokinase, dizziness, urinary tract infection, tiredness, acne, vomiting, mouth and throat pain, flu, stomach flu, bacterial skin infection, high blood pressure, allergic skin rash to something you contacted, stomach pain, shingles, and low platelet count. These are not all of the possible side effects of CIBINQO.\n\nPlease refer to the important safety information below, including BOXED WARNING.\n\nWhat type of patient might benefit from CIBINQO?\n\nLio works with each of his patients to develop individual treatment plans. Before trying CIBINQO, adults looking to control their AD symptoms would try topical treatments — like lotions, creams, or ointments — and consider injected or other systemic prescription options first.\n\nWhen other treatments do not work well or are not advisable, he would consider suggesting a JAK inhibitor pill like CIBINQO. Because of the quick itch relief certain patients may get from a JAK inhibitor, and knowing how debilitating the symptoms of AD can be, he starts those conversations quickly if it’s clear a patient’s current treatment plan isn’t working well enough.\n\nFinding a doctor who offers a personalized approach\n\nAll cases are different. It’s important for each person living with AD to consult with their doctor, who should take their own unique circumstances into consideration, including how AD impacts their life, treatment preference, and how well managed their symptoms are with current treatment. “It’s important to find a health care provider that you have a connection with who is willing to work with you. If you feel that you’re not being heard, I encourage you to find someone you feel comfortable with,” Lio said.\n\nIn the right setting and with the right tools, relief may finally be within reach.\n\n“I would be lying if I said I can get everybody with severe symptoms clear and happy and perfect skin. But I can do a heck of a lot better than I did even just a few years ago. I have so many more options for people today. Even if other things didn’t work for you — well, now I have something else to try that may have a significant impact.”\n\nTo learn more about CIBINQO, and for resources to help prepare for a conversation with your doctor, visit CIBINQO.com.\n\nWhat is CIBINQO?\n\nCIBINQO (abrocitinib) is a prescription medicine to treat adults with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis) that did not respond to other treatment and is not well controlled with prescription medicines, including biologics, or when they cannot be tolerated.\n\nIt is not known if CIBINQO is safe and effective in children.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nCIBINQO may cause serious side effects, including:\n\nSerious infections. CIBINQO can lower your immune system’s ability to fight infections. Do not start CIBINQO if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. Serious infections, including tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body, have occurred in people taking CIBINQO or other similar medicines. Some people have died from these infections. Your risk of developing shingles may increase while taking CIBINQO.\n\nYour healthcare provider should test you for TB before treatment with CIBINQO and monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB infection during treatment.\n\nBefore and after starting CIBINQO, tell your doctor right away if you have an infection, are being treated for one, or have symptoms of an infection, including:\n\nfever, sweating, or chills\n\nmuscle aches\n\ncough or shortness of breath\n\nblood in your phlegm\n\nweight loss\n\nwarm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body\n\ndiarrhea or stomach pain\n\nburning when you urinate or urinating more often than usual\n\nfeeling very tired\n\nCIBINQO can make you more likely to get infections or worsen infections you have.\n\nThere is an increased risk of death in people 50 years and older who have at least one heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and are taking a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (such as CIBINQO).\n\nCancer and immune system problems. CIBINQO may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen. People, especially current or past smokers, have a higher risk of certain cancers, including lymphoma and lung cancers, while taking a JAK inhibitor. Follow your healthcare provider’s advice about having your skin checked for skin cancer during treatment. Limit the amount of time you spend in sunlight and avoid using tanning beds or sunlamps. When in the sun, wear protective clothing and use SPF 30+ sunscreen. This is especially important if you have very fair skin or a family history of skin cancer. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.\n\nThere is an increased risk of major cardiovascular (CV) events such as heart attack, stroke or death in people 50 years and older who have at least one heart disease (CV) risk factor and are taking a JAK inhibitor, especially for current or past smokers.\n\nSome people taking CIBINQO have had major cardiovascular events.\n\nGet emergency help right away if you develop any symptoms of a heart attack or stroke while taking CIBINQO, including:\n\ndiscomfort in the center of your chest that lasts for more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back\n\nsevere tightness, pain, pressure, or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw\n\npain or discomfort in your arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach\n\nweakness in one part or on one side of your body\n\nslurred speech\n\nshortness of breath with or without chest discomfort\n\nbreaking out in a cold sweat\n\nnausea or vomiting\n\nfeeling lightheaded\n\nBlood clots. Blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE) can happen in some people taking CIBINQO. This may be life-threatening. Blood clots in the veins of the legs and lungs have happened more often in people 50 years and older, with at least one heart disease (CV) risk factor, taking a JAK inhibitor. Tell your healthcare provider if you have had blood clots in the veins of your legs or lungs in the past.\n\nGet medical help right away if you have any signs and symptoms of blood clots including swelling, pain, or tenderness in one or both legs; sudden, unexplained chest or upper back pain; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\n\nChanges in certain laboratory test results. Your doctor should do blood tests before and during treatment with CIBINQO to check your lymphocyte, neutrophil, red blood cell, and platelet counts. You should not take CIBINQO if these counts are too low. Your healthcare provider may stop treatment for a period of time if there are changes in these blood test results. You may also have changes in other laboratory tests, such as your blood cholesterol levels. Your doctor should do blood tests about 4 weeks after you start treatment and 4 weeks after any increase in dose to check blood cell counts and as often as needed for other laboratory tests.\n\nDuring the first 3 months of treatment with CIBINQO, do not take medicines that prevent blood clots except low-dose aspirin (≤81 mg daily), if prescribed.\n\nBefore taking CIBINQO, tell your healthcare provider if you:\n\nhave an infection, are being treated for one, or have one that won't go away or keeps returning\n\nhave diabetes, chronic lung disease, HIV, or a weak immune system\n\nhave TB or have been in close contact with someone with TB\n\nhave had shingles (herpes zoster)\n\nhave had hepatitis B or hepatitis C\n\nlive, have lived, or traveled to certain areas (such as Ohio & Mississippi River Valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections. These infections may happen or worsen when taking CIBINQO. Ask your healthcare provider if you're unsure if you have lived in an area where these infections are common\n\nhave had any type of cancer\n\nhave had blood clots in the veins of your legs or lungs\n\nare a current or past smoker\n\nhave had a heart attack, other heart problems, or stroke\n\nhave kidney or liver problems\n\nhave abnormal blood tests (low platelet count or white blood cell count)\n\nhave any eye problems, including cataracts or retinal detachment\n\nhave recently received or are scheduled to receive any vaccinations. People who take CIBINQO should not receive live vaccines\n\nare or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if CIBINQO will harm your unborn baby. Pfizer has a Pregnancy Exposure Registry for pregnant women who take CIBINQO to check your health and the health of your baby. If you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking CIBINQO, ask your healthcare provider how you can join this pregnancy registry or call 1-877-311-3770 to enroll\n\nfor pregnant women who take CIBINQO to check your health and the health of your baby. If you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking CIBINQO, ask your healthcare provider how you can join this pregnancy registry or call to enroll are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if CIBINQO passes into your breast milk. You should not take CIBINQO while breastfeeding\n\nare taking other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. CIBINQO and other medicines may affect each other, causing side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take aspirin or any antiplatelet therapies. Ask your healthcare provider if you are unsure\n\nThe most common side effects of CIBINQO include common cold, nausea, headache, herpes simplex including cold sores, increased blood level of creatinine phosphokinase, dizziness, urinary tract infection, tiredness, acne, vomiting, mouth and throat pain, flu, stomach flu, bacterial skin infection, high blood pressure, allergic skin rash to something you contacted, stomach pain, shingles, and low platelet count.\n\nCIBINQO may cause fertility problems in females, which may affect the ability of females to get pregnant. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have concerns about fertility.\n\nSeparation or tear to the lining of the back part of the eye (retinal detachment) has happened in people treated with CIBINQO. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any sudden changes in your vision.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of CIBINQO.\n\nYou are encouraged to report adverse events related to Pfizer products by calling 1-800-438-1985 (U.S. only). If you prefer, you may contact the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) directly. Visit www.fda.gov/MedWatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Na CH, Chung J, Simpson EL.

They said the vaccine trial is prohibited from enrolling pregnant or nursing women,\" reads a Facebook comment shared by naturopath Ben Lynch in a Dec. 20 post.\n\nThe comment, from an unknown author and posted as a screenshot, states Moderna does not want female trial participants to try to conceive \"within a month of the second injection\" or male participants to impregnate women between the first vaccination until a month after the second one. The author does not provide an explanation.\n\n\"This means NO VACCINE if PREGNANT or trying to conceive,\" Lynch writes in a caption with the screenshot. \"Stop injecting pregnant women. Stop manipulating them emotionally to feel pressured to vaccinate themselves.\"\n\nWhile much of his post is opinion, Lynch does claim \"vaccines are not safe during pregnancy,\" the COVID-19 vaccine even more so since \"there's no research on COVID vaccines during pregnancy because it's unethical to do so.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Lynch for further comment.\n\nWhy are pregnant women excluded from clinical trials?\n\nWhile the Facebook comment Lynch shared is correct — Moderna has advised male and female trial participants to abstain \"from all activities that could result in pregnancy\" — the exclusion of pregnant women from clinical research is not atypical.\n\nAccording to Dr. Heather Byers, a clinical assistant professor in pediatrics at Stanford, women were considered too medically complex, potentially complicating research studies.\n\n\"Historically, women in general were excluded from clinical trials because men were thought to be a more homogenous group without hormonal cycles and other sex-based variables that might impact the medical conditions under study,\" she said in a January 2019 interview with Stanford's Scope.\n\nDespite increased inclusion of women since 1993, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reversed its 1977 policy banning women of child-bearing potential, Byers stated exclusion of pregnant women remains persistent.\n\n\"In addition, pregnant women are still classified as a 'vulnerable' population for all research studies, so investigators must take additional steps to enroll them to ensure minimum risk. Also, the lack of data about what pregnant women can safely be exposed to leads to more uncertainty. So many investigators choose to exclude them, even if they might benefit from the study intervention,\" she said.\n\nThis vulnerable classification dates back to the 1940s after diethylstilbestrol, or DES, prescribed from the 1940s to 1970s to prevent miscarriage, gave rise to generations of women born with an increased risk for gynecological cancers. Additionally, thalidomide, prescribed in Europe and other countries during the 1950s for morning sickness, was found to cause birth defects, though it was never approved in the U.S. thanks to an FDA pharmacologist, Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey.\n\nAs prevailing as Lynch's opinion that research on pregnant women is \"unethical,\" there has been a paradigm shift since the late 2000s with some ethicists and health care professionals arguing exclusion, instead being protective, is disadvantageous to prenatal care and women's health in general.\n\n\"Excluding them is a problem because women don't stop getting sick or stop having chronic medical conditions just because they are pregnant. The average woman is exposed to four medications during her pregnancy and over 80 percent of medications haven't been studied in a like population,\" said Byers.\n\nByers stated this \"forces pregnant women to take medications on an 'off-label' basis ... because there's no other option.\"\n\nWhen it comes to vaccine trials, bioethicists Angela Ballantyne and Françoise Baylis state the exclusion of pregnant women \"does not dodge the risk of unproven vaccinations; it simply shifts this risk from a carefully monitored clinical trial to the privacy of a doctor's office.\"\n\n\"Excluding pregnant women from vaccine research is both unjust and imprudent from a public health perspective,\" they argue in an October article published in The Conversation.\n\nPregnant women do receive vaccines\n\nThe benefits of maternal vaccination have been recognized since the 19th century, when infants, born to women vaccinated against smallpox during pregnancy, were observed to be protected from the virus during their early life.\n\nIt was later understood this temporary protective effect was due to passive immunity. The mother's immune system creates antibodies — molecules that recognize foreign substances like bacteria or viruses — in response to the vaccine. They are passed along to the baby through the placenta, a temporary organ formed during pregnancy that facilitates the transfer of nutrients and wastes between mother and child, or through breast milk.\n\nMaternal vaccination against pertussis, also known as whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease, began in the 1940s, after clinical trials in pregnant women did not appear to have any adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, according to a 2008 CDC report. Influenza vaccination, while not formally tested, was implemented following pandemics of the 1950s. In the 1960s, observational studies and clinical trials found newborn deaths due to tetanus, a potentially fatal infection causing painful muscle spasms, were prevented by vaccinating the mother.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend with every pregnancy an immunization against pertussis, in the form of a combination vaccine that includes tetanus and diphtheria, a bacterial infection that can cause breathing difficulty and heart failure. Influenza vaccination is recommended seasonally, including during pregnancy if not administered before.\n\nVaccines that contain a live attenuated virus, like those for measles-mumps-rubella or shingles, are not recommended to pregnant women, according to the CDC. It is theorized the virus, while weakened and less virulent, could be passed on to the fetus through the placenta and cause infection.\n\nAll other vaccine forms are generally considered not harmful to the growing baby, according to ACOG.\n\n\"There is no evidence of adverse fetal effects from vaccinating pregnant women with inactivated virus, bacterial vaccines, or toxoids, and a growing body of data demonstrate the safety of such use,\" stated the association in a 2018 committee opinion.\n\nLynch's statement that vaccines are not safe during pregnancy is misleading, based on this evidence.\n\nMore:Fact check: COVID-19 pandemic is not a simulation\n\nWhat about the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nWhile the COVID-19 vaccine does not contain the virus — only some genetic code called mRNA, providing instructions on how to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein — how it will affect pregnant women is uncertain.\n\nIn toxicity studies conducted in pregnant and postpartum rats, the FDA found Moderna's mRNA-based vaccine \"did not have any adverse effects on female reproduction, fetal/embryonic development, or postnatal developmental (sic) except for skeletal variations which are common and typically resolve postnatally without intervention.\"\n\nBut animal studies are not always good predictors of human reactions. In an interview with The New York Times, Dr. Michal Elovitz, an obstetrician and preterm labor researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, explained mRNA technology and pregnancy have not been well studied. The mRNA could be completely safe or it could cross the placenta and cause inflammation, potentially harming the fetus.\n\nDr. Stephanie Gaw, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science that \"it's unlikely that anything meaningful would be able to cross\" the placenta, although further studies are needed to confirm.\n\nIt is also important to note that because the vaccine is injected into the arm, it is taken up by muscle cells where, after the mRNA serves its use, it is quickly degraded.\n\n\"Because it acts locally, it's likely of no consequence to the fetus,\" said Dr. Denise Jamieson, an OB-GYN and chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University School of Medicine, also to Live Science.\n\nDoctors and health organizations like ACOG and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend pregnant women have access to the vaccine, given the protective benefits outweigh the considerable risks of coronavirus infection.\n\nAccording to a November study by the CDC, pregnant women are significantly more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit, to end up on a ventilator and to die from COVID-19 than women of the same age and health status who are not pregnant. This is likely due to immunological and metabolic changes that permit and accommodate pregnancy but leave mothers-to-be more susceptible to viral infection and subsequently, severe illness.\n\n\"I personally feel comfortable recommending to those women that your risk-benefit balance suggests you should get vaccinated,\" said Dr. Geeta Krishna Swamy, member of ACOG's COVID vaccine group and associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University School of Medicine, to USA TODAY.\n\n\"If a woman says, 'I don't want to get vaccinated,' I think that's absolutely, positively her choice, just like it's her choice to get vaccinated.\"\n\nSome vaccine trials in pregnant women are expected to start in January, reports The New York Times.\n\nWhat about breastfeeding women?\n\nBreastfeeding mothers have also been excluded from Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine trials although, according to the SMFM, \"there is no biological plausibility\" for their exclusion.\n\n\"For some reason that does not make any sense to me, lactating and pregnant women are always lumped into one group,\" Jamieson said to NPR in December.\n\n\"They're actually two very different groups, and there's even less theoretical reason to be concerned about lactating women. We give live viral vaccines — measles, mumps and rubella vaccine — routinely to lactating women.\"\n\nThe Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine also agreed, stating in December that during lactation, \"it is unlikely that the vaccine lipid would enter the blood stream and reach breast tissue. If it does, it is even less likely that either the intact nanoparticle or mRNA transfer into milk. In the unlikely event that mRNA is present in milk, it would be expected to be digested by the child and would be unlikely to have any biological effects.\"\n\nBut there is also the possibility the vaccine might even confer benefits to the breastfeeding child through passive immunity, according to the ABM. There appears to be some evidence for this, as one small study found antibodies in the breastmilk of women who recovered from COVID-19.\n\nACOG, SMFM, ABM and CDC strongly recommend lactating mothers be offered the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as receive professional counseling to weigh individual risks and benefits. ACOG and ABM have also stated there is no need for vaccinated individuals to cease or discontinue breastfeeding following vaccination.\n\nOur ruling: Missing context\n\nWe rate the claim that no vaccine is safe during pregnancy or when trying to conceive as MISSING CONTEXT, because without additional context it might be misleading.\n\nWhile it is true Moderna has recommended vaccine trial participants against conceiving, exclusion of pregnant women is not atypical. Historically, women were considered too medically complex with sex-based variables that could complicate a study. Pregnant women, especially, were classified as a \"vulnerable\" population following the tragedies of thalidomide and DES. This classification persists, even though clinical trial protocols and drug approval have evolved significantly since then. Some health care advocates, bioethicists and physicians say excluding pregnant women is more harmful than protective, impacting clinical decision making and women's health.\n\nPregnant women have been receiving vaccines safely since the 1940s and continue to receive vaccination against pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus and influenza. Administering a vaccine with a live virus, thought to possibly pose a risk to the growing fetus, is the only contraindication.\n\nThere is little clinical data with which to consider the risk the COVID-19 vaccine poses to pregnancy. Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA-based vaccines are believed to be overall safe with low theoretical risk as the vaccine does not contain a virus itself. Several medical associations call for the vaccine to be available to pregnant women and whether or not it should be administered be based on counseling with a health care professional.\n\nWhile there is also scarce data when it comes to breastfeeding women, most health experts and medical organizations believe the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine poses little to no risk.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Kay Ivey is not ready to issue a shelter-in-place order as other governors have, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, arguing the state has taken aggressive action to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Republican governors in Florida, Mississippi and Georgia on Wednesday reversed course and issued stay-home directives after previously resisting such a statewide order. But Ivey’s office said Wednesday that the governor is not ready to follow suit. A spokeswoman for Ivey said the governor has not ruled anything out, but hopes the state will not have to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order. Alabama last week announced the closure of nonessential businesses, such as salons, gyms and many retail stores and a prohibition of gatherings of 10 people or more that are not work-related where people can’t stay at least 6 feet apart. The previous limit had been 25. The state had earlier announced the closure of public and private beaches, on-site restaurant dining and that students would finish the school year by doing distance learning at home. Alabama’s “safer at home” policy urges people to stay home but does not order them to do so.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state accused an Anchorage man of buying respirators and selling them at “unconscionable prices” online to profit off coronavirus concerns. The complaint against Juan Lyle Aune alleged violations of a law barring unfair trade and commerce practices. It seeks financial penalties. Court records did not list an attorney for Aune, and a phone listing tried by the Associated Press didn’t work. The complaint alleged Aune generally bought 20-packs of respirators for between $17 and $23 from local stores. Between Feb. 10 and March 16, he sold respirators on Amazon at an average price of $89.25, the complaint states and alleged he made other sales on eBay. Reselling the respirators for “unconscionable prices during a time of increased necessity and high demand … offends public policy,” violates fairness concepts and and is unethical, the complaint stated. Assistant Attorney General John Haley, by email, said price-gouging involves taking advantage of an emergency. He said factors developed by the Alaska Supreme Court to help determine when an action is unfair under the law include whether it violates generally accepted fairness standards; is immoral, unethical, unscrupulous or oppressive; and whether it hurts people or businesses.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Some shooting ranges in metro Phoenix are closing to the public or restricting hours in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Arizona Game and Fish Department announced that Ben Avery Shooting Facility in north Phoenix, off Interstate 17 and the Carefree Highway, is closed to the public until further notice. The rifle and pistol ranges at Ben Avery are still open to law enforcement officers and user groups, which have mandated insurance and use ranges for firearms training and education. The Ben Avery archery range remains open to the public from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Only cash payments left in the drop box are accepted. Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide stay-at-home order, which will run through April. Although Ducey encouraged Arizonans to stay home to curb the spread of COVID-19, he said it’s important for residents to be able to go outside for recreation, as long as they practice social distancing. Privately operated ranges are still open across the Valley, but many are cutting hours and services. The Usery Mountain Shooting Range, on Ellsworth Road near the Usery Mountain Regional Park in the far East Valley, is limiting services to curb the spread of the virus. The range, which is operated by the Rio Salado Sportsman’s Club on land owned by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, is postponing all competitions, user groups and organized activities through the end of May, the range announced. The main public range, member range and sporting clays course are still open to the public. Indoor ranges, which often rent and sell firearms, are open with limited hours.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Buffalo National River was temporarily closed Thursday because of coronavirus concerns. The National Park Service said the closure takes effect immediately and includes the river, trails, campgrounds and open spaces. “It breaks my heart to have to close this incredible public park,” Buffalo National River superintendent Mark Foust said in a release. “It is, however, the right thing to do to protect the people that work here, live here, visit here, and love this place.” Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday asked the federal government to close the park and imposed temporary restrictions on state parks, including prohibiting overnight use at them. Hutchinson, legislators and local officials have complained about large numbers of people crowding the Buffalo National River area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A British man accused of smuggling a phony coronavirus cure into the United States was charged with a federal crime, prosecutors said. Frank Richard Ludlow, 59, of West Sussex was charged in Los Angeles federal court with introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and could face up to three years in federal prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. He was arrested last week on drug charges in the United Kingdom and remains in custody there, authorities said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had an attorney. Prosecutors alleged that Ludlow, who isn’t a doctor, had been selling people in California and Utah via mail a concoction called “Trinity Remedy” that he touted as a “miracle cure” for various ailments, according to a court affidavit. “This cure’ – later rebranded as ‘Trinity Mind, Body & Soul’ – allegedly contained vitamin C, an enzyme mix, potassium thiocyanate, and hydrogen peroxide. Consumers were instructed to add 18 ounces of water, say a prayer, drink half of the solution, take a probiotic along with bee pollen, and then ingest the remainder of the solution,” the U.S. attorney’s office statement said. Authorities said Ludlow sold between 300 and 400 of the treatment kits, but in February or March, as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, he began selling the kits under a new name: “Trinity COVID-19 SARS Antipathogenic Treatment.” The treatments haven’t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any medical use. “Every major health authority has warned that there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection,” according to the U.S. attorney’s office. “Hucksters who hawk ‘treatments’ for this deadly disease put consumers’ lives at risk by peddling unapproved drugs.”\n\nColorado\n\nColorado: In the past two weeks, Northern Colorado shelters and rescue groups have seen dramatic spikes in adoption and foster applications. As adoptions soar during the coronavirus epidemic, fewer pets are being surrendered to the Larimer Humane Society, said Tylor Starr, marketing and community outreach program manager. Although they have shut down adoptions through April 17 because of the stay-at-home order, the humane society is still providing lost-and-found, urgent owner surrender and end-of-life services to alleviate animal suffering, he said. Between March 18 and March 25, the humane society adopted out 83 animals, a 28% increase, and witnessed a 41% decrease in surrenders compared with the same time last year. The humane society still has 51 animals in foster homes and 53 more foster homes on standby. Starr said he doesn’t anticipate the need for more foster families at the moment. Bounce Animal Rescue in Fort Collins has seen a threefold increase in adoption applications and a flood of families stepping up to foster dogs, said executive director Anneliese Clark. Before the pandemic, Bounce typically received five to 10 adoption applications per dog. Now, it’s seeing 30 applications per animal and getting about 50 foster home applications a day. Weekly adoption events are on hold during the pandemic, but Bounce is still doing virtual appointments with potential adopters, “low-contact” handoffs for adoptions and a one-week trial for all adoptions to make sure the match is a good fit.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two members of the Connecticut National Guard are among the latest state residents to test positive for COVID-19. An airman assigned to the 103rd Airlift Wing in East Granby tested positive March 27, and a soldier assigned to Joint Force Headquarters who works in Middletown tested positive the next day, National Guard officials said. The airman, between 20 and 30 years old, is hospitalized and the soldier, a woman between 40 and 50 years old, is recovering at home, officials said. On Wednesday, the National Guard also was transforming Southern Connecticut State University’s Moore Fieldhouse and Western Connecticut State University’s O’Neill Center into mobile hospitals to help with the anticipated surge of COVID-19 patients. There will be 250 beds at Southern and 200 at Western.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Trout fishing season started Tuesday, instead of the traditional first Saturday in April, “to help minimize crowds and accommodate responsible outdoor recreation during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) period,” the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said in a release. Anglers can read regulations and find information about licenses on DNREC’s website. Coronavirus or not, the fish were biting. And anglers were eager to get out from isolation, return to a bit of normalcy and get one of those fish. Or, better: the daily limit of six. The DNREC encouraged safe social distancing, reminding anglers that a fishing pole can be about the length of the recommended minimum distance of 6 feet, and to choose less-crowded areas to fish. That can be the hard part, with the trout not practicing social distancing but clumping together in favored spots where they could be seen tantalizingly close in the shallow water. Fishing was a welcome change for Trampas Henderson of Stanton. “It is good to get out; recently I’ve been doing nothing but working and going home. The gym has been closed, restaurants and everything have been closed,” Henderson said. “It’s just nice to get out and do something different.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser said a COVID-19 testing site opens Friday at United Medical Center, WUSA-TV reported. The drive-through and walk-up facility is only open to D.C. residents with symptoms who are 65 and older, health care workers, first responders, and D.C. residents with underlying medical conditions. A hotline will be set up in the coming days so residents can call ahead and make an appointment.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: The Brevard Zoo is welcoming a baby giraffe, which was born on Sunday. The calf weighed 125 pounds and was 6-feet tall at birth. Zoo officials said in a statement that it was the sixth consecutive male calf born there. It was the ninth birth for the calf’s mother, Johari, 20. The father, Rafiki, 21, has sired all 14 giraffe born at the zoo, the statement said. The veterinary staff said the calf is in good health and nursing well, according to zoo officials. Masai giraffe are endangered because of habitat loss and poaching, the statement said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: A kitten stuck on a roof in the cold was saved by firefighters. The 6-week-old kitten was nursed back to health Wednesday after her rescue, Cobb County Fire and Emergency Services said in a post on Facebook. The female kitten quickly recovered after she was given milk, cat food, and was warmed in towels, a fire official told the Marietta Daily Journal. “A future fantasy life on the farm is in order for this adorable kitty,” the post added. The department decided to name the kitten “Shingles” after asking followers on social media to help name the feline, a fire official said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A school has distributed laptops to students who need the computers to take part in online education during the coronavirus outbreak. Hawaii News Now reported Wednesday that Pahoa High and Intermediate School distributed about 200 Google Chromebooks during three drive-thru collection events. The public school’s students signed release forms allowing them to borrow the laptops. The school’s online learning program began this week and staff said teachers and students are adapting to the changes. Staff members said it was important to get the laptops to students quickly so they would have the technological capability they need to learn from their homes. The state Department of Education announced public and charter schools will remain closed to students through April 6 in response to the virus pandemic. Pahoa High and Intermediate teachers developed curriculum using Google classroom and other other online platforms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials are using the coronavirus pandemic to force a through long-delayed livestock grazing allotment decision in critical sage grouse habitat for a powerful agribusiness, an environmental group claimed. Wildlands Defense is asking the Bureau of Land Management to delay its March 20 decision approving Idaho-based J.R. Simplot Co.’s permit on about 94 square miles in southwestern Idaho for at least 10,500 cattle until the virus abates. The director for the Idaho bureau, John Ruhs, has refused. It’s not clear when the agency will issue a final decision, which would start a 30-day appeals process. Wildlands defense said the bureau’s appeal process requiring in-person trips to U.S. Postal Service offices to send or acknowledge receipt of certified mail by dozens of people puts communities at risk. The group said the bureau’s requirements also violate Gov. Brad Little’s March 25 stay-at-home order. The grazing allotment is in an area typically referred to as the Owyhees, which includes the Owyhee Mountains, canyons and rolling flats. Bureau spokesman Ken Frederick, in an email to the Associated Press, said the bureau’s “ability to modify grazing appeal procedures, which require certified mail receipts to confirm that interested parties received notice of a grazing decision and signed hard copies of appeals, is limited.” The agency hasn’t made public on its website the proposed decision. A copy obtained by the AP shows the agency is proposing to renew the grazing permit for 10 years. The average number of cattle on the range has been about 3,700 since Simplot acquired the permit in 1995. The proposed permit for 10,500 is roughly the same as 1995, but numbers typically fluctuate below that based on the condition of the range. Sage grouse are chicken-sized birds with an elaborate courtship ritual. Between 200,000 and 500,000 sage grouse remain in 11 Western states, down from a peak population of about 16 million. Experts generally attribute the decline to road construction, development and oil and gas leasing.\n\nIllinois\n\nCarbondale: Southern Illinois University has suspended the Delta Chi fraternity for violating the chancellor’s order banning in-person activities to slow the spread of COVID-19, officials said. The Southern Illinoisan reported Carbondale police over the past weekend responded to a house party hosted by Delta Chi, a violation of an administrative directive issued March 27 by interim Chancellor John Dunn and dean of students Jennifer Johns-Hall. The directive ordered compliance with Illinois Department of Public Health protocols requiring state residents to stay home except for essential trips for groceries or medicine. Gatherings of 10 or more people are also banned. “It was reported by the Carbondale Police Department that a fraternity in our community blatantly disregarded this message,” said Fraternity and Sorority Life assistant director Rachel Dunning said in an email announcing the suspension, adding it will stay in affect indefinitely. Jones-Hall said students found to have been involved in the incident will be referred to the student administration office.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An April Fools’ Day prank making the rounds on social media suggested that Indiana students will have to repeat their current grade because of the coronavirus crisis. The joke, created by prank websites that can be used to generate social media posts that resemble real news stories, used Gov. Eric Holcomb’s image and claimed that he announced the move during a news conference. That did not happen. Holcomb addressed the prank and others like it Wednesday afternoon. Holcomb noted the date, then said he had received calls and texts asking about executive orders it was rumored he had signed Wednesday. “There were none today and get your information from the Department of Health’s website, that coronavirus website,” Holcomb said. “Don’t get it from someone who’s forwarding a forward that’s been forwarded. Get your information from the Department of Health.” Indiana isn’t the only state dealing with the spread of this fake news on social media. Posts mentioning schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and California are also being generated and shared. In Indiana, all schools will remain closed until at least May 1 and all state testing has been canceled. But students won’t be repeating the grade.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Lily Ungs, 17, of Urbandale performed a ballet for residents of the Summit House senior community in Des Moines on Wednesday night. Since the coronavirus epidemic began, Wednesdays are called “Balcony Night” in the community. Instead of gathering at each other’s apartments or various spots around the building, the residents have taken to standing on their balconies and chit-chatting across the gap. But Jon and Elaine Lindgren cajoled Ungs, their granddaughter, into performing a routine in the parking lot. Ungs studied at the prestigious Ballet West Academy in Salt Lake City, until her school year, like so many others, was shortened by the pandemic. Shortly before 6:30 p.m., Ungs warmed up, using the backs of parked cars to run through her routine stretches. She wore a white tutu and a silver tiara. The residents gathered on their balconies and folks from the other side of the building made their way over, doing their best to stay 6 feet away from their neighbors per coronavirus protocols. With scores of eyes upon her, Ungs twirled and tapped across the rough surface. Her performance included “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from “The Nutcracker.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state expects an influx of coronavirus tests in the coming weeks that should help with efforts to bring the pandemic under control, the state’s top health official said. Dr. Lee Norman, the state’s secretary of health and environment, said that he expects to have up to 64,000 test kits that can produce results in 45 minutes, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. “Very clearly we need to do population studies, meaning testing people who are well,” Norman said. “It’s very fundamental work and will push the analysis (of the virus) upstream. But until that time, social distancing is the name of the game.” Gov. Laura Kelly has issued a statewide stay-at-home-order as part of efforts to slow the virus’ spread, but getting everyone to follow it has proved challenging. The Shawnee Mission School District, which is among the state’s largest with more than 27,000 students, announced that it would begin issuing trespassing warnings Thursday for people who violate social distancing rules at its fields and stadiums. Those facilities remain open so people can exercise. But officials said the district and local police departments have received numerous complaints about large groups playing organized sports. People are supposed to stay at least 6 feet from each other and not gather in groups of more than 10.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:The Kentucky National Guard already has been posted at local hospitals, but they soon will be at food banks amid the coronavirus pandemic.Gov. Greg Beshear announced Wednesday that the National Guard will deploy 70 members to four regional food bank warehouses located in Louisville, Elizabethtown, Wilder and Lexington.”Deployment is going to help feed seniors, families and displaced workers,” Beshear said during his daily news conference. “The National Guard members will assist Kentucky’s food banks by sorting and packing food into bags and boxes and distributing that through no-touch food distributors.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Gov. John Bel Edwards reported a “jarring” uptick in coronavirus cases Thursday, though the state health department’s top COVID-19 expert said the spike is the result of a logjam of test results finally released to the state. The state reported 2,726 new cases Thursday for a total of 9,150 in 61 of the state’s 64 parishes. “This largely reflects people who already knew their test results, but the reporting to the state lagged,” Louisiana Department of Health Dr. Alex Billioux said on a conference call with reporters. “What we want to be clear is ... this isn’t a sudden 24-hour jump in cases that are a run on our health system; rather, it’s a bottleneck of reporting testing results,” Billioux said. Billioux said the backlog is largely from commercial testing, where he said 160,000 national tests results have lagged being reported to state. “There’s been pressure on those companies to get a better flow,” he said. He said the spike from delayed reports makes it harder to determine Louisiana’s infection trajectory. “These are cases newly reported, not necessarily new cases,” Billioux said. “The trajectory is still very concerning ... but the extra element of lagging results makes it harder to (calculate) the trajectory.” Thursday’s number of hospitalizations rose less than than 10% to 1,638.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Unemployment claims in Maine have reached a new high, surpassing a previous record attributed to the coronavirus outbreak. There were about 23,800 initial claims for unemployment compensation during the week that ended March 28, the Maine Department of Labor said. The previous record was about 21,500 claims a week earlier. There had been fewer than 700 claims a week before that in Maine, which had been riding a long streak of low unemployment. The Maine Department of Labor said in a statement that the virus “has caused significant economic hardship for Maine people and job losses across the state, particularly in the food services and lodging, health care and social assistance, retail trade and manufacturing industries.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: In the span of a week, Hardwire went from building armor to help protect soldiers from improvised explosives to trying to protecting health care workers from an enemy invisible to the naked eye. Developing a new type of face shield required long hours, sleepless nights and many cups of coffee, CEO Geroge Tunis said, but in the span of about 10 days Hardwire designed, tested, refined, retested and now manufacturers thousands of shields a day. The shields came at a crucial time for Atlantic General Hospital in Berlin, said Michael Franklin, the hospital’s president and CEO. “We were out of face shields,” Franklin said. “We were using goggles from Lowes and Home Depot. They had provided us with a lot of regular safety goggles and one of the paint stores in town also brought over all their safety goggles.” More than 100 face shields were assembled after the first day of production, Tunis said. Four days later, the company manufactured 12,000, with an additional 7,000 being built in one day alone. “This virus is spreading exponentially so every hour counts. So getting into production in meaningful levels is so important,” Tunis said. “You can’t make 10 of something and think you’re making a meaningful dent in it. The right number is 60,000-100,000 a day. You need to be at that level.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The New England Patriots’ private team plane returned to Boston from China on Thursday on a rainy afternoon carrying most of an order of 1million masks crucial to health care providers fighting to control the spread of the new coronavirus. Standing in front of the plane on the tarmac at Logan International Airport, Gov. Charlie Baker thanked Patriots owner Robert Kraft, officials in China who partnered with the state, and medical workers who need the masks. “This shipment comes at a critical time as we prepare for an anticipated surge in the coming weeks ahead,” Baker said. “What we were able to accomplish with this particular mission will go a long way forward in this fight.” Baker secured the N95 masks from Chinese manufacturers but had no way of getting them to the U.S. Baker said Thursday an earlier order for 3million masks had been confiscated at the Port of New York and this time he wanted a direct humanitarian delivery to the state. In an interview with Patriots.com radio Thursday, Kraft Sports and Entertainment chief operating officer Jim Nolan said the Chinese government didn’t sign off on the trip until March 27. He said the hurdles included legal logistics that were only cleared thanks to cooperation involving multiple state, U.S. and international entities. Nolan said the Patriots received permission to land in China and got a waiver of a 14-day quarantine because the pilots didn’t get off the plane. Baker said some masks will go to New York and Rhode island. The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday urged state lawmakers not to come to the Capitol on Tuesday, as planned, saying it is too dangerous to convene a session during the coronavirus pandemic. But she later clarified her remarks through a spokeswoman, saying lawmakers should convene briefly and in a safe manner to extend her emergency and disaster orders, and then return to their districts. “They should come in, extend (the orders) 70 days, and return to their communities like the rest of us are doing to keep the public safe,” spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said. However, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, and other Republican lawmakers have said the requested 70-day extension is too long, and they plan to approve a shorter extension when they convene Tuesday. Earlier, at a news conference at the Capitol, Whitmer said: “The Legislature’s insistence on coming in next week is something I implored them not to do.” Whitmer’s original emergency declaration is set to expire Tuesday. However, she made a new disaster declaration on Wednesday, meaning she can continue to exercise emergency powers for another 28 days from Wednesday without the need for the Legislature to convene and vote on a resolution to extend the emergency or the disaster. She also has powers under the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act to continue to act unilaterally, even without an extension from lawmakers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz said he will deliver his postponed State of the State address on at 7 p.m. Sunday, and added he’s looking forward to speaking directly to Minnesotans during this uncertain time. The governor said Wednesday that he will deliver the speech alone with a remote camera from the Governor’s Residence, where he was in his 12th day of self-quarantining since a member of his security detail tested positive for COVID-19. “It is appropriate at this time with the character of Minnesota shining so brightly that we address where we’re at, and more importantly, where we’re going,” Walz said in his daily briefing for reporters. Minnesotans can view the address on YouTube Live and participating media outlets. Walz was going to deliver his State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature on March 23, but had to cancel it amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A nonpartisan special election to fill a state House seat is being delayed by two months because of concerns about the new coronavirus. Gov. Tate Reeves announced Thursday that June 23 is the new date for the election in District 88 in parts of Jasper and Jones counties. If a runoff is needed, it will be July 14. The original date was April 21 with a May 12 runoff. Three candidates have qualified for the race, and the qualification period will not reopen. Republican Rep. Ramona Blackledge of Laurel resigned Jan. 31, less than a month after the start of the four-year term. The freshman lawmaker said she had to choose between serving in the House and collecting her state retirement pay. She said she could not afford to relinquish the pension that she earned during 40 years of working for county government. In Mississippi special elections, candidates run without party labels on the ballot but they often tell voters their party affiliation.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Smaller local governments are issuing stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the new coronavirus in Missouri, where the governor hasn’t issued a statewide order. Such orders took effect more than a week ago in the state’s largest cities, including Kansas City and St. Louis, but smaller counties with few or no COVID-19 cases are now telling residents to leave home only for essential reasons, such as to buy groceries or medicine. The order in St. Francois County, in southeastern Missouri, takes effect on Friday, The Kansas City Star reported. The county had 10 cases as of Wednesday morning. Gov. Mike Parson hasn’t ruled out issuing a statewide order, but he has said he was hesitant to impose state control over what he believes is a local issue.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County commissioners voted 2-1 to conduct an all-mail ballot election for the June 2 primary to reduce the chances of elderly election judges, county employees and voters from getting the new coronavirus. Clerk and Recorder Rina Fontana Moore recommended using only mail ballots out of concern that the coronavirus would be spread during the election at Montana ExpoPark. On March 25, Gov. Steve Bullock issued an order suspending a state law requiring that federal elections be conducted by poll and giving counties the options of all-mail ballot elections. The June 2 primary is a federal election. Commissioner Joe Briggs said he personally favored the mail ballot but voted against the resolution calling for the all-mail ballot election. He’s concerned that the governor doesn’t have the authority to suspend a state statute and that the Montana Association of Counties, which insures the county, won’t pay the county’s legal bills if the all-mail ballot election is challenged in court. Exhibition Hall still will be open on election day June 2 but voting will begin soon after May 8, when about 40,000 ballots will be mailed to residents.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state saw another record-setting surge in unemployment claims last week as the new coronavirus forced more businesses to close and lay off workers, according to new data released Thursday. The state received 24,572 unemployment claims during the week that ended March 29, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The previous record of 15,700 was set in the prior week as state officials imposed tough new restrictions on businesses and residents hunkered down at home to keep the virus from spreading. Nebraska has now had about 40,000 jobless claims in the last two weeks, which is about as many as it usually gets in a year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More than 20,000 people registered to vote in March, but the rate of people signing up to vote slowed at the end of the month, when state Department of Motor Vehicles offices closed because of the coronavirus epidemic, according to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. The DMV closures have an outsized impact on voter registration numbers because of a new state law that automatically registers someone to vote when registering for a license with the DMV or making other transactions with the agency, unless the person opts out. Cegavske’s office said Wednesday night that for the first half of March, the state DMV saw 2,100 transactions daily, but in the second half of the month as the virus spread, it dropped to about 470 transactions a day. Overall Nevada saw the number of active registered voters grow by 1.27% in March. Democrats represent 39% of all registered voters, Republicans make up 33% and unaffiliated voters are 23%.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Some county jail inmates who were convicted or accused of nonviolent crimes have been released to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, state corrections officials said. New Hampshire Public Radio reported the jail in Rockingham County, one of the largert jails in the state, has released about a dozen people. County Corrections Superintendent Stephen Church said the release of a defendant often depends on specific restrictions or requirements, such as daily check-ins, electronic monitoring or participation in programming. The majority of inmates who have been released by county jails have been close to the end of their sentences, or have been on work or weekend releases. Correctional facilities across the state are putting new inmates under quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: Gov. Phil Murphy toured a 250-bed field hospital at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus. The facility will open early next week, according to the governor. The hospital is scheduled to field noncoronavirus cases. It’s one of four field hospitals that are supposed to open in New Jersey. There will be two 250-bed facilities in Edison, with the fourth a 250-bed field hospital in Atlantic City.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDoña Ana: Officials with the Doña Ana County Detention Center reported that there are no cases of COVID-19 at the facility, and that they have initiated a quarantine for new detainees. In a news release issued late Wednesday night, county officials stated that all new detainees will be held in a quarantined area of the center for 14 days to mitigate the potential spread of the novel coronavirus within the facility. New detainees will be housed together in order to limit their interaction with other detainees, officials said. This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. This new process will remain in place while the public health emergency is in effect. In addition, the county announced it will more thoroughly and frequently clean and disinfect the facility. Visitors of adult detainees are not allowed inside the detention center. However, they might schedule free calls and video visits from home, using a laptop or desktop computer at www.legacyinmate.com/Prepaid. Additional fee-based connections remain available, as well as texting, via www.gettingout.com. Visitation remains open for the Juvenile Detention Center, with restrictions. To schedule a visit, call (575) 647-7680. Also, juvenile detainees have access to two free 10-minute phone calls per week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Veterinarians are answering the call to give up their ventilators to help fight the new coronavirus in humans. With city hospitals facing a ventilator shortage as coronavirus cases multiply, Mayor Bill De Blasio on Tuesday urged vets, plastic surgeons and others who might have the potentially life-saving equipment to lend it for the duration of the crisis. The New York Post reported the request is forcing some vets to prioritize human life over the animals for which they care. “There’s usually a distinct line between veterinary medicine and human medicine and there’s no crossover,” Brett Levitzke, the chief medical officer at Veterinary Emergency & Referral Group, told the newspaper. “That’s what makes the time we’re in so unprecedented.” A representative for Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, which operates animal hospitals in Manhattan and Brooklyn, said the organization donated seven ventilators to New York-Presbyterian Hospital.But Levitzke’s practice has only one ventilator, and the decision to give it up is not one he makes lightly. Still, he said, “it’s just the right thing to do.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTarboro: A man has been arrested after deputies, who were responding to a call about a shooting, found more than 70 people at a barn, a sheriff’s office said. The Edgecombe County Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded to Bynum Drive in Pinetops last Saturday in reference to shots fired into a residence, news sources reported on Thursday When deputies reached the scene, they saw vehicles leaving the area, and when they went to the back of the residence, they found more than 70 people, which is in violation of Gov. Roy Cooper’s order limiting gatherings. John Fitzgerald Taylor of Pinetops was charged last Saturday for violating the governor’s executive order. Authorities said Taylor was responsible for the gathering. As for the report of gunfire, deputies said the shooting happened on the street and that a stray bullet went into the back kitchen window of a nearby residence nearby. No one was injured and there have been no arrests in that incident.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: One of the state’s largest oil producers filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, citing the coronavirus pandemic on top of plunging oil prices. Gov. Doug Burgum said he expected more might follow and would “create real pressure on state budgets.” Although Whiting Oil was filing for Chapter 11 protection, state leaders were looking at an expected $1.2billion in aid from the federal bailout package – possibly enough with rainy-day money to avert the need to radically rework the state budget. “There are so many unknowns right now but we can absorb a tremendous budget shortfall without a special session,” state budget director Joe Morrissette said. General fund revenue, which is funded largely by state taxes on income, sales and energy, was ahead of projections for the current two-year budget cycle by more than $106million, Morrissette said. The state also has $65million from the prior budget cycle and a record $726million in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund that can be tapped by the governor when tax collections fall short of expectations, though only after agencies endure across-the-board cuts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans are confronted with an additional four weeks in isolation as Gov. Mike DeWine extended the state’s stay-at-home order Thursday to undercut the coming peak of coronavirus cases. The order issued by state health director Dr. Amy Acton will continue stay-at-home precautions until May 1. The initial stay-at-home order bought Ohio time to prepare for the onslaught of predicted cases, DeWine said. The two-week stay-at-home order issued March 23 – restricting many Ohioans to only vital travel for food and medical care and closing workplaces deemed non-essential – had been set to expire Monday night. The governor had signaled for days that the social-distancing order was near-certain to be prolonged with COVID-19 cases not projected to peak until later this month. DeWine said the new order would require retail stores, apparently including groceries, to post a limit of people to be admitted to stores at any one time to help reduce virus risk. The state is not setting a number. Although no limits remain on attendance at weddings and funerals, receptions are limited to no more than 10 people. Campgrounds are also being ordered closed under the new order, but those who live in a recreational vehicle at a campground can remain. State parks are not being closed, but social distancing must be practiced.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt called Thursday for a special session of the Legislature as part of his declaration of a health emergency in all 77 counties. Declaring a health emergency gives the governor broader powers to coordinate the state’s response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, including the ability to waive some statutory or regulatory requirements, said Stitt spokesman Charlie Hannema. State law requires the Legislature to convene within two business days to either concur with or terminate the health emergency, so the Legislature is expected to convene at 8 a.m. Monday. Under Stitt’s order, the state’s Commissioner of Health Gary Cox is authorized as the primary public health authority. On Wednesday, Stitt extended his “Safer At Home” order until April 30 and included all 77 counties, rather than just those with a confirmed case. The order requires nonessential businesses to shut down and the elderly and medically vulnerable to stay indoors. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A doctor at a veterans home in Oregon used a malaria drug to treat eight patients there for the new coronavirus, but said a state rule enacted last month would prevent him from treating any more veterans there. After pushback against the Oregon Board of Pharmacy’s March 25 rule, the board amended it on Wednesday to allow the drug to be used not only in hospitals for confirmed COVID-19 cases, but also long-term care facilities like the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon. Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, showed encouraging signs in small, early tests against the new coronavirus but has not proved safe or effective for this in any major scientific studies yet. It’s approved now for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In the second week of March, the first cases of the coronavirus began emerging at the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon, when two men in their 80s fell ill with COVID-19. Then more got sick. After hearing that hydroxychloroquine could be effective, Dr. Rob Richardson began treating eight of the veterans with it and an antibiotic called azithromycin, also known as Z-Pak. On March 25, the Oregon Board of Pharmacy adopted a temporary emergency rule prohibiting the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine “for presumptive treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infection.” But late Wednesday, the pharmacy board changed its regulation, allowing “for a seriously ill patient in an institutional setting, such as Correctional Facilities and Long-Term Care Facilities, who would otherwise be hospitalized” to receive the drugs. Of the eight patients that Richardson treated with hydroxychloroquine and Z-Pak, seven recovered and one – a 91-year-old patient – died. Richardson has no conclusive evidence that the treatment led to their recovery but there were no negative side effects.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As expected, demand far exceeded the capacity of Pennsylvania’s system of state-owned liquor stores to process online orders as sales resumed Wednesday. Brick-and-mortar liquor stores are closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but nearly 278,000 people tried to place orders on the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board website during the first day of digital sales. By comparison, the site attracted 32,300 users when the liquor agency recently released several sought-after but limited-availability whiskeys. “As we expected, consumer interest and site traffic far exceeded our ability to accept orders,” a spokeswoman said Thursday. For now, the state is limiting website access to prevent the system from crashing, giving only a limited number of randomly selected consumers access to shop. All others get a screen indicating the online store is closed.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A coalition of labor unions and social justice organizations in Rhode Island is calling on state leaders to pass their own coronavirus relief package to help workers and the newly unemployed. The federal government’s relief package is not enough, the 14 groups said in a letter Wednesday to Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, all Democrats. “Our state response must continue to fill the gaps left by the federal stimulus response packages to support the Rhode Islanders who are losing their jobs and the disproportionately low-wage workers who are heroically keeping us fed and cared for at great risk to themselves,” the group said, according to The Providence Journal. Some of the group’s proposals include double paid sick time from 40 hours per year to 80 hours and raising the minimum wage for some. The Gaspee Business Network also issued a list of recommendations for state leaders to consider during the pandemic, including giving businesses more time to remit sales tax; temporarily cutting the minimum wage; and suspending internet sales tax collections.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Public health officials are creating a statewide database of addresses of known positive COVID-19 cases, a secure tool only made available to first responders who have argued the information could help protect them. Although solely intended for the emergency response community, it’s also a step toward the release of more specific information about the location of infections that officials have come under fire for resisting. The online matrix, according to Nick Davidson, acting director of public health for the Department of Health and Environmental Control, comes in response to local officials’ complaints that first responders were being left potentially vulnerable to the disease and also needed that information to conserve protective gear, which is in short supply. Starting next week, Davidson told the Associated Press, the agency will be live with a “secure, web-based system” that first responders can access to see if a home to which they’re being called has a resident who’s tested positive for the new coronavirus. Responders will be able to query the system, which will have known positive cases listed by the address on a patient’s driver’s license.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nEagle Butte: The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said it is setting up checkpoints on roads going into tribal land on Thursday to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The tribe won’t allow people in noncommercial vehicles with out-of-state licenses unless they can prove tribal membership and that they live on the reservation. The tribe also will restrict people who are not members from hunting on tribal lands. The tribe will be monitoring all other traffic on the main roads going into the reservation. So far, no one living on the reservation has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the latest update from South Dakota health officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state will retrofit the Gateway Shopping Center for a 170-bed hospital to help add capacity to the Memphis metropolitan area’s medical system in the face of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Bill Lee said the Army Corps will construct a COVID-19 positive center at the shopping center along Jackson Avenue. He said the Corps is scouting other sites in Memphis, as well. Lee said the facility will be used for nonacute care patients. That would potentially save capacity at existing hospitals in Memphis. The portion of the shopping center that is vacant west of the existing Save-A-Lot grocery store would be retrofitted, according to city officials who learned of the announcement shortly before it was made public. According to a sign on the building, there is up to 105,000 square feet available to lease. Across the country, the Army Corps has been relied upon for its expertise to help combat the surge by retrofitting existing facilities. The Memphis and Shelby County joint task-force submitted more than a dozen sites to the Army Corps.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: Residents are being required to wear something that covers their nose and mouth when they’re out in public during the coronavirus pandemic – or face a fine of up to $1,000. Starting Thursday, all people in Laredo over the age of 5 will have to wear some kind of covering, such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandanna or handkerchief, when entering a building open to the public. Residents will also have to cover their mouth and nose when using public transportation, taxis, ride shares or when pumping gas. The new rule doesn’t apply to people riding in their own vehicles or if they are outside for exercise and following social distancing guidelines. Laredo’s city council issued the mandate on Tuesday. The South Texas city of more than 261,000 residents along the U.S.-Mexico border is about 155 miles southwest of San Antonio. Residents are being encouraged to use homemade masks and leave medical masks, including N95 masks, for health professionals, said Dr. Hector Gonzalez, director of Laredo’s health department. There are nearly 4,700 cases of coronavirus in Texas and at least 70 related deaths, according to state health officials. Others across the country have also been updating their guidance on whether or not to wear some sort of facial covering.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: As the number of coronavirus cases and deaths grew in Utah, the governor announced a freeze on evictions Wednesday and advocates demanded more inmates be released to prevent the spread in jails and prisons. With businesses closed across the state to prevent the spread of the virus that has caused a global pandemic, Gov. Gary Herbert ordered landlords to allow rent payments from affected workers to be deferred and evictions stopped until May 15. “This is designed to help people who, through no fault of their own, have lost jobs or lost income because of COVID-19,” he said. The ACLU of Utah is going to the Utah Supreme Court to demand more prison and jail inmates be released so the facilities can take steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus, like social distancing and frequent hand washing. Authorities have not yet confirmed any cases among inmates, but attorneys said it could spread quickly in jails and prisons. Corrections officials did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Similar petitions have been filed in other states.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Members of Chittenden County’s largest emergency response agencies have so far remained mostly healthy despite the spread of the new coronavirus in Vermont. But they are preparing for the anticipated surge in COVID-19 cases as they are being told by health officials that the worst is yet to come. Contingency planning should emergency responders need to self-quarantine or be hospitalized in large numbers has been key. It has also helped that many Vermonters are heeding Gov. Phil Scott’s calls to stay home, said Vermont State Police Capt. Garry Scott, the director of Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs. Despite the danger of COVID-19, emergency responders are committed to continuing to respond in person to calls that involve citizens’ physical safety, they said. Burlington police has reported one case of COVID-19 in a member who was not interacting with the community in an official capacity at the time. That employee has been quarantined, said interim Chief Jennifer Morrison in an email. Burlington police and fire departments, South Burlington police, and Vermont State Police have said that other members have self-isolated for various reasons, but no other positive tests have been reported.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A long-term care facility with one of the nation’s worst known coronavirus outbreaks said Thursday that testing conducted on all residents had more than doubled the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 to nearly 100 as the number of fatalities increased to 16. The Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in suburban Richmond tested all its residents and staff earlier this week after the virus began sweeping through the facility in mid-March, a time when limited testing supplies and strict policies on who could be tested meant such a response was not possible. Ninety-two in-house or hospitalized residents tested positive, the statement said, up from a total earlier in the week of 41. Only 35 tested negative, and 15 tests were outstanding, meaning approximately two-thirds of the facility became infected with the virus. Of the residents who tested positive, 53, or about 58%, were “asymptomatic carriers showing no sign of being ill,” the statement said. The facility’s administrator, Jeremiah Davis, said in a statement that the findings were consistent with other mass testing studies. Among the 16 deaths were five over the last 24-hour period, the facility said in a statement. Canterbury has faced a staffing and supply shortage amid the crisis, though officials have said both have improved in recent days. As of Wednesday afternoon, 25 workers had tested positive, according to Davis. The staff-wide test results were not yet available.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Federal authorities have proposed a $611,000 fine for a Seattle-area nursing home connected to at least 40 coronavirus deaths. State regulators and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conducted an inspection of the Life Care Center of Kirkland on March 16, finding serious infractions that they said placed residents in immediate danger. Authorities said Life Care had at least partially fixed the most serious problems by the time they conducted follow-up inspection in last weekend. In a letter to Life Care on Wednesday, CMS proposed a fine of $611,000, but said that could be adjusted up or down based on how Life Care continues to correct remaining problems. Life Care, which can appeal the fine, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The federal regulators said the most serious problems concerned a failure to rapidly identify and manage sick residents during an outbreak of respiratory illness that began by mid-February; a failure to notify the Washington Department of Health about the increasing rate of respiratory infections among residents; and a failure to have a backup plan in the absence of Life Care’s primary clinician, who fell ill. CMS notified Life Care on March 18 that it had 23 days to remedy violations that placed residents at immediate jeopardy before it would be terminated as a Medicare provider. The agency on Wednesday extended that period, saying Life Care must fix all remaining issues by Sept.16.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s attorney general on Thursday said a ban on elective medical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic will reduce abortions but will be upheld in an eventual legal challenge. The executive order, which went into effect this week, mirrors directives in other Republican-controlled states that have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. West Virginia’s order, which doesn’t explicitly include abortion, said that it applies to all procedures that aren’t “immediately medically necessary to preserve the patient’s life or long-term health” to preserve medical supplies and protective equipment. “We believe that this broad-based prohibition will be upheld because it’s designed to protect the public health and applies to all elective procedures and all elective facilities,” Attorney General Patrick Morrisey told the Associated Press in an interview. Similar orders in Alabama, Texas and Ohio faced legal challenges soon after they were announced from pro-abortion groups who argued the directives violated existing rights to the procedure. Lawsuits were also filed in Iowa and Oklahoma, after governors in those states similarly ordered a stop to non-emergency procedures and specifically included abortion among them. Morrisey said the state’s order applies to abortion facilities despite a section that excludes “procedures that cannot be performed consistent with other law at a later date.” West Virginia bans abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:The United States’ top infectious disease specialist is getting his own bobblehead. The creation from the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in Milwaukee features Dr. Anthony Fauci wearing a suit as he makes a motion showing how the nation needs to “flatten the curve” in the coronavirus pandemic. The museum picked Fauci because many people see the plain-speaking expert on the coronavirus as a hero right now, said co-founder and CEO Phil Sklar. “He isn’t trying to spin things,” he said. “He isn’t trying to make people happy and tell him what they want to hear. He’s actually telling them, you know, how he sees it as an expert. And I think that’s really what we need him this time.” Fauci’s face also appears on socks. And a Rochester, New York, shop is selling doughnuts with his face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with red, white and blue sprinkles. Sklar said the bobblehead museum plans to donate $5 from every $25 Fauci bobblehead that’s sold to the American Hospital Association in support of that group’s effort to get masks and other personal protective equipment for health care workers. Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has served as an adviser to every president since Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump has called him a star on his administration’s coronavirus task force.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Wyoming courts are extending measures to discourage spread of the coronavirus by another seven weeks. The series of measures announced by the Wyoming Supreme Court in March apply to all state courts in Wyoming. They include suspending many types of in-person proceedings, rescheduling trials, allowing for remote administration of oaths, conducting proceedings by video conference and making paper document filings optional. Set to expire April 10, the measures will now continue through May, Chief Justice Michael K. Davis said Wednesday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/11/01/parents-should-welcome-covid-19-vaccine-their-children/6236720001/", "title": "Parents should welcome COVID-19 vaccine for their children", "text": "Dr. Susan Hata\n\nGuest columnist\n\nDr. Susan Hata practices internal medicine and pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhile the best discussions are those in a trusting relationship between individual caregivers and clinicians, let’s pretend this is our exam room so I can share how COVID-19 vaccines benefit kids, and why I believe parents should vaccinate every eligible child.\n\nLong-haul COVID and MIS-C\n\nFirst, children do get sick with COVID and do get long-haul COVID. Vaccination prevents this. Contracting COVID-19 is not trivial for a child. Thousands of youths in the U.S. have had a serious complication of COVID called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).\n\nThe journal Nature reports that as many as 10% of infected children under 12 have have symptoms of COVID that last longer than five weeks, and a United Kingdom study showed that 7.4% of children under 12 still have at least one symptom 12 weeks after infection. Many teens whose cases of COVID were mild, or even asymptomatic, are experiencing troubling cognitive effects lasting for months and affecting their schooling and sports performance.\n\nReducing transmission of COVID among children and around the world also reduces the possibility that another COVID variant will emerge that is more dangerous to children.\n\nAs a pediatrician — and as a parent — one of the things that has sustained me this year is the fact that though we have witnessed the deaths of about 750,000 adults in the U.S., mercifully we have not also lost 750,000 children. Pause for a moment to consider that.\n\nMost vaccine-preventable infections are dangerous to children: diphtheria, pertussis, measles. It is a tremendous relief that children are not dying of COVID at the same rate as adults. We cannot squander this opportunity by waiting for that to change.\n\nIt's also critical that parents understand that we don’t know what late complications of mild childhood COVID infection will arise in the next decades. For example, one in three adults will experience a painful episode of shingles, which is a late complication of a chicken pox infection they experienced often 50 years earlier! Children today are vaccinated for chickenpox and will never experience shingles. In the same way, vaccinating kids for COVID-19 now could prevent them from unforeseen future late effects of mild childhood infections with COVID-19.\n\nConsider children's emotional health\n\nVaccinating children increases the likelihood that they will have an emotionally healthy childhood. Attending school in person, playing with friends and being able to visit relatives are all essential parts of healthy well-being. The mental health crisis we are seeing in children is devastating, and we need to do everything possible to avoid continued periods of social isolation and disruption.\n\nHear more Tennessee voices: Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought-provoking columns.\n\nReducing COVID in the community also helps adults, and this directly helps kids. Less COVID in the world means fewer family stressors like unemployment, financial strain and the stresses of having limited childcare options. Parental stress has been shown to affect children’s mental health problems, and keeping parents healthy benefits kids.\n\nVaccine ingredients are known and safe\n\nAnother parental concern is fear that the ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine could potentially cause unknown harms. However, the vaccine ingredients are familiar to researchers and nearly all of them are already used in other food and medicine products.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine contains one active ingredient: a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA).\n\nAfter mRNA triggers our body to generate the protein that causes the immune response, it breaks down and ceases to exist, making it unlikely to cause any future issues. Dr. Vicky Forster, a research scientist (and a survivor of childhood leukemia) says the best way to think of mRNA is that it’s like “a recipe”: it gives specific information to your cells and lets them read those instructions and discards them after making the recipe. As a physician, the fact that mRNA self-destructs and leaves the body when it’s done it’s job tells me that it will not cause long-term problems.\n\nThe other ingredients in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine include sucrose (table sugar, which helps molecules maintain their shape during freezing); salts (which help balance acidity in the body); and four different lipids, which provide a greasy exterior to the mRNA so it can slip inside the body’s cells.\n\nThe decision to vaccinate a child for COVID-19 may feel harder than most vaccination decisions, given the lack of longitudinal data, and that’s understandable. But as parents and as physicians, all we can do is make the best decision we can with the best information available to us now.\n\nAs of Oct. 28, 600 children had died of COVID-19 (9 deaths per 100,000 pediatric cases of COVID-19). Consider an everyday parallel: We know that 5 in 100,000 children will die in a car accident each year. We also know that seat belts save lives. There are rare events in which children are seriously injured by their seat belt in an accident, and yet, parents faithfully buckle children into car seats and seat belts every time they get in the car, knowing that the chance of the seat belt saving their child’s life is much higher than the rare risk of harm.\n\nChildren with COVID-19 are 75% more likely to die of COVID-19 this year than in a car accident. Think of the COVID-19 vaccine like a seatbelt for your child.\n\nIt is true that any vaccine might cause an unexpected bodily reaction in a small number of recipients, but those incidents are likely to be miniscule in number as compared to the majority of children who will be spared the ravages of COVID-19.\n\nIf you are a vaccinated parent thinking about vaccinating your young child in the coming months, your pediatric provider welcomes your questions. Many of us are vaccinated parents thinking through the same decision for our own children. Let’s face this together. My hope is that all of us will be alive decades from now to reminisce with our adult children about how much we loved them during these years, that we were willing to bravely face courageous decisions to keep them healthy.\n\nDr. Susan Hata practices internal medicine and pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital.

I feel really moved that we're all together.\"\n\nWhile addressing his absence from past reunions, Estevez, 62, said the anniversary get-together \"was something that finally I felt I needed to do just for myself.\" He also noted the fittingness of reuniting in the Windy City, where \"The Breakfast Club\" was filmed.\n\n\"It's obviously the 40th anniversary, and it just felt like it was time,\" Estevez explained. \"Somebody told me that Molly said, 'Well, does Emilio just not like us?' And that broke my heart. And (I went), 'No, of course, I love all of them.' And that just made sense, so here I am.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nReleased in February 1985, \"The Breakfast Club\" centers on a group of adolescents from different school cliques who bond during a weekend detention session. The film grossed $45.9 million at the global box office and became part of the iconic Hughes canon of teen dramas, which includes \"Sixteen Candles,\" \"Pretty in Pink\" and \"Weird Science.\"\n\nThe movie has since been recognized for its enduring appeal. In 2005, the film was honored at the MTV Movie Awards with the Silver Bucket of Excellence award, and in 2016, was inducted into the Library of Congress' National Film Registry. It's also landed on The New York Times' \"Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\" and Entertainment Weekly's \"50 best high school movies\" rankings.\n\nWhy fans shouldn't count on a 'Breakfast Club' remake\n\nThe cast of \"The Breakfast Club\" also paid tribute to the film's director-writer Hughes, who died in August 2009.\n\nNelson, who played rebel John Bender, said Hughes' death was \"profound for me,\" in part because of the film's open-ended conclusion. Following their time spent in detention, the Shermer High School students are seen departing campus, leaving viewers to ponder the possibility of their continued friendships.\n\n\"I always felt in a weird way that the work was half done, that at some point we would all get back together because there were too many questions by everyone, 'What happens on Monday?' The film is about the fact that everyone has to make that decision for themselves,\" Nelson reflected.\n\nHe added: \"Hughes explained to us the differences between the young and old. So, now is the time for him to show us where we meet in the end because we're all older now, but we're not going to get that, which is sad. But in a way, Hughes has been telling us, 'Think for yourself.'\"\n\nWhile a \"Breakfast Club\" sequel is not in the cards, Nelson's co-star Ringwald, who played queen bee and Bender's foe-turned-love-interest Claire Standish, weighed in on the possibility of remaking the classic film.\n\n\"I personally don't believe in remaking that movie because I think this movie is very much of its time,\" Ringwald said. \"It resonates with people today, but I believe in making movies that are inspired by other movies but build on it and represent what's going on today.\"\n\nThe \"Feud\" star highlighted the film's lack of diversity in its main cast as a jumping-off point for future homages.\n\n\"It's very white, this movie. You don't see a lot of different ethnicities,\" Ringwald said. \"We don't talk about gender, none of that, and I feel like that really doesn't represent our world today. So, I would like to see movies that are inspired by 'The Breakfast Club' but take it in a different direction.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/05/22/brats-movie-trailer-brat-pack-andrew-mccarthy/73810599007/", "title": "Andrew McCarthy reunites with Brat Pack in 'Brats' documentary trailer", "text": "Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don’t you forget about the Brat Pack.\n\nThe official trailer for “Brats,” a documentary by actor Andrew McCarthy about the famous “Brat Pack” collective in the 1980s, dropped Wednesday. The nearly two-and-a-half-minute clip sees McCarthy reconnect with his former co-stars, including Emilio Estevez and Demi Moore, about the infamous moniker given to them as young actors.\n\nA 1985 New York Magazine article coined the term “Brat Pack” as a riff on Frank Sinatra’s \"Rat Pack,\" and it was used to refer to McCarthy and his peers – Estevez, Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy and others – who starred in coming-of-age films such as “Sixteen Candles,” “The Breakfast Club” and “St. Elmo’s Fire.”\n\n\"I just remember seeing that cover and thinking, 'Oh,’ \" McCarthy says in the trailer, adding an expletive. \"From then on, my career and the career of everyone who was involved was branded to the Brat Pack.”\n\nSign up for our Watch Party newsletter: We deliver the best movie and TV recommendations to your inbox\n\nNeed a break?

The infrastructure was already in place from last year and 2022 was supposed to be a hybrid event in any case, with some journalists and viewers logging in from afar.\n\nThe answer to that initial question, it seems, is yes. The online pivot has resulted in a growth in Sundance’s reach and money followed. Apple TV+ paid a reported $15 million for Cooper Raiff’s coming of age comedy “Cha Cha Real Smooth,” while Sony Picture Classics bought Oliver Hermanus’ “Living” (a remake of Akira Kurosawa’s “Ikiru”) for around $5 million and Searchlight spent $7.5 million on the Emma Thompson-fronted sex-positive chamber piece “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande.” On the documentary side, National Geographic cleaned up, buying “The Territory,” a profile of indigenous conservationists in the Brazilian Amazon, along with festival smash-hit “Fire of Love,” about married volcanologists, while Netflix swooped in on “Descendant,” Margaret Brown’s moving account of the search for the last slave ship to reach US shores by the descendants of those who were on board.\n\nNone of these films were awarded grand prizes from Sundance juries, however. “Nanny,” Nikyatu Jusu’s phantasmagoric tale of an undocumented Senegalese migrant in New York, won in the US Dramatic category, while “Utama,” Alejandro Loayza Grisi’s sparse and beautiful Bolivian eco-parable, won World Dramatic. The US Documentary award went to Ben Klein and Violet Columbus for “The Exiles,” which follows the lives of exiled dissidents and a filmmaker reviving an a project with them, and Shaunak Sen won the World equivalent for “All That Breathes,” a profile of two brothers trying to protect local wildlife amid Delhi’s air pollution crisis. The Festival Favourite Award, selected by public vote, went to “Navalny,” Daniel Roher’s docuthriller about Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny (CNN and HBO Max are distributing).\n\nA look at some of the noteworthy Sundance Film Festival titles follows below.\n\n“You Won’t Be Alone”\n\nNoomi Rapace in Goran Stolevski's \"You Won't Be Alone.\" Courtesy of Branko Starcevic/Sundance Institute\n\nGoran Stolevski’s dazzling fable about a body-swapping witch in 19th century Macedonia has much to recommend it.\n\nThe writer-director’s accomplished debut feature transports us into an agrarian past of calloused tradition and deep-set suspicion, not all which are unfounded. Baby Nevena has been abducted by an evil spirit and raised away from the village. At 16 she becomes a witch and makes contact with the nearby community, only to accidentally kill a woman (Noomi Rapace, “Lamb,” “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”). Nevena then assumes her identity; it won’t be her last.\n\nThe screenplay uses the bones of folk horror to explore patriarchal structures, family and sacrifice, employing this ultimate outsider as a curious mirror to society. The film benefits from beautiful work by cinematographer Matthew Chuang, who captures the idyllic countryside with a sense of wonderment and dread, while an ethereal voiceover threads together the thoughts of this young woman in various guises, striving to find meaning and connection.\n\nThe film was picked up by Focus Features ahead of the festival and will be released in the US in April.\n\n“Cha Cha Real Smooth”\n\nCooper Raiff and Dakota Johson in \"Cha Cha Real Smooth.\" Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nCooper Raiff’s second feature is further evidence that one of the smartest things you can do for your movie right now is cast Dakota Johnson in it.\n\nRaiff, writing, directing and starring as listless 22-year-old Andrew, enters the orbit of Domino (Johnson). Andrew’s little brother is in class with Domino’s daughter Lola (Vanessa Burghardt) and both find themselves on the bar and bat mitzvah circuit (Andrew first as a chaperone then a professional party coordinator). There’s more than a frisson between the two, but she’s engaged, though her fiancé is mostly absent.\n\nJohnson brings an air of mystery to every performance, and Raiff harnesses that intractability. Domino seems sad and wise, Andrew sweet and puppy-doggish. What does Domino really want? If Andrew stopped projecting on to her, maybe he’d find out.\n\nRaiff’s smart script pokes holes in both rom-coms and coming-of-age narratives, and dares to suggest that life may not be figured out in line with society’s milestones. A bar mitzvah or degree does not a grown-up make. Nor does time always provide emotional intelligence. Snark and self-conscious laughs cede the floor to something satisfyingly earnest, with Johnson on hand to offer some much-needed counsel.\n\n“Emergency”\n\nRJ Cyler, Sebastian Chacon and Donald Elise Watkins \"Emergency\" by Carey Williams. Quantrell Colbert/Amazon Studios\n\nStudents Kunle (Donald Elise Watkins), Sean (RJ Cyler) and Carlos (Sebastian Chacon) are kicking off the night to end all nights, but hit a bump when they discover an intoxicated girl on their living room floor. So far so normal for this entry to the “one-last-wild-night-out” canon. Where it goes is anything but.\n\nDirector Carey Williams and writer KD Davila offer a welcome corrective to the subgenre. The reality is that prevailing narratives – from “Booksmart” and “Superbad” back to “American Graffiti” by way of “Dazed and Confused” – have been dominated by White faces. How authorities react to the characters’ hijinks and farcical misunderstandings in those films is inseparable from their racial profile. As Sean points out, the same latitude would not be afforded to two Black men and a Latino trying to help a White woman. “Anybody who’s darker than a brown paper bag should get the f— out of here,” he says at one point.\n\nWilliams and Davila deliver a subversive blow to a cosy formula. The film is abrasive in driving home its point, and by the end is a jangling bag of raw nerve endings that feels thoroughly warranted (kudos to Watkins who provides the emotional clout). As an example of how prejudice imprints itself on the next generation it’s effective, but as a deconstruction of the subgenre, even more so.\n\n“Living”\n\nBill Nighy in Oliver Hermanus' \"Living.\" Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nIt’s a bold idea to remake a movie by Japanese master Akira Kurosawa, although it helps to have Nobel Prize-winner Kazuo Ishiguro on screenplay duties and a star of Bill Nighy’s calibre on board. Let’s not take credit away from director Oliver Hermanus (“Moffie”) however, who delivers this reworking of Kurosawa’s “Ikiru” (1952) with real elegance.\n\nThe story moves from Japan to post-war Britain, but the stiff suits and crippling bureaucracy remains the same. Nighy is Mr Williams, a dreadfully repressed widow who’s made an art of passing the buck as a middle manager at London’s council. When he receives a terminal diagnosis, Williams goes through a Scrooge-ian epiphany, with co-worker Margaret (Aimee Lou Wood) and a bohemian Tom Burke helping him get there.\n\nWilliams’ mindset – that the worst thing you could possibly do to someone is bother them with your feelings – speaks to one of the most destructive aspects of polite society. If that doesn’t chime with you, then mileage may vary. However, for those who can handle the buttoned-up atmosphere, there’s rich rewards in Nighy’s delicate character study. As a gentleman who never learned how to live, it’s deeply moving watching him take tentative steps with one eye on his impending doom. The veteran thesp has never been better.\n\n“Utama” (“Our Home”)\n\nA still from Alejandro Loayza Grisi's \"Utama.\" Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nFirst-time director Alejandro Loayza Grisi heads for the Bolivian highlands in this quiet, well-crafted drama about an elderly Quechua couple faced with a life-threatening drought.\n\nReal-life couple José Calcina and Luisa Quispe play Virginio and Sisa, llama farmers living on parched flats that haven’t seen rain for a year. The old, dwindling community pray, give offerings and hope. The other option, their visiting grandson Clever floats, is to up sticks and move to the city. Giving up a way of life in life’s twilight is not an easy decision, however.\n\nA slight plot gives room for faces and places to breath. First-time actors Calcina and Quispe deliver the kind of stoic, affectless performances that are a boon for a director. Both seem capable of writing whole chapters in a single look – particularly Calcina as Virginio, whose fate seems tied to the land. The film looks great too, shot by Barbara Alvarez to maximize the grand sun-bleached vistas.\n\n“Time has gotten tired,” we’re told. An eco-parable of stark beauty, Grisi’s film is a haunting, hypnotic experience.\n\n“Fire of Love”\n\nA still from \"Fire of Love\" by Sara Dosa. Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nKatia and Maurice Krafft put the “rock” in rockstar scientists in Sara Dosa’s brilliant documentary destined to burnish their legend.\n\nHer account of the late French volcanologists is witty, heart-warming and enthusiastically curious, much like the subjects themselves. Admittedly, the Kraffts are calling many of the shots – literally – as Dosa draws on found footage taken by the married couple between the 1960s and 1990s as they zigzagged the globe in pursuit of scientific knowledge. But what footage it is: just watching is enough to make you want to don one of their silvery protective suits.\n\nThe Kraffts were no stranger to the spotlight, evidenced by clips from talk show interviews and news reports. These scientists had a public persona, and Maurice particularly knew how to leverage their fame to finance their derring-do (and how their derring-do bolstered their fame). Paddling into the middle of a sulfuric acid lake in a rubber dingy may have scientific merit, but it also makes for a thrilling story.\n\nNot that the couple – and by extension the film – is ever insincere about their vocation. We feel their devastation when thousands are killed by Mount Ruiz, Colombia in 1985, and feel for the couple, picking through the aftermath of Mount Saint Helens’ monstrous eruption in 1980.\n\n“It will kill me one day,” Maurice says of his relationship with his work. We know that a volcano will claim them both, as Miranda July’s voiceover explains to us at the start of the film. This knowledge frames everything that follows. However, rather than paint them as reckless or spike the film with a dose of fatalism, Dosa’s portrait of a marriage – to each other and to volcanoes – remains earnest and full of admiration.\n\n“Emily the Criminal”\n\nAubrey Plaza in \"Emily the Criminal.\" Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nAny film that allows Aubrey Plaza to unload like this is a worthy endeavor, and writer-director John Patton Ford gives the actor a lot to tear into as a debt-laden graduate digging herself out of a hole.\n\nThe titular Emily has fallen behind her peers. Earning crumbs in Los Angeles’ gig economy, a co-worker puts her in touch with a quick money “dummy shopper” operation involving cloned credit cards and soon-to-be black-market goods. It’s a ballsy scam and a good showcase for Emily’s chops. She’s wants more of a taste, linking up with Theo Rossi’s Youcef for more lucrative – and more risky – jobs.\n\nFord’s film is a true thriller, built around a series of stressful set pieces and little let up in between. Comparisons to the Safdie brothers’ “Good Time” and “Uncut Gems” are inevitable, but Ford’s film contains a stronger moral backbone. Emily wants to live straight, but a criminal record (for reasons best left unsaid) is a career obstacle. When interviewing for a long-term internship, she rightly calls out the employer when it becomes clear it’s unpaid. The labor market is broken, and exploitative practices on both sides of the law aren’t all that different.\n\nPlaza is given a great showcase for her brand of weary righteousness, pouring scorn where she sees fit. Emily is far from perfect, but we’re always sympathetic toward her and her get-money crusade. That’s star power for you.\n\n“Good Luck to You, Leo Grande”\n\nEmma Thompson and Daryl McCormack in Sophie Hyde's \"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande.\" Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nBreathless headlines will tell you Emma Thompson bares all in this sex-positive drama from Sophie Hyde. That may be true, but they only prove the point made by screenwriter Katy Brand: that women past a certain age are expected to retreat from their bodies and bodily pleasure, rather than find cause for celebration.\n\nEscort Leo (Daryl McCormack) is here to help widowed teacher Nancy (Thompson) do just that. Brand builds a trim screenplay around three meetings in a bland hotel room. If the space is lacking imagination, it’s only a reflection of Nancy’s vanilla love life to date. She’s on the other side of 31 years of marriage and has never had an orgasm; achingly self-conscious and wracked by feelings of hypocrisy and inadequacy, but also proud and prickly. Leo couldn’t be nicer (or is that professional?), and over the course of the movie is out to prove that sexual healing isn’t limited to the act itself.\n\nHyde’s chamber piece could easily be a stage play with its limited setting and tight focus on two actors circling one another. The ever-great Thompson finds an equal sparring partner in McCormack, whose break-out turn is sure to attract plenty of attention. Tender, smart and uplifting, it’s already starting conversations.\n\n“Lucy and Desi”\n\nA still from \"Lucy and Desi,\" directed by Amy Poehler. Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nAmy Poehler’s documentary about Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz looks at the famous couple’s professional and personal relationship.\n\nPoehler takes the talking heads route, with Bette Midler, Norman Lear, Carol Burnett and others weighing in. However, her most insightful interviewee is Ball and Arnaz’s daughter Lucie Arnaz Luckinbill, who offers an intimate view of their marriage and its aftermath. More than anyone, she ties the whole story together.\n\nArchival footage and home audio tapes are on hand to illustrate the couple’s rough ride to fame, their many achievements and the ways they changed the industry, from how sitcom “I Love Lucy” introducing the re-run model to the other iconic shows incubated by their company Desilu Productions. Poehler tells their story with love.\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival concludes on January 30.", "authors": ["Thomas Page"], "publish_date": "2022/01/29"}]}

The event appears to be focused on criticizing the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her ties to California.\n\n“Under Kamala Harris and her dangerous Democrat allies like Tim Walz, the notorious ‘California Dream’ has turned into a nightmare for everyday Americans,” states the campaign email announcing the event. “Californians are suffocating under rising prices for everything from groceries to housing, thanks to Kamalanomics.”\n\nThe event is public, and people who want to attend can register online.\n\nTrump last visited Coachella Valley in 2020\n\nTrump is no stranger to the valley. While still in office in early 2020, Trump held a fundraiser at the Rancho Mirage estate of Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison. Trump’s visit brought dozens of supporters to greet him at Palm Springs International Airport, cheering him on with chants of “Four more years!”\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of Trump’s opponents rallied near Ellison’s estate in Rancho Mirage with signs and a large balloon mocking the president. The counter-protest was organized by Courageous Resistance, a progressive local political group.\n\nUnlike the upcoming event, which has registration open for the public to get tickets, the 2020 event was private and cost a minimum of $100,000 per couple to attend, with a higher ticket price of $250,000 for those who wanted to participate in a policy roundtable with the president.\n\nThe full guest list for the Rancho Mirage fundraiser was not made public, but local gas station mogul Nachhattar Chandi was among those who said he was attending. The president’s arrival at the airport also drew some local political figures, such as Jeff Gonzalez, a Marine veteran and pastor who’s running as a Republican for a state Assembly seat this year; conservative radio talk show host Rich Gilgallon; and Joy Miedecke, president of the East Valley Republican Women Patriots club.\n\nMore: Donald Trump's past golf history Donald Trump part of legacy of golf and the presidency in Coachella Valley\n\nWho owns ranch where Trump will hold rally?\n\nTrump's rally will be at a property owned by the Haagen Co., a firm connected to the family that founded the Empire Polo Club, home to the Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals, in 1987.\n\nThe polo club's music festival history dates to 1993, when rock band Pearl Jam was looking for somewhere to play that didn't sell tickets through Ticketmaster.\n\nAlexander Haagen III's 110-acre club seemed perfect to Goldenvoice CEO Paul Tollett and his late partner, Rick Van Santen. The concert ended up drawing 25,000 Pearl Jam fans. In the next decade, Haagen went on to double the size of his property and create a landscape design unique in the polo world.\n\nIn 2022, the Indio City Council approved a request from Alexander Haagen IV to rename the Avenue 51 right-of-way stretch, half a mile west of Monroe Street, to Haagen Way. But ahead of the vote, a few residents spoke in opposition to the change, citing what they say are negative repercussions in the city from the festivals the Haagens host.\n\nThe Haagen Co. also has been involved with other business ventures in the Coachella Valley, including a since-scrapped plan to redevelop the mall long known as Indio Fashion Mall.\n\nThe land where Saturday's rally will be held is in unincorporated Riverside County, just west of Coachella city limits.\n\nWho will attend Trump rally in Coachella Valley?\n\nIt’s unclear which local elected officials and political candidates could appear on stage at Trump’s rally Saturday, but at least one statewide candidate — Steve Garvey, California’s Republican candidate for U.S. Senate — told The Desert Sun in a text that he won’t be there.\n\nInstead, Garvey will be out of the state accepting an award at the International Symposium on Women in Sports Media in Philadelphia. Garvey's daughter, Olivia, is a past sports anchor at NBC Palm Springs and is now a sports anchor at KNBC in Los Angeles.\n\nTrump has recently criticized Garvey, saying at an event in Rancho Palos Verdes earlier this month that the former Dodger “made a big mistake because he hasn’t reached out to MAGA, and if he doesn’t have MAGA he’s got no chance.”\n\nMiedecke, president of the East Valley Republican Women Patriots, told The Desert Sun on Monday that her club was aware of the rally before Monday's announcement, but she was unsure of who's joining Trump for the rally. She said her club members will be \"very involved\" with the event.\n\nCoachella mayor, U.S. Rep. Raul Ruiz oppose Trump rally\n\nSeveral elected officials in the eastern Coachella Valley condemned Trump’s rally following Monday’s announcement, with Coachella Mayor Steven Hernandez saying Trump “wasn’t invited by the people who live here.”\n\n“The City of Coachella was proud to welcome Senator Bernie Sanders during the 2020 primary election, but news of former President Trump’s upcoming visit has been met very differently,” Hernandez said. \"Trump’s attacks on immigrants, women, the LQBTQ community and the most vulnerable among us don’t align with the values of our community.”\n\n“He has consistently expressed disdain for the type of diversity that helps define Coachella,” the mayor added. “We don’t know why Trump is visiting near Coachella, but we know he wasn’t invited by the people who live here. He ain’t like us.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Indio, echoed the sentiments, saying it’s “truly appalling — and yet another demonstration of his cluelessness and ignorance — that Donald Trump would stage a rally in Coachella” in a statement shared with The Desert Sun.\n\n“Under a second Trump administration, there is literally no place in America that would be harmed more than the Coachella Valley,” Ruiz said, referring to Trump’s tariff policies, his “hate-driven immigration policy” and his “ignorant opposition to clean energy.”\n\n“Donald Trump — and his policies — are an affront to everything that makes the Coachella Valley a vibrant community,” Ruiz added.\n\nCoachella City Councilmember Frank Figueroa and Indio City Councilmember Waymond Fermon also condemned the rally in prepared statements, with Fermon calling Trump “a threat to our needs and to democracy itself.”\n\nBeyond the event’s likely focus on Harris and her ties to Democrat-led California, it’s unclear why Trump’s campaign is holding the event near Coachella, where registered Democratic voters outnumber their Republican counterparts by a roughly 4-to-1 margin.\n\nCoachella’s population is also roughly 98% Latino, while about 41% of its residents were born outside of the United States. During his 2024 campaign, Trump has repeatedly used racist rhetoric to describe undocumented immigrants, calling them “animals” and “not human,” while saying people crossing the Mexican border are fueling violent crimes in the U.S.\n\nTrump has long history with Coachella Valley\n\nTrump’s history with the valley stretches back several decades.\n\nThe former president, known for his love of golf, plays regularly in Florida and along the East Coast and owns golf courses throughout the United States and in Scotland. But he has rarely played golf in the desert, most notably in the 1993 American Express tournament, known then as the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.\n\nThat tournament annually invited celebrities from entertainment and sports as well as politicians to play alongside PGA Tour pros. At the time, Trump was known for his books and television appearances but was still a decade away from hosting \"The Apprentice\" television show.\n\nYears later, in 2001, Trump had a big plan for a casino in Coachella. Despite its being the smallest casino in the Coachella Valley at the time, he invested in Spotlight 29, a bingo parlor operated by the Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians, a tribe of just 12 members — recognizing its potential for profit.\n\nLeveraging his reputation, Trump raised funds for an extensive expansion that would introduce slot machines, table games, a stylish nightclub and a private lounge for high rollers. In return, the tribe appointed him as the casino's manager and rebranded the casino as Trump 29 in 2002.\n\nBut three years later, Trump’s multibillion-dollar resort company filed for bankruptcy and subsequently, the tribe terminated his management contract early, buying him out for a mere $6 million — less than than the contract had earned him in a single year. Trump’s name subsequently came off the building.\n\n“When Trump came in, we all thought, ‘Oh gosh, he is going to really run the tables on the tribe,’ and it was actually just the opposite that happened,” Victor Rocha, an Indian gaming advocate from Temecula, told The Desert Sun in 2016. “But it shouldn’t have been a surprise. If you look at anything that guy has done in this industry, he has a lead thumb — it’s the opposite of a golden touch.”\n\nTrump has mocked Palm Springs windmills for years\n\nA day after flying into Palm Springs for the 2020 fundraiser, Trump took shots at a familiar fixture of the desert landscape: the windmills that Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley are known for.\n\nDuring a campaign speech Colorado Springs, where he discussed energy independence, Trump reminded his audience about the \"rusty,\" \"rotting\" windmills made in \"China\" and \"Germany.\"\n\nHe told his audience: \"And they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs. ... They're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell.\"\n\nWindmills in the Palm Springs area date back about four decades, and in recent years, energy developers here have replaced some aging wind turbines with state-of-the-art models.\n\nIt wasn't the first time he tilted at the windmills.\n\nIn 2016, during Herman Cain's radio show, then-candidate Trump referred to Palm Springs as a \"poor man's version of Disneyland.\"\n\nHis disdain for windmills goes back to at least 2012, where he tweeted about how Palm Springs had been \"absolutely destroyed\" by \"the world's ugliest wind farm\" along Interstate 10.\n\nThe Desert Sun staff contributed to this report.\n\nTom Coulter covers the cities of Palm Desert, La Quinta, Rancho Mirage and Indian Wells.

On the one hand, you've gotten into the swing of things, know your way around the grounds and have even built up a bit of stamina. On the other, you still feel fresh (at least assuming your friend didn’t talk you into taking too many Malibu shots back at your campsite after Lana Del Rey's set) and hungry, not to mention thirsty, for more.\n\nMost importantly, you haven’t yet started to feel the impending sadness about the weekend’s end that inevitably arrives on Sunday.\n\nA look at the highs and lows from Weekend 1, Day 2.\n\nThe dream of the '90s was alive with reunions by No Doubt, Blur and Sublime\n\nThe bulk of the prime time at the main stage was taken up by not one, not two but three anticipated '90s reunions. Sublime started things out and singer Jakob Newell proved himself a more than capable replacement for his late father (if you closed your eyes, you might have even thought you were listening to KROCK circa 1997).\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nNext up was Blur led by Coachella fixture Damon Albarn, who continues to show little sign of slowing down a year after he performed with his other band “Gorillaz” on this same stage. But the best was saved for last as No Doubt turned back the clock with an exuberant performance that showcased both the rebellious rocker girl side of Gwen Stefani that she has mostly seemed to keep under wraps for the past few years and the band's impressive catalog of hits.\n\nJack Antonoff and Bleachers brought it (and drew Taylor Swift)\n\nJack Antonoff presided over one of the most amped-up sets ever seen at the festival. But his energy was somehow matched by Bleachers' saxophone players who joined him onstage for much of the show and seemed to almost be battling for supremacy as they closed out the show with “Don’t Take the Money.” No wonder Taylor Swift could be seen bopping along in the wings. Swift has good taste in collaborators/friends.\n\nVampire Weekend went country for surprise set\n\nVampire Weekend’s set brought a couple of surprises to Coachella this weekend. The first was that they showed up at all, as the set was a surprise add that was announced Tuesday. But the second came when singer Ezra Koenig quipped that he initially wasn’t sure if the band was being asked to play Stagecoach or Coachella when festival organizers reached out to him, a clever way of introducing a decidedly-un-Vampire Weekend sounding medley of country and bluesy songs that closed out the show. While it may not have been what anyone would’ve expected, it was a pretty darn cool way to end the show. Maybe Goldenvoice should give them a call about Stagecoach after all.\n\nThat painfully long line to see T-Pain left fans shut out\n\nThe excitement that surrounded the recent addition of a T-Pain set at the Heineken House was quickly extinguished when fans wandered toward the stage only to see a massive line.\n\nAround a half-hour before the set was to begin, word began to circulate that the house had reached capacity and no one else would be let in. Goldenvoice, it appears, had grossly underestimated the interest that remained to hear early 2000s hits like “Up Down” and “Bartender.” Maybe they can bring back T-Pain next weekend (only a Weekend 1 set was initially announced) and put him on a bigger stage where his fans can enjoy “Booty Wurk” without any concerns about capacity issues.\n\nSadly, Taylor Swift did not guest with Bleachers or Ice Spice\n\nOK, so it was pretty cool that the world’s most famous couple did in fact add the festival to their globetrotting itinerary (as eagle-eyed fans in the crowd at Bleachers found out for themselves). And, yes, even pop stars are entitled to enjoy a day at the festival without having to face the pressure that comes with performing (although we doubt Taylor feels much at this point).\n\nBut if we’re being honest, we have to cop to being a little disappointed that Swift didn’t hop on stage to join either Antonoff or Ice Spice and create what would instantly become the most memorable Coachella moment since Beychella. But while it appears the wait for Taylorchella will have to continue, we won’t give up quite that easy: Here’s hoping Swift liked her time in the desert so much she’ll come back next weekend in a singing mood.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/03/08/music-festival-2023-lineups-outside-lands-bonnaroo-coachella-more/11367234002/", "title": "Music fests 2023: Riot Fest in Chicago and Music Midtown in Atlanta", "text": "The spring music festival season is in full bloom – and the summer and fall fest schedule is filling out, too.\n\nThe latest festivals to be announced: Riot Fest, held Sept. 15-17 in Chicago, with headliners including Foo Fighters, The Postal Service, Death Cab For Cutie, The Cure, and Queens of the Stone Age, and the same weekend in Atlanta is Music Midtown with headliners including Billie Eilish, Pink, The 1975, Guns N' Roses, Lil Baby and Pitbull.\n\nTickets are on sale now for Riot Fest, held in Chicago's Douglass Park.

Once inside the darkened space, audience members become uneasy as they peer down a brightly lit and very deep-looking hole that drops into infinite darkness. Glenn Kaino’s work is a contemplative gesture that explores the complicated and diverse history of tunnel making, from the secret tunnels between Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the common childhood (and Orientalist) fantasy of digging a hole through the planet and ending up in China.

With single \"Fall In Love Again\", P1Harmony entered the Top 40 Radio Airplay chart, becoming the fourth K-pop boy group to do so.\n\nNow, the members are in the midst of their third US tour, P1ustage H: UTOP1A. Spirits are high on May 30 at The Anthem in Washington, D.C. as Keeho, Theo, Intak, Soul and Jongseob come off the stage from soundcheck. Jiung was absent that night due to an injury.\n\n\"Tonight's show, it's sold out so being able to perform somewhere that really welcomes you with open arms, it just takes the nerves off,\" P1Harmony's leader Keeho, 22 tells USA TODAY.\n\nJongseob, 18, says he's glad to be back in America's capital city and has wanted to perform here again since last tour.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIt has been over a year since the guys toured the States in January and February 2023, recalls Theo, 22. But P1Harmony couldn't be happier to return.\n\n\"The energy and the love that we get from American fans specifically has always been so overwhelmingly energetic and I missed it a lot,\" he says.\n\nP1Harmony is ready to put on a show\n\nThe U.S. leg of the UTOP1A tour kicked off May 14 in Houston, and they wanted to up their game for fans.\n\n\"We always have this burden to feel like we have to be better than the last time,\" shares Intak, 20. \"This is the third time we're back in America; it just makes us feel more at home and more safe in a sense that we don't have to feel that burden.\"\n\nThe tour was set for 10 cities, plus a performance at Governors Ball festival in New York City on June 8. This time around the venue and audiences have gotten bigger.\n\nEach night, the fans – known as P1eces – get louder, and the members have taken note. \"You can really see that they're in tune with the songs that we're performing,\" says Jongseob.\n\nAnd with the UTOP1A tour, P1Harmony decided \"to put on a show,\" Keeho says.\n\nThe concert is not just one song after the other. \"Whenever we make a new show, the first thing that's always in our heads, 'What can we show that's different from the last?'\" says Keeho.\n\nThe group took into account musical direction and how to remix songs for a distinct flair. \"We really tried to make that an experience for the viewers,\" he adds.\n\nGrowing on the UTOP1A tour\n\nBeing able to show fans the members' different talents while performing a new setlist has been fun, says Intak.\n\nP1Harmony sought to surprise fans. They wanted to make shows more interesting and dynamic, Intak adds. The setlist spans across the group's discography and includes solo performances from each member.\n\nSpecifically, Keeho executes \"Kill Bill\" by SZA, Intak shows off \"On My Mama\" by Victoria Monét, Theo croons \"Until I Found You\" by Stephen Sanchez and Jongseob does a rendition of \"Praise the Lord (Da Shine)\" by A$AP Rocky.\n\nSoul, on the other hand, freestyle dances, and every city gets a new variation. \"'What can I do different this time to make them interested even more' is something that's always on my mind,\" the 19-year-old says.\n\n\"Because of that factor, I've gotten better at freestyle and also dancing and different techniques, so that really helped me grow as an artist,\" he adds.\n\nFor his solo stage, Theo learned how to play guitar. Through this, he has realized \"what is my passion as a singer.\"\n\n\"Being able to play guitar was a big stepping stone to finding myself as an individual, as an artist,\" he explains.\n\nThe group has become more comfortable in their stage presence. Intak says he's improved strategizing within performances of when to ad lib, change signals or bring the energy even more.\n\n\"This whole dynamic when it comes to show, I feel like I've gotten so much better at,\" he adds.\n\nThere are intricate details when it comes to performing live, shares Keeho, from listening to the other members, metronome, backtrack and your own voice all while making it look seamless.\n\n\"Being able to balance all of those aspects is like actually super insane. It's like you're juggling eight balls at once,\" he explains.\n\nBut Keeho has found an equilibrium, better understanding his abilities as an artist.\n\n\"I feel like it's only up from here. There's always so much more we can learn,\" he adds.\n\nP1Harmony's hopes for the future\n\nP1Harmony wants to continue stand out within the industry and lean into their unique characteristics.\n\n\"I don't want to be afraid and I want to really experiment with everything,\" says Theo.\n\n\"I feel like everyone's trying to follow whoever's in front of them and follow them in terms of music,\" Keeho adds. \"I think we try to stay away from that and we try to always bring something to the table.\"\n\nP1Harmony's dreams are big, but they're going to keep pushing forward.\n\n\"It's so important to make sure your goals don't seem realistic so that you obviously work for them,\" Keeho says. And goals they set in the past have come to fruition.\n\nP1Harmony performed at several of the KIIS-FM Jingle Balls last December and they hit the stage at Governors Ball last Saturday.\n\nThe members hope to perform at bigger venues and want to go to more festivals, including Coachella.\n\n\"It's a dream; dream big,\" says Jongseob.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/29/record-grapefruit-light-rail-win-snake-road-news-around-states/40042541/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The mayor has promised that any graduate from the city’s public school system will “have the opportunity” to attend any in-state public college for free starting next year. Randall Woodfin tweeted the pledge late Tuesday with the hashtag #BirminghamPromise. Al.com reports Birmingham Promise is a public-private partnership that promised in June to provide funding for 20 rising Birmingham seniors or graduates to work in the city for seven weeks. At least one student from each city high school was included. Woodfin has said that program would offer scholarships for city graduates to attend college. The mayor didn’t provide specifics about the college promise, including sources of funding or possible limitations. He later tweeted that he wanted to clarify that in-state college for city graduates “will be funded.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Add salmon to the list of species affected by the state’s blistering summer temperatures, including the hottest July on record. Dead salmon have shown up in river systems throughout Alaska, and the mortalities are probably connected to warm water or low river water levels, says Sam Rabung, director of commercial fisheries for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The department has not quantified past heat-related fish deaths because they tended to be sporadic and inconsistent, Rabung says. But department scientists this year will analyze fish deaths, summarize observation and record effects. The deaths should not be a surprise because climate models have for years forecast unhealthy Alaska river temperatures for salmon, says Peter Westley, assistant professor of fisheries conservation and fisheries ecology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A fall groundbreaking for an extension of a light rail system in the nation’s fifth-largest city is back on track after voters soundly rejected a referendum that would have killed any future expansion, transit officials say. Mayor Kate Gallego said the vote underscored that residents want a modern, sustainable city that respects mass transit and urban development. She said the city is already scheduling community meetings to discuss the upcoming extension’s design with residents and business owners. The total number of ballots cast was 180,636, the highest ever in a city special election involving only ballot measures. Proposition 105 would have immediately stopped the rail’s extension into the working-class Hispanic and African American communities of south Phoenix, as well as other future extensions linking far-flung areas around the region.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor is forming a committee to promote statewide participation in the 2020 census. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday issued an executive order establishing the Arkansas Complete Count Committee, a panel of 30 volunteer members appointed by the governor from state and local government. The panel will also include representatives from the private sector. Fort Smith Mayor George McGill is serving as the committee’s chairman. Hutchinson directed the committee to establish a public awareness campaign to promote census participation and to provide recommendations on how best to reach hard-to-count communities within the state. The panel is required to submit a progress report to Hutchinson by Nov. 1.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Schools in the state may soon allow parents to administer medical marijuana to their children on K-12 campuses. The California Assembly approved a bill this week that lets school boards decide whether parents can give their kids the medicine on school campuses. It would allow the use of marijuana in non-smoking form. Current law prevents marijuana on school campuses, meaning children who use medical cannabis to treat seizures have to go off campus to get their medication. Supporters of the bill say that’s a dangerous and onerous requirement. Opponents worry about allowing the drug on campus and question whether medical marijuana regulations for children are strong enough. If it passes the Senate in a final vote, it will go to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. His predecessor, Jerry Brown, vetoed a similar proposal last year.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A private security guard who officials say accidentally wounded a student during a school shooting that left one teen dead wasn’t supposed to be armed, an online news outlet reports. Emails obtained by The Colorado Sun show the suburban Denver charter school had requested an unarmed guard from BOSS High Level Protection about a year ago. In a statement, STEM School Highlands Ranch said it didn’t know the guard was armed until the shooting occurred May 7 on the campus that includes students from kindergarten through high school. “While it is more common to have armed security personnel at high schools, it is uncommon at elementary schools,” the statement said. “Given the diverse population at our school, we made the decision to request an unarmed guard in an effort to balance these different interests.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nEnfield: The state is changing the way it handles visits between prisoners and their children. The reintegration center at the Willard-Cybulski prison in Enfield is one of five sites in a pilot program called Family Connections, designed to help inmates become better parents both behind bars and once they are released. The inmates are taking parenting classes, and guards are receiving training on how to interact with children to create a more welcoming environment. The prison’s visiting room is undergoing a makeover to allow contact visits and will now include toys and games. On Monday night, the prison hosted a family dance. Prison officials say about 5 million children in the United States have a parent in prison, and research shows fostering better relationships can lower recidivism.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Local law enforcement officers will be conducting checkpoints throughout the state over Labor Day weekend. The DUI checkpoints will be on U.S. 40 in Newark, U.S. 13 in Camden and Del. 24 in Millsboro. Police will be conducting the checkpoints from 10 p.m. Saturday to 2 a.m. Sunday. The effort is part of a national “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” campaign. In addition to the campaign, the Office of Highway Safety is continuing with its highway safety signs program, which aims to display cleverly crafted safety reminders for drivers. According to the Office of Highway Safety, there have been four DUI fatalities in 2019. There have been more than 600 DUI-related crashes and 300 DUI-related injuries this year.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Black golfers are hoping a gift from NBA star Stephen Curry to fund Howard University golf teams will spark a resurgence in the sport at historically black colleges and universities. Curry’s donation to help the prominent Washington school relaunch its men’s and women’s teams is bringing new attention to collegiate black golf. It is also spotlighting the harsh budget constraints that HBCUs face in keeping their programs alive. Black colleges and universities are a crucial pipeline to increasing diversity in golf at a time when few African Americans are playing the sport at the college and professional levels. Craig Bowen, president and founder of the Black College Golf Coaches’ Association, says only about a quarter of the more than 100 HBCUs have golf teams. Howard abandoned its golf program in the 1970s.\n\nFlorida\n\nBartow: A prosecutor says he is dropping criminal charges against an estranged couple known after the wife’s arrest for taking two guns from the husband’s apartment and turning them over to the police. State Attorney Brian Hass said in a case disposition that Courtney and Joseph Irby agreed to participate in a 12-month program that includes anger management classes. Courtney Irby was originally arrested in Bartow for theft and burglary but later charged with trespassing. Joseph Irby faced an aggravated battery charge for hitting his wife’s vehicle with his. The couple is divorcing. Hass says the offer came after prosecutors found Courtney Irby illegally installed a tracking device in her husband’s car. He says contradictions in her testimony have affected her credibility.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Residents near two plants that have emitted toxic gas say they’re furious that the government did not alert the public about a federal report on potential health dangers. Hundreds of people packed two recent town hall meetings in Marietta and Covington, where the two companies use ethylene oxide to sterilize medical devices. The meetings followed news stories about a 2018 report that identified Census tracts near the two businesses where residents could face health risks. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chose not to issue press releases about the study or take other steps to inform the public about it. The EPA did provide Georgia’s Environmental Protection Division with talking points about the report in case someone stumbled upon it on the EPA’s website and asked questions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Hawaiian Volcano Observatory officials have started a search for a new site. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports a federal disaster relief bill signed in June has enabled the observatory to begin exploring new properties. The previous observatory in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park overlooking the Kilauea volcano was abandoned due to earthquake damage. The quakes were part of the prolonged eruption of Kilauea, which began in May 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes in lower Puna. The $19.1 billion Big Island relief package includes $49 million for a new observatory, which is part of the U.S. Geological Survey. There is also a $20.1 million appropriation for ongoing operations in a rented, transitional facility in the Hilo Iron Works building and for instrument and equipment replacement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials are increasing logging on state lands by more than 30% and plan to build a seed orchard in northern Idaho to plant trees to replace those cut down. The Idaho Land Board has voted to ramp up harvest on the state’s forests over a four-year span to bring in about $20 million more annually for beneficiaries, mainly public schools. Officials with the Idaho Department of Lands told Gov. Brad Little and other Land Board members that a better method of inventorying the state’s timber holdings found significantly more timber available for cutting. The Lands Department says cutting mature stands will reduce the risk of loss due to disease, insects and wildfires. The board also approved a $165,000 plan by the Lands Department to start a seed orchard near Lewiston to provide western larch and Douglas fir seed.\n\nIllinois\n\nJonesboro: Snake Road is closing to cars so snakes can cross without getting run over. The Southern Illinoisan reports that the road winding through the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois will close to vehicles beginning Sunday. The road, more than 2 miles long, will stay closed until late October. And it’s not just snakes: Frogs, turtles, newts and salamanders are also starting to migrate across the road from swamps to limestone bluffs where they’ll spend the winter. Some are endangered, so the Forest Service goes the extra mile to ensure their safety. People can still walk the road while it’s closed to cars but are prohibited from collecting or handling the species. The road will be closed again in March as the animals head back to the swamp.\n\nIndiana\n\nVincennes: A replica of an early Confederate flag has been removed from a flagpole near a Civil War monument after a county official says “misunderstandings” kept it flying. Knox County Commissioners President Kellie Streeter says the commissioners “weren’t fully aware” of the flag’s nature, but it’s been replaced with an Indiana state flag outside the county courthouse in Vincennes. She says “misunderstandings” about its origins kept it flying among seven different flags near the war monument. The Confederate flag isn’t the one most would think of but is instead the Confederacy’s first official flag, which flew for a year starting in early 1861. The Vincennes Sun-Commercial reports that flag features a circle of white stars against a blue background and a white stripe flanked by two red stripes.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: A public radio station that was founded to serve black listeners is seeking help to stay on the air. Officials at Afro-American Community Broadcasting Inc. told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier they need $100,000 quickly to handle overdue payments for the station, KBBG-FM 88.1, and have set a fundraising target of $400,000 over the next year. Community outreach director Edyce Porter says the station is “in dire straits right now.” Her father, Jimmie Porter, founded KBBG in 1977. KBBG officials say the financial crisis stems from equipment failures, lost federal support and declining donations as its older patrons pass away and aren’t replaced by younger listeners. KBBG accountant Candice Lanning says KBBG originally was a station for black people but no longer is just for the black community.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A proposed settlement has been reached with inmates whose conversations with attorneys were taped at Leavenworth Detention Center. KCUR reports the agreement calls for the private operator of the prison and the phone provider to pay $1.45 million into a settlement fund for inmates. After payments to attorneys, the money will be distributed to about 539 current and former Leavenworth inmates. The settlement with CoreCivic, which runs the prison, and Securus Technologies, which provided the phone and video services, needs court approval to become final. On Aug. 15, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas City, Kansas, improperly listened to the recorded conversations and willfully violated court orders during an independent investigation. The ruling could affect hundreds of federal convictions and sentences.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A Christian theme park with a 500-foot-long Noah’s Ark is not paying enough in property taxes, according to a county school board. Grant County’s school board filed a lawsuit against the Ark Encounter after losing an administrative appeal. The school board alleges the theme park has been undervalued by county officials. The park in northern Kentucky preaches a literal interpretation of the Bible’s Old Testament. The centerpiece is a massive wooden ark that houses exhibits telling the biblical story of Noah, who built the giant boat to survive the flood. The lawsuit by the school board says the county’s property valuation administrator assessed the park’s worth at $48 million in 2017. The school board argued the Ark Encounter is worth much more, perhaps up to $130 million, meaning it is paying thousands less in property taxes than it should. County schools are funded by property taxes.\n\nLouisiana\n\nSlidell: A basketball-sized grapefruit has brought two world records to a local couple. The giant citrus grew in the yard of Mary Beth and Doug Meyer. The Guinness Book of World Records says it’s the world’s heaviest and largest in circumference. It weighed 7 pounds, 14.6 ounces and measured 28 3/ 4 inches around. That’s almost as big as an NBA basketball. The grapefruit was 13.6 ounces heavier and 1 1/ 4 inches bigger around than the 2006 record, set in Brazil. State Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain presented a Guinness certificate to the couple Tuesday in Baton Rouge. His department provided the equipment for the official weighing and measuring in January.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: U.S. lobster exports to China have fallen off a cliff this year as new retaliatory tariffs shift the seafood business farther north. China, a huge and growing customer for lobster, placed heavy tariffs on U.S. lobsters – and many other food products – in July 2018 amid rising trade hostilities between the Chinese and the Trump administration. Meanwhile, business is booming in Canada, whose fishermen catch the same species of lobster as American lobstermen, who are based mostly in Maine. The loss of business has brought layoffs to some Maine businesses, such as The Lobster Co., of Arundel, where owner Stephanie Nadeau has laid off half the 14 people she once had working in wholesale. “They picked winners, and they picked losers, and they picked me a loser,” Nadeau said. Lobster exports to China have seen a more than 80% drop since last year.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state has narrowed the possibilities for a potential new crossing over the Chesapeake Bay to ease traffic congestion to three areas near the current twin spans of the Bay Bridge, state officials announced Tuesday. The Maryland Transportation Authority also announced a fourth option of not building a new bay crossing. Data indicates the three construction proposals are the only ones that sufficiently meet the purpose and need in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The proposals narrow the possibilities from 14 that were first considered. Jim Ports, the executive director of the transportation authority, said while all four proposals are being included for further study, traffic models indicate that building a third crossing near the current bridge “would have the most positive impact on reducing traffic.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gun safety advocates contend further steps are needed in a state acknowledged to already have some of the toughest firearms laws in the country. A legislative committee heard testimony Wednesday on dozens of gun-related bills filed for the current two-year session. The proposals include barring 3D-printed firearms and so-called copycat assault weapons, as well as requiring all gun owners to carry liability insurance. Boston Police Commissioner William Gross told lawmakers that “one homicide is too many,” while arguing for a crackdown on illegal trafficking in firearms. Jim Wallace, executive director of the Gun Owners Action League of Massachusetts, disputed that current state laws – which include an assault weapons ban – have saved lives or made residents safer. Instead, he argued they burden law-abiding gun owners with high costs and onerous regulations.\n\nMichigan\n\nPaw Paw: Officials have reversed course and won’t cover up courthouse paintings that have nude figures and bare-breasted women. WOOD-TV says Van Buren County commissioners heard from people on both sides Tuesday and decided to leave the paintings alone. One painting in a stairwell shows a bare-breasted woman holding a decapitated head and a spear. Another painting above a judge’s bench shows a nude man and nude woman begging a woman for mercy. Breasts are exposed on one woman. One painting could be more than 100 years old. Judge Kathleen Brickley says the paintings are contrary to efforts to “de-escalate trauma rather than revisit trauma.” But Rose Rook spoke to commissioners and asked, “Do we have to shelter everything?” She says there are attempts to get rid of everything that “makes us uncomfortable.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nHanhassen: Prince’s estate will take over management of the late rock star’s studio complex near Minneapolis. Graceland Holdings, which runs Elvis Presley’s tourist attraction in Memphis, Tennessee, had been operating Prince’s Paisley Park in Chanhassen as a museum since October 2016. Prince’s oldest sibling, Sharon Nelson, says the family will manage Paisley Park because the contract expires at the end of September. She says the family is not unhappy with Graceland Holdings or making the decision because of economic reasons. The Star Tribune reports Nelson says there are differences of opinions among the heirs, so the estate’s administrator, Comerica, will be making the final decisions on how to operate the landmark. Prince died at age 57 of an accidental overdose of fentanyl at Paisley Park on April 21, 2016.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Second-term Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves won the Republican nomination for governor, setting up a November general election showdown with Democrat Jim Hood, the state’s four-term attorney general. Reeves defeated retired Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller Jr. in a Republican primary runoff Tuesday. Reeves, 45, spent more than $6 million this year – the most of any candidate in the race, regardless of party. Waller, 67, spent about $1.4 million. Waller is a retired brigadier general in the Mississippi National Guard and son of the late Gov. Bill Waller Sr., a moderate Democrat who served from 1972 to 1976. Hood, 57, had spent about $1.1 million through the end of July. He said Tuesday that Waller ran a “gentlemanly race” and discussed quality-of-life issues. Hood said he hoped some Waller supporters would cross party lines to vote for him in November.\n\nMissouri\n\nJoplin: The Friends of Camp Mintahama group is getting ready to start raising money to purchase a former Girl Scout camp near the city. The Joplin Globe reports the property’s new owner approached the group this year with the chance to purchase about 140 of the camp’s 180 acres for about $1.25 million. The group has started the process of becoming a nonprofit corporation. Members have been attending public events, raising awareness of their upcoming campaign to raise $300,000 for a down payment on the property, which includes a spring-fed lake. A short documentary about the camp is under development and expected to be released next month. The friends group has targeted summer 2020 for its first camp programs for boys, girls and families.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Environmental officials are proposing approval of a major expansion of the state’s largest coal mine after it was recently sold through a bankruptcy auction. Jen Lane with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality said the 72 million ton expansion of the Spring Creek Mine near Decker will occur within the mine’s existing permit boundary. The expansion would extend the life of the mine by four years, to approximately 2031. Spring Creek in 2017 ranked as the 10th-largest coal mine in the United States, producing almost 13 million tons of coal. A bankruptcy judge last week approved the sale of Spring Creek and two Wyoming mines owned by bankrupt Cloud Peak Energy to the Navajo Transitional Energy Company. Company representatives said the sale will help keep the mines open.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorth Platte: Students returning to Mid-Plains Community College campuses will find a new tool to help with their emotional health – and she’s furry. The college has added Shenzi, a black Labrador puppy, as the college’s therapy dog to help those going through a personal tragedy or loss. The college says Shenzi’s work began this month with the return of students for a new fall semester. Shenzi’s handler, Holly Andrews, says the pup is taking over the role that had belonged to Nestle, the college’s therapy dog for the previous five years. Nestle died in January after a battle with cancer. The college has its main campuses in North Platte and McCook and satellite campuses in Broken Bow, Imperial, Ogallala and Valentine. Shenzi will be available to students at all locations at various times.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Clark County School District has gone to court to stop a teacher’s union from carrying out a threatened Sept. 10 strike if negotiators fail to agree on a new contract. The school district filed a court order Monday asking a judge to certify that it’s against state law for members of the Clark County Education Association to walk off the job next month. Teacher strikes are illegal under Nevada law, and if a judge issues an order against any strike, the union can be fined up to $50,000 a day, and striking employees can be punished or fired. The Clark County School District said in a statement Tuesday that the union has agreed to mediation talks, but the strike threat remains. The union says it believes the law making strikes illegal is unconstitutional.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Fish and Game Department is offering advice to hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts as fall hunting season approaches. Sept. 1 is the beginning of fall hunting season, but it’s not just hunters who will be out in the woods enjoying cooler weather, fewer bugs and changing leaves. Fish and Game officials say people should remain aware of their surroundings and know the dates of hunting seasons in their area. They also advise hikers to stick to established trails, wear blaze orange clothing and make some noise – talking, singing or whistling – to make their presence known.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The governor has signed a bill ensuring voters who got mail-in ballots in 2017 and 2018 will get them for future elections unless they opt out. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the measure Wednesday after the Democrat-led Legislature quickly passed the legislation earlier this week. The measure updates a 2018 law that mandated voters who signed up for and got mail-in ballots for the 2016 general election would continue to get those ballots for future elections, unless they opt out. But lawmakers said the law failed to specifically address voters who requested 2017 and 2018 mail-in ballots. The new measure requires that those voters also get mail-in ballots unless they opt out. The bill also sets aside $2 million for counties to implement the law.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State economists on Wednesday revised forecasts upward for government income amid surging oil and natural gas production, giving lawmakers greater leeway as they begin crafting a general fund spending plan for the coming fiscal year. The fiscal forecasts, announced at a legislative committee hearing in the mountain resort community of Red River, hold major financial implications for public school budgets, tax incentives for filmmakers, infrastructure spending, support for Medicaid and an array of state government services. Most of the windfall is linked to steadily growing fossil fuel production focused in the Permian Basin. Economists from three state agencies and the Legislature said state general fund income for the coming fiscal year that begins July 1, 2020, is expected to surpass current annual spending obligations by $907 million, a nearly 13% surplus. Legislators and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham are grappling with efforts to expand economic opportunity in a state with the highest rate of poverty in the western U.S. and to improve the quality of public schools.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: New York softened penalties for possessing small amounts of marijuana and created a process for erasing certain past offenses in a state law that went into place Wednesday. The maximum penalty for possessing less than an ounce of pot has been lowered to $50. The legislation also turns an unlawful marijuana possession statute into a violation similar to a traffic ticket, instead of a criminal charge. The criminal statute was responsible for hundreds of thousands of arrests over the past four decades, according to state data. Advocates for marijuana legalization have argued the law is a positive step but falls short of addressing negative consequences that come with keeping the drug illegal. Under the law, they say people can still face immigration consequences and probation violations for basic marijuana possession.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s Transportation Department is looking for volunteers to remove trash along roads during the Adopt-A-Highway Fall Litter Sweep next month. Each April and September, NCDOT asks volunteers to help remove litter from the sides of roads. Volunteers from local businesses, schools, nonprofits, churches and community groups often participate. In addition, NCDOT maintenance crews devote one week of their time during Litter Sweep to pick up trash and collect the bags that the volunteers have filled with trash. This year’s fall Litter Sweep will be held Sept. 14-28. The department provides cleanup supplies, including trash bags, gloves and safety vests.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State agricultural officials say there’s help available for the millions of dollars in crop damage caused by blackbirds each year. Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring says the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services program loans nonlethal management equipment to farmers to help disperse blackbirds that attack sunflower and grain crops. The USDA says of eight states with significant sunflower acreage that were surveyed, North Dakota ranked first in bird damage to confectionery and oilseed sunflowers. The study found the eight states lose a total of $29.5 million annually from bird damage to sunflowers.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A state tourism bureau says a record-breaking 19.2 million people visited Greater Cleveland in 2018. Regional tourism bureau Destination Cleveland says the visitor numbers were up 3.9% from the previous year. The bureau says that rate of increase outpaced the rest of Ohio and the nation. The bureau defines a visitor as someone who travels at least 50 miles from home outside of a normal routine. The Plain Dealer reports Cleveland visitors in 2018 accounted for nearly $6.2 billion in spending, up 6.2% from 2017. The bureau says spending is likely up because of an uptick in people staying the night. Destination Cleveland president David Gilbert says he’s impressed with the numbers and hopeful the bureau will reach its goal of 20 million visitors in 2020.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Second Amendment Association is challenging efforts that would put on hold a new permitless carry law until voters weigh in on the issue. The law passed earlier this year will allow residents to openly carry guns without a background check or training. It takes effect Nov. 1, but efforts are underway for a statewide referendum on the measure. The Oklahoman reports the association filed a legal challenge Monday to the wording of the referendum petition, calling it inaccurate and misleading. Second Amendment Association President Don Spencer called the statewide vote a waste of time. “Citizens of the state of Oklahoma have been waiting on this for over 112 years and it’s time for them to get their rights back,” he said. The measure’s backers have until 5 p.m. Thursday to collect nearly 60,000 signatures to get the measure on the 2020 ballot.\n\nOregon\n\nCascade Locks: One of the most popular hikes in the Columbia River Gorge has reopened almost two years after it was damaged by the Eagle Creek Fire. The Wahclella Falls Trail, near Cascade Locks and east of Multnomah Falls, features a 2.4-mile out-and-back hike through a slot canyon to a powerful waterfall. The main part of the trail has been cleared and stabilized, but the upper section remains closed because of a damaged bridge and washouts. The U.S. Forest Service says people should respect closure signs and stay out of areas that remain closed for their safety. The trail was one of those hit hardest by the Eagle Creek Fire, which ignited Sept. 2, 2017, after a teenager tossed a firework off nearby Eagle Creek Trail.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State prison officials are planning to close another prison, as the inmate population continues to decline and prison costs rise. State Sen. John Yudichak said Wednesday that prison officials had just briefed him and Retreat state prison staff in northeastern Pennsylvania about its plans to close it. Gov. Tom Wolf’s office isn’t commenting. Retreat has about 400 employees and is at full capacity with almost 1,100 inmates. Pennsylvania’s state prison population is about 48,000, after reaching nearly 52,000 in 2012. Retreat is about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre. Wolf’s administration closed a state prison in Pittsburgh in 2017. Retreat’s original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania’s 25 state prisons.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state approved tax credits Monday to lure a third major offshore wind company to the state as part of an effort to become a hub for the industry. The first U.S. offshore wind farm began operating off Block Island, Rhode Island, in late 2016, and Gov. Gina Raimondo wants the industry to grow in the state. The Rhode Island Commerce Corp. approved nearly $900,000 in tax credits over 10 years for Boston Energy, which plans to open its U.S. headquarters in Providence. The British company must maintain at least 52 full-time jobs in the state for at least 12 years. Raimondo said Tuesday that the development is “further proof that we’re well-positioned to be the hub for this growing industry.” She announced in June that another British wind turbine maintenance company, GEV Wind Power, will locate its U.S. headquarters in Rhode Island and create about 125 jobs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: The island’s leaders are one step closer to banning long shovels and large holes in the sand to protect sea turtles and beachgoers. The Island Packet reports Hilton Head Island public planning committee members voted unanimously last week for the ordinance. The full council will vote on it Sept. 17. The proposal would ban shovels longer than 14 inches. It would also ban holes larger than 12 inches deep and 12 inches wide. A volunteer group called The Hilton Head Island Turtle Trackers says young turtles can get trapped in large holes after they hatch in dunes and head toward the sea. Beaufort County sheriff’s deputies would be able to ticket anyone who broke the rules. The volunteer group says enforcement could be difficult.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Federal regulators are holding a hearing on a uranium mine proposal that could help resolve a long-running dispute over the potential impact on places of Native American cultural, historical and religious significance. The Oglala Sioux Tribe argues federal regulators haven’t done enough to study the potential effects of the mine near Edgemont on Native American burials, artifacts and other cultural sites within the project’s boundaries. The Rapid City Journal says the hearing before the federal Atomic Safety and Licensing Board in Rapid City that began Wednesday could last through Friday. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission contends regulators have done everything within their power to study the potential impacts on tribal cultural resources. The company proposing the mine, Powertech, agrees.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A prominent member of the sanitation workers union whose historic strike drew the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the city where he was assassinated has died, close friends said Tuesday. Baxter Leach was 79. Gail Tyree, executive director of the Memphis Local 1733 chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said Leach’s daughter gave her the news of her father’s passing. Leach had been battling cancer, said his friend Calvin Taylor. Leach helped organize the 1968 strike that saw 1,300 sanitation workers walk out of their jobs and march on Memphis streets with demands of higher wages and better working conditions. They mobilized after two colleagues were killed by a malfunctioning garbage truck. Leach and other surviving sanitation workers received the National Civil Rights Museum’s Freedom Award last year.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey will join the University of Texas as a professor this fall, teaching in the university’s Department of Radio-Television-Film. McConaughey has been a visiting instructor at the flagship campus in Austin since 2015, and the university said in a statement Wednesday that the appointment recognizes his “outstanding work as a teacher and mentor.” He will continue teaching a Script to Screen film production class for which he developed the course curriculum. The university says McConaughey is respected for his “willingness to work with students beyond the classroom.” McConaughey earned a film degree from the school in 1993. He’s appeared in more than 50 films, including “Dazed and Confused,” “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Dallas Buyers Club,” for which he won an Oscar and Golden Globe for his leading role.\n\nUtah\n\nEden: A proposed heliport at a ski resort is raising concerns about environmental impact and other issues. The Standard-Examiner reports SMHG Village Development has applied for a conditional use permit to operate a heliport at Powder Mountain. The facility would house a helicopter to haul skiers, mountain bikers and anglers to remote areas of the resort 59 miles north of Salt Lake City. The heliport would be operated by partner firm Whisper Ridge. One resident says the proximity of helicopters to the Middle Fork Wildlife Management Area south of Powder Mountain could disturb wildlife. Another cited risks posed by hauling helicopter fuel on the area’s narrow roads. The Ogden Valley Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the permit request next week.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Officers from the University of Vermont police department are investigating what they describe as “bias-motivated vandalism” on campus. Police say they received a report Tuesday of vandalism to a sign at the Davis Center off Main Street. Responding officers found locations where a person or people affixed stickers and posters with statements such as “Keep America American” and “Better Dead Than Red.” The name “Patriot Front” was on the bottom of the stickers. UVM police cited Burlington police who said earlier this year that the Patriot Front is a group “that espouses white supremacist views.” The group’s members have recently been associated with placing banners on bridges, buildings and overpasses in several states.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Three months after a city employee killed 12 people in a mass shooting, the city’s executive resigned Wednesday following criticism from victims’ family members and others about his response to the rampage. In his resignation letter, City Manager Dave Hansen urged employees to work together without “pointing fingers.” “Our most recent tragedy will take all our energy, strength and patience so we can walk the long path of recovery ahead,” he said. Hansen worked for the city for 13 years, including more than three years as city manager, overseeing day-to-day operations of the city. Criticism of his leadership style has been long running, but the May 31 shooting and the city’s response brought heightened scrutiny. Family members of some of the victims have said he has not been responsive to their requests for information or treated them well.\n\nWashington\n\nRidgefield: Work is underway to improve pedestrian access to a unit of the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge. The Columbian reports work began this summer on the project, estimated to cost $3 million to $5 million, which will create dedicated pedestrian and bicycle access to the refuge from existing sidewalks near Ridgefield city limits. The Federal Highway Administration will contribute about $3.1 million. The city, county and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Pacific Region also are contributing. Previously, pedestrians walked along a road in a ditch to reach the Carty Unit. Port of Ridgefield CEO Brent Grening says that was dangerous. The new walkway is expected to be finished by Oct. 3. Culvert improvements are also planned to help prevent water from backing up on sections of the road.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Secretary of State Mac Warner says his office hopes there are at least 100 voter registration drives next month during National Voter Registration Month. Warner said in a news release that everyone should check their voter registration and make sure their voter information is correct. Any group interested in hosting a voter registration drive can submit a form to the secretary of state’s office. The National Voter Registration Day project provides access to promotional support and materials including an organizer’s toolkit, posters and social media graphics.\n\nWisconsin\n\nPark Falls: More accurate weather forecasts could depend on each blade of grass, leaf and pine needle in a small, dense area in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers and students are trying to figure out how trees and other vegetation affect the atmosphere and influence weather. That means examining how plants suck up and release moisture and carbon dioxide and how that changes as the seasons evolve. The data collection involves numerous instruments on towers of varying heights, lasers, drones, weather balloons and low-flying aircraft. Ankur Desai, UW professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences, dreamed up the project five years ago and has dubbed it Chequamegon Heterogeneous Ecosystem Energy-balance Study Enabled by a High-density Extensive Array of Detectors 2019 – CHEESEHEAD19.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has set new minimum score requirements on college entrance exams for students to be admitted. The Laramie Boomerang reports university trustees voted this month to make changes to admissions requirements. For high school graduates with GPAs of 2.5 to 2.99, the university will require a minimum score of 17 out of 36 on the ACT or a score of at least 900 out of 1600 on the SAT. The university previously did not require the tests for students in this group. The university says it has admitted about 20 freshmen in the group annually, but only about half continue past their first year. For students with lower GPAs, the university still requires a 20 on the ACT or a 1020 on the SAT.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/29"}]}

Well, not at the desk. Obviously I went home in between. But still, it’s been a wild ride.”\n\nA lineup of correspondents’ segments paying tribute to Noah and a video montage of goodbyes from Oprah, Issa Rae, Kamala Harris, Tracy Ross, Bill Gates, Hillary Clinton and more helped usher the host through the night.\n\n“I would never pretend to understand America, you know, in the relatively short time I think I’ve been here,” said Noah, whose perspective as a South African comedian brought an outsider’s perspective to the show. But he did offer a few lessons he has learned.\n\nNoah noted the strong influence American political parties hold, encouraging his audience to consider issues outside the lens of democrat or republican ideals.\n\n“As we live in a society where we increasingly introduce ourselves to things that separate us, we forget that real friendships come from the similarities, and then the disagreements are how we polish each other as human beings,” he said.\n\n“Issues are real, but politics are just an inventive way to solve those issues,” Noah said. “It’s not a binary. There are not just two ways to solve any problem. There are not just two ways to be.”\n\nIn the last minutes of the show, Noah thanked Black women, particularly those who took the time “to inform me, to educate me, to argue with me.”\n\n“I’ve often been credited with, you know, having these grand ideas … Who do you think teaches me? Who do you think has shaped me, nourished me, informed me. From my mom, my gran, my aunt – all these Black women in my life,” the host said.\n\n“If you truly want to learn about America, talk to Black women,” he continued.\n\nNoah took over the program in 2015 from long-time host Jon Stewart whose 16-year run of the show shaped it into a late-night staple.\n\nThe comedian had appeared as a correspondent on “The Daily Show” for only a few months before he was tapped to fill the anchor chair. Though little-known to American television audiences at the time, Noah had already garnered a significant following outside the US.\n\nHe quickly molded the program around him, puckishly guiding his audience through singular national experiences such as the Trump presidency and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen Noah announced his exit from the show in late September, he hinted that his decision was inspired by a desire to perform out from behind the desk.\n\n“I spent two years in my apartment, not on the road, and when I got back out there, I realized there’s another part of my life out there that I want to carry on exploring. I miss learning other languages. I miss going to other countries and putting on shows,” Noah said.\n\nThe comedian is only taking a brief hiatus before hitting the stage again. He kicks off his “Trevor Noah: Off The Record” tour in Atlanta on January 20.\n\nWhen the show returns on Tuesday, January 17, the network has announced a lineup of comedic greats who will fill in as host, including Chelsea Handler, D. L. Hughley, Leslie Jones, Hasan Minhaj, Kal Penn and Wanda Sykes.\n\nBut the long-term future of the show remains unclear as the network has yet to say whether guests hosts will revolve indefinitely or if a permanent host will be installed in the chair.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/12/16/kevin-hart-talks-oscar-backlash-cheating-scandal-netflix-trailer/2669173001/", "title": "Kevin Hart talks Oscar backlash, cheating scandal in Netflix trailer", "text": "Kevin Hart is getting real.\n\nOn Monday, Hart shared the first trailer from his upcoming Netflix documentary series, \"Kevin Hart: Don't (Expletive) This Up,\" which will cover his Oscar controversy and cheating scandal, among other things.\n\n\"I have lived my life as an open book,\" he captioned the NSFW trailer on Instagram. \"I have forever told my stories on stage and tried my best to give my fans as much of me as possible…I honestly believe in transparency…I believe in being OK with the ups & downs that come with life.

But the happy announcement quickly turns sour when the cameras cut to Hart knee-deep in controversy.\n\nYou may recall that Hart was tapped in December 2018 to host the 91st Academy Awards. But, the comedian promptly relinquished his duties following an outcry over his refusal to apologize for past homophobic comments and tweets that he felt he already made amends for.\n\n\"OK, let's just stop you right here,\" Hart says in the trailer after he was asked if he had any regrets. \"Because before people judge and say, 'Kevin Hart's a (expletive),' 'He's an (expletive),' I want you to understand that there's a lot that you don't know.\"\n\nKevin Hart on Netflix special, homophobic jokes: 'The apology was never doing it again'\n\nHe not only faced turmoil in his career, but his marriage after he publicly came clean about cheating on his then-pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish, in Las Vegas in 2017.\n\nAn emotional Parrish spoke for herself: \"You publicly humiliated me. I just kept saying, 'How the (expletive) did you let that happen?' \"\n\nHart added, \"You can think you got it all together. Something stupid can happen that can take it all away like that.\"\n\nThe comedian's year didn't get any easier. In September, Hart suffered a major back injury in a car crash in California.\n\n\"Life is funny, because some of the craziest things that happen to you end up being the things that you needed most,\" he said in October. \"I'm thankful for simply still being here.\"\n\n\"Kevin Hart: Don't (Expletive) This Up,\" a six-part documentary series, is set to premiere on the streaming platform on Dec. 27.\n\nPeople's Choice Awards:Kevin Hart makes first major appearance since car crash, shares thanks", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2022/06/15/des-moines-2022-summer-shows-concerts-festivals-central-iowa/9571961002/", "title": "55 of Central Iowa's best summer concerts, shows and festivals", "text": "Summer is nearly here and with the arrival of the season comes a slew of concerts, festivals and other in-person events.\n\nWhile some events that happened last year, like the Riverview Music Festival and Big Country Bash, will be absent from central Iowa this year, here are more than 55 events Iowans can look forward to this summer.\n\nFREE MUSIC EVENTS\n\nWhere: Various\n\nWhen: Throughout the summer\n\nAll through the summer, a variety of central Iowa venues have free concert series available to Iowans.\n\nThese include Hoyt Sherman Place's Jazz in July series, Windsor Heights' Nights in the Heights, Valley Junction's Music in the Junction, Jasper Winery's Summer Concert Series, Summer Sundaze at the Jamie Hurd Amphitheater, Sunday Tunes at Summerset Winery, the Iowa Municipal Band Festival in Boone and Tunes in the Trees in Madrid, among many others.\n\nDes Moines Arts Festival (and concerts, too!)\n\nWhere: Western Gateway Park, 1205 Locust St., Des Moines\n\nWhen: June 24-26\n\nThe first major event of the summer is the Des Moines Arts Festival, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary.\n\nThe annual event gathers thousands of people each year for a weekend of art, entertainment and food.

Will it be the brutal feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Will it be the slow-motion collision that ended Bennifer 2.0?\n\nCould it be the rapid rise of Chappell Roan, near-daily lawsuits leveled against Diddy, or Disney regaining its footing as a dominant force in theaters?\n\nAs 2024 comes to an end, these are the pop culture moments we think will define the year − for better or worse.\n\nKendrick Lamar and Drake engage in epic rap feud\n\n\"The Big Three\" took over 2024. Well, the big two. When J. Cole bowed out of the decade-defining rap feud between his genre contemporaries Kendrick Lamar and Drake, K. Dot faced up with Drizzy. It didn't end well.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nLamar, the Compton lyricist who rose to fame with a critically acclaimed breakout album \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City\" in 2012, settled the long-running debate about \"who the G.O.A.T\" is a decade after his rise to fame.\n\nIn his hit Drake diss track \"Not Like Us,\" referencing online rumors surrounding his frequent foe by name, Lamar raps, \"Say Drake, I hear you like 'em young.\" He also raps, referencing Drake's album \"Certified Lover Boy,\" calling the Canadian rapper a \"certified pedophile.\"\n\n\"Not Like Us,\" the most commercially successful work of his career, became his first No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 and in November, he notched seven Grammy nods, becoming the most-nominated rap artist at next year's Grammy Awards.\n\nDrake, who does not submit for Grammys, received no nominations, and now he's threatening to sue Universal Music Group and Spotify for deceptive practices. He claims they colluded to boost Lamar's \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nNow, Lamar's game-changing year will spill into 2025 as the \"Swimming Pools\" emcee headlines the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show in New Orleans in February.\n\nKendrick Lamar and Drake rap beef: What makes this music feud so significant?\n\nTaylor Swift's Eras Tour finally ends\n\nThis year marked the end of an era for Taylor Swift and for pop music.\n\nThe singer's hugely popular Eras Tour kicked off in early 2023 but made headlines throughout 2024 before finally wrapping up Dec. 8.\n\nJust when fans thought they knew the show like the back of their hands, Swift switched up the set list in May by adding songs from \"The Tortured Poets Department\" − and in June, her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, made fans swoon by joining her on stage.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the Eras Tour was reported to have grossed more than $2 billion, making it by far the biggest tour ever.\n\nDiddy arrested after sex trafficking investigation\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs is in the midst of a legal fight for his life.\n\nThe embattled music mogul was arrested Sept. 16 at a Manhattan hotel by federal investigators, who charged Combs with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The Bad Boy Records founder has since been denied bail despite multiple attempts to be released from a detention center in Brooklyn, New York, ahead of his trial next May.\n\nThe hip-hop heavyweight's arrest came amid a slew of civil lawsuits alleging abuse, including a highly publicized suit filed in 2023 by his ex-girlfriend \"Me & U\" singer Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura that was settled 24 hours later.\n\nThe arrest followed a pair of federal raids that targeted him as the subject of a sex trafficking investigation and came after a surveillance video surfaced of Combs kicking, dragging and hitting Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.\n\nDiddy's long history of legal troubles: Unraveling old lawsuits, allegations\n\nChappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter blow up as Charli XCX ushers in Brat summer\n\nChappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter have bubbled under the surface of pop music's mainstream for years, but in 2024, the pair finally emerged as up-and-coming superstars.\n\nAlthough Roan's debut album, \"The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,\" was released in 2023, she saw a major surge in popularity this year, as her track \"Hot to Go!\" became inescapable.\n\nBut the burgeoning pop star wasn't afraid to scold \"creepy behavior\" from fans and speak out about the way fame is affecting her, which could inspire future industry rookies to set similar boundaries.\n\nIt was also a massive year for Carpenter, whose earworm \"Espresso\" helped cement her as a pop sensation and became Spotify's most-streamed song of the year.\n\nAnd let's not forget Charli XCX, whose album \"Brat\" so defined the summer that Vice President Kamala Harris joined in on the fun − forcing a CNN panel to unpack Gen Z's seasonal moment.\n\nJennifer Lopez files for divorce from Ben Affleck\n\nBen Affleck and Jennifer Lopez made us believe in love again with their reunion in 2022, but by this year, the couple affectionately known as Bennifer were constantly in the news amid tabloid rumors about the health of their marriage.\n\nAfter months of rumors that ranged from bad to worse, fans finally got word in August that Lopez had filed for divorce − on the couple's second wedding anniversary. (The two were married two years ago after calling off their engagement in 2004.)\n\nLopez also canceled her summer tour in May amid the split.\n\nTaylor Swift's 'The Tortured Poets Department' and Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter'\n\nSwift and Beyoncé aren't known for taking days − or years − off, and 2024 was no different.\n\nIn March, Beyoncé released her genre-bending record \"Cowboy Carter,\" proclaiming in an Instagram caption that her eighth studio album \"ain't a Country album. This is a 'Beyoncé' album.\" It hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with the help of her twang-tinged lead single \"Texas Hold 'Em.\"\n\nThe album featured Shaboozey, Dolly Parton, Miley Cyrus, Post Malone, Willie Jones, Willie Nelson, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Tanner Adell, Reyna Roberts and country legend Linda Martell.\n\n\"Cowboy Carter\" was seen as a response aimed at Nashville's mainstream after the music legend got an icy reception during her performance of \"Daddy Lessons\" featuring The Chicks at the 2016 CMA Awards. A month after Beyoncé got back on the saddle, Swift followed up with a record-breaking album of her own.\n\nThe singer/songwriter megastar wrote her way into music's history books with more than 300 million streams in a single day for \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" It became the most-streamed album in a single day in 2024, according to a rep for Spotify.\n\nLead single \"Fortnight,\" featuring rapper and genre-bending singer Post Malone, also made history as the most-streamed song in a day. Swift also claims the top three albums most-streamed albums in Spotify history with 2023's \"Midnights\" and \"1989 (Taylor's Version).\"\n\n'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool & Wolverine' set records; 'Wicked' defies gravity\n\nIs there any better summation of 2024 than the fact that the year's most iconic movie character may be anxiety?\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" exceeded box-office expectations over the summer by tapping into 2010s nostalgia and millennial anxiety. It's not only the biggest movie of 2024 but also the highest-grossing animated film of all time. Later in the year, another Disney animated sequel, \"Moana 2,\" had the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever at the box office. Both films marked a comeback for Disney after a series of animated flops like \"Wish,\" \"Strange World\" and \"Lightyear.\"\n\nMarvel similarly rebounded from financial disappointments and beat superhero fatigue allegations with \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" the current second-highest-grossing film of the year and biggest R-rated movie in history. Its success could lead Marvel to lean even harder into fan service and cameos going forward.\n\nIt wasn't all good news on the comic book movie front: DC's \"Joker: Folie à Deux,\" starring Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix, was a stunning failure both in terms of box office grosses and fan reception. The crash raised the pressure on new DC boss James Gunn to reset the superhero brand with next year's \"Superman.\"\n\nIf there was a true successor to the \"Barbie\" craze, it was \"Wicked,\" which wowed audiences after an Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo-peppered press tour that made the movie musical feel like a true must-see event.\n\nPrincess Kate and King Charles III battle cancer\n\nKing Charles III and Princess Kate bucked royal tradition this year by publicly revealing their respective cancer diagnoses.\n\nCharles, who celebrated his 76th birthday Nov. 14, announced his unspecified cancer diagnosis in February and underwent a \"corrective procedure.\"\n\nThe news came after the palace announced Jan. 17 that the monarch \"has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate,\" telling the press and public his condition was \"in common with thousands of men each year.\"\n\nKate's surgery in the spring led doctors to discover she had cancer. Her absence from public view fueled weeks of speculation about her whereabouts. In a video message in March, she announced she had cancer and told viewers it took time to \"explain everything\" to her three children \"and to reassure them that I'm going to be OK.\"\n\nShe asked for privacy and said she needed to \"focus on making a full recovery.\" In September, Kate shared her \"relief\" after completing her chemotherapy.\n\nStars stump for Kamala Harris, embrace 'childless cat lady' label\n\nWhen President Joe Biden made the historic decision to drop out of the 2024 election, stars were quick to rally around Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSwift and Beyoncé joined the list of celebrities who endorsed the Democratic nominee. Swift's endorsement was particularly anticipated, and she strategically dropped it just after Harris' debate with Donald Trump.\n\nMany of the endorsements also seized on Vice President-elect JD Vance's controversial comments about the Democratic Party consisting of \"childless cat ladies.\" But in the end, all the star power in the world couldn't prevent a decisive loss for Harris, while stars including Zachary Levi,Joe Rogan and Rob Schneider celebrated Trump's victory.\n\nLiam Payne, James Earl Jones and more celebrity deaths\n\nHardly any time passed in 2024 without the deaths of industry titans and stars gone too soon.\n\nIn October, One Direction star Liam Payne died at 31 after falling from a hotel balcony. For a generation that grew up with the boy band, the news was especially heavy and difficult to process.\n\nOther young stars lost this year included Chance Perdomo, who died at just 27 years old in a motorcycle accident, and \"General Hospital\" star Johnny Wactor, who was shot and killed at 37.\n\nSeveral stars also died after battling cancer, including Shannen Doherty, Toby Keith and Morgan Spurlock.\n\nCarl Weathers, Richard Lewis, Louis Gossett Jr., Shelley Duvall, Richard Simmons, Bob Newhart, James Earl Jones, John Amos and Quincy Jones were among the year's losses.\n\n5 charged in death of Matthew Perry\n\nMatthew Perry's death last year shocked legions of \"Friends\" fans, leading to questions about Perry's condition at the time of his death in October 2023. But in 2024, we found apparent answers.\n\nIn August, five people were charged in Perry's death from \"the acute effects of ketamine.\"\n\nPhysician Salvador Plasencia, 42, and Jasveen Sangha, 41, whom a Department of Justice press release referred to as the \"The Ketamine Queen\" of North Hollywood, originally faced 18 criminal counts for allegedly \"distributing ketamine to Perry during the final weeks of the actor’s life.\"\n\nSuspected co-conspirators named in the case are Perry's live-in assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, 59; Dr. Mark Chavez, 54; and Erik Fleming, 54, who was described as Perry's acquaintance.\n\nIwamasa's plea agreement gave a look at Perry's final days and his private battle with ketamine addiction. Perry was found dead in a hot tub at his Pacific Palisades home in Los Angeles on Oct. 28, 2023.\n\nInvestigators said Iwamasa conspired alongside others to purchase at least $55,000 worth of ketamine on behalf of Perry to inject the actor with the drug without proper medical licensure. Ketamine is an anesthetic that contains psychedelic contents. Prosecutors claim Iwamasa injected Perry with ketamine three times on the day of his death.\n\nMatthew Perry's death: Doctor who illegally obtained ketamine pleads guilty\n\n'Oppenheimer' dominates Oscars, but Ryan Gosling steals the show\n\n2023 was the year of Barbenheimer, but the phenomenon spilled over into 2024 thanks to awards season, which culminated in \"Oppenheimer\" winning the best picture Oscar as Christopher Nolan was awarded best director.\n\nBiggest moments from the 2024 Oscars, from Emma Stone's surprise win to naked John Cena\n\nThough it was not unexpected, it was the moment Hollywood officially crowned Nolan as not only one of the most financially successful filmmakers working today but one of the best.\n\nStill, the image we'll remember most from the 2024 Oscars may be of someone who didn't win anything: Ryan Gosling, who in a bedazzled pink suit delivered a performance of \"I'm Just Ken\" from \"Barbie\" that was so inspired it may actually top the one in the movie. We always knew he was Kenough.\n\nJon Stewart and Robert Downey Jr.'s shocking returns\n\nJust when we thought they were out ... two stars unexpectedly returned to the franchise that made them famous.\n\nJon Stewart revealed in January that he would return as host of \"The Daily Show,\" at least for one night a week. It was a surprising move for the comedian, who exited with great fanfare in 2015.\n\nWho is Doctor Doom? Robert Downey Jr.'s shocking Marvel casting explained\n\nBut fans have been impressed with Stewart's new episodes, and although his comeback was first pitched as just for the election, he's now set to stay through 2025. Could this just be the start of a long second run for the man who for years was one of the most influential voices in late-night?\n\nAnd Robert Downey Jr., who left the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2019 with the emotional death of Iron Man, shocked fans at Comic-Con in July when he revealed he's returning for the next \"Avengers\" movies − not as Iron Man but as the villain Doctor Doom.\n\nTo quote Luke Skywalker: In Hollywood, no one's ever really gone.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/entertainment/ronnie-spector-the-ronettes-dies/index.html&quot;", "title": "Ronnie Spector, lead singer of the Ronettes, dead at 78 - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Ronnie Spector, the swaggering 1960s pop icon with the sky-high beehive whose sultry, quavering voice powered numerous hits for The Ronettes, including \"Be My Baby,\" has died, her family announced in a statement Wednesday.\n\nShe was 78.\n\n\"Our beloved earth angel, Ronnie, peacefully left this world today after a brief battle with cancer,\" the family said. \"She was with family and in the arms of her husband, Jonathan. Ronnie lived her life with a twinkle in her eye, a spunky attitude, a wicked sense of humor and a smile on her face.\"\n\nBrian Wilson of the Beach Boys has called \"Be My Baby\" the greatest pop recording ever produced.\n\nTributes to Spector's talent began pouring in from music royalty.\n\n\"I just heard the news about Ronnie Spector and I don't know what to say,\" Wilson wrote on Twitter . \"I loved her voice so much and she was a very special person and a dear friend. This just breaks my heart. Ronnie's music and spirit will live forever.\"\n\nJoan Jett said Spector's \"mark on rock and roll is indelible.\"\n\nBorn Veronica Bennett in the Spanish Harlem neighborhood of New York City, she formed the Ronettes in 1961 with an older sister and a cousin while she was still a teenager.\n\nThe group didn't become famous until after they auditioned two years later for music producer Phil Spector, creator of the 1960s' \"Wall of Sound\" style, who signed them to his label.\n\nFueled by the runaway success of \"Be My Baby,\" their first single for Spector, they toured the country with Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars and reeled off a string of pop hits over the next several years, including \"Baby I Love You,\" \"Walking in the Rain\" and \"Do I Love You?\"\n\nThe girl group also became hugely popular in England, where the Ronettes headlined over acts such as the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton and The Yardbirds, according to Ronnie Spector's website , and later opened for the Beatles on their final US tour in 1966.\n\nThe group broke up in 1967. Soon after Ronnie wed Phil Spector, with whom she had a tumultuous relationship. The couple divorced in 1974.\n\nIn her memoir, \"Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness,\" Ronnie Spector described her husband as controlling and emotionally abusive.\n\nIn social media posts after his death last year, she famously said , \"he was a brilliant producer, but a lousy husband.\"\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Ronnie Spector had launched a new career as a solo artist. Although she never again reached the commercial peak of her '60s heyday, she returned to Top 40 radio singing with Eddie Money on his 1986 hit, \"Take Me Home Tonight.\"\n\nIn 1988, Ronnie Spector and the Ronettes sued Phil Spector for more than $10 million in royalties and licensing fees. A court eventually ordered him to pay the Ronettes royalties twice a year.\n\nPhil Spector was later convicted of murdering actress Lana Clarkson and sentenced to 19 years in prison. He died behind bars.\n\nRonnie Spector continued to record music and perform well into her 70s.\n\nHer family said she \"was filled with love and gratitude. Her joyful sound, playful nature and magical presence will live on in all who knew, heard or saw her. In lieu of flowers, Ronnie requested that donations be made to your local women's shelter or to the American Indian College Fund.

The 35-year-old had never won the Masters. He participated in the event 16 times before 2025, but a green jacket had always remained illusive.\n\nThat all changed Sunday at Augusta National Golf Club, when McIlroy beat Justin Rose in a playoff in the 89th edition of the Masters to finally complete golf's career Grand Slam after years of futility. McIlroy finished with a 1-over 73, tied with Rose at 11-under-par before it went to the playoff. Then McIlroy hit an immaculate approach shot and tapped in for birdie as the crowd roared its appreciation.\n\nWith the triumph, McIlroy becomes the sixth man to capture golf's career Grand Slam and the first since Tiger Woods capped off the achievement in 2000. McIlroy's previous best finish at Augusta National was as runner-up in 2022.\n\nHere's every golfer in history with a Grand Slam on their résumé:\n\nWhat is a Grand Slam in golf?\n\nIn men's golf, a Grand Slam is when a player wins all four major tournaments over the course of their careers. These tournaments happen once a year and consist of:\n\nThe Masters\n\nPGA Championship\n\nOpen Championship (AKA British Open)\n\nU.S. Open\n\nSo long as a golfer wins each of these tournaments at least once in their careers, they will have achieved a career Grand Slam.\n\nRory McIlroy had won each of the last three on that list. He won the 2011 U.S. Open, the 2012 and 2014 PGA Championship, and the 2014 British Open. Despite 16 appearances and 13 cuts made prior to 2025 at the Masters though, McIlroy had never won at Augusta before 2025.\n\nHow many golfers have career Grand Slams?\n\nSix golfers, including Rory McIlroy, have now achieved the career Grand Slam (first win at each tournament listed):\n\nGene Sarazen: 1922 U.S. Open, 1922 PGA Championship, 1932 Open Championship, 1935 Masters\n\n1922 U.S. Open, 1922 PGA Championship, 1932 Open Championship, 1935 Masters Ben Hogan: 1946 PGA Championship, 1948 U.S. Open, 1951 Masters (1951), 1953 Open Championship\n\n1946 PGA Championship, 1948 U.S. Open, 1951 Masters (1951), 1953 Open Championship Gary Player: 1959 Open Championship, 1961 Masters, 1962 PGA Championship, 1965 U.S. Open\n\n1959 Open Championship, 1961 Masters, 1962 PGA Championship, 1965 U.S. Open Jack Nicklaus: 1962 U.S. Open, 1963 Masters, 1963 PGA Championship, 1966 Open Championship\n\n1962 U.S. Open, 1963 Masters, 1963 PGA Championship, 1966 Open Championship Tiger Woods: 1997 Masters, 1999 PGA Championship, 2000 U.S. Open, 2000 Open Championship\n\n1997 Masters, 1999 PGA Championship, 2000 U.S. Open, 2000 Open Championship Rory McIlroy: 2011 U.S. Open, 2012 PGA Championship, 2014 British Open, 2025 Masters\n\nBobby Jones is another golfer who has completed a Grand Slam, but he did so in the pre-Masters era (prior to 1934). At that time, both the U.S. and British Amateur tournaments were considered majors, alongside the U.S. Open and the Open Championship. Jones even went as far as to win each of these tournaments in one calendar year (1930), and he remains the only golfer in history to achieve a Grand Slam in a single year.\n\nThere have been 12 other golfers to complete three of the four legs necessary to complete the Grand Slam including Arnold Palmer, Lee Trivino, Tony Watson, Phil Mickelson and Jordan Spieth, among others.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/pga/2025/04/10/golf-career-grand-slam-2025-masters/83010245007/", "title": "What is the career Grand Slam in golf? Rory McIlroy looks to finish it ...", "text": "The Masters Tournament is one of the most decorated and prestigious events on the sports calendar each year, and it is largely due to the history that surrounds golf's marquee major tournament.\n\nCelebrating its 89th rendition of The Masters at Augusta National Golf Club this week in Augusta, The Masters serves as the first of four major tournaments on the golf calendar and is part of one of golf's richest accomplishments: the career Grand Slam.\n\nWinning The Masters is a feat of its own, as it comes with that signature green jacket and a forever spot in the clubhouse at Augusta National as an honorary member, but winning the career Grand Slam is an even more challenging one for a golfer.\n\nRory McIlroy and Jordan Speith enter the 2025 Masters Tournament once flirting with adding their names to a prestigious group of golfers that have accomplished one of the hardest feats in the sport.\n\nFor McIlroy, the world's No. 2 ranked golfer, it is his 11th go-around at winning the career Grand Slam after winning the U.S. Open in 2011, PGA Championship in 2012 and The Open Championship in 2014. He came up short in 2022 of getting the final leg of the feat when he finished second to Scottie Scheffler.\n\nHere's what you need to know about golf's career grand slam leading into the 2025 Masters Tournament:\n\nWhat is the career Grand Slam in golf?\n\nThe career Grand Slam is considered one of golf's greatest achievements, as it marks the completion of winning each of the four majors at least once in a golfer's career. The first of the four majors is The Masters, followed by the PGA Championship, the U.S. Open and then The Open Championship.\n\nThere have been two career Grand Slams in golf history, both an original career Grand Slam and the modern career Grand Slam. The original career Grand Slam, which was achieved by Bobby Jones, included the U.S. Open, he U.S. Amateur, The Open Championship and the (British) Amateur Championship. Only five golfers have achieved the mountaintop of winning the modern career Grand Slam: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.\n\nAs noted by Golfweek, part of the USA TODAY Network, there are 12 golfers who are or have been one leg shy of pulling off the career Grand Slam. Three of those 12 are competing in this year's Masters: McIlroy, Jordan Speith and Phil Mickelson, who now competes in LIV.\n\n2025 MASTERS PREDICTIONS: Expert picks, predictions for 2025 Masters winner\n\nWhat are the Grand Slam's in golf?\n\nThe Masters\n\nPGA Championship\n\nU.S. Open\n\nThe Open Championship\n\nThe four career Grand Slam golf tournaments include The Masters, the PGA Championship, the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.\n\nLast person to win career Grand Slam in golf?\n\nThe last golfer to achieve the career Grand Slam was Tiger Woods, who withdrew his name from the 2025 Masters Tournament due to a ruptured Achilles injury that required surgery.\n\nA three-time Grand Slam winner, Woods dominated the game of golf as he came up and the way he won his first career Grand Slam is a perfect example of that: winning all four major champions consecutively. He first won the 2000 U.S. Open, then the 2000 Open Championship, the 2000 PGA Championship and then finally the 2001 Masters Tournament.\n\nThe 11-month span that Woods used to win his first career grand slam, of course, is famously known as the \"Tiger Slam,\" as he became the youngest golfer to reach the feat at 24 years old.\n\nHere's a breakdown of which wins claimed the first career Grand Slam for Woods:\n\n2000 U.S. Open\n\n2000 Open Championship\n\n2000 PGA Championship\n\n2001 Masters Tournament\n\nHow many golfers have won the career Grand Slam?\n\nFive golfers have achieved the modern career Grand Slam, one of golf's hardest feats to accomplish. The first to achieve the career Grand Slam was Gene Sarazen.\n\nSarazen won his first two legs in 1922 with the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship, his third leg in 1932 at The Open Championship and then his final leg in the 1935 Masters Tournament. Jack Nicklaus became the fourth member of the prestigious group when he won the 1966 Open. An 18-time major champion, Nicklaus became the first player to complete the grand slam a second and third time in his career.\n\nNicklaus and Woods the only two golfers in the history of the sport to win it three times.\n\nHere's the full list of golfers that have won the career Grand Slam:\n\nGene Sarazen\n\nBen Hogan\n\nJack Nicklaus\n\nGary Player\n\nTiger Woods\n\nNote: This does not include Bobby Jones, who completed the original career Grand Slam.

Mickelson has been one leg shy since his Open Championship win in 2013. He’ll have another chance to complete that final leg at the 2024 U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 this week.\n\nDespite coming up short in the win column, the 53-year-old has seen success in the U.S. Open to the tune of 10 top-10 finishes in 32 career starts. Could this be his year at Pinehurst?\n\nWhat constitutes a career grand slam?\n\nThe career grand slam in men's professional golf is when a golfer wins each of the four major tournaments at some point in his career, including the Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, PGA Championship and the Open Championship.\n\nHow many golfers have completed the career grand slam?\n\nAs of this week, just five men have completed the task: Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen. Of the five, Woods and Nicklaus are the only ones to win each of the four majors at least three times.\n\nBobby Jones completed the original grand slam in 1930 by winning The Open Championship, the U.S. Open, the U.S. Amateur and the British Amateur. Since the landscape of major tournaments has changed over the years, no other player has completed all four legs in a consecutive manner.\n\nThe closest anyone came was Woods in 2000-01, when he won all four majors consecutively, but over two seasons. He won the PGA Championship, U.S. Open and Open Championship in 2000 and followed them up with the 2001 Masters, which became affectionately known as the “Tiger Slam.”\n\nHow many majors has Phil Mickelson won?\n\nMickelson has six majors under his belt. He’s won the Masters Tournament three times (2004, 2006, 2010), the PGA Championship twice (2005 and 2021) and The Open Championship in 2013.\n\nMost recently, he also finished in a tie for second in the 2023 Masters following a Sunday 65.\n\nPhil Mickelson's odds to win the 2024 U.S. Open\n\nAccording to BetMGM, Mickelson's odds sit at +30,000 to win at Pinehurst this week.\n\nPhil Mickelson's U.S Open history\n\nMickelson has finished in second or a tie for second six times at the U.S. Open (1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2013).

At only 25 years old, his place in golf history would be secure, alongside Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen.\n\nBut Spieth, who failed in his first two bids to win the final leg of the career slam, isn’t putting any pressure on himself to join that club this week.\n\n“That would be a dream come true for me,” Spieth said. “But I also recognize that if I continue to stay healthy and play well, I'll have, I don't know, 30 chances at it. One of them is bound to go my way, right?”\n\nMore chances is a good thing, because few believe this one will go Spieth’s way.\n\nNearly two years have passed since his last win at the 2017 British Open. Since then, Spieth has fallen from No. 2 in the world to 39th and he hasn’t had a top 20 finish since September.\n\nIt’s an alarming drop-off for Spieth, who had won 10 events from 2015-17 before falling into a self-admitted slump.\n\nSpieth said it hasn’t been easy dealing with his poor play.\n\nFrustrated with slump\n\nThese days, most interviews are filled with questions about what’s wrong with his game and why it isn’t at the level that helped him win two majors in 2015 and finish in the top 5 in the other two.\n\n“I don't want to use the word ‘negativity,’” Spieth said. “But the questioning and the wording that's used to describe me by media or whatever over the past year has only come up because of the amount of success that I've had.”\n\nSpieth admitted that he’s grown frustrated, at times, with the way he’s played. But he also believes he’s becoming more driven to fix it.\n\n“Knowing my capabilities and then what I’ve been doing … sometimes, momentarily, that can [become] frustration,” Spieth said. “But it certainly leads to a drive, a will to want to correct and get back to where I’m contending.”\n\nPGA CHAMPIONSHIP: Why these 10 golfers can win the trophy\n\nSTORY LINES: What to watch in PGA Championship at Bethpage Black\n\nHe says he’s fixed the technical swing issue that undermined his game. He says his slump is over and that he’s close to a breakthrough. And there’s some evidence to support that.\n\nHe’s made eight of the last nine cuts and ranks 18th on the PGA Tour in birdie average. He played three solid rounds at the Masters, and worked himself into contention at last week’s Byron Nelson Classic.\n\nBut there are also some red flags. Spieth has been prone to big mistakes, with at least two double-bogeys or worse in each of his last 10 tournaments. And he’s had a tough time scoring when it matters: In 16 weekend rounds this year, Spieth has broken 70 only three times.\n\nFinding the fix\n\nSpieth says he’s pinpointed the problem: the driver.\n\n“Even on some of the good rounds I get away with a bad couple of drives,” Spieth said. “But then over the course of four rounds, you just can't continue to get away with them. Kind of the foul ball-type thing.”\n\nThe stats support Spieth’s hypothesis. He’s ranked 202nd in strokes gained off the tee.\n\nIt’s a problem that needs to be fixed, and Spieth says he’s working on it.\n\n“It's getting there,” Spieth said. “And I feel like I'm working on one swing feel now instead of changing it up each round, which allows me to be more consistent, to recognize where the club face is and be able to time it a little bit better.”\n\nBut Spieth admitted that he’s been sticking with one feel for the “last week or so.” And as recently as Sunday’s final round at the Byron Nelson, when Spieth made four birdies and four bogeys, he was unsuccessfully experimenting with his driver, which he called a “dumb decision.”\n\nIf Spieth is to have any success at Bethpage Black, he’s knows he’s going to have to stop hitting the foul balls.\n\n“You need your bad rounds to be held at about par to win this tournament,” Spieth said. “If I can continue to make the amount of birdies I've been making and then just limit the mistakes a little bit, then I should be right in it.”\n\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2025/04/13/rory-mcilroy-2025-masters-grand-slam-champion/83073658007/", "title": "Rory McIlroy wins 2025 Masters in playoff, earns career Grand Slam", "text": "The 11-year chase is finally complete − and it took a playoff.\n\nRory McIlroy emerged victorious at Augusta National as the winner of the 89th Masters tournament, capturing the one major that eluded him and putting himself in golf immortality. McIlroy was in a showdown with Justin Rose, with both tied at 11-under par, and only needed one playoff hole to win. McIlroy finished with a 1-over 73 before it went to the playoff.\n\nIt was as dramatic as an ending could be at Augusta National on April 13. McIlroy headed into the final hole with a one-shot lead but couldn't save par and it came down to a playoff between McIlroy and Rose, who shot a final-round 66.\n\nThe two competitors replayed the 18th and started off with ideal tee shots. On their second shots, Rose nearly hit it into the hole and got to within 15 feet, while McIlroy's ball had incredible backspin after hitting the green to end up 4 feet away. Rose couldn’t make the putt and settled for par. All McIlroy needed was birdie to win his first green jacket, and he hit it.\n\nIt was an up-and-down final round, but after he nailed the winning putt, McIlroy fell to his knees as the celebration was on. He was visibly emotional, and all the pain and frustration from years past are now wiped away with his first Masters victory.\n\nWith the win, the 35-year-old from Northern Ireland becomes the sixth golfer to win the career Grand Slam and the first since Tiger Woods capped off the achievement in 2000.\n\n\"It feels incredible,\" McIlroy said afterward on the CBS broadcast. \"This is my 17th time here and I started to wonder if it would ever be my time. The last ten years coming here with the burden of the Grand Slam on my shoulders and trying to achieve that. I’m sort of wondering what we are going to talk about going into next year’s Masters. I’m honored and thrilled and so proud to call myself a Masters champion.\"\n\nOne of the most recognizable names in golf, McIlroy burst onto the scene after becoming an accomplished amateur star and proved he could play with the best in the world when he turned pro at 18. He won his first major at the 2011 U.S. Open, took the 2012 PGA Championship and had a stellar 2014 when he won the British Open and PGA Championship in less than a one-month span.\n\nBut as McIlroy became a household name, the Masters has always been a sore spot in his career. In 2011, he looked like he'd win it when he had a four-stroke lead heading into the final day. Instead, he had a disastrous last round and finished tied for 15th. The following year, weekend struggles took him out of the mix.\n\nMcIlroy finished in the top 10 every year from 2014 to 2018, and in 2022, he finished in second, three strokes behind Scottie Scheffler.\n\nThere was wonder if McIlroy would ever win at Augusta. But something felt different about this year. McIlroy met with Jack Nicklaus, winner of six green jackets, about how to play the course, shot-by-shot. The legendary golfer told McIlroy he wouldn't change a thing about his approach.\n\n“I think it’s about time that Rory won,” Nicklaus said.\n\nMaybe it was a good omen.\n\nAfter a rough end of the first round spoiled his day April 10 and seemed like it would be another disappointing weekend, he recovered with a 6-under-par second round to catapult himself into third place. Then for his third round he had another big day to get to 12 under, in first place by two strokes heading into the final day.\n\nIt was his first 54-hole sole lead at a major since the 2014 PGA Championship. It was nearly the same scenario as the 2011 collapse. The question on Sunday was would McIlroy finally exorcise the demons?\n\nBryson DeChambeau made it interesting early when he briefly took the lead after the second hole, but there was nothing stopping McIlroy from ending the day on top, even when things started going wrong.\n\nHe was dialed in off the start. After a poor tee shot on the par-4 seventh, McIlroy split the trees and the ball beautifully landed on the green 8 feet from the cup. He couldn't help but smile as he saved par on the hole, and it was just that kind of Sunday McIlroy dreamt of having.\n\nMcIlroy was 2-under-par after the first 10 holes, and despite everything going right to start the day, there was still some intense drama to cap off the weekend.\n\nThe winner's third shot on the par-5 13th went right and bounced into the creek in a stunning turn of events. He ended up with double bogey on the hole to drop to 11 under, and moments later Rose birdied the 16th for a tie on top of the leaderboard.\n\nOn the following hole, McIlroy had a rough tee shot and could only hope to save par. On the shot, the ball got as close to the cup as it could without going in, stunning everyone watching. It resulted in a bogey and there was a three-way tie among McIlroy, Rose and Ludvig Aberg just before 6 p.m. ET.\n\nWhen it looked like McIlroy might fade back into complete disaster, he had an unforgettable 15th. On the par-5, his second shot was a magnificent display. The ball landed on the green and rolled to just 6 feet away from the pin as the crowd erupted from the stellar performance. He missed the shot for eagle but got the birdie to retake the lead with three holes to go.\n\nStill, more was needed. Rose hit an incredible birdie putt on the 18th to finish the round at 11 under and tie for first. McIlroy did it again with a spectacular second shot on the 17th hole that set him up 2 feet away from the cup. He nailed the birdie shot and it ended up being critical to forcing the playoff.\n\nMajor Insider: Get Golfweek's best stories, latest updates from Augusta National straight to your inbox.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/pga/2025/04/08/masters-2025-rory-mcilroy-career-grand-slam/82987663007/", "title": "Masters 2025: Rory McIlroy seeking to complete career Grand Slam", "text": "AI-assisted summary McIlroy has won four major championships, but none since 2014.\n\nHe is considered one of the favorites this year, along with defending champion Scottie Scheffler.\n\n.AUGUSTA, Ga. — When Rory McIlroy needs a reality check or just needs to be reminded about life outside the bubble of being one of the greatest ever to swing a golf club, all he has to do is think back to that day three weeks ago when his daughter had a very simple question:\n\n\"Daddy, are you famous?\" asked Poppy McIlroy, 4½.\n\nMcIlroy had just won The Players Championship and his sizzling start to the season was a hot topic with the Masters, and majors season, approaching.\n\nPoppy had just returned home from school that day, and she was wondering why some of her classmates were talking so much about her daddy.\n\nRory's answer: \"It depends who you talk to.\"\n\nAh, the innocence.\n\nNot much debate on McIlroy's popularity, no matter who you talk to. The Jupiter resident is one of the most recognizable sports figures in the world as one of the most decorated golfers on any tour. He has 28 career PGA Tour wins, add in 18 DP World Tour titles and a handful of others, and this is a career headed directly to the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nYet, even for a man who's accomplished so much, including recently becoming the second golfer to surpass $100 million on the career money list (second to Tiger Woods), this is not a life immune to disappointment.\n\nAnd for McIlroy, the venue he is playing this week has been the source of disappointment.\n\nMcIlroy still seeking elusive Grand Slam\n\nMcIlroy, 35, is more than a decade removed from the last of his four major championships. From 2011 to 2014, he won the U.S. Open, PGA Championship twice and the British Open.\n\nThat means Thursday, when McIlroy tees off at Augusta National at 1:12 p.m. in a group that includes Ludvig Aberg and Akshay Bhatia, it will mark the 11th time he is seeking to complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters.\n\nWith it comes plenty of attention, especially for the No. 2 golfer in the world.\n\n\"Look, I understand the narrative and the noise, and there's a lot of anticipation and buildup coming into this tournament each and every year, but I just have to keep my head down and focus on my job,\" McIlroy said Tuesday.\n\n\"It's just trying to block out that noise as much as possible. I need to treat this tournament like all the other tournaments that I play throughout the year.\"\n\nThe closest McIlroy has come to completing that Grand Slam was a runner-up finish in 2022, but even that was not close, not with Scottie Scheffler having a five-shot lead on 18. Scheffler won by three.\n\nWHAT ARE HIS CHANCES? Masters predictions, picks: Odds on the winner at the Augusta National Golf Club\n\nFive other times, McIlroy was top 10, including fourth in 2015 and fifth in 2018 and 2020.\n\nMcIlroy's year started with a win at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, a couple of top 20s at the Genesis Invitational and Arnold Palmer Invitational before his second Players championship. He followed that with a T5 at the Houston Open.\n\nAll of which have most looking at this week's first major as a two-man race between McIlroy and world No. 1 and defending champion Scottie Scheffler.\n\nAnd even with all he has accomplished, many do not trust McIlroy when it comes to pressurized situations.\n\n\"I think if they’re tied with three holes to go, I’d have to go with Scottie just because I think Rory might be trying so hard to finish it off that he gets in his own way,\" ESPN golf analyst and two-time major winner Andy North said.\n\nAs much as he tried to tune it out, McIlroy knows the narrative. And that grew last June at Pinehurst when he missed two short par putts in the final three holes to hand the U.S. Open to Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nAlthough it would not have completed the Grand Slam, it would have silenced the noise about winning that fifth major.\n\nMcIlroy is proud of his record since last summer's heartbreak. In 12 events worldwide, he has seven top 10s, including those two wins on the PGA Tour this year.\n\nMORE FROM D'ANGELO: Bernhard Langer knows plenty of tears will be shed during his final Masters\n\nBut, the only one in which he missed the cut was the British Open.\n\n\"I think over the course of my career I've showed quite a lot of resilience from setbacks, and I feel like I've done the same again, especially post-June last year and the golf that I've played since then, and it's something that I'm really proud of,\" he said.\n\n\"You have setbacks, and you have disappointments. When you have a long career like I have had, luckily, you sort of just learn to roll with the punches, the good times, the bad times, knowing that if you do the right work and you practice the right way, that those disappointments will turn into good times again pretty soon.\"\n\nMcIlroy called dealing with the disappointments and not allowing them to eat you alive \"self-preservation.\" But as important is he now understands, especially in this profession, heartbreak will happen. It's inevitable.\n\nAnd when you accept that, when you are not fearful of taking those chances that could lead to anguish, dealing with the results is easier.\n\nWHAT'S ON TAP FOR WEDNESDAY? Master Par 3 Contest: What is it and everything to know\n\n\"People, I think, instinctually as human beings we hold back sometimes because of the fear of getting hurt, whether that's a conscious decision or subconscious decision, and I think I was doing that on the golf course a little bit for a few years,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"But I think once you go through that, once you go through those heartbreaks, as I call them, or disappointments, you get to a place where you remember how it feels and you wake up the next day and you're like, yeah, life goes on, it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be.\n\n\"You dust yourself off and you go again.\"\n\nAnd again and again.

Some will forever be stuck on 75 percent of golf's major achievement, while a few still have a shot at Grand Slam destiny.\n\nAs the fist major championship of this year gets ready to tee off, let's take a look at the golfers who are (or were) incredibly close to a career Grand Slam.\n\nFun fact: No golfer has ever won the PGA Championship to complete the career grand slam.\n\nJim Barnes\n\nWe're starting things off with the golfing legend, Jim Barnes—and an asterisk. Barnes, who won the 1916 and '19 PGA Championship, the '21 U.S. Open, and the '25 Open Championship, didn't get a crack at the Masters until its inception in 1934. By then, Barnes was 48 years old, which, as history has shown, is not the typical age range of golfers you'd expect to see getting cloaked in a green jacket.\n\nTommy Armour\n\nNext up on the tee box is Tommy Armour—and though not as bold as Barnes', his Masters shortcomings require a caveat. Armour had the 1927 U.S. Open, the '20 PGA Championship and the '31 Open Championship under his belt by the time he played his first Masters in 1935. But at 38, he was also on the downhill portion of his prime, and never captured glory at Augusta. His best finish would be a tie for 8th in 1937.\n\nWalter Hagen\n\nThe Masters strikes again! Walter Hagen was a major championship-winning force during his prime. The Nicklaus and Woods before Nicklaus and Woods. His 11 majors included the 1914 and '19 U.S. Open, the '21, '24-'27 PGA Championship and the '22, '24, and '28-'29 Open Championship. Like Barnes and Armour, though, by the time the Masters began, Hagen (then 41) was looking back at his best playing days. He appeared at Augusta National six times.\n\nByron Nelson\n\nThe great Bryon Nelson won 1937 and '42 Masters, the '40 and '45 PGA Championship and the '39 U.S. Open—producing some of the legendary one-ups against Ben Hogan, such as that '42 Masters. The Open Championship eluded Nelson's career resume, however, and the reasoning was understandable (even in today's sports landscape): cost of travel. Nelson played the Open Championship two times during this career—1937 and 1955—and his best showing was fifth ('37).\n\nSam Snead\n\nSam Snead's trips to the majors during his impressive career were not so much about the seven victories as they were the \"so close!\" runner-up showings. Snead finished second four times at the US Open—the one major he would never win. Unfortunately, the most notable snafu cost Snead more than a runner-up nod: The infamous 1939 U.S. Open at Philadelphia Country Club. Snead played aggressively on the 18th hole on Sunday, thinking he needed a birdie to win it all—when par would have done the trick. Alas, his go-for-broke mindset ended with a snowman on the scorecard, an 8 that would forever follow him around the golf world.\n\nArnold Palmer\n\nThe PGA Championship would be the one that got away from Arnie, leaving the Latrobe, Pennsylvania legend one major short of a career Grand Slam. Like Snead, Palmer faced a few close calls when battling for PGA Championship prestige, ending with three runner-up finishes in 1964, '69 and '70.\n\nLee Trevino\n\nLee Trevino's six major championships were spread equally among the U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championship. The Masters would be the one that got away for Trevino, who looked at the \"high-draw friendly\" layout at Augusta National and saw nothing but headaches for his low-fade game. He skipped the tournament multiple times throughout his career—something he would regret—and never really created the opportunities for a green jacket fitting.\n\nRaymond Floyd\n\nRaymond Floyd never conquered the links-style tests of the Open Championship, keeping him from earning the career Grand Slam. The four-time major winner's best chance at the final leg ended with a runner-up finish at the 1978 Open (St. Andrews). Floyd fired an impressive 68 that Sunday, catapulting up the leaderboard from 13th. But it would not be enough to overcome the champ that year, Jack Nicklaus.\n\nTom Watson\n\nWatson was an eight-time major champ but never raised the Wanamaker Trophy at the PGA Championship. He had several top-10 nods at the final major of the season, but only three were close to winning it all. The 1978 PGA Championship at Oakmont Country Club would be the toughest to swallow: Watson lost a five-shot lead, posting a final-round 78 on the challenging layout. He would lose the tournament on a playoff to John Mahaffey.\n\nPhil Mickelson\n\nPhil Mickelson has come close so often at majors (11 total) that simply saying \"Lefty\" can take golf fans on a runner-up roller coaster—culminating at Winged Foot circa 2006. Phil has six runner-up showings at the U.S. Open—the one major not on his spectacular career resume—and some of the finishes have been epic (and heartbreaking), including that final round at Winged Foot. His errant tee shot on 18 resulted in a double-bogey and a win for Geoff Ogilvy. Unlike others on this list, he's still got chances, though fleeting (at 50), to earn that final trophy for the Grand Slam mantel.\n\nJordan Spieth\n\nSpeith, like McIlroy, had to endure the added pressure of winning big-time tournaments early on in the career. He has struggled lately, his last major coming in 2017 (Open Championship), but the idea he can go the next decade-plus without snagging at least one PGA Championship seems odd. ... but then again, more than a few golfers above him on this list probably said the same thing at one time or another.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2024/05/16/pga-championship-2024-contenders-valhalla-golf-club-scottie-scheffler/73651365007/", "title": "Who will win the 2024 PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club?", "text": "The best golfers in the world have converged on Louisville, all with the same goal in mind: to walk away from Valhalla Golf Club with the Wanamaker Trophy. But not every player's chances of winning the PGA Championship are equal. There are 20 PGA club professionals in the 156-player field; no teaching pro has won the event.\n\nThen there's the fact the top two players in the Official World Golf Ranking enter this week firing on all cylinders. That's not to say either of them, or any of the other favorites installed by oddsmakers, will end at the top of the leaderboard come Sunday evening. The PGA Championship has its share of underdog victors, from Y.E. Yang and Shaun Micheel to Rich Beem and John Daly — the ninth alternate the year he conquered Crooked Stick.\n\nKeeping those facts in mind, here are five players expected to be in contention Sunday (and five more, for good measure):\n\nThe favorites\n\nScottie Scheffler\n\nThe only thing that has slowed down Scottie Scheffler recently is his own family. He didn't play in the Wells Fargo Championship last week because he was awaiting the birth of his first child. Now, he'll tee it up as a father for the first time. He and his wife, Meredith, welcomed their son, Bennett, into the world last week.\n\nScheffler will try to remain in splendid form after a torrid recent stretch.\n\nHe's won four of his last five events; the only one he didn't win (the Houston Open), he tied for second. In 10 events this season, Scheffler has finished outside the top 10 only once, as he tied for 17th at The American Express in January.\n\nReciting how many categories in which he ranks No. 1 on the PGA Tour this season would take all day.\n\nFor the sake of brevity, check out the tweet below from golf stats guru Justin Ray, which also includes Scheffler's numbers in major championships the past three years. (No surprise: They're also stellar.)\n\nNeedless to say, he's the odds-on favorite to bag his second major in as many events this year after winning the Masters by four strokes last month.\n\nRory McIlroy\n\nAfter holding off Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson to win the 2014 PGA Championship, Rory McIlroy had four major titles at just 25 years old. (Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Bobby Jones are the only other golfers who can make that claim.) But since that victory at Valhalla, McIlroy hasn't added to his major tally.\n\nEven though he's achieved everything else within reach.\n\nThree FedEx Cups (the most all time), three Race to Dubai championships (the only player with more than one in that span) and three Tour Championships (the only player with multiple victories in the season-ending event). A Players Championship in 2019.\n\nAnd he's won his last two starts, teaming with Shane Lowry to capture the Zurich Classic and then powering past Xander Schauffele in the final round of the Wells Fargo last week.\n\nIt's not as if he's struggled in major championships since his PGA triumph: His 20 top 10s since then are the most of any player.\n\nFor a variety of reasons — slow starts, costly errors and questionable course management, and at times, others simply playing better — McIlroy has been stuck on four majors.\n\nOn the course, his game is in tip-top shape; aside from his consecutive wins, he also has a top three a month ago (at the Texas Open) and hasn't missed a cut in 10 events this season.\n\nOff the course, there have been developments in McIlroy's private life: He filed for divorce from his wife of seven years, Erica McIlroy, on May 13.\n\nHow he navigates what's going on off the course with a goal of snapping his dry spell in major championships may be the determining factor in McIlroy's result this week.\n\nNext in line\n\nBrooks Koepka\n\nIt's Brooks Koepka. At a major. Need we say more?\n\n(We will. But not too much.)\n\nKoepka is simply a colossus when it comes to major championships.\n\nSince the beginning of 2015, he has 17 top 10s in majors, trailing only McIlroy. The biggest difference between the two: Koepka has five wins in majors, while McIlroy has none. Koepka became only the 20th in history to reach the five-major mark thanks to his victory at last year's PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club. He's won three of the past six PGAs, going back-to-back in 2018 (at Bellerive) and 2019 (at Bethpage Black).\n\nA triumph this week would put him in rarefied air: Only Walter Hagen (five, all in match-play era), Nicklaus (five) and Woods (four) have at least four Wanamakers.\n\nPerhaps even more worrisome for the field this week: He's fresh off a victory in his most recent outing, winning the LIV Golf tour's Singapore event earlier this month, beating Cameron Smith and Marc Leishman by two shots.\n\nJon Rahm\n\nThe 29-year-old Spaniard already is halfway to the career Grand Slam, winning the U.S. Open in 2021 and the Masters last year.\n\nNo player, on the PGA or LIV tours, has been more consistent recently than Jon Rahm when it comes to reaching the weekend at majors: He's made 18 consecutive cuts in golf's four biggest events, the longest active streak of its kind. (His last missed cut: the 2019 PGA at Bethpage). During his cuts-made streak, Rahm's scoring average is 70.40, which trails only Scheffler (69.95) and McIlroy (70.38) among players with at least 40 rounds in major championships in that span.\n\nIn seven LIV events this year, Rahm has yet to finish outside the top 15, though he's still in search of his first victory on that tour.\n\nThe PGA Championship is the only major in which Rahm doesn't have multiple top fives; he tied for fourth in 2018, five strokes behind Koepka. He has three top fives in the Masters and two apiece in the U.S. Open and Open Championship.\n\nAnother one to watch\n\nXander Schauffele\n\nAside from Koepka, no player has been more of a fixture on the first page of major championship leaderboards the past five years, as Schauffele has nine top 10s.\n\nBut putting himself in contention never has been in question.\n\nActually winning has been the problem.\n\nHe's still seeking his maiden major victory. And those struggles closing extend beyond the majors into the rank-and-file PGA Tour events. Schauffele led McIlroy by one stroke heading into last week's final round; the Californian went on to lose by five shots. And that final-round flameout came after Schauffele held a four-shot lead at the conclusion of 36 holes.\n\nSince his last victory — the 2022 Scottish Open — he has 21 top 10s and 13 top fives.\n\nIs this the week he ends his 39-tournament winless drought and finally breaks through in a major?\n\nFive more who might contend\n\nLudvig Åberg: The young, immensely talented Swede would rank higher on this list if not for his health. Åberg withdrew from the Wells Fargo, citing lingering knee soreness. When his body hasn't bothered him, he's been a force. Already No. 6 in the OWGR, Åberg has a victory, three runners-up, five top fives and nine top 10s in just 26 starts on the PGA Tour. And only Scheffler bested him in his major-championship debut last month at Augusta National Golf Club. If his knee isn't an issue, he'll be a factor this week.\n\nPatrick Cantlay: While he's started to turn around his performance in major championships — he has five top 15s in his last seven appearances after having only four in his first 21 — it's still not what is expected for a player of his caliber, who hasn't been outside the top 10 in the OWGR since June 2021. Cantlay is 11 for 11 in made cuts on the PGA Tour this season but hasn't won an event since the 2022 BMW Championship.\n\nCollin Morikawa: The 2020 PGA champion, whose level of play dropped off after his 2021 Open Championship triumph, has bounced back in the past 10 months. Since a missed cut at the 2023 Open, he ended his winless drought (thanks to a victory at the Zozo Championship) and has seven top 25s in 11 tournaments this season. He finished third at the Masters.\n\nJordan Spieth: A PGA Championship win is all that separates Spieth from the career Grand Slam and golf immortality, joining a group consisting of just five players: Nicklaus, Woods, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen. But he'll have to overcome lackluster results in recent years: He hasn't finished better than 29th in the last four PGA Championships and has just two victories since his 2017 Open Championship win. Spieth also has twice as many missed cuts (seven) as top 10s (three) in 12 events in 2024.\n\nJustin Thomas: The local favorite, and two-time PGA champion, undoubtedly will have the crowd behind him. But can he rediscover consistent form in majors? In his first 28 major championships, he missed just five cuts. Since the beginning of 2023, however, he's failed to make the weekend four times in five majors; the lone made cut was last year's PGA, where he tied for 65th.\n\nReach Kentucky men’s basketball and football reporter Ryan Black at rblack@gannett.com and follow him on X at @RyanABlack.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/masters/2025/04/12/rory-mcllroy-scorecard-masters-2025-third-round-highlights-score-live-updates/83060078007/", "title": "Rory McIlroy scorecard today: PGA Tour star takes lead at The Masters", "text": "Correction/clarification: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported Rory McIlroy’s last major championship win.

He moves into first place on the leaderboard.\n\nHole 3: McIlroy makes birdie on Hole 3 to move 10-under-par on the tournament. An exceptional start for the four-time major champion on \"Moving Day\" at the Masters.\n\nHole 5: McIlroy pushes his lead to 11-under-par on the tournament with his third birdie of the day. He is shooting 5-under-par 16 on the afternoon through his first five holes.\n\nHole 6: McIlroy keeps his three-stroke lead by making par on Hole 6. Per The Masters' official X (formerly Twitter) account, McIlroy has become the first player in the tournament's history to start his round with six consecutive threes.\n\nHole 8: McIlroy can't get his save himself for par on Hole 8 as hit putt shot goes just past the hole. He would then make bogey on his next shot, his first bogey since Thursday's opening round, to drop him to 10-under-par in the tournament. He holds a three-stroke lead over the field.\n\nHole 10: McIlroy records his second bogey of the day, dropping his lead down to one stroke at 9-under par. His hot start on Saturday has now slowed down. It is the second bogey in the last three holes for McIlroy.\n\nHole 13: McIlroy capitalizes on the opportunity to get birdie on Hole 13 to push his lead back up to two strokes at 10-under par. It is the fourth birdie of the afternoon for McIlroy, who is now back to 4-under-par on the day.\n\nHole 15: Just when it looked like McIlroy might have gone cold, he struck back in a big win: recording his second eagle of the day to push his lead to 12-under-par in the tournament. The eagle came on the par 5 Hole 15 after his second shot — which went 205 yards — fell six feet from the pin.\n\nHole 18: McIlroy closes out his strong outing with a putt for par. He will be paired with DeChambeau in the final paring on Masters Sunday, as the two golfers duel for the green jacket.\n\nHas Rory McIlroy ever won the Masters?\n\nNo, McIlroy has never finished atop the leaderboard at the Masters. The closest he has come to winning the Masters was finishing second in 2022 behind Scottie Scheffler.\n\nIf McIlroy can win the 2025 Masters Tournament, he will become the sixth golfer to accomplish the career Grand Slam, i.e. win each of the four major tournaments at least once in his career. He'd also take home an earning of $4.6 million for winning the Masters from the tournament's record-breaking $21 million purse, which was announced by Augusta National Golf Club on Saturday.\n\nMasters 2025 purse, payout\n\nThe Masters Tournament purse for this year is $21 million, which is a $1 million increase from last year's tournament.

The first of the four majors each year is The Masters, followed by the PGA Championship, the U.S. Open and then The Open Championship.\n\nThere have been just five golfers to achieve the career Grand Slam, with Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus as the only two golfers in the history of the sport to win it three times.\n\nClick here to read more on the career Grand Slam in golf.\n\nRory McIlroy Masters Shoes\n\nMcIlroy is currently rocking the limited edition Nike Victory Tour 4 shoes at the 2025 Masters Tournament.

Still, “taken together they will help limit the number of infected people and provide us an early warning about new variants.”\n\nUS health officials said the January 5 timeline was selected to provide airlines with ample time to adjust operations to implement the new rules. The officials did not estimate how long they expect these rules to remain in place, saying they would “monitor the situation on the ground and adjust as needed.”\n\nAdditionally, officials announced that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expanding the Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance program to airports in Seattle and Los Angeles, bringing the total number of airports participating to seven with approximately 500 weekly flights from at least 30 countries covered. This will include approximately 290 weekly flights from China and surrounding areas.\n\n“We’re expanding that to hopefully to pick up any variant that may emerge” as well as “to reduce transmission of a new variant by introducing this pre-departure testing program,” an official said.\n\nThe new requirement comes as Japan and India have announced Covid-19 measures for travelers from China amid concerns over an uptick in cases.\n\nJapan is requiring individuals traveling from China be tested for Covid-19 upon arrival starting December 30. Indian authorities have said travelers from China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Thailand will have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test on arrival to India and quarantine if they test positive.\n\nChina has started loosening its strict Covid-19 measures after dismantling the country’s long-held zero-Covid policy earlier this month. On Monday, China announced it will end quarantine requirements for international arrivals from January 8, marking a major step toward reopening its borders.\n\nBut the sudden end to the China’s stringent health policy has caught many in the country off guard and put strains on the health system as it deals with an increase of infections.\n\nOfficials noted that the “CDC continues to recommend masking during travel, self-monitoring for symptoms and testing for three days after arrival for international travel.”\n\nOfficials said China uploaded “only about 100” new sequences to public databases in recent weeks, “including Omicron subvariants such as BA.5,” but the small sample size leaves room for concern, the CDC said.\n\n“What we’re concerned about is a new variant may emerge actually in China,” one official said. “With so many people in China being infected in a short period of time, there is a chance and probability that a new variant will emerge.”\n\nAsked if there was concern about the veracity of the data – and whether China was being truthful and transparent, an official said it was mainly the amount of data that concerned the administration at this point.\n\n“We have just limited information in terms of what’s being shared related to number of cases (that) are increasing hospitalizations, and especially deaths,” he said. “Also, there’s been a decrease in testing across China. So that also makes it difficult to know what the true infection rate is.”\n\nChina’s foreign ministry responded Wednesday to reports that the US is considering imposing restrictions on travelers from China, urging parties to work together to ensure the safe movement of people between countries and the stability of the global supply chain.\n\n“We need all parties to work together scientifically against the epidemic to ensure the safe movement of people between countries, maintain the stability of the global industrial chain supply chain and promote the resumption of healthy growth in the world economy,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Arlette Saenz Kevin Liptak Nikki Carvajal", "Arlette Saenz", "Kevin Liptak", "Nikki Carvajal"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/health/masks-covid-omicron-planes-travel-wellness/index.html", "title": "Should you cancel your travel plans now that masks aren't required ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge in Florida struck down the Biden administration’s mask mandate for airplanes, trains and other public transport. Within hours, several major airlines announced that they would no longer be enforcing mask requirements, and mask-wearing is optional.\n\nHow can people continue to keep safe on planes now that masks are no longer required? What about vulnerable individuals like immunocompromised people and young children who aren’t yet vaccinated? Do you need to quarantine if you’re visiting vulnerable people and you were just on a flight? Should people consider canceling their travel plans?\n\nTo help answer these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.”\n\nThe following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nCNN: First of all, how worried are you about masks no longer being required on flights?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: Since the beginning of the pandemic, I’ve said that my major concern with Covid-19 risk during travel isn’t what happens during transit, but what happens after people get to their destination. It may seem like planes are high risk because there are a lot of people in close proximity to one another, but planes have not been a major source of virus spread even before masking requirements. That’s because the ventilation on airplanes is quite good, with more frequent air exchanges than most office buildings. The HEPA filters they have are on par with the ones used in hospitals.\n\nThat said, masks – especially when used properly and consistently – do reduce the risk of virus transmission. There could be higher risk now that masks are no longer required. That means people who wish to remain cautious must take matters into their own hands even more to protect themselves.\n\nCNN: What are steps people can take to continue keeping safe on planes?\n\nWen: Just because masks aren’t required by the government doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t wear them. I have several trips this month by train and by plane, and I will certainly be choosing to mask in the airport, train station, on the train and plane, and in other crowded areas.\n\nIf you are going to wear a mask, please wear a well-fitting, high-quality mask – an N95, KN95 or KF94 mask. I get very worried when I see people in simple cloth masks. They may think that those masks are protecting them, but they aren’t doing much, especially when we are dealing with the extremely contagious Omicron subvariants.\n\nPassengers make their way through Delta Airlines Terminal Two at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday, April 19, 2022 in Los Angeles, CA. Gary Coronado/Los Angeles Times/Getty images\n\nWear your mask in the highest-risk settings. That includes during boarding and deplaning, when the ventilation systems on airplanes are often not running. Don’t drink or eat at those times.\n\nOf course, please make sure you that you are maximally protected from a vaccination perspective. People who are vaccinated and boosted are less likely to be infected with Covid-19 compared with someone who is unvaccinated – and much less likely to become severely ill from the coronavirus. Consider getting your second booster shot, if you are eligible, for additional protection.\n\nCNN: What’s your advice for people who are immunocompromised, or families with young children not yet eligible to be vaccinated?\n\nWen: For individuals who are immunocompromised or otherwise most vulnerable to severe outcomes from Covid-19, I would highly recommend that they stay masked with an N95 or equivalent mask at all times while in crowded indoor spaces. They should take off their mask to eat and drink only when not around others. That could be at an empty gate at the airport. One-way masking is highly protective, but only when it’s used at all times with a well-fitting, high-quality mask.\n\nFor families with children, the question to ask is how important is avoiding Covid-19 to your family. If it is very important, what to do depends on the age of the child. Children ages 2 and older who are able to mask can be encouraged to mask while on flights. A cloth mask worn over a three-ply surgical mask is better than a cloth mask alone. It’s much more challenging for little kids and those who are unable to mask. My best advice is to put them in the window seat, turn on the air nozzle at full blast, and try to limit the time they have to be in packed, poorly ventilated spaces like during boarding and deplaning.\n\nCNN: What if you’re traveling to visit vulnerable people? Do you need to quarantine or test before seeing them if you just got off a plane with a lot of maskless people?\n\nWen: Depending on the medical circumstances of the people you’re visiting, you may already be asked to quarantine and test. For instance, if you are visiting an elderly relative who is on chemotherapy, or meeting a newborn baby, their families may already be requesting that you limit your risks and not go to indoor dining for a few days prior to travel, then take a rapid test just before seeing them.\n\nI don’t think the travel itself should change this calculus. That is, I don’t think a plane of maskless people is risky enough to start your quarantine clock over, as long as you wore your N95 or equivalent the entire time while in indoor, crowded settings.\n\nCNN: The mask mandate decision doesn’t affect just airplanes and trains. It also impacts subways and buses, which a lot of people need to get to school and work, as well as medical appointments. Is it safe for them?\n\nWen: This is a major concern. While airplanes have good air circulation in comparison to many other indoor settings, buses and subways may not. Also, many people need to take these local or regional forms of transportation in order to go about their daily lives.\n\nSome municipalities, such as New York and Los Angeles, are continuing to enforce mask mandates on local public transportation. My advice for vulnerable people remains the same: It is extremely important that you wear a well-fitting, high-quality mask at all times while in these indoor crowded spaces. Young children who are unable to mask and cannot yet be vaccinated have been at higher risk throughout the pandemic, and they remain at higher risk now. Try to limit their time in these settings and look for ways to improve ventilation, for example, by opening a window if that is an option.\n\nCNN: Are there some people who might want to reconsider travel plans, now that the mask mandate has essentially been lifted?\n\nWen: I think families with babies and other very young children who are not able to mask might have already had concerns about traveling, especially with the number of people who were wearing flimsy masks or refusing to wear them. That’s the group that I could see being even more hesitant to go on planes and trains now.\n\nOther people who can wear an N95 or equivalent mask should be quite well-protected through one-way masking. I would urge vulnerable people – and really everyone – to have a plan for what happens if they were to contract Covid-19. Would they qualify for treatments? If so, which ones are best for them, given their medical circumstances and other medications they are on? How would they access treatment at their destination? Can they bring rapid tests with them, and if they need confirmatory PCR testing, where would they get it?\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSpeaking of tests, before you go to international destinations, make sure you know what, if any, testing and vaccination requirements there are. There is still a testing requirement to reenter the United States, so know where you would go to get your test.\n\nIn recent months, there has been a shift from top-down, federal mandates to empowering individuals to make risk calculations and then decide for themselves what precautions they want to take. For some people, it may not be ideal, especially considering the chaotic way the federal mask mandate was brought to an end, but we all need to adjust to the current circumstances. We have many more tools at our disposal, and people should know about how to access all these tools to protect themselves and their families.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/inflight-wifi-technology/index.html", "title": "How airlines give you internet access at 35,000 feet — and why it ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nFlights used to be a chance to sit back (albeit a bit cramped) and watch a recently released movie or catch up on some reading. Now they’re just another place to log on.\n\nDelta and United each host more than 1.5 million inflight WiFi sessions a month, the airlines told CNN Business, while JetBlue said its service is used by “millions of customers” every year. Southwest declined to share specific numbers but said inflight Wifi is “popular.”\n\nAlaska Airlines, meanwhile, estimates that about 35% of its passengers on average make use of its $8 onboard WiFi services which include surfing the web and streaming.\n\nWhile most airlines will allow certain messaging apps for free, full internet access in the skies usually comes at a premium, with Delta charging nearly $50 for a monthly pass on US flights (though the airline plans to switch to a $5 per flight per device offering by the end of this year). But with a market that’s currently estimated at around $5 billion and projected to grow to more than $12 billion by 2030, according to research firm Verified Market Research, there’s a lot of room for improvement.\n\nInflight internet has been around for nearly two decades, with aircraft manufacturer Boeing announcing its service, known as Connexion, in April 2000 and debuting it on a Munich-Los Angeles Lufthansa flight in 2004. Boeing discontinued the service in 2006, saying the market for it had “not materialized” as expected. But the advent of smartphones and subsequent efforts by a host of satellite providers and airlines have helped the technology evolve significantly in the past decade — though it still has some catching up to do in order to compare to home and office networks.\n\nHow it works\n\nThere are two main types of inflight connections. The first, known as air-to-ground or ATG, relies on antennae attached to the aircraft that catch the signal from cellphone towers on the ground.\n\nIntelsat, which launched air-to-ground services with American Airlines in 2008, currently operates a version of the technology on more than 1,000 aircraft across North America.\n\nThe one major drawback of this technology is that, much like cellphone service on the ground, it is dependent on the density and connectivity of towers, and so flights over rural areas, deserts or large water bodies are likely to suffer drops in connectivity. The maximum speeds for these systems are currently around 5 megabits per second (which is shared by hundreds of passengers), according to Andrew Zignani, a research director at technology intelligence firm ABI Research who specializes in wireless connectivity. By comparison, median global download speeds for mobile and fixed broadband are around 30 megabits per second and 67 megabits per second respectively, according to recent data from monitoring app Speedtest.\n\n“To date, the biggest issues have been speed, limited availability, gaps in coverage, dropouts, and price,” Zignani told CNN Business.\n\nThat’s why airlines and providers are increasingly switching to satellite-based connections that are relatively less susceptible to interruptions because they can more effectively cover the entirety of the flight path from space and keep the signal active as it moves through the air.\n\nThat includes Intelsat, which has a network of over 50 satellites serving airlines such as Alaska, American, Delta, United, Air Canada, British Airways and Cathay Pacific.\n\n“As regional jet fleets are refreshed we expect the majority to migrate to satellite-based solutions,” Jeff Sare, Intelsat’s president of commercial aviation, told CNN Business.\n\nViasat, another major provider used by several airlines around the world, uses its own network of satellites that provide high-speed connectivity and is gearing up to launch another satellite constellation later this year. The company debuted its services with JetBlue in 2013 and now serves more than a dozen airlines around the world.\n\nBut even satellite connections are currently capable of around 100 megabits per second per aircraft or around 15 megabits per second per passenger device, a far cry from the speeds terrestrial WiFi is capable of.\n\nMany airlines use a combination of WiFi providers and types of technologies, depending on the type of aircraft and routes they need to be deployed on.\n\nNewer players such as Starlink, the satellite internet service run by billionaire Elon Musk’s company SpaceX, are also entering the fray. Earlier this year, SpaceX announced a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines to provide high-speed internet through Starlink’s network of low-earth orbit satellites.\n\n“Some of these solutions also adopt a hybrid approach, combining the best of both technologies to ensure optimal coverage depending on the specific flight path,” said Zignani. “I believe we will see opportunities for all technologies in the coming years, and recent partnerships are showing that each technology will have its own part to play,” he added.\n\nChallenges and opportunities\n\nThere are still gaps between inflight WiFi and the networks you would use in your home, office, a coffee shop, or anywhere on the ground.\n\nWhile most airline WiFi connections now support messaging and social media functions, and some even have live TV and video streaming capabilities, providing users with the same level of bandwidth and connectivity mid-air can be a challenge.\n\n“The biggest point of difference for inflight WiFi is the complexity added by the mobility element,” Don Buchman, vice president and general manager for commercial aviation at Viasat, told CNN Business. “The aircraft is traveling at a high rate of speed, typically banking during the flight, and often flying across large geographical areas that demand consistent coverage for a high-quality in-flight connectivity experience.”\n\nAnd while satellites solve for some of the restrictions that cellphone towers face, expanding the satellite network to keep up with increasing demand is not always straightforward.\n\nAs Sare of Intelsat puts it: “It is much faster and cheaper to deploy new cellular towers than to launch a satellite on a rocket.”\n\nIn a survey by Intelsat last year of airlines, service providers and equipment manufacturers, 65% of respondents said they anticipate increases in the number of passengers who expect to be connected while flying. The two biggest impediments to increasing inflight WiFi adoption, the survey indicated, were the high price of the service and “poor internet connection.”\n\nCompanies such as Viasat, Intelsat and Starlink continue to expand that capacity, however, launching more satellites every year in anticipation of the growing demand for their services. That added capacity will not only enhance the online experience for users, but could also potentially give airlines more avenues to monetize and lower the price.\n\n“One example is ad sponsored inflight WiFi so passengers can access WiFi for free and use it however they would like,” Buchman said, adding that Viasat is also exploring ways to use its connectivity services to help airlines with functions such as crew management and aircraft maintenance.\n\nThe biggest priority, according to Sare of Intelsat, is shortening the time it takes to make those technological advances happen, and he foresees more partnerships between companies to help move the industry standard forward.\n\n“Our vision is achieved when passengers can’t tell the difference between being connected on the ground and in the air.”", "authors": ["Rishi Iyengar"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/05/02/fatal-covid-19-cases-grow-fedex-newark-while-workers-senator-cory-booker-demand-change/3010403001/", "title": "COVID-19 fatalities grow at FedEx; Sen.

The sheriff's office suggests using State 76 or U.S. 45 through Oshkosh as a detour.\n\nSouthbound I-41 is described as \"treacherous\" and worse than northbound, but the sheriff's office advises staying off the highway in both directions.\n\n— Larry Gallup\n\n11:18 a.m.: Few power outages reported in Wisconsin\n\nThough there were concerns about the potential for widespread power outages, they've been scattered and localized around Wisconsin.\n\nWe Energies was reporting about 2,000 customers without power, most in the Fox Valley and southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin Public Service was reporting just over 200 without power in northern and central Wisconsin.\n\nAlliant Energy listed just 20 customers without power in Wisconsin.\n\n— Doug Schneider\n\n10:30 a.m.: National Weather Service updates snowfall total to 2.3 inches for Milwaukee\n\nThe National Weather Service for Milwaukee/Sullivan released its updated snowfall totals for southern Wisconsin, indicating that Milwaukee has gotten 2.3 inches of snow from late Wednesday through 10 a.m. Friday.\n\nKenosha (1.1 inches) is at the low end of the spectrum, with 2.6 inches in West Bend, 2.9 in Janesville, 4 inches in Madison and 3.5 in Fond du Lac.\n\n\"Keep in mind these are estimated using a mix of point observations and smoothing to fill in the map for display purposes,\" the NWS tweeted. \"Exact amounts at your location may vary, especially with blowing and drifting.\"\n\nSee the latest on snow totals here.\n\n— JR Radcliffe\n\n7 a.m.: Wind chills as low as minus 35 degrees; winter Storm Warning remains in effect until Saturday\n\nWind speeds and frigid wind chills mean a Winter Storm Warning remains in place for all of southern Wisconsin through Saturday morning.\n\nThe wind chill Friday was expected between minus 25 and minus 35 in some areas thanks to 45 mile-per-hour winds, wind speeds that will taper off only gradually through the weekend before finally getting back to single digits on Monday.\n\nRead more about how the forecast has changed.\n\n— JR Radcliffe\n\nTHURSDAY\n\n10 p.m.: Light snow to accumulate overnight in some areas; extremely cold temperatures for all of Wisconsin\n\nLight snow will continue for the rest of the night for large portions of Wisconsin, while some places have already seen a few inches of snow.\n\n\"For central Wisconsin, most of it has tapered off,\" said meteorologist Tasos Kallas with the National Weather Service in Green Bay.\n\n\"It's still snowing over eastern and northern Wisconsin still. It probably will be light snow for the rest of the night, although accumulations, away from Door County, will be under an inch here.\"\n\nKallas said most of the heavier snow has ended for most of the state but now more cold will continue. Most communities are reporting wind chills from minus 15 to minus 30 and wind gusts as high as 25 to 35 mph. Sheboygan reported a wind gust of 36 mph.\n\nMost communities received 4 to 7 inches of snow. Some areas in far northern Wisconsin could receive a foot of snow. Here are some recent snow totals from the weather service:\n\nOutagamie County - 6.5 inches\n\nBrown County - 4.6 inches\n\nDane County - 3.9 inches\n\nWaukesha County - 2.3 inches\n\nMilwaukee County - 1.3 inches\n\n\"With the new snow on the ground and these strong winds there's going to be a lot of blowing snow, that's going to be the biggest problem for travelers,\" Kallas said.\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\n7:50 p.m.: Wisconsin airports report some delays and cancellations; Mitchell International Airport calls it 'standard'\n\nAirports across Wisconsin reported more delays and cancellations on Thursday.\n\nAn airport spokesperson with Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport says it is likely due to the weather and that operations were “standard.”\n\nStephanie Staudinger, marketing and public relations coordinator for the airport, said airlines do not typically, immediately provide reasoning for the delay or cancellation but we can “assume” it is weather related. Also, it may be the weather at an airport where a flight is arriving from that may be the cause of the delay or cancellation. A large portion of the country is experiencing extreme weather right now.\n\nAccording to FlightAware, 67 flights coming to or from Milwaukee have been delayed and 33 have been canceled. That amounts to roughly 23% to 27% of flights delayed and 9% to 15% of flights canceled.\n\nAt Green Bay Austin Straubel International Airport, 12 flights coming to or from Green Bay have been delayed and five have been canceled. While at Appleton International Airport, 10 flights coming to or from Appleton have been delayed and 16 have been canceled.\n\nCentral Wisconsin Airport in Mosinee had four flight delays and two cancellations.\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\n6:45 p.m.: Third drop-in shelter opened for people who are homeless\n\nMilwaukee County's Marcia P. Coggs Human Services Center (1220 W. Vliet St. in Milwaukee) has been opened as an additional drop-in warming shelter from the winter storm and dangerously low temperatures.\n\nThe additional 60- to 80-person capacity will supplement space at drop-in warming shelters at St. Benedict the Moor Parish (930 W. State St.) and Repairers of the Breach (1335 W. Vliet St.).\n\nThe Coggs Center will be open until noon Tuesday.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n4:45 p.m.: 'Dangerously low' temperatures begin to settle in overnight, expected to continue through Christmas\n\nAs light snow continues to accumulate overnight, \"dangerously low\" temperatures have arrived in Milwaukee and wind chills could reach as low as minus 34 overnight, meteorologist Taylor Patterson with the National Weather Service office in Sullivan says.\n\nMilwaukee currently records a temperature of 8, while Madison is at minus 3.\n\nFriday morning temperatures could be as low as minus 5 in Milwaukee, which could cause frostbite within 10 to 15 minutes and the chance of hypothermia increases.\n\n\"Once you start seeing wind chills in the negative 30s, which is what Wisconsin will experience Friday morning, there is a greater risk for hypothermia and frostbite,\" Patterson said.\n\nTemperatures are expected to stay in the single digits and below freezing throughout the entire Christmas weekend.\n\n\"Once we start to get into early next, so Monday morning, temperatures will climb back into the 20s,\" Patterson said.\n\nAccumulating snowfall will continue overnight but Patterson forecasts only another inch of snow for Milwaukee. However, strong winds could result in blowing snow, reducing visibility.\n\nAccording to the weather service, the parts of the state may have a lot more shoveling yet to do. Most of far northern Wisconsin and Door County could see up to an additional 6 inches of snow, while specifically northern Vilas County may see a foot of heavy lake effect snow.\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\n2:30 p.m.: Snow emergency in city of Milwaukee unlikely at this point, DPW says\n\nThe City of Milwaukee is not expecting any impacts to parking or a snow emergency to be called Thursday based on the latest forecasts of only a few inches of snow at most, according to the Department of Public Works.\n\nThe department asked that residents follow posted signs, including winter parking regulations, and park as close to curbs as possible to allow large salt trucks to pass through the streets.\n\nThose who park on the streets are encouraged to sign up for text message notifications at Milwaukee.gov/Parking.\n\nThe department did not pick up some garbage and recycling Thursday because staff were reassigned to trucks salting the streets. Residents whose garbage and recycling were not picked up should leave their carts at their collection points until they are emptied next week. They should also clear snow and ice on and around the carts and ensure they're accessible.\n\nNo collections or non-emergency services are scheduled Friday through Monday in observance of the holiday.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n2:10 p.m.: Evers declares 'energy emergency'\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers on Thursday signed an executive order declaring an energy emergency across the state as the winter storm hampers delivery of liquid fuel for heating homes and threatens to cause power outages due to factors such as downed trees.\n\nThe executive order waives certain federal and state requirements on those transporting liquid fuel products and supplies or providing other energy emergency response.\n\nThe order \"will allow for the swift and efficient delivery of fuel products, as well as streamlined restoration efforts in the event of significant power outages throughout the state,\" his office said in a statement.\n\nThe Public Service Commission’s Office of Energy Innovation has indicated multiple liquid fuel terminals have limited supplies available to be distributed and utilities have indicated the potential need for response from out of state, the statement said.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n1:45 p.m.: Drop-in warming sites open in Milwaukee\n\nDrop-in warming shelters are available for people without stable housing at St. Benedict the Moor Parish (930 W. State St.) and Repairers of the Breach (1335 W. Vliet St.).\n\nAnyone who sees somebody living outside in these dangerous temperatures should send the location and general description of the person to the Milwaukee County Homeless Outreach Team at outreach@milwaukeecountywi.gov. The team will be doing street outreach from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday and Friday to find people living outside and get them to warming sites.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n1:30 p.m.: Milwaukee Mitchell sees minimal cancellations, delays so far\n\nMilwaukee Mitchell Airport has seen “minimal delays and cancellations so far,” said Stephanie Staudinger, marketing and public relations coordinator for the airport.\n\nSnow-clearing crews are standing by as they wait for snow to begin accumulating, Staudinger said.\n\nAccording to FlightAware, 31 flights coming to or from Milwaukee have been delayed and 19 have been canceled.\n\nIn comparison, Chicago O’Hare Airport has seen over 350 delayed flights and 530 cancellations.\n\nAbout a quarter of Southwest’s flights in Milwaukee are delayed. Delays account for 16% of American Airlines and 12% of Delta’s flights in Milwaukee.\n\nStaudinger urged people to keep in contact with their airlines for updates.\n\nThe airport remains open and operational, she said, despite an incorrect report that it had closed.\n\n– Sophie Carson\n\n1 p.m.: Cold front arriving in southeast Wisconsin as storm reduces visibility on roads\n\nWinds are picking up and temperatures are dropping as a cold front approaches southeast Wisconsin.\n\nNational Weather Service reported that temperatures at its Sullivan office dropped from 25 degrees at 8 a.m. to 5 degrees at 1 p.m.\n\n“There is a band of moderate snow behind the cold front that is reducing visibility to around 1 mile. Winds are increasing out of the northwest, so expect this fresh snow to start blowing and drifting around,” the weather service said.\n\nHere are some recent snowfall total estimates from the weather service:\n\nWisconsin Dells - 3.4 inches\n\nMadison - 2.2 inches\n\nFond du Lac - 1.6 inches\n\nWest Bend - 0.4 inches\n\nHighways across the state continued to be either snow-covered or had slippery stretches, according to the state’s 511 map. A handful of disabled vehicles and crashes could be seen.\n\n12:30 p.m.: UW-Grambling State men's basketball game canceled\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin officials announced the men's basketball game set for Friday night at the Kohl Center has been canceled because of travel issues for Grambling State.\n\nAccording to UW officials, fans should retain their ticket and parking permits, which will be valid if a different opponent can be secured for a future date.\n\nUW (9-2) is set to return to action Dec. 30 against visiting Western Michigan.\n\n11:30 a.m. Marquette University closes\n\nMarquette University is closing at noon Thursday due to the winter storm. Some on-campus services will remain open in a limited capacity, such as the police department and facilities staff.\n\nClasses already ended earlier this month and students are on winter break. The closure affects employees who are typically expected to work on campus. The university directed employees who can work remotely to do so, while others may need to use a vacation day.\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer\n\n10:22 a.m.: Tow ban issued in Outagamie County\n\nThe Outagamie Sheriff's office is urging people to avoid traveling, and issued a tow ban that is expected to last until Saturday morning and perhaps beyond, depending on road conditions.\n\nUnless a vehicle is an \"immediate hazard,\" no cars will be towed from Interstate 41 and or State Highway 441 in Outagamie County.\n\n10 a.m.: Highways across Wisconsin mostly snow-covered, slippery\n\nMost highways and interstates across Wisconsin were either snow-covered or had slippery stretches as of 10 a.m., according to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation's 511 map.\n\nSome stretches of highway were ice-covered, including I-41 near Slinger and I-43 near Port Washington, I-43 in Green Bay, and some highways near Fort Atkinson and East Troy.\n\nHighway cameras around the state showed deteriorating conditions with low visibility and a handful of disabled cars and crashes .\n\n— Sophie Carson\n\n9:45 a.m.: Snowfall totals reported from around Wisconsin\n\nAs snow begins to fall in the Milwaukee area, residents in northern and western Wisconsin have reported overnight snowfall totals to the National Weather Service.

Milwaukee is expected to see 3 to 5 inches, Sheboygan and Fond du Lac will see 3 to 6, and Madison will see 1 to 3.\n\n\"Snow will move through this morning and taper off from west to east through this evening. As the snow is ending, strong winds will develop. Blowing and drifting snow will cause hazardous travel conditions tonight into Friday,\" the weather service said in a statement.\n\n— Sophie Carson\n\n8:50 a.m.: Several Milwaukee County buildings to close at noon Thursday\n\nThe Milwaukee County Courthouse, Vel Phillips Detention Center, and Marcia P. Coggs Building (except the behavioral health mobile crisis teams) will be closed starting at noon Thursday, County Executive David Crowley said in a statement.\n\nThe facilities will remain closed through Friday.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n8:45 a.m.: Several Milwaukee-to-Chicago Amtrak trains canceled\n\nAmtrak canceled several of its Midwest trains through Sunday, including many trains on its Milwaukee-to-Chicago line.\n\nThe Amtrak Hiawatha route is canceled Thursday through Sunday for the following trains:\n\n329, 333, 337, 343 (Northbound from Chicago)\n\n332, 336, 340 (Southbound from Milwaukee)\n\nThe remainder of the Hiawatha trains will remain in operation.

Most of the snow in the storm will occur in this time period.\n\nThe more severe weather threat will be potential blizzard conditions beginning late this afternoon or this evening, caused by strong winds and blowing snow.\n\nWind gusts of 40 to 50 mph tonight and Friday could bring down tree branches.\n\nIt will be combined with a “very sharp drop in temperatures,” the weather service said.\n\nDangerously cold wind chills will begin tonight. At noon, the wind chill in Milwaukee is expected to be 12 degrees. By 3 p.m., it’ll be minus 4. By 7 p.m., it’ll be minus 15.\n\nWind chills will most likely dip the lowest from late tonight through midday Friday, in the range of minus 25 to minus 35.\n\nStill, wind chills of minus 10 to minus 20 are expected through Saturday night.\n\n— Sophie Carson\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\n9:20 p.m.: Snow has began to fall in western Wisconsin; NWS reports 'several' crashes\n\nSnow has began to cover roadways on the western edge of the state, causing crashes.\n\n\"Several accidents and slide-offs have been reported,\" the National Weather Service office in La Crosse said in a tweet.\n\nThe weather service reports that road conditions have deteriorated in La Crosse and that snow will continue to accumulate through the overnight hours. The snow could reduce visibility by up to a mile.\n\n\"Delay or cancel travel plans as necessary tonight,\" the weather service said.\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\n6:25 p.m.: All of Milwaukee's western suburbs announce school closures\n\nA number of communities in Milwaukee County have announced that schools will be closed Thursday, resulting in the beginning of an early winter break for students.\n\nAll of Milwaukee's western suburb public schools will be closed, including Wauwatosa, West Allis-West Milwaukee, Greenfield, Whitnall and Franklin.\n\nThe public school districts in Cudahy and Oak Creek, in the southern portion of the County, also announced they will be closed Thursday.\n\nStudents at Milwaukee Public Schools will not be reporting to school either, as it was a scheduled off day for them.\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\n5:20 p.m.: Winter storm warning issued for northeast, central and northern Wisconsin\n\nThe National Weather Service in Green Bay has issued a winter storm warning for much of northeast, central and northern Wisconsin through 6 a.m. Saturday.\n\nSix to eight inches of snow are expected throughout the region, with more possible in the upper northeast corner of the state and less in eastern Wisconsin along the Lake Michigan shore.\n\nThe NWS continues to expect the bulk of the snow to hit central Wisconsin on Wednesday night and the northern and northeastern areas overnight into Thursday morning.\n\nWhile the snow will taper Thursday, the wind will increase, with gusts between 35 mph and 50 mph.\n\nWind chills could reach minus 20 in central Wisconsin Thursday night, with wind chills Friday throughout the northeast quarter of the state expected to range from minus 10 to minus 30 and will remain there through Sunday morning.\n\n3:55 p.m.: MCTS is prepared to maintain bus service\n\nRepresentatives from the Milwaukee County Transit System said the suspension of bus services is a highly unlikely scenario — though not impossible. However, inclement weather could mean service delays, so riders should dress warmly in case waits are long.\n\n“Sometimes when it’s snowing there are fewer cars on the road and this can actually make driving bus routes safer in those conditions … but we do tell our drivers to drive slower, and this can result in a delayed schedule,” said Anna Schryver, communications manager for MCTS.\n\nSchryver said that riders can track weather alerts and delays in service at ridemcts.com.\n\n—Beck Andrew Salgado\n\n3:30 p.m.: Department of Public Works asks for patience in snow clearing\n\nMilwaukee Department of Public Works officials are asking residents to be patient as staff shortages mean a reduced fleet of snow plow drivers will be on city streets.\n\nAbout 270 people will be working 12-hour shifts, said Jerrel Kruschke, commissioner of public works.\n\n“We’re going to get to every street,” Kruschke said. “There could be a delay in other services.”\n\nLast month, department leaders warned that residents should expect delays in clearing snow and ice, picking up garbage and recycling and other services this winter as the department struggles with a serious staffing shortage.\n\nBecause of the holiday weekend, garbage pickup will not occur Friday through Monday. If garbage pickup cannot be completed Thursday, crews will likely come on Tuesday. Kruschke asked residents to clear snow around their garbage bins.\n\nThe department is also trying to reach residential streets more quickly as opposed to focusing so intensely on main streets. That might involve taking a pass through a neighborhood instead of solely focusing on keeping the biggest roads pristine, he said.\n\n“We’re going to do a lot of experimental things just to give people access to those arterials,” Kruschke said.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Alison Dirr\n\n3:20 p.m.: Several Milwaukee County buildings to close Friday\n\nSeveral Milwaukee County buildings will be closed on Friday — and potentially Thursday — due to the winter storm.\n\nThe Milwaukee County Courthouse, Vel Phillips Detention Center, and Marcia P.

Rooney has declared a snow emergency in the city of Racine from 6 p.m. Thursday to 6 a.m. Saturday.\n\n\"The National Weather Service is predicting a significant snowfall during this period of time,\" Rooney said in a statement.\n\nThere will be no parking allowed on any of Racine's arterial or collector streets. For all other streets, alternate side parking will be in effect from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. Vehicles parked in violation will be ticketed and subject to towing, Rooney said.\n\nTo see which streets are in effect visit cityofracine.org/SnowEmergency.\n\n—Drake Bentley\n\n2:50 p.m.: It's officially a winter storm warning, starting 9 a.m. Thursday\n\nThe National Weather Service in Sullivan has officially issued a winter storm warning for southeastern Wisconsin, including Milwaukee County, beginning 9 a.m. Thursday and extending to 6 a.m. Saturday.\n\nThe winter storm warning extends from the Illinois border to Sheboygan, west to the border with Iowa and Minnesota and north to Superior.\n\nMost of northeast and central Wisconsin, including Green Bay, Appleton and Wausau, were not under the warning. There, a winter storm advisory is in effect.\n\nWhat exactly constitutes a 'blizzard'? What about a 'winter storm watch'? Here are some weather terms to know\n\nForecasts call for 3 to 6 inches of snowfall during the storm, coupled with dangerous winds and freezing temperatures, falling to around 7 degrees for most of Thursday with wind chill values between minus 5 and minus 15, then between minus 20 and minus 30 overnight. Winds could gust as high as 30 mph during the day then as high as 50 mph starting overnight and into Friday.\n\nFriday's high temperature will be merely 3 degrees, with regular winds around 30 mph, creating blowing-snow hazards. Friday night's low will reach minus 2 degrees, with winds maintaining their ferocity and tapering off only slightly into Saturday, down to 25 mph and 40 mph gusts.\n\n— JR Radcliffe\n\n2:10 p.m.: Wisconsin State Patrol urges travelers to rethink travel plans, use 511\n\nTim Carnahan, superintendent for Wisconsin State Patrol urged the public to \"seriously reconsider\" their travel plans on a state Department of Transportation media call Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Don't underestimate this storm,\" Carnahan said. \"The conditions are such and the temperatures are such that things like salt are going to be, in many cases, ineffective — it is just too cold. The wind would blow the salt off the road anyway. My best advice is seriously reconsider whether or not you're going to travel.\"\n\nHow to keep safe if you have to drive, travel in Wisconsin during a winter storm\n\nRandy Hoyt, the DOT's Traffic Management Center supervisor, recommends that people pay close attention to the 511 app or website for updates on road conditions. He also advises travelers to pay attention to electronic road signs.\n\nHoyt said he anticipates the western and northern parts of the state to be the most impacted by Thursday's storm, with wind gusts affecting high-profile vehicles like semis and box trucks. He urged drivers to keep a safe distance from these larger vehicles.\n\nHoyt and Carnahan both emphasized that drivers should be extra prepared while traveling, just in case they get stuck or stranded. That includes dressing extra warmly in the car, even if you don't think layering up is necessary for an hour-long car ride. Drivers should also travel with an emergency kit containing blankets, extra gloves and hats, coats, water, snacks and a phone charger.\n\nDrivers should expect to find themselves in whiteout conditions, Carnahan said, and underscored the importance of pulling over or getting off at the next exit if you're not comfortable on the roads. No holiday party is worth risking the safety of you or your loved ones, he said.\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\n2 p.m.: Friday likely will be worst day for air travel, Green Bay airport director predicts\n\nAirports may not seem bad now, but Marty Piette, airport director of Green Bay Austin Straubel International Airport, said he anticipates Friday to be the worst day for air travel.\n\nHe strongly recommends flyers with scheduled flights out of the Green Bay airport to request travel waivers now, if they have the flexibility in their plans to do so. Waivers can be used to schedule flights at a later date without changing fees or additional charges.\n\n\"What really impacts the aircraft upon landing and arrival is the visibility,\" Piette said. \"That's really our biggest concern with Friday, because it will be that drier snow, there's going to be snow on the ground. And when the winds pick up, the visibility is reduced. So that's why we're really watching Friday a little more closely.\"\n\nPiette said that customers should also be mindful about their inbound flights. If you're expecting to make a connecting flight to the East Coast, consider that this is also the direction the storm plans to travel, too. And the storm's wants and whims will always win out.\n\n\"It's hard to predict. It just depends on what the weather systems are at any given time,\" Piette said.\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\n1:30 p.m.: Milwaukee mayor Cavalier Johnson says 'Stay at home'\n\n1 p.m.: Some UW campuses cancel exams\n\nSome University of Wisconsin System campuses canceled final exams scheduled for the end of this week to allow students time to get home for the holidays before the winter storm hits. In most cases, instructors will contact students about alternative arrangements, such as an online test format.\n\nUW-La Crosse, UW-Superior, UW-Green Bay, UW-River Falls and UW-Eau Claire canceled many in-person exams scheduled for Wednesday evening, Thursday or Friday. Some schools are encouraging employees to consider working remotely Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"For students, we really want them to be able to focus all their energies on their exams and not be worried about what this storm means for their ability to get home,\" said Kathleen Burns, UW-Green Bay provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs. \"We wanted to be proactive, and give people some time to plan and also some peace of mind.\"\n\nIt's the first time UW-Green Bay has moved online for the final exam week due to weather, Burns said, and it potentially sets a precedent for future weather events. UW-Milwaukee announced Wednesday that in-person exams scheduled for 3 p.m. or later on Thursday are canceled. Exams earlier in the day will take place. Residence halls, as usual, will remain open during winter break.\n\n\"The university understands that this causes disruption for students and instructors, but the safety of our campus community — including students who will travel far distances to get home — comes first,\" a UWM statement to students and staff.\n\nUW-Madison is forging ahead with the last day of finals scheduled on Thursday. In a Tuesday statement, officials wrote that \"based on currently available information, the university will be open for normal operations,\" including final exams ending Thursday and open for business on Friday.\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer and Natalie Eilbert\n\n11:50 a.m.: Milwaukee airport crews ready for snow removal\n\nMilwaukee’s Mitchell International Airport has all snow removal crews working 12-hour shifts to ensure that flights flying in and out of the airport are minimally interrupted.\n\n“As an airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin you are always working to prepare for the snow, so all year we’ve had our teams practice dry runs to be ready for winter weather,” said Stephanie Staudinger, public relations coordinator for the airport.\n\nThe decision to delay or cancel a flight is ultimately up to the individual airlines. The only situation in which the airport would cancel flights would be if snow forced it to close.\n\nIf you have plans to fly out of Mitchell in the coming days, Staudinger recommends consistently contacting your airline to be best prepared for changes.\n\nA TSA spokesperson also recommends that passengers arrive at the airport no later than two hours before the flight’s departure.\n\n— Beck Andrew Salgado\n\n11:30 a.m.: Milwaukee officials urge people to prepare for outages, check on neighbors\n\nMilwaukee-area officials on Wednesday urged residents to prepare for power outages and to avoid traveling in the coming winter storm and deep freeze.\n\nA trifecta of snow, strong winds and low temperatures will \"wreak havoc on our infrastructure,\" said Joshua Parish, assistant chief of the Milwaukee Fire Department.\n\nWinds gusts of 45 to 55 mph could knock down trees, which could fall into power lines.\n\nWe Energies has all available crews working through the week, and it has put out a call for help from other utility companies around the country. Spokesman Brendan Conway asked people to be patient if they lose their power, as crews will be working in difficult conditions.\n\n\"We're prepared for it, we have a plan in place and we're going to respond as quickly and safely as we can,\" Conway said. \"Our crews out in the field, it's going to be incredibly cold for them and they're going to take extra precautions, so it could take a little bit longer.\"\n\nMatt Cullen, a spokesperson for Wisconsin Public Service, recommended people download the WPS or We Energies app to easily report outages.\n\n\"That is a key step in our process because it helps us better pinpoint the specific area where an outage has occurred,\" Cullen said.\n\nCullen also emphasized the importance of checking the natural gas meters and appliance vents for any buildup of snow or ice. This type of interference can trap carbon monoxide indoors and create a hazardous situation.\n\nMilwaukee officials asked residents to check on older neighbors and others who are most vulnerable to extreme cold. They include infants and young children, those using alcohol or drugs and those with mental health issues or those without adequate shelter.\n\nOfficials provided additional guidance on how to remain safe.\n\nDo not use your oven to heat your home.\n\nBe mindful of space heaters.\n\nHave enough food and water on hand for a few days in case of a loss of power.\n\nKeep electronics such as cell phones and medical devices fully charged in case of a loss of power.\n\nKeep warm blankets and clothing on hand.\n\nKeep a full tank of gas in your car.\n\nIn case you are stranded while driving, prepare an emergency kit for your vehicle that includes a snow shovel, warm clothing, blankets and snacks.\n\nWith wind chills as low as minus 35, frostbite can occur within minutes, said Nick Tomaro, emergency preparedness director of the Milwaukee Health Department. The signs of frostbite include numbness, stinging and aching. The signs of hypothermia are shivering, drowsiness, clumsiness and confusion.\n\nSigns of carbon monoxide poisoning include headaches, nausea, disorientation and can result in seizures, comas respiratory failure and death.\n\nMultiple street outreach teams are checking on people who are living outside, said Rafael Acevedo, a city official who oversees outreach to the homeless population.

The Department of Labor said it is ending in-person service at the Crump Senior Center because of health and safety concerns related to the coronavirus. The last dates for such service will be Monday and Tuesday. Appointments for those days will be available on the ADOL website www.labor.alabama.gov. Claimants can call (800) 361-4524 beginning Sunday after 5 p.m. until midnight on Sundays through Thursday to schedule a call-back for the next day to set up an appointment. Claimants are encouraged to keep their phones near them for their scheduled call-back, the department said. The calls will come from a Montgomery number. State officials have struggled to keep pace with a staggering number of unemployment claims spurred by the pandemic.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: A remote village has received its first delivery of the coronavirus vaccine by boat after it traveled through choppy waters during a storm that prevented air travel. The journey allowed first responders in the village of Seldovia (population 430) to receive the Pfizer vaccine for the virus, The Homer News reported. Usually, nurses and nurse practitioners from the SVT Health & Wellness Center in Homer travel weekly by air to Seldovia to help with health care in the village. But on Dec. 17, poor visibility meant a small boat was needed to transfer a crew of four medical personnel and the vaccines to the village about 250 miles south of Anchorage. Capt. Curtis Jackson, owner and operator of the boat, said conditions were rough with up to 4-foot waves and “pretty poor” visibility. The crew, which included a nurse, two nurse practitioners and a medical assistant, traveled for about an hour across Kachemak Bay, usually a 30-minute trip, said Jackson, a captain for Mako’s Water Taxi. “That little blue box was the best Christmas present a tired boat captain could ask for, my friends,” Jackson said in a post on Facebook. “This might be the start of what’s getting to be better and better news. It’s pretty emotional.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Arizona residents should show empathy and kindness to help ease each other’s burdens in the face of the pandemic and other troubles, the state’s top education official said. Economic and social hardships encountered by many people in 2020 left them exhausted, isolated and frustrated, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman wrote in a commentary published Saturday by the Arizona Republic. “Act as if the person you are speaking with just lost a job, a home, a loved one, a future. Act as if they are scared, or lonely, or tired to their bones,” Hoffman wrote. In education, teachers faced challenges getting the internet to work for their students and their own children, and school board members were worn down by painful decisions amid concerns about the well-being of students, Hoffman wrote. Meanwhile, she wrote, Arizona’s pandemic death toll has topped 8,000 people. “Each loss represents a valued member of our communities, and in some cases, our schools,” she wrote. Hoffman shared that the pandemic has affected her personal life, including when COVID-19 mitigation strategies meant she couldn’t be with her father when he was hospitalized for acute heart failure and then had a successful heart transplant. Also because of virus mitigation measures, her husband couldn’t be at her side when she heard that news, “I became one of the many Americans who learned to cope with loss in isolation, sharing our heartbreak over text messages and calls instead,” she said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Coronavirus hospitalizations in Arkansas fell Saturday but remained near their recent record high as state health officials reported more than 700 news cases and three more deaths linked to the disease. The Department of Health said there were 1,059 Arkansas residents hospitalized Saturday, a drop of three from the day before. The state record was set Wednesday, when there were 1,110 patients hospitalized with the disease. There were 660 newly confirmed coronavirus cases and 42 more probable cases Saturday, according to the department. Health officials have warned holiday gatherings and travel are likely to further spread the virus. Over the last seven days, more than 18% of coronavirus tests in Arkansas have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Health inspectors and authorities stepped up enforcement at restaurants and shopping malls over the post-Christmas weekend as they seek to curb a coronavirus surge that has filled some hospitals in California well beyond normal capacity. Crowding at Los Angeles County shopping malls came under scrutiny before the holiday. Several of them were cited and fined up to $500 for violating COVID-19 measures, which could include not keeping occupancy below 20% capacity and not prohibiting eating and drinking, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Health officials were waiting to see whether people followed their pleas and avoided Christmas and New Year’s festivities that could lead to a new round of infections and threaten to extend stay-at-home orders in several regions of the state. Beverly Hills police halted a plan for a secret New Year’s Eve dinner at La Scala after the Italian restaurant circulated invitations to a “discreet” meal that would violate the county’s ban on indoor dining. In Sonoma County in California’s wine country, a Native American casino announced it was canceling a planned private New Year’s Eve indoor event that could have drawn as many as 4,000 people. The Graton Resort and Casino is on sovereign native land that isn’t subject to state or county health orders, but it had come under scrutiny for the event.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: About 120 black-footed ferrets, among the most endangered mammals in North America, were injected with an experimental coronavirus vaccine aimed at protecting the small, weasel-like creatures rescued from the brink of extinction four decades ago. The effort came months before U.S. Department of Agriculture officials began accepting applications from veterinary drug makers for a commercial vaccine for minks, a close cousin of the ferrets. Farmed minks, raised for their valuable fur, have died by the tens of thousands in the U.S. and been culled by the millions in Europe after catching the coronavirus from infected humans. Vaccinating such vulnerable species against the disease is important not only for the animals’ sake, experts said, but potentially for the protection of people. Some of the most pernicious human diseases have originated in animals, including the new coronavirus, which is believed to have spread from bats to an intermediary species before jumping to humans and sparking the pandemic. For the newly vaccinated ferrets, the main risk is to the animals themselves. They’re part of a captive population at the National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center outside Fort Collins, where there have been no cases of COVID-19 to date. But the slender, furry creatures – known for their distinctive black eye mask, legs and feet – are feared to be highly vulnerable to the ravages of the disease, said Tonie Rocke, a research scientist at the National Wildlife Health Center who is testing the ferret vaccine. They’re all genetically similar, having come from a narrow breeding pool, which weakens their immune systems. And they likely share many of the features that have made the disease so deadly to minks. “We don’t have direct evidence that black-footed ferrets are susceptible to COVID-19, but given their close relationship to minks, we wouldn’t want to find out,” Rocke said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Residents, businesses and landlords are getting a three-month grace period on taxes because of the COVID-19 pandemic – but how much they will end up paying will depend on where they live. In some towns, the tax deferment will be interest-free and in others it will come with a lowered interest rate. Whether taxpayers need to apply for the deferment also varies from town to town, the Hartford Courant reported. The tax deferments apply to real estate, motor vehicle and personal property taxes. Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order in the spring instructing towns to defer July tax payments for three months at zero interest or lower the interest to 0.25% monthly. He recently extended the order to cover tax payments due Friday. Taxpayers applying for the deferment must show their household had an income loss of at least 20% because of the pandemic. Businesses must show their expected revenue will decrease at least 30% during the deferment period. Hartford and numerous towns in Hartford County are offering interest-free deferment, the newspaper reported, while Berlin and Enfield are offering a lowered interest rate. Windsor will give the deferment automatically, town tax collector Cathleen Eliot told the Courant, and South Windsor will require an application. The state Office of Policy Management website contains a list of towns and their policies.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:For the first time in three months, the daily number of people hospitalized because of complications of COVID-19 in Delaware has dropped for three straight days – a welcomed development as officials in Delaware and elsewhere brace for what could come next following the end-of-year holidays. As of Friday night, 400 people statewide were being treated in a hospital for their coronavirus symptoms. That’s down from 454 on Dec. 22; 426 on Dec. 23; and 404 on Dec. 24 – an overall drop of 12% over three days. It’s the first time the daily number has dropped for three straight days since a four-day stretch ending on Sept. 24, when just 53 people in Delaware were hospitalized. The dip in hospitalizations comes while thousands might have spent the Christmas holiday traveling and at family gatherings and religious services. “Although we would like to be encouraged with the downward trend of hospitalizations, we are concerned that a similar increase after Thanksgiving can be seen with Christmas/New Year’s,” Division of Public Health spokeswoman Jen Brestel said in an email Saturday. “Hospitalization is also a lagging indicator, so we may see a change weeks after any trends in new positive cases.” Cases in Delaware were mounting before Thanksgiving, but the post-Thanksgiving surge saw the average seven-day daily case count climb from 469 cases on Thanksgiving to a peak of 823.7 three weeks later on Dec. 16. That number has decreased to 621.4 through Friday, a day when the state reported 798 new cases.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Because of the pandemic, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception was forced to use tickets and advanced registration for the first time for its Mass on Christmas Day, WUSA-TV reported. The purpose of the ticketed admission was to limit the number of people attending. Attending Mass on Christmas is a tradition for many families in the D.C. area, and also acted as a tool for others to help fill a void this year. “My sons weren’t able – I asked them not to come out of safety. So, I came here to sort of fill myself up,” Trish Earnest told WUSA9. Parishioners believed it was necessary to be in church as they near the end of a trying year. “The spiritual part of it, it was really special because we could, even throughout everything, we were really grateful that we could still come out and to celebrate Jesus and Christmas,” Eve Muir said. With capacity limits and other COVID-19 restrictions, the ceremony was not one would typically expect. “They made sure everyone was far away from each other, and using hand sanitizer, and keeping their masks on,” Earnest said. “But it was a beautiful service.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Some South Florida counties have put into place a short-term curfew over the holidays to discourage the spread of the coronavirus. Broward County officials said last week that businesses would have to shut down from midnight to 5 a.m. over the holidays – with the exception of Christmas Day and New Year’s Day, when the curfew starts an hour later. “Christmas and New Year’s holidays are known for large gatherings,” Broward Mayor Steve Geller told mayors during a conference call. “We are expecting a spike in cases here.” The temporary curfew, from Christmas to Jan. 4, is meant to stop people from moving around and gathering for parties. Midnight Mass and travel to and from work are exempt, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Miami-Dade County already has a curfew from midnight to 6 a.m. Key West, home to one of the nation’s most high-profile New Year’s Eve celebrations with its drop of a drag queen in a super-sized red high heel shoe, also has implemented a holiday curfew. Visitors and locals who are not working at an essential business must be home or in their hotel rooms or vacation rentals by 10:30 p.m. starting Thursday and ending at 6 a.m. Sunday. All nonessential businesses must close from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., according to the Miami Herald.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: With coronavirus infections spiking across the Sunbelt, the latest White House Coronavirus Task Force report warned that Georgia will soon see more fatalities as cases and hospitalizations climb. “This surge must be met with aggressive public mitigation inclusive of safe public options, like outdoor dining,” said the most recent report, dated Dec. 20. “And clear personal behavior change messages to ensure as many Americans as possible can survive to be immunized and protected from severe disease and fatalities over the ensuing weeks.” More than nine out of 10 Georgia counties have moderate to high rates of spread, and 83% of the state’s counties are in the red zone. The task force said Georgia ranked 26th, or in the middle nationally, for new cases, and 18th for test positivity. Two weeks ago, Georgia ranked 47th, or fifth-best out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, for new cases. In the previous week’s report, the state ranked 41st in new cases. Georgia’s worsening ranking appears to reflect not only a rise in infections but also the addition of cases detected by rapid antigen tests. The recent inclusion of antigen cases provides a clearer picture of Georgia’s status as more states add these “probable” cases to their official counts. But it’s unknown how many states still do not report antigen cases.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Roughly 20% of Honolulu’s 4,500 first responders have received the Moderna coronavirus vaccine, city officials said. Hiro Toiya, the city’s emergency management director, said that 936 first responders received their shots Tuesday and Wednesday. Honolulu Police Department officers represented 649 of the vaccines, 173 vaccines were given to firefighters with the Honolulu Fire Department and 114 vaccines were distributed to paramedics, emergency medical technicians and lifeguards with the Department of Emergency Services. Between 60% to 70% of first responders are expected to receive the voluntary coronavirus vaccine, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. “It’s the best Christmas present we could give to ourselves, to our island, to our state, to our country and to the world and this planet,” Mayor Kirk Caldwell said. “And the City and County of Honolulu has made a commitment to get all of its first responders vaccinated, if they want to be vaccinated.” Caldwell said he would not receive the vaccine with the state’s first responders. The mayor said he would wait his turn and stand in line with other seniors after his term runs out in a few weeks. Police Chief Susan Ballard, Fire Chief Manuel Neves and Emergency Services Director Jim Howe were were vaccinated last week.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Vaccinations for about 10,200 residents and staff at 75 Idaho long-term care facilities will begin Monday, officials said. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokeswoman Niki Forbing-Orr told the Idaho Press that most of Idaho’s 315 long-term care facilities will receive the vaccine from CVS Health Care and Walgreens through the Pharmacy Partnership organized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “What we have been hearing from residents is, ‘We just want our life back, we want our families to visit, to play cards with our friends,’ ” said Zendi Meharry, the director of clinical operations at Cascadia Healthcare, a group that runs several skilled nursing facilities in Idaho. Residents and workers at long-term care facilities are in the first group scheduled to get vaccines. That group also includes front-line health care workers. About 130,000 people are in that group.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new proposal filed earlier this month would allow state lawmakers to meet and vote remotely in emergency situations. Chicago Rep. Ann Williams and Sen. Robert Martwick, both Democrats, call it a launching point for discussions on how to meet going into 2021 amid the ongoing pandemic, according to a joint statement. The Legislature last met in person in May to approve a budget, taking social distancing measures. However, Martwick said he has a preexisting condition which puts his health at risk. Under the bill, members of the General Assembly could meet remotely for session and committees if a joint proclamation is made by the House speaker and Senate president. The plan calls for members of the public to be able to watch sessions and committee meetings in real time. “The intent of the legislation is to provide for the very rare circumstances where it is extremely dangerous or impossible to meet,” Williams said in a statement. “It’s clear that the Legislature operates most effectively in person, when we can all meet and interact with each other more easily.” Earlier this year, the Senate adopted rules that allowed lawmakers to participate remotely if there’s a quorum present. A similar plan failed in the House.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:A federal judge has denied a request from more than a dozen Indianapolis bars and nightclubs to overturn coronavirus restrictions they said disproportionately impact bars and other age-regulated establishments. In her ruling, U.S. Southern Indiana District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson acknowledged the difficulties bars are facing during the pandemic but said the bars involved in the lawsuit \"have not presented a legal basis\" to overturn the orders restricting business. Bar owners in their complaint filed in September alleged Marion County's public health orders unfairly restrict bars because of the age of their patrons and the products they sell. The complaint said the county has imposed stringent closure times despite capacity restrictions, adding that Marion County's coronavirus regulations are stricter than elsewhere in the state. Bar owners involved in the suit called the court's decision a \"disappointing setback\" but said they plan to file an appeal Monday.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: Commercial flights will resume at the Dubuque airport next month. Airport officials recently announced that American Airlines plans to restore service to the airport on Jan. 6. The airline suspended flights out of Dubuque in October after cutting its flight schedule there several times in the spring as airline traffic plummeted because of the coronavirus pandemic. “The return of air service marks a significant milestone in the continued recovery from COVID-19,” said Molly Grover, CEO of the Dubuque Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A northeast Kansas county is moving jury trials to a building on its fairgrounds to allow for better social distancing amid the pandemic. The Lawrence Journal-World reported that the plan is for jury trials in Douglas County to resume Jan. 11 at the Flory Meeting Hall. Chief Judge James McCabria said the jury selection room can safely seat up to 30 people at a time in addition to the judge, parties and court staff. Trials that need larger jury pools will bring in panels at staged intervals. Because court proceedings will be livestreamed on YouTube for public access for the time being, prospective jurors will not be addressed by name, but by number. Trials will be held on the other side of the collapsible wall that divides the meeting hall in half. The space is large enough that the 14 chairs of the jury box can be distanced from one another. Witnesses who testify will wear plastic face shields instead of masks so that jurors can see their faces. “We believe anyone who participates in the process should feel safe with the distancing and other protocols that are in place,” said George Diepenbrock, a spokesperson for Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Kentucky reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Saturday, adding 14,999 new cases. That's down 24.6% from the previous week's total of 19,904. Kentucky ranked 24th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. In the latest week, the U.S. added 1,327,043 reported cases of coronavirus, a decrease of -12.3% from the week before. Across Kentucky, cases fell in 91 counties, with the best declines in Pulaski, Jefferson and Boone counties.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: Mayor Friday Ellis has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to city spokesperson Michelli Martin. In a statement, Martin said Ellis self-quarantined at the onset of symptoms late Tuesday night. His rapid test came back positive Wednesday afternoon. Ellis described his symptoms as mild, and close contacts have been notified. The mayor was at the Tuesday meeting of the City Council, and people considered close contacts at the meeting were also notified. Social distancing guidelines were adhered to Tuesday night and have been practiced by the City Council throughout the pandemic. Ellis urged citizens to continue mitigation efforts and thanked front-line workers for their “unwavering efforts to help residents fight this virus.” Council Chair Doug Harvey previously tested positive for the coronavirus and returned to council meetings Tuesday. Harvey expressed appreciation for everyone who checked on him while he was sick.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Schools across Maine are reporting dips in academic performance during the coronavirus pandemic. Standardized test scores in Gorham dropped by 10 percentage points or more in some subjects, and Biddeford High School reported a nine-point increase in course failure rate in year’s first quarter, the Portland Press Herald reported. The lower scores in Maine schools reflect broader trends across the country. Maine educators are looking for strategies to help get students back on track during a difficult time for learning. “It doesn’t come as a shock,” Biddeford High School Principal Martha Jacques said. “Obviously we’re disappointed and we want all kids to succeed, but we’ve also had a group of students that have been out of traditional education for six-plus months by the time they came back to school this fall and the nature of a hybrid model is very different than what they’re used to with an in-classroom model.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: With the pandemic aggravating mental health concerns, Sean Driscoll, a peer support specialist at the University of Maryland Medical Center’s Department of Psychiatry, said he focuses on steering people to resources that can help. “It’s OK to talk about your problems,” said Driscoll, who also writes songs to raise awareness about mental health issues under his stage name, Driscoe. “It’s OK to confide in people and to trust, and it’s OK to feel.” With COVID-19 cases surging and a difficult winter expected, state and local officials as well as health care professionals are taking steps to raise awareness about getting help during a time of rising mental health concerns, particularly during the holiday season when the problem can become more acute. Dr. David Marcozzi, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who is a senior medical advisor for COVID-19 to Gov. Larry Hogan, heightened attention on mental health during the pandemic when he spoke about the suicide of a longtime friend during a news conference last month. “Let’s make sure we reach out,” he said. “Let’s make sure we support each other and talk to a professional if helpful.” Maryland has seen a 30% increase in calls so far this year to the state’s 211 crisis hotline, said Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, who chairs a state commission on mental health. The lieutenant governor has been leading the panel since early last year.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: New restrictions designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus took effect in the state on Saturday. The new rules state that most industries in Massachusetts are now subject to a 25% capacity limit. The new restrictions apply to restaurants, casinos, office spaces, houses of worship, retail businesses, libraries and many other kinds of businesses and public spaces. Indoor gatherings are also now limited to 10 people at private homes, public places and events. The administration of Republican Gov. Charlie Baker also said all hospitals are directed to postpone or cancel all nonessential inpatient elective invasive procedures. That restriction is intended to increase capacity at the hospitals.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Bridget McCormack wants judges and other court staff to be among the second wave of people to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the state, saying vaccinating them quickly would keep courts open and slow the spread of the virus. McCormack made the request in a Dec. 8 letter to Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive and chief deputy director of the Department of Health and Human Services. McCormack asked that judges and court workers who are still performing work in person at Michigan’s courthouses be among the “essential workers” to get the COVID-19 vaccine in the second tier of vaccinations. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has identified “workers supporting the operations of the judicial system, including judges, lawyers, and others providing legal assistance” as essential critical infrastructure workers, she noted. Michigan health officials expect to receive 120,900 doses of COVID-19 vaccines during each of the next two weeks. The FDA has authorized vaccines from pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna for emergency use.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Minnesota reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Saturday, adding 11,910 new cases. That's down 38.1% from the previous week's total of 19,237. Minnesota ranked 43rd among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. Sunday's report included 2,335 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 40 new deaths, including one in the tri-county area. Stearns County added 57 new cases Sunday and reported one death of a resident in their late 80s, Benton County added 16 cases and Sherburne County added 47 cases. Across Minnesota, cases fell in 83 counties, with the largest declines in Hennepin, Ramsey and Dakota counties.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Mayor Andrew “Fofo” Gilich told WLOX-TV this week that he’s “about 80%” sure he will cancel Mardi Gras parades in Biloxi in 2021 because of concerns about the coronavirus. “Right now, it’s not looking too promising,” he said. Gilich said he will make a call on the event before the new year. “We aren’t going to do another super-spreader event,” he said, noting that health professionals have attributed some of the current increase in cases to larger gatherings around Thanksgiving. One of the Mississippi Gulf Coast’s largest Mardi Gras parades is hosted by the St. Paul Carnival Association and is among those that have cancel for 2021. Also canceled is the North Bay Mardi Gras parade, which usually takes place in St. Martin and D’Iberville. The Krewe of Nereids and the cities of Bay St. Louis and Waveland announced earlier this month they were canceling the Nereids’ Parade. Biloxi’s Second Liners Marching Club also announced it would not hold its annual parade. “You’ve got until the 16th, and that’s when the parades will roll, and I just don’t see a trend where we’re below 1,000 hospitalizations in that number of days,” Gilich told WLOX. “I don’t think it’s going to break anyone’s heart that we would rather be safe than sorry.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Missouri set a record for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 on Christmas Day as the pandemic surges. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that there were 2,862 patients hospitalized statewide, eclipsing the record of 2,851 set on Nov. 18. Hospitalizations have remained high in the past month. Meanwhile, the seven-day average for new cases is 2,213 each day, according to data posted Saturday on the state health department website. With the virus present at such elevated levels, county officials are urging caution. “It is here, it is spread in the community, and we’ve got to make sure that that spread slows,” said St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark Kern. “Our fates are in our own hands, and really, it’s not difficult to wear that mask.”\n\nMontana\n\nWolf Point: In a typical year, Native American youth die by suicide at nearly twice the rate of their white peers in the U.S. Mental health experts worry that the isolation and shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could make things worse. “It has put a really heavy spirit on them, being isolated and depressed and at home with nothing to do,” said Carrie Manning, a project coordinator at the Fort Peck Tribes’ Spotted Bull Recovery Resource Center. It’s not known what connection the pandemic has to the youth suicides on the Fort Peck reservation. Tribal members typically lean on one another in times of crisis, but this time is different. The reservation is a COVID-19 hot spot. In remote Roosevelt County, which encompasses most of the reservation, more than 10% of the population has been infected with the coronavirus. The resulting social distancing has led tribal officials to worry the community will fail to see warning signs among at-risk youth. So tribal officials are focusing their suicide prevention efforts on finding ways to help those youth remotely. “Our people have been through hardships and they’re still here, and they’ll still be here after this one as well,” said Don Wetzel, tribal liaison for the Montana Office of Public Instruction and a member of the Blackfeet Nation. “I think if you want to look at resiliency in this country, you look at our Native Americans.”\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Officials in central Nebraska are worried that next spring’s sandhill crane viewing season will be disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic just like this year’s was and hurt the area’s economy. The annual migration of sandhill cranes across central Nebraska usually draws thousands of visitors to the area who want to see the birds gather along the Platte River in the midst of their annual migration. Kearney Visitor Bureau Executive Director Roger Jasnoch told the Kearney Hub that there is little demand for the hotel rooms in the area that visitors usually fill. And the conferences, weddings and other events that help generate business for hotels and event centers have also disappeared. Jasnoch said the area is “still losing events as far out as next June. The first quarter (of 2021 business) has evaporated.” The pandemic has taken a toll on tourism in the area. Jasnoch said that revenue from lodging and occupation taxes is down 30% from July 1 to December, reflecting the drop in demand. Before the pandemic began, the 2019 crane viewing season was disrupted by significant flooding in the area, so next year could be the third year in a row of problems during the crane migration.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Unemployed Nevada residents were bracing for the end of some federal coronavirus relief benefits on Saturday. The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programs were set to expire after President Donald Trump held off on signing a stimulus package presented to him by Congress. The new package would have extended the benefits for at least 11 more weeks for gig workers, self-employed people and those who have exhausted their regular unemployment claims.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Most of the recent confirmed cases of the coronavirus in New Hampshire are in Rockingham and Hillsborough counties, the state Department of Health and Human Services said. The department reported more than 1,000 new positive test results for the coronavirus on Saturday. “Community-based transmission continues to occur in the State and has been identified in all counties,” the department said in a statement. “Of those with complete risk information, most of the cases are either associated with an outbreak setting or have had close contact with a person with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Beginning this week, United Airlines travelers to Newark Liberty International Airport from the United Kingdom will have to show a negative coronavirus test. Gov. Phil Murphy and United Airlines announced Thursday that the restriction take effect Monday. United travelers with flights originating in the U.K. will have to present proof of a negative test obtained within 72 hours of departure. The restriction doesn’t apply to travelers originating from outside the U.K. who connect to a Newark-bound flight at London's Heathrow Airport. Passengers can take a same-day, rapid test at Heathrow. The measure is being taken to curb the spread of a new strain of the coronavirus that has surfaced in the U.K. “As we continue to experience a second wave of COVID-19 cases, it’s critical that we take any and all precautions to mitigate the potential for further transmission,” Murphy said in a statement. United said it is operating four daily flights this month from Heathrow to Chicago, Newark, Washington and San Francisco. Next month, it will operate two daily flights to Newark and Chicago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico has begun providing COVID-19 vaccinations to 15,000 people who work or live at long-term care facilities, state officials said. Beginning Sunday, the CVS and Walgreens pharmacy chains and Vida Pharmacy in Albuquerque administered doses of the Moderna vaccine at nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the state, officials said. “Sunday marks a monumental day in our fight with this deadly pandemic. It signifies a step toward protecting our seniors and securing their safety,” said Katrina Hotrum-Lopez, cabinet secretary of the Aging and Long-Term Services Department. The statement noted that people receiving vaccinations will need two doses from the same manufacturer administered several weeks apart. The pharmacies will send staff to facilities three times over the coming months to administer the vaccines. Dr. Tracie Collins, Department of Health cabinet secretary, said people who have been vaccinated can still carry and transmit COVID-19, so it’s important that they continue to wear masks and take other precautions such as washing their hands and distancing.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State police and health officials were investigating Saturday whether an Orange County health care provider violated state guidelines in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said in a statement that his office and state police were investigating Parcare Community Health Network in Orange County. Zucker said he received reports that Parcare might have fraudulently obtained the vaccine and diverted it to other facilities to be given to members of the public. The state has prioritized front-line health care workers, long-term care residents and staffers to receive the vaccine first. The first vaccine in the state was given to a critical care nurse in Queens on Dec. 14. “We take this very seriously and DOH will be assisting State Police in a criminal investigation into this matter,” Zucker said. “Anyone found to have knowingly participated in this scheme will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Parcare lists four locations in Brooklyn, one in Manhattan and one in Monroe, Orange County on its website. In an emailed statement, the company said it would cooperate with the investigation and that it “has a long history of partnering with the city of New York to provide vital healthcare services to New Yorkers who need them most – including providing COVID-19 testing – especially for New Yorkers in medically underserved communities who’ve been hardest hit by COVID-19.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A North Carolina health care system said it is delaying COVID-19 vaccinations scheduled for next month after a controversy arose over who would get the initial round of doses. Atrium Health said up to 97 vaccination appointments set for January have been canceled, The Charlotte Observer reported. The action followed a report by several Charlotte television stations which cited a tweet by Atrium social media manager Katie McKiever saying she had scheduled her first vaccine appointment for early January. According to guidance published in October, health care workers and medical first responders should get the vaccine first. “The key is to get those most at risk and those who are on the frontlines risking their lives for the community. We get the vaccine to them so they can care for those who need it as others are waiting,” said Dr. Scott Rissmiller, Atrium’s executive vice president and chief physician executive. Atrium also said it has revised its internal plan for vaccine distribution to exclude nonfront-line health care workers from the first phase.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The North Dakota Army National Guard on Saturday began providing rapid coronavirus testing to people arriving at Hector International Airport in Fargo. The tests were being offered for free to people on arriving flights to catch new infections from spreading in the community. The tests are expected to take 15 minutes to give a result. Over the last two weeks, North Dakota has seen a 68% decline in the average number of new cases reported each day. An average of about 199 new cases was reported each day over the last week. The Department of Health reported 133 people had tested positive during testing completed Friday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Another 5,857 Ohioans have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Ohio Department of Health data recorded Sunday. That number is well below the three-week average of 9,310 cases a day, but weekend numbers generally fall off. Sunday's cases bring the statewide total to 670,525 since the pandemic began. Another 33 deaths were recorded on Sunday, also below the three-week daily average of 74. Total deaths in Ohio stand at 8,509. The number of hospitalizations rose by 273 on Sunday, which is less than the three-week average of 360. Total hospitalizations have reached 36,786. The state reported 30 additional intensive-care admissions on Sunday; the latest three-week average for ICU admissions is 39 people a day.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health authorities have reported more than 2,600 news cases of COVID-19 over the last two days as well as 13 more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The State Department of Health said the new counts from Saturday and Sunday bring the state totals to 279,139 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,370 fatalities. There were 2,458 new cases Saturday and 173 cases Sunday, according to the department. The 13 new deaths were reported Sunday. Over the last seven days, more than 15% of coronavirus tests in Oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland:The Department of Agriculture said among animals captured during wildlife surveillance recent tests confirmed mink at a farm that tested positive for the coronavirus in late November are now clear of the virus. KOIN reported the department conducted two rounds of follow-up tests, 14 days apart, to document the animals’ recovery. The first follow-up testing occurred on Dec. 7, with only one of 62 animals testing positive for barely detectable levels of the virus. With the second round of testing on Dec. 21, there were no signs of the virus among all 62 tested, indicating the mink population on the farm had recovered. One more round of testing will be conducted before releasing the quarantine, per federal guidelines. Scientists with USDA Wildlife Services, under the direction of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, are continuing to conduct wildlife surveillance near the farm, which entails trapping and testing animals.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWashington Crossing: Washington Crossing Historic Park said it filmed an annual reenactment of George Washington’s crossing of the Delaware River on Christmas morning earlier this month because of the pandemic. A video of the reenactment is available online at YouTube. The Park said the reenactment provided a “close-up view” of the event it called “a beloved community tradition that will continue for years to come.” Crowd-size restrictions barred holding the Revolutionary War reenactment in the “traditional, in-person manner,” organizers said. Usually, thousands gather every Christmas morning on the banks of the river in Washington Crossing and Titusville, New Jersey, to watch historical reenactors set out in boats to retrace the daring 1776 voyage of Washington and his troops. Last year, the crossing was completed for the first time in three years with what the Friends of Washington Crossing Park said was probably a record crowd of 4,500 to 5,000 looking on. The crossing had been scuttled during the previous two years, first by high wind and then by high water levels. Other activities at the annual event include Washington’s address to his troops, historical speeches and processions, and staff in period clothing providing public interpretation. In the original crossing, boats ferried 2,400 soldiers, 200 horses and 18 cannons across the river. Washington’s troops marched 8 miles downriver before battling Hessian mercenaries in the streets of Trenton. Thirty Hessians were killed, and two Continental soldiers froze to death on the march.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has awarded the Rhode Island Department of Health more than $3 million to help with expenses that resulted from the coronavirus pandemic. The federal agency said the money was provided “for various supplies which included personal protective equipment, mortuary-related supplies for the state’s five refrigerated trucks and supplies for contracted personnel to assist with staging and relocation of hospitalized COVID-positive elderly patients statewide.” Regional administrator and federal coordinating officer Capt. Russ Webster said FEMA plans to keep helping Rhode Island “meet its long-term goals to recover stronger, safer and smarter.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Teacher vacancies in South Carolina are up 26% compared to last year, according to a new study. The findings lead teacher advocates and public education officials to say the coronavirus pandemic is worsening the state’s teacher shortage. The State newspaper reported that school districts counted 699 teaching and service position vacancies at the start of this school year compared to 555 at the beginning of the prior academic year. The findings come from an annual report by the Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention and Advancement. Education officials said vacancies can lead to larger class sizes, more classes taught by long-term substitutes, and some specialized classes not being offered. Advocates also said the teacher exodus could mean problems for the state’s long-term recruitment and retention of teachers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Wildlife officials said South Dakota’s outdoor recreation economy boomed in 2020, providing much-needed sales in several business sectors, as well as hopes of reversing a long-term decline in the number of licensed hunters and anglers. The state waived entry fees and did not collect visitor information for almost two months at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Even so, state park visitation in 2020 has been roughly 31% higher than it was in 2019, said Al Nedved, deputy director of the South Dakota Game Fish and Parks Department’s parks division. “It was pretty evident early on that the outdoors were going to be a place where people could exercise or just relax or whatever they like to do and do it safely,” Nedved said. For the first time in several years, hunting and fishing license sales to state residents increased in South Dakota. Together, resident hunting and fishing license sales rose 6.7%, and roughly one-quarter of 2020 licenses were sold to hunters or anglers who had not bought a license since at least 2017, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported. Meanwhile, classes on everything from archery to plant identification have been filling up quickly when staff at the Game, Fish & Parks Department Outdoor Campus in Sioux Falls post them online, said campus director David Parker.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The Tennessee Department of Health reported two days worth of coronavirus data on Saturday after not releasing data on Christmas. In those 48 hours, there were 14,395 cases, 9,230 of which were attributed to Friday's case count and 5,165 for Saturday's. To date, there have been 560,892 cases of the coronavirus reported in the state. So far, 5.48 million tests have been given. Tennessee confirmed 12 new deaths, five of which were attributed to Friday's case count and seven for Saturday's. In all, 6,443 people have died as a result of the virus.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Dennis Bonnen, the outgoing speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, said Sunday that he has tested positive for the coronavirus following his wife becoming sick last week. Bonnen wrote on his Facebook page that he was diagnosed over the weekend. The Republican said his symptoms have so far been mild and that his family is in quarantine. Bonnen said his family celebrated Christmas alone out of concern of spreading the virus and that it’s unknown how they were initially exposed. Bonnen’s positive test comes as coronavirus hospitalizations are hovering near their summer peak in Texas, even amid holiday gatherings and travel that health officials have warned are likely to further spread the virus. “This disease is no joke in its unpredictability and severity, so please continue to keep your guard up and your loved ones protected,” Bonnen wrote.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Utah reported fewer new coronavirus cases in the week ending Saturday, adding 15,108 new cases. That's down 11.9% from the previous week's total of 17,149. Testing has changed around the holidays, making comparisons difficult. Labs and testing sites closed. People traveled or prepared for the holidays instead of getting tested. Some counties and states didn't report data as quickly. Across Utah, cases fell in six counties, with the best declines in Salt Lake, Utah and Davis counties.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermonters can now follow the progress of the state’s efforts to vaccinate the population against the virus that causes COVID-19 on a new dashboard on the website of the Health Department. The dashboard, which went live Wednesday, will provide information on the number of people who have been vaccinated and how many people have completed the two-shot series of vaccines needed to have immunity against the virus. It will also show the rates of vaccination by age, sex, race and ethnicity. As of Thursday, just under 4,400 people had received the first dose of one of the two vaccines being administered in Vermont. The state expects to receive a total of about 34,000 doses of vaccine by the new year. Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said that initially, the dashboard will be updated weekly, on Wednesdays, but as progress is made in the state’s vaccination campaign, it could be updated more frequently.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: New figures from the Department of Corrections showed that two inmates and one staff member who tested positive for the coronavirus have died in recent days. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the figures posted Friday showed that overall, 41 inmates and two staff members who had tested positive have died. That’s up from Dec. 21, when the department said were 39 inmates and one staff member who had died. The department did not immediately release details about the recent deaths. There are about 25,000 inmates in Virginia and the department has about 11,000 staff members. About 7,000 inmates have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee said last week he will extend a state ban on evictions to March 31. Inslee’s office did not offer more details on the moratorium extension, saying that more information would be available this week. “COVID-19 has had a significant financial impact on Washingtonians over the last nine months,” Inslee said in a statement. “I know this moratorium has been critical for many families and individuals as they cope with the impacts of this virus. People need certainty about whether the moratorium will be extended, and it is important that I provide that certainty today while we work out the final details of the moratorium.” Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan also extended the city’s eviction moratorium through March 31.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice reported that nearly half of his state’s stock of COVID-19 vaccines has been administered. But the promising news was tempered by the governor’s announcement on Christmas Day that 55 more West Virginians had died from the disease. During a press briefing Friday, the governor described, one by one, the latest people who had succumbed to the pandemic. “Not good, not good,” he said. By Saturday, that number had climbed further – with deaths now surpassing 1,250, according to state health officials. Earlier in the week, Justice said he expects West Virginia to complete within three weeks all vaccinations at hospitals, health departments and long-term care facilities. During his Christmas Day announcement, the governor reported that the state’s vaccination rate, about 47%, was the highest of any state. He said 28,623 of the 60,875 total doses delivered to West Virginia to date have been administered.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Officials said Dane County has secured a six-month extension of a program linking local growers with food pantries that was set to expire at the end of this year. The program began in April with the help of about $8 million of the county’s federal coronavirus relief funding. More than 4,000 hours of service have been logged to help those experiencing hardship and hunger, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. County Executive Joe Parisi said last week that a $5 million agreement has been reached with Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin to continue the program through at least the end of July. Many people facing job losses have turned to food pantries for meals. Requests for food from Second Harvest has increased more than 50% since last year, the nonprofit’s leader said last month.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Health care workers at Cody Regional Health have been challenged by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been struggles with obtaining masks and other protective equipment, workers getting sick, and rising numbers and longer stays in the intensive care unit. They have pushed through them all. “The things the employees have done here and the department leaders to care for the patients of this community, everybody has just gone above and beyond,” chief clinical officer Keith Ungrund told The Cody Enterprise. Ungrund said the hospital has had 10 to 15 people out per week because they contracted the virus or were in close contact with another person who did. That crunch on staffing has led to occasional cancellations of elective surgeries – those procedures that aren’t immediately life-threatening but must still be done. The staffing challenges have also meant some health care workers are being cross-trained to ensure there is coverage in the ICU. It has been a total team effort, Ungrund said. And despite a recent push for longer hours and more overtime to have the people they need in the building, morale isn’t lacking. “They are a strong team of caregivers that take care of each other very well,” said Barbara Mullaney, a nurse and the head of the acute and critical care units. “We ensure that we are rounding on them routinely to ensure they are getting breaks and they have what they need. We are so proud of our team and they are doing their best to stay upbeat and positive.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/11/23/covid-cases-college-age-new-york/6357362002/", "title": "How 1 in 6 COVID cases in NY hit college-aged people this fall.", "text": "College-aged people accounted for about 16% of New York’s coronavirus positive tests in September and October after many campuses reopened, the biggest age-related chunk of COVID-19 cases at the time.\n\nThe newly reported statistic, covering COVID-19 infections among 18- to 22-year-old people, offered the first statewide glimpse of the virus’s spread on New York college campuses, some of which struggled to curb party fueled outbreaks.\n\nNow, college students are fanning out to return home for the holidays and authorities are striving to prevent them from spreading the virus to older Americans more vulnerable to the respiratory disease.\n\n“With the holidays approaching, we are fighting living-room spread from small gatherings in private homes and adding college students' interstate travel will be like pouring gasoline on a fire,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last week.\n\nThe comments came as governors in Northeast states urged all colleges and universities to offer COVID-19 tests to students before they left campus for Thanksgiving break, a precaution previously required of the State University of New York’s 64 campuses.\n\nWhat experts say about college students, COVID risk\n\nThe dire effort to safely clear college campuses underscored health officials' mounting concerns about COVID-19 deaths hitting record highs in the U.S., surpassing 250,000 deaths overall last week, by far the most in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, after limiting the virus’s spread this summer, New York’s COVID-19 cases have risen recently and hospitalizations topped 2,300 on Friday, the highest level since early June but far below the spring peak of nearly 19,000.\n\nNew York’s daily death toll also surpassed 30 recently, which is up from the summer but well below the 800 people killed each day during the peak.\n\nExperts anticipate the virus will keep spreading among older New Yorkers in coming weeks and cost lives, despite improved medical treatments for COVID-19, robust testing and travel restrictions.\n\nMore: COVID is threatening NY hospitals. Will elective surgeries stop again? What to know\n\nMore: As COVID-19 surges, NY health care leaders concerned about repeat of PPE shortages\n\nBut convincing people to forgo holiday gatherings and follow COVID-19 precautions, such as mask wearing, will still be integral to limiting the severity of the suffering as the nation awaits delivery of an eventual vaccine, said Dr. Robert Amler, dean of New York Medical College School of Health Sciences and Practice\n\n“People have done so well by and large so far, and it would really be a shame if large numbers of us kind of got tired and weren’t doing these things when we’re so close to being able to turn the corner on this once we can get vaccinated,” he said.\n\nExperts, including scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have also expressed concerns about the ability of COVID testing to limit risks associated with college students returning home for the holidays, as well as plans for resuming the spring semester.\n\n“Properly timed tests can be very useful in the right circumstances. But to test large numbers of people on a certain day and then watch them all leave for large parts of the country and have them come back and test them again, I’m afraid we just can’t time it right,” Amler said.\n\nWhy elderly, communities of color remain at higher-risk of COVID-19 deaths\n\nAmid the effort, coronavirus cases have also surged to an all-time high at nursing homes across the country despite government efforts to shield residents through aggressive testing and visitor restrictions, a recent report shows.\n\nFederal data shows 10,279 COVID-19 cases in nursing homes during the week of Nov. 1, the most recent data available. The figures surpassed the previous high of 9,903 cases in late July, according to a report by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living.\n\nWhile COVID-19 ravaged New York nursing homes this spring, the number of cases among frail and elderly residents most susceptible to the illness declined during the summer, only to begin ticking up again this fall.\n\n“The trend continues that age is very strongly correlated with death from COVID-19,” said Jill Montag, a state Department of Health spokeswoman, adding underlying health conditions that often track along with age are also a major factor.\n\nMore: New York, New Jersey limiting private gatherings to 10 people. How will it be enforced?\n\nMore: School nurses are on New York's COVID-19 frontlines.

The invasive species known as Burmese pythons.\n\nTo help combat this problem for Florida’s ecosystem, snake hunters are congregating in the hundreds for the Florida Python Challenge. The event, created by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, started in 2013.\n\n“I love snakes. I hate that we have to do this, but they’re invasive and changing the entire ecosystem.” professional python hunter Amy Siewe told CNN.\n\nAccording to the commission, these reptiles were detected as early as 1979 in Florida.\n\n“They were introduced to Florida through accidental and intentional release through the pet trade,” a spokesperson with the commission told CNN on Friday.\n\nSince then, they’ve killed and continue to pose a major threat to wildlife.\n\nThe event brings hundreds of professional snake hunters to the Everglades to hunt and kill the reptiles. As of Friday, more than 850 people had signed up, the commission said.\n\nThomas Aycock explores the Everglades as he hunts Burmese pythons in 2020's challenge. Marco Bello/Reuters\n\nAugust 5 marked the start of this year’s 10-day challenge.\n\nTo participate, members were required to take an online training course and pay a $25 registration fee.

Since 2000, more than 17,000 pythons have been removed and reported, according to the commission.\n\nMichael Kirkland, a biologist with the South Florida Water Management District, told CNN that pythons have been “decimating wildlife for years.”\n\n“The challenge is designed to remove as many pythons from the area as possible,” he said, “Human detection and removal are the most efficient and effective tools in the toolbox right now,”\n\nContractors hired with the water management district work year-round and participate in the challenge to capture the creatures.\n\nKirkland said there has been up to a 90% decline of animals in the area due to pythons.\n\nDonna Kalil has been hunting pythons professionally since 2017. She's killed more than 670 since then. Courtesy Donna Kalil\n\nA full-time job\n\nAmong the many partaking in the challenge this year are Siewe and Donna Kalil.\n\nKalil told CNN he has been professionally hunting the reptiles since 2017. Siewe was hired in 2019.\n\nCombined, the two have killed more than 1,000 pythons – Kalil at more than 670 and Siewe at close to 400.\n\nThey share a love for the creatures but understand the importance of this challenge. “The hunters are the best way we have at this moment to help with this problem,” Siewe said.\n\nKalil grew up in Florida and said when she went to the Everglades as a kid there were “so many rabbits you couldn’t count them all.” Fast forward to the 2000s when Kalil said there were practically no rabbits, possums or raccoons as a result of the pythons.\n\nIn last year’s challenge, Kalil took home the $2,500 prize for removing the most pythons at 19. She’s been participating since 2013.\n\nThis will be Siewe’s third year. In her first year, she won second place for heaviest snake.\n\nThe two will base their hunting on factors like weather, time of day and sleep schedule. “This time of the year, the nighttime is best to go out,” Kalil said.\n\n\"I love snakes. I hate that we have to do this, but they're invasive and changing the entire ecosystem.\" Amy Siewe told CNN. Courtesy Amy Siewe\n\nAnd hunting doesn’t come easy.\n\nThroughout her career, Siewe has suffered from many python bites and said she doesn’t recommend it.\n\n“It’s like a warm knife going through butter,” Siewe described. Pythons, while not venomous, have hundreds of teeth that are razor sharp, according to Siewe.\n\nThe creatures can grow to massive sizes and it’s a feat to take them on. Siewe said her largest capture measured 17 feet and 110 pounds, which she caught standing 5 foot 4.\n\nKalil shares that you can’t catch them all. “I’ve had four get away from me during my career,” she said. “It can be difficult during the night in the water and weeds.”\n\nFlorida Gov.

Daniel Kim/The Seattle Times/AP In pictures: Winter storm impacts the US Prev Next\n\nIn all, more than 200 million people in the US were under wind chill alerts from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and from Washington state to Florida, with below-zero wind chills expected in the Southeast by Friday. Other winter weather alerts are in effect for blizzard conditions, ice, snow as well as flooding.\n\n“The National Weather Service’s Watch Warning graphic depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” the agency said Thursday.\n\nRecord cold Christmas Eve for many\n\nNotably, parts of Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have already seen wind chills below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the past two days.\n\nThe entire state of Texas was seeing temperatures below freezing by early Friday afternoon, according to weather observations from around the state.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned residents about the “epic, statewide hazard” of winter weather.\n\n“I called it a kitchen sink storm because it is throwing everything at us but the kitchen sink,” Hochul said at a press conference Friday afternoon. “We’ve had ice, flooding, snow, freezing temperatures, and everything that mother nature could wallop at us this weekend.”\n\nFor Brian Trzeciak, the storm was “living up to the warnings” at his home in Hamburg, New York. Buffalo’s airport, just to the north, reported zero visibility shortly after noon on Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions, frigid temperatures, and the waves are like what you would see during a hurricane,” he told CNN.\n\nHe and his family decided to cancel their Christmas plans because of the dangers from the storm.\n\n“My mother lives about 30 minutes away and so does my sister and her family, in the other direction,” he said. “We always get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas, but we’re all hunkering down in our houses until it all stops on Monday.”\n\nDriving bans are in place in Erie, Genesee, Niagara and Orleans counties in Western New York because of whiteout conditions.\n\nAs many as 250 people could be stranded in their cars in Erie County in a situation that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said put first responders at unnecessary risk. Brown told CNN Friday night that forecasts call for 36 to 48 inches of snow. The area has had wind gusts of 79 mph.\n\nMany will experience a cold holiday unlike any other: Atlanta, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Tallahassee, Florida, are all forecast to have their coldest high temperature ever recorded on December 24, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWashington DC is forecast to see its second coldest Christmas Eve, only behind 1989. In New York, it will be the coldest Christmas Eve since 1906. Chicago is expecting temperatures to rebound above zero, but will still experience its coldest Christmas Eve since 1983.\n\nMuch of Florida will experience the peak of their cold on Christmas Day. It will be coldest Christmas Day since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nStorm expected to become ‘bomb cyclone’\n\nCars drive in whiteout conditions in Orchard Park, New York on Friday. Mark Mulville/The Buffalo News/AP\n\nOn Friday, the storm unleashed more heavy snow and blizzard conditions, particularly in the Midwest.\n\nAs it treks east across the country, the storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone,” a rapidly strengthening storm which drops 24 millibars of pressure within 24 hours. The storm’s pressure was forecast to match that of a Category 2 hurricane as it moved into the Great Lakes on Friday morning.\n\nGovernors in at least 13 states, including Georgia and North Carolina in the South, have implemented emergency measures to respond to the storm. Declarations of a state of emergency in several states have included the activation of National Guard units.\n\nMore than 5,500 Friday flights have already been canceled as of 9:30 p.m. ET, after nearly 2,700 cancellations on Thursday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\n• It will remain very cold: Friday will bring record-low temperatures in large swaths of the US, including from the Lower Mississippi Valley, northeastward into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and stretching across large sections of the east from the Southeast, through the Southern to Central Appalachians and into the mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n• Dangerous wind chills: The plummeting temperatures will be accompanied by high winds, which will create dangerous wind chills across nearly all the central to eastern US.\n\n• Blizzard warnings: The Upper Midwest will see frigid temperatures, heavy snow and high winds. The warning applies to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Michigan. Buffalo, New York, will go under a blizzard warning Friday morning. Such warnings go in effect when snow and wind of 35 mph will reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile for at least three hours.\n\n• Whiteout conditions: Blizzard conditions may exist even if snowfall stops, because high winds can pick up snow already on the ground and cause low visibility.\n\nSeparate storm system in Pacific Northwest\n\nA separate storm system is bringing heavy mixed precipitation to the Pacific Northwest on Friday.\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for western Washington, including Seattle, until 7 p.m. PST Friday. Additional snowfall of up to 2 inches is possible and ice accumulations could reach a quarter of an inch. Precipitation will begin as snow and transition to sleet/freezing rain and then finally to rain. More power outages are likely and travel will be made very difficult.\n\nThe ice caused the closure of runways at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where nearly half of flights going into and out of the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware. Further, all express services for Sound Transit, a regional transportation network in the Seattle metro area, were suspended Friday due to the icy conditions.\n\nA winter storm warning is also in effect for northeastern Oregon, including Portland, from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST. Total snow and sleet accumulations of up to one inch and ice accumulations of .2 to .4 inches is likely as well as winds gusting to 55 mph. Wind chills as low as zero are possible, and frostbite is possible on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nOne of the biggest dangers of the massive winter storm besides heavy snow and blizzard conditions is the rapid drop in temperatures over a short period of time. The air will continue to get and feel colder, especially during night hours.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Ray Sanchez Eric Levenson", "Aya Elamroussi", "Ray Sanchez", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/us/florida-panhandle-wildfire-monday/index.html", "title": "Florida Panhandle wildfires: Thousands of acres near Panama City ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith nearly 1,100 homes evacuated, firefighting crews continue to battle several dangerous wildfires across three counties in the Florida Panhandle, officials said.\n\nThe most prominent blaze, the Bertha Swamp Road Fire, expanded over the weekend and was at 14,000 acres Monday evening, up from 9,000 on Sunday, with just 10% of it contained, according to a news release from the Florida Forest Service.\n\n“The fire continues to show extreme activity as steady winds push the fire through thick, dry, and dead trees and vegetation left behind from Hurricane Michael,” the statement said.\n\nThe fire, which originated in Gulf County, has spread into neighboring Bay and Calhoun counties just east of Panama City, a popular tourist destination, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis expanded a state of emergency Saturday to include all three counties.\n\n“Right now, the main focus is, of course, is getting the fire contained, but we are marshaling assets and we will provide whatever the folks here in northwest Florida (need),” DeSantis said Saturday.\n\nThere is no timeline as to when residents will be allowed to return home, according to a release from the Florida Forest Service.\n\nAnother fire even closer to Panama City, the Adkins Avenue fire in Bay County, was 50% contained and all evacuation orders had been lifted by Monday, FFS said. Two homes have been destroyed and 12 more were damaged by the blaze.\n\nMuch of the activity on the #BerthaSwampRoadFire is occurring near where the center/eye-wall of #HurricaneMichael traversed. There still remains a lot of blowdown timber from Michael in these areas. #FLwx #ChipolaComplex pic.twitter.com/kK3mtxTz2p — NWS Tallahassee (@NWSTallahassee) March 6, 2022\n\nDamage from a 2018 hurricane was hampering the firefighting.\n\nHurricane Michael was a Category 5 storm and “left 2.8 million acres of trees broken, uprooted,” state Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services Nikki Fried said Saturday.\n\n“The blowdown timber from Michael makes it very difficult to fight wildfires in our area,” Bay County Emergency Services said in a statement. “Fires that would normally be contained quickly grow rapidly as there is so much fuel on the ground.”\n\nMore materials arrive to combat the flames\n\nAdditional resources have been brought to the area to combat the fires, DeSantis said, noting some first responders had suffered injuries.\n\n“We’ve got four National Guard air assets: two Black Hawks and two Chinooks. They are working, and they have a positive impact,” DeSantis said Sunday. Crews have dropped more than 103,000 gallons of water on the Adkins Avenue fire since Friday, officials said.\n\n“Firefighters and emergency personnel are working around the clock to help fire suppression efforts, including seven aircraft,” Bay County Emergency Services said on Monday afternoon.\n\n“Additionally, a strike team of heavy bulldozers is focusing on building fire lines and defensible space around the communities near Bear Creek,” the agency said.\n\nThe situation on the ground remains dynamic and changes are called for very quickly, Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said Sunday.\n\n“Last night, we had to initiate an evacuation in the area of Bear Creek that was due to the fire up there moving closely. We’ve had to initiate some additional evacuations today due to a fire in the area of Tram Road,” Ford said, adding crews are “still fighting that as we speak.” The evacuation order remained in effect late Monday.\n\nFord said the Bay County Jail is “not in immediate danger, but we do have a very robust plan in place” and will have buses on “standby should that (evacuation) become necessary.”\n\nAn additional fire in the area, the Star Avenue Fire, was at 250 acres Monday and 60% contained. A veterans nursing home in the area had been evacuated because of it, FFS said, but all evacuations have been lifted.\n\nNo houses or other structures were damaged by the Star Avenue Fire, according to the agency.\n\nInvestigators are working to determine the cause of the fire and a burn ban has been issued for Bay County. There are currently 160 wildfires burning more than 18,500 acres throughout Florida, FFS said.", "authors": ["Raja Razek Travis Caldwell", "Raja Razek", "Travis Caldwell"], "publish_date": "2022/03/07"}]}
