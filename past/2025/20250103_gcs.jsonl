The Coalition for Delaware’s Kids wants to change this.\n\nRead more:Coalition says $55M in extra revenue should fund Delaware's neediest kids\n\nTo this end, on Dec. 5, the Coalition announced its plan to use the more than $50 million in assets that the state suddenly holds.\n\nThe Coalition includes community leaders, government, and religious organizations, including: Network Delaware, the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League, the Delaware Attorney General’s Office, the Delaware PTA, the United Way, and many others. We are urging the creation of a four-year “Hope Trust” to increase support for the state’s children most affected by poverty.\n\nEditorial:Until budget is fixed, be careful with spending promises\n\nKey points of the trust include:\n\n● Home visitation programs for infants and toddlers in low-income homes: Delaware used to lead the nation in enacting the Nurse Family Partnership Program, but in recent years the program has been drastically reduced. The Coalition proposes that the state use $10 million to greatly expand aid to children of first time, low-income mothers.\n\n● Expanded Pre-K enrollment for 3- and 4-year-olds: Nationally, 43.1 percent of 4-year-olds are enrolled in Pre-K programs. In Delaware, it is only 21.4%. The Coalition suggests the state spend $10 million to expand pre-school enrollment through the Early Childhood Assistance Program.\n\n● Increased financial support for high-poverty elementary schools: A small number of elementary schools in Delaware educate a very high percentage of children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The Coalition advises the state to issue $10 million in grants to the ten elementary schools where 70% of students live below the poverty line.\n\n● Expanded after-school and summer programs for low-income students: after-school and summer programs that provide a structured and safe environment outside of regular school hours have many benefits. Sadly, there are few such programs for kids from low-income homes that cannot afford to pay enrollment fees. The Coalition wants the state to use $10 million to dramatically expand the grant program for after-school and summer programs, with a special focus on programs for students twelve and older.\n\n● Improved re-entry services for juveniles leaving the correctional system: Delaware’s juvenile repeat offender rate is extremely high – nearly 80% of kids who spend time in correctional facilities commit new crimes upon release. The Coalition urges the state to spend $10 million in grants to non-profit organizations that provide cognitive behavioral therapy and family-centered programs.\n\n● Addressing juvenile substance abuse: Delaware’s opioid crisis involves many high school-aged kids. The Coalition recommends that the state spend $2 million to provide the initial operating costs for a recovery high school.\n\n● Use of the Centers for Disease Control’s data sharing plan: The CDC has recommended that Delaware take advantage of its data systems to provide broad-based, early help to Wilmington youths who might later become violent offenders. The Coalition proposes that the state spend $2 million to establish CDC’s data system.\n\nBy providing quality programs and services, the ill effects of childhood adversity can be eased, and in some cases avoided completely. The state has the chance to ensure that more of Delaware’s children have the continual support they need in order to thrive. By adopting the plan of the Coalition for Delaware’s Kids, the state can begin to lessen the impact of poverty and help the state’s most vulnerable residents.\n\nAndrea Swan lives in Wilmington, is a social worker and co-coordinator for Coalition for Delaware’s Kids.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/letters/2022/05/12/letters-what-do-columbus-ohio-residents-think-abortion-ban-roe-wade-supreme-court-pro-life/9729161002/", "title": "Letters: My mom already birthed two babies 'another one was more ...", "text": "Letters to the Editor\n\nNote from Opinion Editor Amelia Robinson: News of a leaked draft of a Supreme Court decision that would overturn Roe v.

This fight for basic human rights has been turned into a political debate and women are surrounded by people who are trying to control their body.\n\nIf a woman is raped and becomes pregnant and cannot support the baby, abortion is a way to help the woman.\n\nWhat if a woman is ill and her life becomes threatened if she were to proceed with the pregnancy? Well, abortion is a way to save her life. If the baby had life-threatening illnesses and won’t survive birth, abortion is a way to relieve the baby of this pain. This is not a political fight, this is a fight of basic human rights.\n\nMore:Letters: Jean Schmidt wants to keep women 'barefoot, pregnant' in the kitchen\n\nThere are many easy ways you can help save abortion rights and help fight for this cause.

Wade the U.S. Supreme Court will unleash a wave of pontification from people who claim to be pro-life. The issue is clearly defined. Who should decide whether a fetus should be carried to term—politicians or women with unwanted pregnancies?\n\nIt’s easy to claim that a fetus’ heartbeat means that a viable being exists. However, being pro-choice does not make anyone pro-abortion. There is far more to life than simply being born. A child deserves more than a life in an orphanage.\n\nBecause of the Supreme Court’s ruling, millions of unwanted children will be born and placed for adoption or in facilities for babies with serious mental or physical defects. How many pro-life people will be willing to adopt them? Time will tell but wise people will be skeptical of pro-lifers’ willingness to practice what they preach.\n\nDick Graham, Worthington\n\nShare your thoughts:How to submit a letter to the editor for The Columbus Dispatch\n\nMother need help not choice\n\nSo much is written about the possible repeal of Roe.\n\nLook at what is written and the pictures of those opposing this.

News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — Nearly four dozen family members and friends of the two women murdered in the New Castle County Courthouse in 2013 let out a sigh of relief Thursday after the shooter’s adult children were sentenced to life in prison on federal cyberstalking charges.\n\nThe group packed a federal courtroom in Wilmington for the sentencing of David Matusiewicz, 48, and Amy Gonzalez, 43. Their intention was to impress upon the judge the serious danger faced by the public and the three daughters of Matusiewicz and his deceased ex-wife if life sentences were not handed down.\n\n“The Matusiewiczes will never stop until they have my sisters,” Katherine Moffa, the older half-sister of the three girls, said in an emotional plea to the judge. “Please make them go away so we can get the justice we deserve.”\n\nMemories linger one year after Del. courthouse shooting\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Gerald Austin McHugh heard those pleas — and, while giving both defendants the maximum sentence, said childhood should be a time of innocence and security.\n\n\"Punishment of these defendants, severe punishment, was absolutely warranted,\" Acting U.S. Attorney David Weiss said. \"This was the only way that the court was able to protect the Matusiewicz children and anyone else who happened to draw the ire of the Matusiewiczes.\"\n\nThis case marked the first time in the United States that a defendant was convicted and sentenced under the federal cyberstalking resulting in death statute.\n\nThursday’s sentencing stemmed from a heinous double murder that rocked the legal community and the state.\n\nOn Feb. 11, 2013, Thomas Matusiewicz shot and killed his ex-daughter-in-law, Christine Belford, and her friend, Laura \"Beth\" Mulford, as they walked into New Castle County Courthouse for a child support hearing. Thomas Matusiewicz exchanged gunfire with police before killing himself.\n\nAfter the shooting, prosecutors accused Thomas Matusiewicz’s widow, Lenore Matusiewicz, and two children of waging a vicious campaign to harass and stalk Belford and their daughters in the three years leading up to her death. Federal prosecutors have pointed to a web of emails, letters and other correspondence that attacked Belford’s character and accused her of sexually abusing their oldest daughter, a fact the government, judge and eldest daughter said was not true.\n\n“In the process, they shattered lives,” Weiss said. “They left permanent scars in this community.”\n\nA Delaware jury found the three guilty in July of various charges, including cyberstalking, conspiracy and interstate stalking. The legal standard for doing so was somewhat untested.\n\nTo find the defendants’ guilty of cyberstalking resulting in death, the jury didn’t have to find that the family knew of Thomas Matusiewicz’s killing plan, only that they could have reasonably foreseen, based on their own conduct, that Thomas Matusiewicz, considered a co-conspirator, would shoot Belford.\n\nAttorneys for all three defendants have maintained that none knew of his plan.\n\nMcHugh, in handing down the sentence on Thursday, said that while David Matusiewicz likely foresaw the courthouse murder, Amy Gonzalez had no deliberate intent of murder but should have been aware of looming violence that was going to occur.\n\nGonzalez, who the prosecution has characterized as the “propaganda director” for the harassment and stalking conspiracy, was sentenced to life in prison despite that difference.\n\nBefore hearing her fate, Gonzalez stood before the judge and offered a tearful apology to the victims. The former nurse from Texas asked for mercy for her, her husband and their 10-year-old daughter.\n\n“My heart goes out to all of [the victims],” she said. “I cry for them every day and pray for them every day.”\n\nShe said she only wanted the best for her nieces, but should have let law enforcement investigate her “suspicions” of child abuse, rather than harassing Belford via the Internet.\n\nMcHugh said he “anguished” over the sentencing of Gonzalez, but ultimately found that she was “inextricably interwoven” in the offenses and lacks the moral compass to ever be let out of prison.\n\n“I hope you will continue to pray for these children and their futures,” he said.\n\nDavid Matusiewicz, wearing a green prison jumpsuit, decided not to speak at his sentencing but provided the judge with a written statement.\n\nHis attorneys, Edson Bostic and Dina Chavar, told The News Journal after the sentencing that they will file an appeal on his behalf soon.\n\nLenore Matusiewicz, who is terminally ill, was sentenced to life in prison last Friday at an emergency, bedside hearing at a hospital in Philadelphia. Her attorney has already filed notice of appeal.\n\nBecause this is the first conviction for cyberstalking resulting in death, the case could be heavily litigated on appeal in the coming years.\n\nThe Matusiewicz family's saga began in 2006 when David Matusiewicz, a Newark optometrist, and Belford divorced. The ensuing bitter custody battle over their three children took an unusual turn when David and Lenore Matusiewicz took the girls on what was supposed to be a two-week trip to Disney World in 2007.\n\nThey instead headed to Central America, leading to a year-and-a-half-long international manhunt that finally ended when they were found living in a mobile home in the tiny Nicaraguan village of Catalina.\n\nThe girls were returned to the United States and reunited with Belford. David and Lenore Matusiewicz pleaded guilty to their roles in the kidnapping and were sentenced to prison.\n\nFederal prosecutors have accused David Matusiewicz of launching the family's campaign against Belford from his prison cell in 2009.\n\n“Christine Belford had no chance, zero chance,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jamie McCall. “They literally suffocated her.”\n\nSix months after David Matusiewicz was released from prison, he and his parents traveled from Texas to Delaware for a child support hearing with Belford at the New Castle County Courthouse, where the shooting occurred.\n\n“This was the place … that people come to peacefully resolve their disputes,” Weiss said. “The Matusiewiczes used this place, as Judge McHugh noted, as a bait, as a lure. They chose this as the place they would carry out the execution.”\n\nWeiss said he hopes the life sentences will provide some comfort to Belford’s daughters. Many noted during the sentencing that for their protection they have been isolated from all of their friends and family, including their half-sister Moffa.\n\n\"This is not a victimless crime by any means,\" McHugh said.\n\nFollow Jessica Masulli Reyes on Twitter: @JessicaMasulli", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/20/paid-parental-leave-state-workers-passes-delaware-general-assembly/718469002/", "title": "Paid parental leave for state workers passes Delaware General ...", "text": "State workers scored a victory Wednesday when the Delaware General Assembly approved a bill granting them 12-weeks of paid family leave.\n\nThe Senate voted 16 to 4 to provide what remains a relatively rare benefit in the United States. The House passed the bill earlier this month.\n\nThe measure now heads to Gov. John Carney, who opened the year by pledging his support for the bill. He and his wife Tracey also recently penned a column on the subject for Mother's Day.\n\nCarney on Tuesday said women will make up a large portion of the state's new hires as a large portion of the state's workforce reaches retirement age.\n\n\"This benefit will be great for those women, great for us in terms of attracting them and great for the babies and children as well,\" he said. \"It's the right thing to do for families, it's the right thing to do for the women who work for the state of Delaware and it's the right thing to do for our state.\"\n\nThe passage of House Bill 3 also was cheered by the Delaware State Education Association, the largest union that represents state workers.\n\n\"We shouldn’t be forcing people to choose between taking care of a new child and being able to put food on the table or paying the bills” said DSEA President Mike Matthews. “And, not only does this legislation support new parents, but it also helps in the recruitment and retention of educators and state workers.”\n\nFirst proposed by Rep. Debra Heffernan, D-Bellefonte, in 2015, the bill will allow state workers employed for at least a year to take up to three months of paid maternity or paternity leave within a year of their child's birth. Parents who adopt a child ages 6 and younger also will be eligible.\n\n\"It was three years of hard work and really a group effort,\" Heffernan said. \"I think it's a fantastic benefit for all state workers.\"\n\nThe Office of Comptroller General estimates about 1,000 state workers — including public, charter and vo-tech school employees — will take advantage of the paid leave offered by the bill each year.\n\nThe total cost to the state is estimated at about $4 million per year. School district's also will have to spend a combined $1.26 million per year on substitute teachers, the comptroller reported.\n\nThat cost raised concerns among some lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Gary Simpson, R-Milford.\n\n\"I fully appreciate the social aspects of this bill,\" he said. \"But I think this body is asked to look a little deep into whether it is fiscally sound and I've got to say this is probably the most fiscally irresponsible bill that I've seen in my 20 years in the Senate.\"\n\nHe also questioned whether the bill might contribute to a serious staffing shortage in the Department of Correction, while the executive director of the Delaware Association of School Administrators said she fears the legislation will add to a long-standing shortage among substitute teachers.\n\nSimpson was joined by three other Republicans in opposing the bill, including Sens. Gerald Hocker of Ocean View, Dave Lawson of Marydel and Brian Pettyjohn of Georgetown.\n\nWith the bill's passage, Delaware becomes the sixth state, along with Washington D.C. to offer some form of paid family leave to public sector workers.\n\nThe federal Family Medical Leave Act allows state — and most private employees — to take 12 weeks of leave to care for a newborn. But the law does not require employers to pay those workers during that time.\n\nHeffernan's legislation does not impact private businesses in Delaware, although some major employers here already offer paid family leave, including JPMorgan Chase, Sallie Mae, Barclays and Amazon.\n\nOnly three states — California, New Jersey and Rhode Island — and the District of Columbia require private employers to provide paid family leave, including time off to care for sick family members.\n\nMassachusetts lawmakers approved legislation Tuesday that would allow all workers to take up to 12 weeks paid family leave and 20 weeks of medical leave.\n\nThe Delaware Senate on Tuesday also passed the first — and by far the largest — of several pieces in the state budget puzzle.\n\nThe $4.27 billion operating budget for fiscal year 2019 — 4 percent more than the current year — cleared the chamber with only Sen. Colin Bonini, R-Dover, casting a vote of opposition.\n\nThe bill, which includes the core of the state's spending plan for the coming year, now heads to the House for final approval.\n\nThe General Assembly has yet to consider a supplemental budget bill that includes bonuses for state workers that would bring to total spending growth to 5.2 percent. A bond bill that includes funding for capital projects and a Grant-in-Aid bill that provides taxpayer dollars to a more than 100 nonprofits have yet to be introduced.\n\nDelaware Legislature:\n\nAssault weapons ban dies in Delaware Senate after months of fighting\n\nDelaware House passes and governor signs bump stock ban\n\nRep.

Lower-income taxpayers are generally eligible for more generous tax credits and deductions after having or adopting a child, said Jim Daniels, a CPA and managing director at UHY Advisors, a tax and consulting services firm.\n\nAdoption tax credit\n\nIf you adopted a child in 2023, you might have been able to qualify for a credit of up to $15,950 in adoption-related expenses you incurred per child. This could include adoption-related attorney fees, adoption fees, traveling expenses and more. The credit increased to $16,810 in 2024.\n\nTo claim the full credit, your modified adjusted gross income, which is generally close to your adjusted gross income, must be below $239,230. After that, the credit phases out and is not available for people who have a modified gross adjusted income of $279,230. For 2024, those figures rise to $252,150 and $292,150.\n\nThe credit is not refundable, meaning if you don't owe any taxes, you won't be able to claim the credit. However, you can carry it forward to reduce your tax liability in the future.\n\nHow much is the Child Tax Credit this year? What are the qualifications?\n\nIf you became a parent in 2023, you could qualify for the Child Tax Credit if you had an adjusted gross income of less than $200,000 or less than $400,000 if you were filing a joint return with a spouse.\n\nChild and dependent care credit income limit\n\nIf you are employed and pay for child care services, you may qualify for the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. To qualify, you must have earned income in 2023 and have work-related care expenses, among other rules. You can seek the credit for up to $3,000 of expenses for one child, $6,000 for two or more children. The actual credit is a percentage of those expenses. See IRS Publication 503 for the formulas.\n\nEITC qualifications\n\nHaving a child could make you eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. If you have one child and your adjusted gross income was $46,560 (filing alone) or $53,120 (filing jointly with a spouse) in 2023, you could claim up to $3,995 in a refundable tax credit.\n\nIn 2024, using the same example, the income levels rise to $49,084 and $56,004, and the credit ranges up to $4,213.\n\nMake adjustments to your W-4 withholding\n\nFinally, if you haven't already, you should make sure to fill out a new W-4 form if you have an employer, to reflect that you now have a dependent. This will likely lower the refund you get next year, but it will increase the size of your paychecks going forward, Daniels said, because less money will be withheld.\n\nMore of your 2024 tax season questions answered\n\nNew Federal tax brackets for 2023-2024.

It joins displaced families packing local hotels, babies with diaper rashes, damp clothes and hungry faces. Months of new images, more people in need.\n\nStacey Henry remembers coming home exhausted each night after Hurricane Ida, after its remnants brought extreme flooding to her neighborhood in September 2021. She organized relief efforts; she disseminated supplies; she helped families find housing; she was recognized as a woman of the year. But the self-appointed people’s advocate also remembers more private moments, venting through a clutched phone.\n\n“At night, I would literally go home and there was one friend of mine, she would just listen to me,” the Wilmington native remembered. “I just kept saying, I didn't know the name of it. I didn't know what to call it, but I have to build something.”\n\nShe would start keeping a list of those unhoused. She would spend hours cooking, bringing trays of pasta to hotels. She would start fielding calls from all over the city, frantically organizing food distribution, asking state officials if they'd buy diapers or dry socks. Days following the flooding were chaotic, and residents in the Northeast were terrified.\n\n“I have to organize something,” Henry continued, recalling her evening musings. “So that when there's a disaster, there's a place or a group that can come in immediately, until the plans that they have in the file cabinets with dust on them are pulled out.\"\n\nMemories of flooding, displacement and panic are still fresh on the minds of many residents in Wilmington's Northeast. Organizers who stepped up after this storm never want to see the same devastation again. Or, face it unprepared.\n\nToday they hope to have the beginnings of an answer: a Delaware Resilience Hub.\n\nHenry and other residents banded to launch a climate resilience hub, focused on community engagement and climate-change-fueled disaster readiness. The team has found a funding partner in Philadelphia-based Green Building United, alongside other partners across Delaware.\n\nPacked into Wilmington’s PAL Center, a community center and the base for the new outfit, organizers marked an official launch April 29 with information sessions, workshops and free emergency preparedness kits. It's a first for the neighborhood, Henry said, and a first for Delaware.\n\nShe hopes the vision expands to more Wilmington neighborhoods.\n\n‘I wouldn’t take no for an answer’:Lifelong Wilmington resident recognized for advocacy\n\nIntensifying future storms, accelerating sea-level rise, extreme heat — Henry knows the brunt of disasters is borne by under-resourced, vulnerable neighborhoods like her own. Riverside, 11th Street Bridge and Eastside neighborhoods were some of the most affected by Ida.\n\nNow, a vision of preparedness is taking shape. And step one might be getting people's attention.\n\nHave a story to tell?

Reach out: kepowers@gannett.com.\n\nUnderstanding a vision for resiliency in Wilmington\n\nResidents peered into their buckets.\n\nFlashlights, first aid kits, bottled water, blankets, rope, more packed against smooth blue plastic. Many residents who had to replace personal documents just two years ago looked down at plastic sleeves made to store copies of birth certificates and other identification. Over 30 attendees filed into the center, perched on North Market Street’s higher ground, and were handed these stuffed kits.\n\n“Grab the bucket while they're grabbing you,” Henry put it simply. Her team believes many neighbors would be much better off if they had supplies like these during Ida.\n\nThe kits are an early step for the group, Northeast Rising. It meets aims for training on first aid, evacuation routes and more for members and interested residents. Unlike working alone in a makeshift hotel office in 2021, Henry and her team want residents to know there’s a place to go in the wake of disaster.\n\nThe hub boasts communication, resources, dry clothes and cool air. And it would support more than post-disaster recovery.\n\nEven on the soggy April morning, Henry knows summer is fast approaching. Core to the hub’s plan, she described, will also be offering a place to escape a different threat.\n\nStill flooding their neighborhood, still sweeping between homes and across pavement, already claiming more lives than any other weather-related cause in the U.S. — it’s heat.\n\n“It’s a place for them to be for the hours that the heat index is dangerously high,” Henry said. Heat index, or how hot a day \"feels,\" combines both temperature and humidity. When it's more humid, it's much harder for the body to cool off by sweating.\n\nNortheast Rising plans to open the air-conditioned gym when conditions call for it, providing water and food. Research shows the brunt of increasing heat will not be felt equally. It will fall on households with lower incomes, renters without access to efficient air conditioning, those facing homelessness and others most vulnerable.\n\nUrban heat island?Not all Wilmington neighborhoods experience the same summer heat. Here’s why.\n\nBack in the PAL, hardly able to keep still as she watched residents listen to the Aug. 29 speakers, Henry knows she has yet to see anything quite like her vision in the First State. She called it a catalyst.\n\nBut, Northeast is just one pocket of Delaware’s largest city.\n\n“This is small,” she said.\n\n“It's large for me, but it may be small for the city. I don't have money to do what I need to do — but I've started to bring awareness to the support that we're going to need from the community, from the government, from everyone, to make this hub one of many.”\n\nStorms like these...\n\nHurricane Ida’s remnants brought floods to a 20-block radius of the city.\n\nA maximum crest of 23.1 feet — measured near Rockford Park on the morning of Sept. 2 — had the Brandywine set a new record, as previously reported.\n\nFloodwaters lifted cars, swallowed bridges. Emergency responders rescued over 200 people from homes, wading through the streets in boats. Displaced residents struggled for months to find housing, as city and state response came under fire.\n\nA changing climate will play a role in the prevalence of these strong storms. A warming planet draws more water into the atmosphere, contributing to heavier storms, and a rising sea.\n\nIt’s everywhere:Sea-level rise is damaging much more than beach homes and East Coast shoreline\n\nLooking back:Displaced by September floods, Wilmington residents still living in shelters, cars in January\n\nFrom the Chesapeake to Massachusetts bays, Ida brought surges several feet above typical high tide levels. Rising seas can spell problems for more inland communities, too, as high tides and strengthened storm surges push water higher in nearby rivers during extreme storms, and into floodplains.\n\nRivers across the region broke records. Higher tides push back on these rivers, preventing flow back into the sea — while fresh water from extreme rainfall starts stacking up.\n\nIf it can’t drain into watersheds, it will find new routes. Without regard for neighborhoods.\n\nDangerous moisture can be more insidious, too.\n\nFor every 1-degree Celsius temperatures rise, according to First Street, the air holds about 7% more water vapor. This contributes to more humid days, with a higher likelihood of hazardous heat.\n\nHeat claims more lives than flooding and hurricanes combined.\n\nDense urban areas feel heat exacerbated, as concentrations of dark materials like asphalt, steel and brick trap heat between buildings and streets. A difference of a few degrees of extreme heat can affect the body’s ability to regulate, and extended exposure compounds stress on organs. Those with respiratory illnesses, diabetes and obesity maintain the highest risk.\n\nWilmington already sees an average of seven more days a year over 90 degrees than it did 50 years ago.\n\nThe state is tied with Arizona as the fourth-fastest warming state based on temperature trends since 1970. Average temperatures in Delaware are projected to increase 2.5 to 4.5 degrees by 2050, from 2012 averages. That could rise up to 8 degrees by 2100, in the worst emissions scenario, according to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.\n\nHistorically just one day above 100 degrees would be rare in Delaware, coming about once a year, if that. But by 2050, the state’s Climate Action Plan warns of two to eight each year, alongside projections of up to five nights with temperatures above 80.\n\nThe perilous list continues.\n\nThis more extreme future will likely demand physical adaptation, according to a national report on hazardous heat, as well as planning for emergency heat events, such as checking on residents, creating more cooling centers and ensuring people can reach them.\n\nThat means communities and governments unfamiliar with extreme heat will have to adapt and prepare for it.\n\n“The conversation needs to be about people,” Henry said, back in Wilmington. “It’s about our climate and what we're going to do to prepare ourselves for what's coming.”\n\nHave a story to tell?

Brian Callister\n\nAs a physician who deals daily with terminal patients, I can say that HB 160 is bad policy for many reasons. Here are five:\n\nFirst, contrary to what proponents say, legalizing assisted suicide actually limits your choices and access to healthcare.\n\nOnce assisted suicide becomes a medical option, it will be the cheapest option and provide incentive for insurers to save money by denying treatment. I had two patients from Oregon and California, states which have legalized assisted suicide, who were denied treatment.\n\nThey were not even “terminal” as long as they could receive the life-saving treatment we asked for. But there were denied coverage and offered assisted suicide pills instead. Neither they, nor I, had requested the lethal drugs. Assisted suicide is not about freedom, autonomy, or choice – it limits choice and reduces your healthcare options.\n\n\"In the final analysis, economics, not the quest for broadened individual liberties or increased autonomy, will drive assisted suicide to the plateau of acceptable practice.” (Derek Humphry and Mary Clement, Freedom to Die, St. Martin’s Press (New York, 1998), page 313).\n\nSecond, the underlying premise that everyone will suffer horrible pain at the end of life is simply not true in 2017. No one has to die in pain in this day and age. If someone is suffering needlessly, frankly they need to change doctors. In fact, “pain” is not even in the top five reasons for committing assisted suicide, according to data in Oregon. The top reasons listed are “burden to family” and “loss of autonomy.”\n\nThird, a physician’s ability to predict life expectancy in terminal illness is often not accurate – the medical literature shows the average margin of error is 50-70 percent.\n\nAssisted suicide, like hospice, requires a physician to “certify” six months or less to live. Physicians are frequently wrong – I put people on hospice all the time, and I take them off all the time. Patients often live months and even years longer than we thought with a good quality of life.\n\nJ.J. Hanson of Patients Rights Action Fund, a retired Marine, husband, and father, has the same horrible brain cancer as Brittany Maynard, an advocate of medical aid for dying before her own death in 2014.\n\nHanson is now grateful he did not have access to suicide pills in the first few months of his illness. In an impulsive moment of depression, he may have taken them. Today, he has a second child on the way.\n\nFourth, assisted suicide puts too much power in a doctor's hands and corrupts the medical profession.\n\nWe all know that doctors exercise a lot of influence with their patients, especially when important health decisions are being made.\n\nJeanette Hall was considering doctor prescribed suicide in Oregon, but her doctor said no and encouraged treatment.\n\nSome 17 years later she is an oft-cited opponent of assisted suicide. \"if my doctor had believed in assisted suicide, I would be dead,\" she said.\n\nFinally, doctor shopping is a real danger if assisted suicide becomes law. Elder abuse is rampant in America. Nothing in the proposed assisted suicide law will prevent an interested party from looking for a doctor who will prescribe death if another doctor says “no.\"\n\nIn Oregon, 88 percent of the cases of doctor assisted suicides were “helped” in finding a doctor who would prescribe lethal drugs by the pro-assisted suicide group Compassion and Choices.\n\nAssisted suicide is an affront to human dignity on every level and should be vigorously opposed by the people of Delaware and their elected representatives.\n\nT.

The debate over whether physicians should be allowed to prescribe lethal drugs to terminally ill patients is likely to reach Legislative Hall this spring.\n\nDelaware Rep. Paul Baumbach, D-Newark, is preparing a measure that would mirror Oregon's 18-year-old \"death with dignity\" law. Since that law was enacted in October 1997, doctors have written lethal prescriptions for 1,327 patients and 859 have died from taking the drugs, including 105 last year.\n\nBaumbach has not introduced legislation, or circulated language broadly for co-sponsors. But he says Delawareans with a terminal illness, and six months or less to live according to a doctor, also should be allowed to take medicine that ends their life.\n\n\"It could take more than a year for this to happen,\" Baumbach said. \"But I'm open to whatever the process permits. We have a process here (in Legislative Hall) and if it is not ready for it (the bill) yet, it's not ready for it.\"\n\n\"I think what we are ready for is this discussion,\" Baumbach said.\n\nDelaware's Medical Society, which represents doctors, and religious groups are likely to oppose Baumbach's effort. It's unclear whether Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, a Democrat, is open to signing legislation that would allow Delawareans to seek a doctor's help in dying. Baumbach will have support of patient advocates when he introduces legislation in Dover.\n\nOregon, Vermont and Washington have laws allowing physician-assisted suicide. Court decisions in Montana and New Mexico also have allowed assisted suicide in those states. A spokeswoman for Markell said the governor has not spoken with Baumbach about his upcoming legislation.\n\n\"The governor looks forward to reviewing the legislation and hearing more from Rep. Baumbach about his proposal if it is introduced,\" spokeswoman Kelly Bachman said in an email.\n\nDr. Joanne Lynn, director of the Altarum Institute's Center for Elder Care and Advanced Illness in Washington, said state and federal lawmakers must broadly discuss ways to care for the elderly.\n\nThe idea of allowing the terminally ill to seek assistance in dying ignores that most elderly patients face progressive degrees of disability before dying, and are never offered a clear-cut diagnosis indicating how long they have to live.\n\nPolicymakers advocating for physician-assisted suicide should start by exploring ways to more effectively fund long-term care, and craft plans for making elderly patients comfortable, coordinating services like housing, transportation and access to food.\n\n\"We are not even discussing public policy on long-term care,\" Lynn said. \"We sort of sweep it under the rug.\"\n\nIn a written statement, the Medical Society said it \"strongly opposes any bill to legalize physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia, as these practices are fundamentally inconsistent with the physician's role as healer.\"\n\nThe Medical Society said doctors should \"redouble\" efforts to ensure that dying patients receive treatment that make them as comfortable as possible. Physicians should resist the natural tendency to withdraw physically and emotionally from their patients,\" the group said in its prepared statement. And training physicians should receive more education on advanced pain management techniques.\n\n\"The use of more aggressive comfort care measures, including greater reliance on hospice care, can alleviate the physical and emotional suffering that dying patients experience,\" the Medical Society's statement says.\n\nDr. Nancy Fan, president of the Medical Society, said end-of-life treatment should stop short, however, of assisting a patient in dying. \"We want to provide them comfort and relief and make sure they don't feel like they have no options\" Fan said. \"Our role as healers makes it very difficult for us to proactively assist in the concept of ending someone's life.\"\n\nBaumbach said his legislation will likely allow assisted suicide in cases where patient shave been told by doctor they have six months or less to live.\n\nOnly patients would be allowed to authorize the decision to pursue that course. Patients would have to request assisted suicide, receive education about the process, and wait through a \"cooling period\" before receiving the lethal drugs.\n\n\"This is not something to be taken lightly,\" Baumbach said. \"It has to be an arduous process to make sure you are certain. It is irreversible.\"\n\nNicole Theis, president of the Delaware Family Policy Council, said the program would still \"endanger vulnerable people who will be pressured with a duty to die,\" over the fear of becoming dependent on others.\n\nAssisted suicide also would offer a cheaper alternative to end-of-life treatment, subjecting elderly patients to abuse, Theis said. Delaware should instead expand options for early hospice, train more palliative physicians, mobilize faith communities to help others, and increase funding for home health care, she said.\n\nSean Hebbel is program director at the Cancer Support Network of Delaware, where he helps coordinate support groups for cancer patients, some of whom are terminally ill. Hebbel said he has discussed assisted suicide with patients, but none have expressed an interest in seeking help dying, he said.\n\nBut Hebbel says patients who face a painful death should be allowed to choose when they die, so long as the program is strictly overseen and guarantees that patients are making the decision with a clear mind.\n\n\"If we as a society can value the process of dying, just as much as the process of living, well, that would be lovely,\" Hebbel said.\n\nContact Jon Offredo at (302) 678-4271, on Twitter @jonoffredo or at joffredo@delawareonline.com.

It allowed me the opportunity to become a stronger advocate for early intervention through prevention and screening for life within the Latino community and to lend a voice to those who cannot speak for themselves.\n\nMore of this debate\n\nPro: We should be able to write our own endings\n\nCon:Assisted suicide undermines human dignity\n\nWhile I am blessed today to call myself cancer free, I would want this compassionate option if my cancer ever came back.\n\nI am pleased to know that the Delaware General Assembly is considering a bill that would allow terminally ill adults the option to request a doctor’s prescription for medication they can decide to take to die peacefully in their sleep if their suffering becomes unbearable.\n\nThat’s why I am formally endorsing the Ron Silverio/Heather Block Delaware End of Life Options Act sponsored by Rep. Paul Baumbach. This compassionate legislation would allow terminally ill people of Delaware to peacefully end needless, intolerable suffering at life’s end.\n\nHispanics nationwide overwhelmingly support state laws that authorize the option of medical aid in dying for terminally ill adults.\n\nThanks to support from Latinos like civil rights activist Dolores Huerta, today 69 percent of Hispanics nationwide support medical aid in dying. The iconic Huerta recently recorded online videos in English and Spanish to urge fellow Hispanics to support these compassionate laws.\n\nI strongly believe mis hermanos [brothers and sisters] in Delaware should have the option when the time comes — to make the end-of-life care decisions that are right for them and their loved ones — in the final stages of a terminal illness.\n\nI understand this end-of-life care option may not be for everyone. Many terminally ill people have different opinions about what decisions are right for them in the final stages of a terminal illness.\n\nBut when there is nothing else that medicine can do and it becomes impossible to provide relief from extreme suffering, we should allow a person the option to peacefully end their suffering.\n\nAs a Christian who respects other people’s faiths, I believe it is not for me to judge someone else. The harsh reality is that no matter how hard we try, we cannot escape the cycle of life and death.\n\nMy faith tells me that if the time comes when we can’t bear the suffering that afflicts us, a merciful God will understand that we all should have the option to die peacefully without unbearable suffering.\n\nMaria Matos is the President and CEO of the Latin American Community Center in Wilmington.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/27/heres-what-delaware-can-and-cant-say-its-covid-19-cases/5076877002/", "title": "Here's what Delaware can (and can't) say about its COVID-19 cases", "text": "As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Delaware continues to climb and the first deaths have been reported, many residents are looking for answers.\n\n\"Could Delaware please provide more detailed info of what towns, within each county, that have confirmed cases of the virus?\" asked Milton resident Cindy Black. \"I’d like to know if any cases are in my town?\n\n\"Maybe this info could help flatten the curve?\"\n\nOthers are asking: How many tests have been conducted? Does the state have enough ventilators?\n\nHealth officials say they are constrained by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and because of this, cannot provide any additional details of specific cases — including towns — because it could lead to a person being identified.\n\nFIRST DEATH:Sussex County man becomes Delaware's 1st coronavirus death; health care workers infected\n\nThe state will also not say how many ventilators, masks and other protective gear Delaware hospitals have available or will need to have in the future. This comes as several states, including New York and Washington, are desperately trying to find ventilators to save the lives of the sickest.\n\nDelaware residents are not alone in this lack of knowledge; other state health departments have provided similar information, or lack thereof.\n\nSome public health experts and elected officials believe more information is needed for Delawareans to truly grasp the magnitude of this pandemic and act in the public interest.\n\n\"I trust that if you see a place or a business or a town or a hot spot, you are more likely to isolate yourself,\" said Newark state Rep. John Kowalko. \"It took me awhile to appreciate that you have to stay in. It really is distressing and it is also necessary.\n\n\"The more people take it seriously,\" he said, \"the more likely we are to face this hidden enemy.\"\n\nWhat can the state tell us?\n\nAlmost half the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Delaware — 95 — are among people age 18 to 49, state officials said.\n\nFifty-three people from age 50 to 64 have the virus, while 62 people 65 years and older have been confirmed, as of March 28. Four children under the age of 17 have contracted it as well.\n\nThe youngest resident to get the virus is a 1-year-old, while the oldest is 90.\n\nAs of March 28, there were 214 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Delaware — 130 in New Castle County, 25 in Kent County and 59 in Sussex County.\n\nMore women have coronavirus than men. Thirty-one people have been hospitalized in Delaware, while two other residents were hospitalized out of state, officials said. Eight are critically ill, while nine people have recovered from the coronavirus.\n\nIn the two weeks since the first coronavirus case was announced, the state has been providing regular updates. This often includes a breakdown by county, gender, a general age range and the number of people who are hospitalized and in critical condition.\n\nIn the past week, the state has updated its COVID-19 website about twice a day and then sent a media advisory near the end of each workday. State officials have also held press conferences and virtual town halls.\n\nREAD:Find out how much your stimulus check could be\n\nWhen Delaware announced its first case on March 11, health officials revealed the man was over the age of 50, lived in New Castle County and was connected to the University of Delaware.\n\nThe university later announced the man was a faculty member.\n\nThe next couple of confirmed cases included an age range, gender, and county. And, when applicable, the state identified the patients as members of the University of Delaware community.\n\nBut as the number of cases grew, the health department stopped providing information for each case, instead offering general statistics for the total confirmed cases in Delaware.\n\nFor a while, the state also provided information about the number of people who were being tested. When commercial labs began testing for the coronavirus in Delaware, the state then started to announce only positive cases.\n\nDr. Karyl Rattay, the director of the Division of Public Health, said Thursday that the state's public health lab, as of March 25, had run 639 tests.\n\nAt the Delaware health care facility testing sites, a total of 2,617 samples had been collected as of March 25. This does not include any tests performed in emergency departments, inpatient units or primary care offices, she said.\n\nREAD:See which Delaware workers face the greatest coronavirus risk\n\nThe state does not have the results of many of these samples yet, Rattay said, and it's unclear how many of these samples are from Delaware residents. The state said it will provide more information about the number of test results in the coming days.\n\n\"We are working through some data sharing issues and once we have that information, we plan to be able to share that with you,\" she said.\n\nAs of March 28, five people have died due to complications from the virus. The first Delawarean to die from coronavirus was a 66-year-old Sussex County man, who had underlying health conditions and was critically ill.\n\nOn Thursday, officials said the man had died within the previous 72 hours and had the typical symptoms of COVID-19, including a fever. Their announcement came 18 hours after a 7:30 p.m. press release Wednesday announced four victims had recovered.\n\nDuring a virtual town hall Friday, Gov. John Carney mentioned the man lived in the Dagsboro area.\n\nWhen answering a question on the media call Thursday, one state official briefly mentioned that the man died in a Maryland hospital, but quickly said \"out-of-state hospital.\"\n\nWhen a reporter asked to confirm the man died in Maryland, state officials would not do so.\n\nWhat won't the state tell us?\n\nDue to HIPAA restrictions, state officials say they can't release any personal information on any individual case, including: name, address, city, underlying health condition, or dates of medical care, including date of death.\n\nThis information, health officials say, on its own and combined with other \"information in the public space\" could lead to a person being identified.\n\n\"DPH’s greatest responsibility is to protect the personal health information of every individual in our state,\" said Rattay, the director of the Division of Public Health. \"And we take that responsibility incredibly seriously.\"\n\nMORE:More sacrifices lie ahead for Delawareans as coronavirus continues to spread\n\nYet, the state routinely releases ages, counties and information about whether a patient had a flu shot or underlying conditions when announcing deaths from influenza.\n\nSpecifically, Rattay said the state can't identify patients' towns due to HIPAA restricting information for populations less than 20,000.\n\nThis applies to many Delaware towns, she said. The areas that exceed this population count are Wilmington, Dover, Newark, Bear and Middletown.\n\nAround 1 p.m. Friday, the state updated its coronavirus website to include two graphs indicating where COVID-19 cases are by Delaware ZIP code. The first graph includes data from March 8 to March 14, while the second covers from March 8 to March 21.\n\nThe state was able to reveal the first confirmed case's connection to the University of Delaware because the community exceeded this number.\n\nDelaware officials have declined to provide specific information about the number of ventilators and other medical supplies currently available to health care workers.\n\nAccording to the Delaware Healthcare Association, there are a total of 395 intensive care unit beds at Delaware hospitals. A spokeswoman for the organization said it is \"not possible to quantify exact numbers regarding our respiratory support equipment.\"\n\nHealth officials have said the state is talking to hospitals and the Delaware Emergency Management Agency every day and is monitoring the number of masks, test kits and other protective gear available.\n\nHospitals, including some here in Delaware, have been asking for donations.\n\n“Right now, we have what we need in-state,\" Rattay said. \"But we do have concerns that some of the items have certainly become more difficult to order.”\n\nGov. John Carney has said hospital capacity has been one of his biggest areas of concern.\n\nDuring a March 19 interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal, Carney said he had received a spreadsheet that day that outlined what the hospitals have. He declined to make that information public.\n\n\"We don't have a lot in terms of a surge capacity,\" Carney said. \"That's the biggest fear.\"\n\nHe said this has been a focus of the emergency management agency and there have been ongoing conversations with the National Guard, specifically about the potential of setting up a facility to handle a surge of cases.\n\nOne potential location, he said, is the building that used to house Milford Memorial Hospital.\n\nWhat do experts say?\n\nSince the first case was confirmed, The News Journal has received dozens of emails, phone calls and Facebook comments, all asking for more information about where the virus is in Delaware.\n\n\"How about the number actually tested,\" suggested Milford resident Lezlie Eustis, \"broken down by age in decades, how many have other underlying health issues, how many live at home, and how many live at a care facility?\"\n\n\"Are there clusters of cases in specific portions of the state?\" asked Rehoboth Beach resident Glen Pruitt. He would also like to see a map identifying the towns where people with COVID-19 reside.\n\nDr. Mohammad Akhter, who also oversaw the Missouri and Washington, D.C., health departments, said he believes there is value in providing community-specific information.\n\nIf people knew there were confirmed cases in their town, or ZIP code, they would likely become more alert and take the precautions — such as social distancing — to protect themselves, the Delaware resident said.\n\n\"You cannot fight an infectious disease without being transparent. Eventually, the information will come out,\" Akhter said. “There is no infectious disease a health department can win without the help of the people.”\n\nREAD:Are Sussex County retirees and tourism prepared to weather Delaware's coronavirus crisis?\n\nBut due to the United States' privacy laws and Delaware’s small population size, this cannot be done in practice, said Jennifer Horney, the founding director of the University of Delaware’s epidemiology program.\n\n“The law and guiding principle is to protect confidentiality,” she said. “This is the problem with small numbers.”\n\nIf for example, Horney said, the state released COVID-19 related information about a white 87-year-old woman from a small Delaware town, it wouldn’t take long for people to figure out who this resident is.\n\nBut this isn't good enough for Kowalko, a state representative, who has been frustrated with the information provided by the state.\n\nWhile he said he believes Carney and health secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker have done a good job addressing the outbreak, he also said Delawareans have a right to know what areas are being hit the worst by this pandemic.\n\n\"I think quite frankly the transparency has been horribly lacking,\" Kowalko said. \"I say that to not criticize efforts that are made. I know HIPAA laws are well intended, but ... it's not to be a blanket.\"\n\nSarah Gamard contributed reporting to this story.\n\nContact Meredith Newman at (302) 324-2386 or at mnewman@delawareonline.com.

During the past few months, the Delaware Health Care Commission's End-of-Life Work group has been conducting meetings throughout the state to receive input from professionals in the health care system, as well as the public, concerning the issues that are important when discussing end-of-life decisions.\n\nRep. Paul Baumbach has introduced a bill (the Death with Dignity Act, HB 150) which outlines the purposes and safeguards of the act. Now, there may be some people who say assisted suicide is an act that defies both moral and religious principles. I say that this is a human right given to us by God, since he has also given us a \"free will\" to decide whether a particular thought or action is inherently good or bad. It is only right that a competent person who has terrible physical pain and suffering, and has less than six months to live, be able to make his/her decision to end their life. If any of you have witnessed the dying and death of someone who has cancer, or the complications from AIDS, you understand what I am talking about. My sister died from lung cancer, and I witnessed the dying and deaths of many who died from AIDS complications when I was the executive director of Damien Ministries, and the Washington AIDS Ministry in Washington, D.C.\n\nBesides the issues of death and dying covered in the act, I feel there are two other issues which are tangential to them. They were issues I discussed in a past letter to the editor concerning dying alone and being buried alone. As I stated in that letter to the editor, there are patients dying alone everyday in Delaware in hospitals, hospices, hospitals and nursing homes. Even Christ had his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, Mary Magdalene, and his beloved disciple John, to witness his death.\n\nThe other issue related to dying and death with dignity in Delaware, relates to being buried alone with no one to be a witness to that person's life and death. All you have to do is glimpse at the obituaries in the Delaware News Journal, where there are not only obituaries, but also burial notices from funeral homes asking whether or not there were friends or relatives to claim the remains. In many cases, no one comes forward and they are buried alone. What is disturbing, is that there are the burial notices over the last month or two related to the remains of two babies that have no birth date or name.\n\nWhat kind of society have we become that we do not even acknowledge the death and burial of babies?\n\nEven Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple a Jesus, asked Pontius Pilate for the remains of Jesus. No one deserves to die or be buried alone in Delaware.\n\nI wholeheartedly support Rep. Paul Baumbach's Death with Dignity Act, and I will work closely with the national organization and establish a Compassion and Choices chapter in Delaware. In addition, I will be forming a foundation in Delaware whose mission will be to make sure that Delawareans don't die alone, with volunteers that will be ready to assist in that effort by devoting their time and energy to be with those who need this service, and will be in constant contact with hospitals, hospices, and nursing homes to make sure that we provide the care giving for these abandoned individuals.\n\nIn addition, the Delaware Foundation for Equality in Death and Dying will be in contact with funeral homes to offer our services to those deceased with no one to claim their remains, so that we can claim their remains and provide a decent funeral or celebration of life. I urge you to call Rep. Baumbach and tell him you support his bill, as well as your state senator and state representative. The governor of Delaware (who already supports the bill) would like to hear from you too.\n\nJoseph Carsello is the former executive director of Damien Ministries and the Washington AIDS Ministry in Washington.

It's not clear exactly how many children would be covered by the bill because families are often fearful of coming forward, according to Rep. Krista Griffith, a Democrat from Fairfax who is sponsoring the bill.\n\nAs it stands now, the only coverage that the state and the federal government can provide is life-or-death emergency care, Griffith said.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, children would be eligible for health coverage if they live in the state and their family income is low enough that they would qualify for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program coverage.\n\nThe bill is expected to affect only children who don't currently qualify for coverage because of their immigration status.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Services would run the program, which would go into effect in January 2023 if the bill passes. Hospital, medical, dental and prescription drug benefits would align with Medicaid and CHIP coverage, according to the bill.\n\nBut the one-page bill could face obstacles from Gov. John Carney's administration, whose health secretary is hesitant about how the state will pay for it. It's expected to cost several million dollars per year.\n\nCarney has not commented publicly on the bill but is typically hesitant about any proposals that include a recurring cost such as this one.\n\nThe 62-person, Democratic-controlled General Assembly has become increasingly progressive and willing to spend money on similar programs. But Carney, who has traditionally gotten his way in the Statehouse, is by comparison fiscally conservative.\n\n\"For thousands of Delaware children ... a simple trip to the doctor for an illness or to get vaccinated is not a financially viable option,\" Griffith said.\n\nSen. Sarah McBride, a Wilmington Democrat who is helping sponsor the bill, said the proposal is \"financially responsible\" because the current system is \"inefficient.\" By expanding coverage, health outcomes will be improved and overall care costs for the state will go down in the long run, she said.\n\n\"None of them chose the broken immigration system that prevents them from seeing a pediatrician, and none of them chose to endure the kind of basic health concerns that afflict so many young people,\" McBride said.\n\nChildren getting poor treatment under current laws\n\nTwo parents who immigrated to Delaware shared examples of their families' health care challenges when the bill was introduced last week.\n\nOne mother, who did not give her name, said through a translator that her 14-year-old has no medical insurance and cannot get a checkup. Routine dentist appointments are too expensive, and she's limited to only doing the exams mandated by her child's school, she said.\n\nOnce, she took her child to the doctor for a skin problem. She was able to pay for the appointment, but when she went to the pharmacy to buy the medication he was prescribed, she couldn't afford it.\n\n\"One is there with one's heart torn apart,\" she said.\n\nAnother mother, who did not give her name, said she had trouble paying $300 for an ambulance to transport her child, at the time a 1-year-old, from the emergency room to the children's hospital for a respiratory condition.\n\nHer daughter, who's older, has had fewer health problems. But recently, her teacher asked her family to take her to an ophthalmologist for vision problems. She's struggling to find care she can afford.\n\nAccording to Dr. Marisel Santiago, a pediatrician at the La Red Health Center in Georgetown, pediatricians see \"heartbreaking\" situations when children don't qualify for health coverage because their family immigrated illegally. Parents struggle to pay for medication, tests and lab work. Some of the children they treat also have \"terrible, terrible dental hygiene,\" she said.\n\nShe remembers one family who brought in their 8-year-old boy, who was severely obese. Doctors said they needed to do lab work on the child, but the family \"just disappeared\" because they couldn't afford it, she said.\n\nEventually, they came back and the child had lost weight despite eating the same and drinking more water. Doctors again ordered lab work, which the family again didn't do because they still couldn't afford it.\n\nThe child eventually ended up in the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication, and is now a type 1 diabetic patient, she said.\n\n\"The same way that we can provide school and education for every kid, no matter where they come from, we should be able to provide access to medical coverage,\" Santiago said.\n\nPREGNANT WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE:Women's health care is a 'dire need' in Sussex County. And pregnant women, doctors know it\n\nProgam not included in Carney's budget\n\nThe state will have to pay the full cost of the program, which would have to be written into next year's budget by the 12-person Joint Finance Committee that relies mostly on Carney's spending proposal when drafting.\n\nCarney has not included this bill in his proposal, which he presented in January.\n\nBesides McBride and Griffith, 25 other Democrats have signed on to the bill, which is essentially pledging their vote. But they will need more votes than that to pass it.\n\nAccording to spending estimates from Nemours Children's Health and DHSS, it could cost the state between $3 million and $7 million per year, Griffith said.\n\nCarney's office did not say whether or not the governor supports the bill.\n\n\"We'll be following legislative debate on the bill,\" said his spokesman, Jonathan Starkey.\n\n\"The real issue will come down to determining (the cost),\" Griffith said.\n\nBill sponsors have pledged to work with the Carney administration on ways to fund it.\n\nThe bill won't be scheduled for a hearing until March, according to a House spokesperson.\n\nThe General Assembly is in session until the end of June.

John Carney later on Thursday.\n\nNo champion will be named, and the eight remaining boys and girls teams will receive Final Four trophies. The two Unified teams will be named co-champions.\n\nThe Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association had earlier Thursday announced that the remaining games would be played with restricted attendance limited to legal guardians.\n\nDIAA executive director Donna Polk said the tipping point was when Gov. Carney declared the state of emergency.\n\n“It was a tough decision, but we have to do what’s in the best interest of our student-athletes and our community,” Polk said. “We have to follow the guidelines within the state, and once [Carney] indicated the state of emergency, looking at the guidelines we fell within that. We had to follow suit in regards to honoring that.”\n\nHEIGHTENED ALERT:Governor declares state of emergency in Delaware after announcement of coronavirus cases\n\nPolk was sympathetic to all the athletes involved, and all the coaches and athletic directors who had to inform them of the decision.\n\n\"The unknown is always scary,” St. Andrew's boys coach Terrell Myers said. “But you just want to make sure you’re taking all the precautions. Not only for the players, but for all of the families that are involved. When you put that as your No. 1 concern, then it makes a lot of sense. It puts sports as a secondary concern.\"\n\nSanford girls coach Marcus Thompson said the school's boys and girls basketball teams were practicing Thursday afternoon when athletic director Joan Samonisky brought them together and announced the cancellation.\n\n“There were a lot of tears. This is tough,” Thompson said. “Not what anybody wanted.\n\n“They’re heartbroken. Almost every girl on our team was crying, including the managers. This is something that they look forward to every year, the opportunity to be the best. This year, unfortunately they won’t get it.\n\n“I’m in here trying to console guys and having conversations with a bunch of disappointed kids,” Sanford boys coach Stan Waterman said. “We have a lot of seniors, and it’s a really, really odd way for their high school careers to come to an end.\"\n\nThe alternate ending hadn't sunk in for Conrad Schools of Science senior Julie Kulesza, twice named Gatorade Player of the Year in Delaware.\n\n“I know it’s going to hit me in the next couple of days; I’m just so shocked and in disbelief right now,\" she said.\n\n“I feel really, really bad for the remaining girls of the four teams, and especially the seniors, that they got this far and couldn’t compete for a state championship,” said Dan Cooney, coach of the St. Elizabeth High School girls team. “But I also see where the state is coming from. They’ve got a big decision to make, and it’s not going to look popular in a lot of peoples’ eyes. But you’ve got to respect what they did.”\n\nDelaware's first presumptive positive test, a faculty member at the University of Delaware, was announced Wednesday. Three more positive tests were reported Thursday, all also among people connected to the university, and the school paused its spring sports \"until further notice.\"\n\nPractices are under way for spring sports teams at high schools across the state, but Polk said DIAA is not involved in any decisions to cancel practices or preseason scrimmages.\n\n“Those decisions will be made at the local level,” Polk said. “Superintendents and principals of the schools will be able to make those decisions.”\n\nThe DIAA seemed to be following in lockstep with Maryland, which announced a similar policy Wednesday night before announcing Thursday that its tournaments were postponed. In neighboring New Jersey, Thursday night state playoff games will be played without fans, but media will be allowed.\n\nThe situation escalated in a matter of days. DIAA first announced Tuesday night that the tournaments were being moved out of the University of Delaware's Bob Carpenter Center.\n\nOn Wednesday, new sites and times were officially announced.\n\nTHE LATEST: What you need to know about coronavirus in Delaware\n\nThe virus and the response to it surged beginning Wednesday night, the same day UD suspended classes.\n\nIn a matter of hours, president Donald Trump announced restrictions on overseas travel; an NBA player, Rudy Gobert, tested positive for the coronavirus; the league's season was immediately suspended; and the domino effect was on.\n\nIt continued Thursday, when the sports world came to a halt.\n\nBy midday, NCAA conference basketball tournaments were being canceled, and March Madness was off by the afternoon. There will be no spring NCAA championships, either.\n\nThe NHL, MLB and MLS announced suspension of their leagues.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the Sixers played a home game Wednesday night, and Thursday morning the Wells Fargo Center was closed for \"extensive cleaning and sanitization.\"\n\nFRANK: As coronavirus spreads, NBA does the right thing by suspending games. It was too late\n\nAsked Thursday afternoon if this was all a distraction, Conrad girls coach John Kulesza recalled the team's 2018 run to a state championship, when snow had pushed the tournament back a few days.

Let's take a look back at the most admirable student-athletes of the high school season.\n\nPolytech girls lacrosse coach Lynn Richardson knew Ali McKay had the potential to score goals. That's why she moved McKay from defense to midfield before her sophomore season.\n\nMcKay was solid last year, earning second-team All-State honors. But this year, after some encouragement from her coach and teammates, she really turned it on. The junior led the Panthers with 104 goals, and was named the state's Player of the Year by the Delaware Girls Lacrosse Coaches Association.\n\n\"She's a well-rounded athlete, and she's a competitor, but I wouldn't say she is someone who is full of herself or overly confident,\" Richardson said. \"We had to encourage her to shoot and drive to the goal.\"\n\nOnce the Panthers convinced her she could do it, the sky was the limit.

Because Pettit finished his glittering career with school records for goals, assists and points, was a three-time first-team All-State selection and a two-time U.S. Lacrosse All-American. And this year, the Delaware Boys Lacrosse Coaches Association named Pettit the state's Player of the Year.\n\n\"What sets him apart are his stick skills and ability to create offense,\" Tower Hill coach Brad duPont said. \"He has tremendous vision, and he knows where everybody is. He can put the ball on people's sticks.\"\n\nHe can put the ball in the net, too. And he can do it from any angle.

It was the first time I was playing for a team. I was so disappointed; I didn't want to let my team down.\n\n\"I went home and told my parents that was the worst feeling ever and I didn't want to ever feel that again.

He listens on his cell phone, then redirects a question to his father.\n\n\"Do you have a claim to fame, Dad?\" he says.\n\n\"Tell him you are\" is the reply.\n\nThe subject is tennis, and for good reason. Williamson had just capped off his junior year at Milford High, having won the state boys singles championship. With his father, Rex, and \"Pop Pop,\" Paul Williamson, coaching the team, Colt became the first Buccaneers No. 1 singles player to win a state title. Ever.\n\n\"That means a lot,\" Williamson said, \" not just for me but for Milford finally having a state champ. Downstate, it's pretty much always been Caesar Rodney for as long as I've known.

If I see an open space, I quickly go there and call for the ball. Moving around is the best part of my game.\"\n\nLaz found enough openings this spring to be named the state's Girls Soccer Player of the Year by the Delaware Soccer Coaches Association. The senior never stopped in leading Sussex Tech to a 13-4 season and a spot in the DIAA Division I semifinals.\n\nSoccer is a long game, with a half lasting 40 minutes at the high-school level. Defenses threw everything but the kitchen sink at Laz, often shutting her down for long stretches. But more often than not, the end result was the same.\n\nLate in the game, Laz would send a screamer into the back of the net, and the Ravens would celebrate a victory.

The golfer best able to handle the stress of the big occasion emerges as the champion.\n\nFor the second straight season, Salesianum's Liam Murphy passed the test with flying colors.\n\nLast year, Murphy pulled away over the final nine holes at Dover's Maple Dale Country Club to win by four strokes. This year, the senior broke out of the pack again at Wilmington Country Club on May 26-27 to win by five and earn his second straight Golfer of the Year honor.\n\n\"There's really no better feeling than to be able to go in there and pull it off, and prove to yourself that you can do it,\" Murphy said. \"All of those hours that you put in were worth it.\" READ MORE\n\nALL-STATE GOLF TEAM\n\nIn a sport whose defining adjectives are \"faster,\" \"higher\" and \"stronger,\" Ashley Bailey is all of the above.\n\nSoaring 18 inches higher than any other Delaware girl ever before pole vaulted, excelling in five other events and leading her team to unprecedented success, the Middletown High senior won the Bill Thomson Award as the state's outstanding high school track athlete.\n\nJust this past Sunday, Bailey vaulted 13 feet at the Junior Olympic Regionals at Stockton (N.J.) University, in a performance she would have undoubtedly reached during the high school season, but for the other work she had taken on.\n\nRequiring speed, strength and jumping ability, the pole vault attracts the sport's most versatile athletes. But the compact schedule of a track meet prevents most vaulters from showing their skills in other events. Bailey, though, invariably performed in the maximum four events.

Six of the top 12 milers in Delaware history competed this spring, five of them graduating last month.\n\nIn this elite field, Kieran Tuntivate dominated. The Harvard-bound senior broke the state records in the mile and 1,600 meters both indoors and out, became Delaware's third-fastest ever at 3,200 meters, set a school record in the 800 to clinch the Blue Hen Conference championship for Charter School of Wilmington and earned national notice at major invitational races.\n\nIn a year when Mykele Young-Sanders of Dover overcame mid-season injury to complete an unprecedented three-year sweep of the hurdles events and Jarod Wilson of Newark became Delaware's fastest half-miler in 30 years, Tuntivate earned the Tom Fort Award as the state's top male track athlete.

A perfect game in a DIAA state final. Two state championships. A career ERA of 0.70, and a career average of 14.2 strikeouts per seven innings.\n\nSo even though the Bulldogs came up short in their bid for a three-peat, Green was a clear choice as The News Journal's Softball Player of the Year. The senior's contribution in the dugout was as important as her work in the pitcher's circle.\n\n\"I became a better leader on the team,\" she said. \"You usually think of the pitcher as one of the leaders, but I had never really been in that spot because of the seniors that we've had. This year, I had to step up to it.\" READ MORE\n\nALL-STATE SOFTBALL TEAM\n\nBrandon Walter allowed two earned runs in the first inning of Hodgson's season opener against eventual state champion Appoquinimink.\n\nThen he allowed one more earned run – the rest of the season.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 left-hander put together one of the greatest seasons in the history of Delaware high school baseball, making him an obvious selection as the state's Player of the Year by the Delaware Baseball Coaches Association.\n\nWalter's numbers bordered on the absurd. He struck out 147 in 72 innings, and allowed just 25 hits, 16 walks and three earned runs.

But the alias sounded funky enough, so it stuck.\n\nThose are the members in the cover band The Amish Outlaws, a group playing nearly a dozen shows in the First State heading into summer. Their next Delaware stop is a free show at Paradise Grill in Millsboro on Sunday, March 17, and there are three more through August.\n\nThe band also will play a free show at Dover Motor Speedway during NASCAR weekend in April. Their first time gigging at the Speedway was in 2022 when they opened for country star Jimmie Allen.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAmish band plays 50 Cent\n\nThe band started in 2003 with four of six original members who grew up in strict Amish households in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where there weren't any power lines connected to their homes. There also wasn't any alcohol or musical instruments.\n\nWhile not everyone in the band's current lineup is Amish, all members perform in Amish attire. This means straw hats, suspenders, and light blue button-up shirts.\n\nEzekiel Scott, better known as band co-founder \"Eazy Ezekiel,\" said The Amish Outlaws usually throw new audiences for a loop in concert.\n\nMany people don't expect a band dressed so plainly to cover everything from System of a Down (metal) to 50 Cent (rap) and Luke Byran (country), one song after the other.\n\n\"When we get on stage and start to play, usually it's confusion for them ... then heads start to bob,\" Eazy, 49, of Stoney Point, New York, said.\n\nAmish Outlaws: 'I loved NWA'\n\nEazy Ezekiel is responsible for his bandmate's rap-inspired stage names. He also named Elijah Rule (Ja Rule), a former member of the group.\n\nComing straight outta Lancaster, Eazy Ezekiel says the concept behind that was important.\n\n\"I loved N.W.A. I loved Eazy-E's 'Eazy-Duz-It' album,\" he said. \"We didn't want to use our family names because we want to protect our family's privacy ... not that we expected [the band] to be as popular as it is.\"\n\nMeet the Amish 'Mos Def' from Delaware\n\nAmos Def (keyboardist) is the only member of The Amish Outlaws who lives in Delaware. He appreciates his stage name and the rapper who inspired it.\n\n\"I love a good punny name, but also Mos Def is one of my all-time favorite rappers, so I treat [my name] with great respect and deference,\" said Amos Def, who has lived in Pike Creek for two years. \"I also love his movie with Jack Black, 'Be Kind Rewind.'\"\n\nWhy did he leave the Amish church?\n\nSome Amish communities practice a tradition called \"Rumspringa\" where when Amish children turn 16, they can live free of the strict Amish code of conduct before deciding if they want to come back and be baptized into the Amish church. The practice applies sometimes just to male youths.\n\nMost of the youth return. Rumspringa doesn't have a deadline, but it typically lasts a year, Eazy said.\n\nEzekiel said he left the Amish church because he didn't like the idea that God would punish some of the friends he made during Rumspringa.\n\n\"I couldn't reconcile myself with the belief that because somebody just happened to not be raised or born Amish that he or she was gonna go to hell,\" he explained.\n\nWhile he's no longer part of the Amish church, Eazy still considers himself Amish. He's just a non-practicing Amish. \"It's still my heritage. That's the best way to phrase it.\"\n\nA misconception about Amish shunning\n\nThere's a popular idea that the few people who leave the Amish community after Rumspringa are shunned for life. Eazy said that's not true because each sect is different.\n\nThe bassist explained he still has a good relationship with his parents, who live in Lancaster. His older brothers left the Amish church and have seen their little bro perform. But his parents have never attended any of Eazy's concerts, which are sometimes at bars.\n\n\"I mean, I understand. They're not supposed to go into a bar,\" he said about his Amish parents.\n\nDiscovering music by Pink Floyd & The Beatles\n\nIt was during Rumspringa when Ezekiel began exploring music.\n\n\"Music became, beyond my family, my biggest passion. It's just something I love more than just about anything in the world,\" he explained.\n\nAt the age of 18, he moved to New York and a friend introduced him to The Beatles' album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and Pink Floyd's \"The Wall.\"\n\n\"Suddenly music went from a distraction or entertainment to something with a very deep, almost sub-religious meaning.\"\n\nDelaware embraces Amish Outlaws\n\nEzekiel would go on to found The Amish Outlaws, a band that has been going strong for 21 years.\n\nThese days, Delaware is playing a bigger role in the band's success. At one point, it was a state the guys would drive through. From now through August, the band is playing the First State nearly a dozen times.\n\n\"Delaware has really become one of our absolute strongest and most receptive markets,\" Eazy said.\n\nAmish Outlaws upcoming Delaware concerts\n\nFor more info about The Amish Outlaws, visit amishoutlaws.com.

There was singing from the Ausbund, a song book of religious songs, which was beautiful in its way, but very simple. I heard bits and pieces of modern music out in the world, at a store or a business or coming from a passing car. As kids we would sneak around and hear music outside and inside some places where we knew it would be playing, but I never listened to any music regularly until I left.\n\nWhat made you decide not to return?\n\nReading and music. I couldn't give either up. I got my GED and wound up going to college and studying, among other things, literature, and couldn't unlearn all that I did and close my eyes to it and go back and live Amish. There is nothing wrong with living Amish, I am not implying that by any stretch. It may sound like I am trying to say to live Amish is to live in ignorance. Far from it.\n\nHow did your family react?\n\nLuckily an older brother made the decision before me and kind of broke the ice, so I got off a lot easier than he did, but they weren't happy at first. A lot of guilt trips and hawing, but from a place of love. I still get it occasionally. I am sure they still aren't happy about it, but after this long, acceptance has set in.\n\nHave any of them been to your shows?\n\nMy older brother has, but not other family.\n\nHow difficult was transitioning from the Amish community to the outside world?\n\nIt was a gradual process for me; going out into the world and experiencing it while still living at home, then in an apartment. Moving to New York was a shock. I am not in the city, but I have been there a lot. The hardest part, though, is the lack of quiet ... the cacophony of phones and cars and machines and blips is hard to shut out sometimes. Missing my family was the only thing more difficult.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to pursue music?\n\nIt was during the first year of my Rumspringa when an English friend played Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles. He had them on vinyl — his father's copies, with the inserts and lyrics — and it wasn't until I held those albums and heard them and read the words that I realized music can mean so much. As much as I love playing music, I love listening to it even more.\n\nHow do you feel about the Amish-centric shows that are cropping up on TV?\n\nWe get asked about them non-stop; 'Is the Amish Mafia real?' My answer is usually, 'If a bunch of people were doing illegal stuff on TV, wouldn't the police come and arrest them?' There is a reason they digitize people's faces on \"Cops\"… I have seen about five minutes each of \"Breaking Amish\" and \"Amish Mafia\" and of course I don't know the people on that show so I can't say how or who they really are, but it seems to me like people acting the way they think people should act on TV, but in bonnets and suspenders.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Amish Outlaws\n\nWhere: Cross County Shopping Center, 8000 Mall Walk, Yonkers. 914-968-9570.

Also in the mix: How to adequately fund post-hurricane repairs to beach areas in south Brevard.\n\nThe advisory Brevard County Tourist Development Council has recommended a plan that would fully fund all of that through the 5% tourist development tax on hotel rooms and other short-term rentals.\n\nUnder the TDC's proposal, commissioners would agree to use money built up in the cultural fund to fund the $1 million-a-year Tourism + Indian River Lagoon Grant Program in the 2023-24 budget year that begins Oct. 1. Then, the Office of Tourism would use new tourist tax revenue to pay for cultural grants that would be awarded for 2023-24.\n\nCounty commissioners on March 7 had discussed ― but did not vote on ― an earlier council recommendation to suspend lagoon grant funding for one year so that more money could go toward beach restoration. Commissioners didn't like that idea, and instead sent the issue back to the TDC, asking for a recommendation that would include funding for the lagoon grant program.\n\nFunding shift proposed:New proposal: Take tourism cultural grant money and shift it to lagoon, beach projects\n\nCurrently, 25% of the revenue from the tourist development tax goes toward a fund used for beach renourishment and the lagoon grant program. And 4% goes to the cultural fund that is used for cultural grants; for major events grants like air shows and the Thunder on Cocoa Beach powerboat races; and to partially funding the Brevard Cultural Alliance. The largest share of the tourist tax revenue — 47% — goes toward a comprehensive plan to market the Space Coast as a destination for tourists.\n\nThe County Commission has the power to change those allocations.\n\nSome tourism council members feared that any temporary cuts to the cultural grants program would become permanent.\n\nSpring break frenzy:Record-setting Space Coast spring break has Cocoa Beach area buzzing\n\nIn the current budget year, 22 arts and cultural organizations and events received tourism cultural grants totaling $340,000. In addition, Thunder on Cocoa Beach received a major events grant of $49,996.\n\nThe Tourism + Indian River Lagoon Grant Program funded a range of projects this year, includes ones dealing with seagrass restoration, improving the clam and oyster populations in the lagoon, and removal of derelict boats from waterways.\n\nHurricanes Ian and Nicole caused $22.49 million in damage to Brevard's south beaches area, which is a 14.5-mile stretch from Spessard Holland Park south to Sebastian Inlet. Repairs to the beaches will use all current beach funds, plus require an additional $6.44 million to be drawn from federal American Rescue Plan Act funds the county received. County commissioners approved that ARPA allocation on Dec. 6,.\n\nThe south beaches project is eligible for reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But FEMA reimbursements typically occur about three years after a storm. So until FEMA reimbursement is received, if another storm damages the beaches during the 2023 hurricane season, the beach fund are depleted.\n\nThe TDC also approved these recommendation, which will come up for discussion at Tuesday's County Commissions meeting:\n\nVoted 9-0 to recommend not diverting further money from the beach fund for uses other than beach renourishment until that fund is once again solvent.\n\nVoted 9-0 to recommend increasing the maximum available grants for cultural organizations to $15,000 for those that attract 1,000 to 2,500 out-of-county attendees; $20,000 for those that attract 2,501 to 5,000 out-of-county attendees; and 25,000 for those that attract more than 5,000 out-of-county attendees. The current maximum grants are $10,000, $15,000 and $20,000, respectively.\n\nVoted 7-2 to continue to allow municipalities to be eligible for cultural grants, overriding an earlier recommendation of the TDC's Cultural Committee that municipalities should no longer be eligible for such grants. TDC Chair Rita Pritchett, who also chairs the County Commission, and Cultural Committee Chair Andrea Young, who is a member of the West Melbourne City Council, voted no. TDC member Rob Medina, who is mayor of Palm Bay, pushed for municipalities to continue to be eligible for such grants. Palm Bay was a cultural grant recipient for the current budget year.\n\nContact Berman at dberman@floridatoday.com, on Twitter at @bydaveberman and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/dave.berman.54", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2015/10/29/sandy-breaches-get-repair-prime-hook-refuge/74382488/", "title": "Beach replenishment changing Delaware shoreline", "text": "Molly Murray\n\nThe News Journal\n\nWhen Hurricane Sandy made landfall just north of Atlantic City three years ago, it swept away homes, beaches and dunes.\n\nBut the storm left another legacy: a shift in the approach state, federal and local regulators take to make shorelines storm ready and resilient.\n\nFrom New England to the Carolinas, dredges have pumped millions of cubic yards of sand, in the three years since Sandy struck, to build storm-ready beaches and form engineered sand dunes. The trend is coast-long, even in places where the strategy had been to allow nature to take its course.\n\nDelaware alone received $30 million in federal Sandy relief money to restore sand that was swept away during the hurricane in 2012. Another $38 million is being spent at Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge to restore wetlands and fill shoreline breaches that Sandy worsened.\n\nThe sand pumping there – in an area that federal officials had allowed to retreat as sand washed over into the adjacent marsh during storms – started last week.\n\nBut this new policy could be short-lived, said Howard Marlowe, with Warwick Group Consultants, a Washington-based consulting firm. Marlowe is an expert on beach rehabilitation funding, having lobbied on behalf of communities for several years. He has shifted his focus to a regional approach to shoreline management and to finding new sources of sand such as reuse of dredge spoils.\n\nHis predicts that when it comes time for maintenance and repairs of all these created beaches, there won't be enough federal money to go around.\n\n\"They'll be bumping into each other,\" he said of state and local governments who will be jockeying for a share of federal money. \"There's going to be a load of beaches between 2017 and 2020\" that will need maintenance and repairs – and that's without a significant storm or hurricane. \"There's going to be a significant lack of money if I had to bet on it.\"\n\nThat puts Delaware communities like Bethany and South Bethany – where as much of one-third of the protective sand dune was chopped off during a long-duration coastal storm earlier in October – in a predicament. The two communities are in line for federal maintenance sand pumping in 2017.\n\nAnthony P. Pratt, the state shoreline and waterway manager, said he isn't worried about availability of federal money for the Delaware projects. In each case, there is a 50-year contract for continued U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintenance.\n\n\"It really hasn't changed our world, at all,\" he said. All the projects that were initiated after Sandy were pre-approved, Pratt said.\n\nMarlowe has witnessed the struggle over money for beaches. He said it dates back to the Clinton administration, and the start of funding cuts for federal dollars for beach rehabilitation. Back then, there were fewer beaches in line for money. Among them: several in New Jersey, Florida and Ocean City, Maryland. These days – after emergency projects following Sandy – that funding pot may not be large enough to cover all the future repair needs.\n\nThe root of the problem, Marlowe said, is there isn't a federal coastal policy on beach renourishment. So while federal flood insurance may give people an incentive to build higher or farther from the sea, exactly where and how people build is controlled by local rules.\n\nHe believes states should work together on a regional basis to prioritize shoreline repair needs, reduce the cost of mobilizing dredge crews ( that mobilization cost can be significant) and work with federal agencies to find and use sand being removed as part of other projects.\n\nPratt said that before Sandy, officials in Delaware, Maryland, New York and New Jersey had started to work together but the effort was put on hold after the hurricane.\n\nThe idea, he said, was to find ways to make beach repairs more efficient by combining contracts to reduce overall costs.\n\nFowler Beach Fix\n\nAt Fowler Beach, there is a one-time effort to build a more storm resilient wetland and shoreline. Even before Sandy, lower Delaware Bay residents begged federal officials to fill the breaches along the bay shoreline.\n\n\"At first, it was a battle,\" said Jim Bailey, president of the Broadkill Beach Preservation Association, of the push by area residents, farmers and landowners to get federal officials to address the problem. \"Now it's a cooperative effort.\"\n\nThree years after Sandy, the Fowler Beach sand pumping project is the largest of the Delaware shoreline repair projects. The plan is to pump 1.1 million cubic yards of sand to fill a series of breaches and inlets blamed for flooding in nearby communities, killing trees in adjacent woods and flooding nearby farm fields with salt water. The repeated inundation prompted farmers to build earthen berms to keep the flood waters out.\n\nLast week, a survey boat made a final series of calculations and then a plug in the pipeline was removed. The pipe was primed with seawater and then, on Oct. 21, the first of the sand that will be pumped onto Fowler Beach, spilled through the pipeline. The area is southeast of Milford and is currently inaccessible. The road is closed while the dredging work is underway. Eventually, federal refuge officials may install a footpath into the restored area.\n\n\"In the beginning, it was a battle,\" said Jim Bailey, president of the Broadkill Beach Preservation Association, of the push by area residents, farmers and landowners to get federal officials to address the problem. \"Now it's a cooperative effort.\"\n\nThe plan, said Bart Wilson, the project manager for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, is to work north first and then shift to the south to fill the largest in a series of breaches between Fowler and Prime Hook beaches.\n\nWhile the Fowler Beach breach opened during previous storms – the first was in 2008 – it was worsened during Sandy. Today, it is more an inlet than a breach, sending water into and out of the marsh with every high and low tide on Delaware Bay.\n\n\"We have the Prime Hook Sound,\" now, Bailey said.\n\nOnce the breach formed, water flooded a manmade water holding structure originally designed to draw in ducks and geese during migration each fall. The area became a rich habitat for ducks that favored fresh and brackish water.\n\nBut once the shoreline was breached, the old structure flooded with water from Delaware Bay, the freshwater vegetation died and the structure of the marsh crumbled. In storms, saltwater followed the old drainage ditch system and flooded low-lying farm fields adjacent to the refuge. The salty water limited the crops that would grow.\n\nBailey said this restoration project will help property owners to the north in Slaughter Beach, to the south in Prime Hook and Broadkill beaches and also help area farmers.\n\nThe $38 million cost includes shifting drainage in several of the refuge marsh units to restore historic channels and allow the marshes to revert back to historic, tidal salt and brackish marshes. Federal officials believe that will make the marsh system more resilient during coastal storms and improve drainage. Salt tolerant grasses will be planted to help the wetlands built and keep pace with sea level.\n\nOne of the landmarks in the area – the foundation of a tower that dated back to WWII – now sits several feet offshore in deep water. It will be covered in sand, said Bart Wilson, the project manager for the federal agency.\n\nThe plan is to create a 220-foot-wide beach in the area, with a 40-foot wide dune that will taper into the adjacent marsh to the west. The dune will be 9-feet above mean sea level, said Al Rizzo, The Fish & Wildlife Service Coastal Delaware project leader for Bombay Hook and Prime Hook national wildlife refuges. The dune height is based on remnant dunes in the area, he said.\n\n\"We're crossing our fingers and praying we don't get a nor'easter or hurricane in the next five years,\" Rizzo said.\n\nThat will give thousands of sprigs of beach grass time to establish on the manmade dune and build resiliency.\n\nThe dune will taper into the adjacent marsh.\n\nThe area is one of the most dynamic along Delaware's coast. The remains of a bird viewing platform constructed less than a decade ago behind the dune, are now in deep water just off the beach. A series of studies found that manipulation of the area marsh over the last several decades kept it from keeping pace with sea level rise. Many of Delaware's coastal marshes are keeping pace with sea level rise by adding fractions of inches of decomposing plant matter year after year. Those marshes retreat naturally as waves cause the sand to over wash into the wetland and form a new beach just to the west. That didn't happen at Fowler Beach because the adjacent marsh flooded, the plants died and deep inlets were cut over the last several years. Rather than a beach, a mucky layer of exposed peat edged the shoreline.\n\nHurricane Sandy worsened the damage that had already occurred.\n\nThis massive marsh and beach restoration is designed as a demonstration project on coastal and marsh resilience in a refuge system. It is also designed to protect and restore thousands of acres of habitat at the refuge.\n\nRizzo said the project took two years to design, using sophisticated modeling to guide the marsh drainage work. Earlier this summer, crews started work on a plan to improve the drainage in the marsh system by clearing sand from the network of historic drainage channels.\n\nThe beach repairs could be completed as early as this spring with all of the work finished by October 2016, Wilson said.\n\nRizzo said the sand pumping contract is $14 million. Additional money will be spent to plant the rebuilt dune. The total project cost is $38 million from federal Sandy relief money.\n\nOther repair sites\n\nDelaware's other major Sandy repair projects are mostly complete, save for work on projects at two state wildlife refuges in Kent County.\n\nOne of the most iconic images after Hurricane Sandy in Delaware was of the damage at the north side of Indian River Inlet bridge. There, the approach road from the old bridge was destroyed by waves and storm surge – confirming the long-held fear that the old bridge was vulnerable and a new one needed.\n\nSince Sandy, both the approach road and the old bridge have been removed. State transportation contractors removed thousands of cubic yards of sand from the roadway and used it to rebuild the storm-flattened dune. In addition, they pounded steel-sheeting into the sand just east of the roadway to protect it from future storm damage. More sand was pumped from a bar in the inlet onto the north inlet beach to create a wider buffer for the new bridge approach road.\n\nElsewhere along the ocean coast, sand was pumped in to replace the losses at Rehoboth and Dewey beaches, Bethany and South Bethany and Fenwick Island. Total cost: $30 million.\n\nThe state received an additional $6.9 million for habitat restoration along the Delaware Bayshore.\n\nAt Mispillion Harbor, where the plan is to rebuild shorebird and horseshoe crab habitat by creating more sandy beach, state officials are ready to apply for state and federal permits.\n\n\"The whole point is to improve habitat for spawning horseshoe crabs and red knot\" shorebirds, said Karen Bennett, who administers the state's Delaware Bayshore initiative.\n\nThe existing rock wall at Mispillion Harbor will be raised three-feet higher than it is now to keep waves and storm high tides from topping it. An area that has breached in the past will be angled into an existing sand dune to prevent future breaching.\n\nThe idea is to recreate the habitat in the area as it looked in the 1940s and '50s, said Jeremey Ashe, the restoration project manager.\n\nSmall structures perpendicular to the rock wall will be built to help hold the sand in place, he said. The two final parts of the Mispillion project will be to fill an old ditch to create a tidal marsh and try a small, experimental project to create about two acres of shorebird roosting habitat in the old Fitzgerald Marsh to the west of the harbor.\n\nTo the north, at Milford Neck, the state, The Nature Conservancy and Delaware Wild Lands are working together to come up with a plan to restore the marsh to a more natural drainage system. Like most tidal wetlands in Delaware, the marshes at Milford Neck were cut with ditches to drain them and reduce mosquito populations.\n\nBennett said state officials know that coastal storms and flooding are inevitable so the idea with this project is to restore drainage so when flooding does happen, the water doesn't inundate the western edge of the marsh – the buffer between the marsh and the uplands. When that happens, saltwater kills the trees and vegetation, she said.\n\nAt the Ted Harvey State Wildlife Area east of Dover, state officials are planning a restoration of the existing impoundment, a manmade structure that holds water during times where birds are migrating through the area. The existing dike between the impoundment and Delaware Bay dates back to the 1960s, Ashe said.\n\nThe dike will be raised two to three feet to make it higher and less likely to be breached during coastal storms. A pumping system to raise and lower water levels will also be upgraded.\n\nAt Little Creek Wildlife Area, state officials are looking at how to make the impoundments there more storm resilient.The best strategy may be to create a buffer for future sea level rise but modeling work is still underway. The shoreline to the east is no longer a sandy beach and part of a restoration there, Ashe said, might eventually include restoration of a sand shoreline.\n\nAs a final state project, state wildlife officials are working with the state Department of Transportation to restore Port Mahon Road. The road ends at a boat launch ramp and parking lot but is especially vulnerable to storm and flood damage.\n\nFederal money to replace lost sand\n\nFor beaches alone, this breakdown of federal spending to replace sand losses from Sandy:\n\n509,000 cubic yards at Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach -- $9,172,794\n\n440,000 cubic yards at the north side of Indian River Inlet -- $6.6 million\n\n536,000 cubic yards at Bethany-South Bethany -- $7,832,731\n\n368,000 cubic yards at Fenwick Island -- $4,319,254\n\n22,000 cubic yards along the Delaware Bay at Lewes -- $752,420\n\nSource: Army Corps of Engineers\n\nReach Molly Murray at 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

The 14.5-mile south beaches area stretches from Spessard Holland Park south to Sebastian Inlet.\n\nThe proposal calls for the grant program to be suspended for the 2023-24 budget year that begins Oct. 1, with no new grant applications accepted.\n\nPreviously approved grants for the current 2022-23 budget year would not be affected. In fact, commissioners also are being asked to give nine grant recipients for 2022-23 an extra year to complete their projects.\n\nThere was a wide range of projects approved for funding for this year, includes ones dealing with seagrass restoration, improving the clam and oyster populations in the lagoon, and removal of derelict boats from waterways.\n\nLatest estimates indicate that beach repairs in the south beaches for the 2022 storms will total $22.49 million, which will use all beach funds and reserves, plus require an additional $6.44 million to be drawn from federal American Rescue Plan Act funds that the county received. County commissioners approved that ARPA fund allocation on Dec. 6.\n\nCounty officials are hoping that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, in conjunction with the Florida Division of Emergency Management, will reimburse the county for much of the storm damage work along the south beaches. But FEMA reimbursement could take two to three years.\n\n\"We're in a precarious situation, with respect to beach funding,\" said hotel owner and Tourist Development Council Vice Chair Tom Hermansen, who proposed the moratorium on the lagoon grant program.\n\nSupport from Commission Chair Pritchett\n\nBrevard County Commission Chair Rita Pritchett, who also chairs the Tourist Development Council, voted with the other eight TDC members in favor of the change. Pritchett told TDC members that she anticipated there would be County Commission support for the change as well, as that move also has the backing of Brevard County Natural Resources Management Department Director Virginia Barker.\n\nBarker's department received grants for three projects under the program for 2022-23, totaling $549,300.\n\nIn a presentation to the TDC, Mike McGarry, beaches, boating and waterways program manager for the Natural Resources Management Department, said most of the south beaches restoration work is expected to be completed in the current budget year. But that area also might require several million dollars more in the 2023-24 budget year for required dune vegetation planting and ongoing environmental monitoring.\n\nThe south beaches renourishment work is underway, and will continue through April 30, McGarry said. Any work that remains would begin on Nov. 1. Beach work is halted during turtle nesting season from May 1 through Oct. 31.\n\nLagoon sales tax update:Lagoon committee OK's millions in cleanup plan\n\nAny action to temporarily suspend the Tourism + Indian River Lagoon Grant Program would have no impact on a much-larger county program to provide money for projects aimed at improving the condition of the lagoon.\n\nThat program is funded by a special half-percent Save Our Indian River Lagoon sales tax that was approved by Brevard County voters in 2016. The lagoon tax raises about $50 million a year.\n\n$70 million hit to other beaches\n\nSeparately, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers likely will pay for most of the renourishment work on Brevard beaches south of Patrick Space Force Base but north of the south beaches ― sections known as the midreach and south reach.\n\nMcGarry said the latest Army Corps of Engineers estimates indicate that those areas sustained about $70 million in total damages from the 2022 storms. That's an increase from a previous estimate of $45 million.\n\nBeach repair work on those areas that total 11.4 miles is expected to take place from November 2023 through April 2024, McGarry said.\n\nSpace Coast Office of Tourism Executive Director Peter Cranis said every dollar spent from the tourist tax's beach fund for beach restoration has an average return on investment of $9 from federal and state funding.\n\nIn addition, McGarry said beach-related tourism has an more than $1 billion-a-year positive economic impact on the Brevard County.\n\nContact Berman at dberman@floridatoday.com, on Twitter at @bydaveberman and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/dave.berman.54", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/13/raiding-tourism-fund-wont-solve-indian-river-lagoon-issue-opinion/514886002/", "title": "Raiding tourism fund won't solve the Indian River Lagoon issue ...", "text": "Ben Malik\n\nGuest columnist\n\nThe current Indian River lagoon condition took over 50 years to reach this point. In 2016, Brevard County voters passed a half-penny sales tax increase to assist in cleanup efforts. This tax is expected to generate $340 million over 10 years.\n\nThat sounds like a lot of money. But based upon the cost of recent storm water projects, county officials estimate it would cost $1,000 per pound of nitrogen removed — or $1.39 billion — for municipalities along the lagoon to eliminate the 1.39 million pounds the Environmental Protection Agency and the state propose over 15 years from northern Volusia County to the Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach County.\n\nThe cost to cure all of the storm water and sewer plant upgrades will require state and federal funding and I encourage residents to write to their elected officials to support these efforts.\n\nSome state and county officials have called for redirecting some of the Brevard County hotel bed tax funds for infrastructure projects. In simple math this does not come close to solving the lagoon problem.\n\nMore:Not again: Dreaded fish kill begins in Brevard\n\nMore:Brevard environmental officials prepare for dealing with major fish kill\n\nThe bed tax generated $13.6 million last year and these funds are used for promotion of tourism and capital projects related to tourism. Raiding this fund doesn’t solve the gap between the estimated $1.39 billion dollar cost to cure the lagoon. In addition, it will actually hurt the half-penny sales tax fund used for the lagoon as approximately 25 percent of the collected sales taxes are from tourists. Tourist spending equals approximately $10 million in sales tax proceeds. This doesn’t make any economic sense.\n\nWe still need to find the exact cause of increased nitrogen in the lagoon. Studies indicate a very direct correlation to human waste as research by Dr. Brian LaPointe at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute at Florida Atlantic University points to evidence of sewage-driven eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. We have our very own Dr. Duane DeFreese, director of the Indian River Lagoon Council and fellow waterman and surfer, working in conjunction with Florida Tech and others to solve this problem.\n\nIf we desire to solve the problem, let’s look at long-term funding by allocating actual dollar amounts needed to cure the problem.\n\nBrevard County's state Sen. Debbie Mayfield filed Senate Bill 786, which would have annually allocated $50 million for certain projects related to Indian River Lagoon. The bill died in the Senate and a similar Florida House Bill 339 filed by Rep. Gayle Harrell also failed in committee. These bills would have been a start to bridging the estimated $1.39 billion cost to cure. Local cities must look at sewer and wastewater fees to ensure the costs for these services are sufficient to upgrade their plants.\n\nBrevard County taxpayers have stepped up and passed sales tax to help the lagoon. I encourage all the other impacted counties to pass similar measures to solve the problem. Going after the tourism bed tax, which is a vital economic engine in Florida, will not fix the problem. If anything, I would suggest considering an additional penny of tourism bed tax to be set aside for specific infrastructure, beach, safety and capital projects. This potentially generates $3.2 million per year and frees up some funds from county and cities’operating budgets to deal with deferred infrastructure projects.\n\nClean water has no party affiliation as it is a vital natural and economic interest for all of us. Even if you don’t care about the environment (as a surfer I absolutely do), one should care about the tax revenue generated by waterfront properties and the economic impact of boating, fishing and water recreation activities, which is estimated at over $3.7 billion, according to the EPA.\n\nBen Malik is the mayor of Cocoa Beach.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/06/01/bridges-martin-st-lucie-indian-river-florida-department-of-transportation-structurally-deficient/7243858001/", "title": "FDOT: Bridges in Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River need repair, replaced", "text": "Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin counties undertake replacement projects\n\nNearly 40 bridges on Treasure Coast don't meet current design standards\n\nFinding funds for repairs can be a big challenge for local departments\n\nRepairs or replacements are needed for 10 structurally deficient bridges on the Treasure Coast, according to the Florida Department of Transportation's most recent report.\n\nThose bridges vary in the severity of problems.

The community is asking Florida for $216,000 next year to help pay for a study required before a planned $23 million beach renourishment project can add sand to their beach.\n\n“Most people feel we need beach replenishment because they’ve lived through the bad. They’ve seen it,” said Bob Garfield, 78, a resident of the beach community for nearly 25 years.\n\nBut the Manasota Key study, and maybe more than a dozen other beach and inlet projects, are unlikely to get the state assistance they need this year, even with Gov. Rick Scott’s proposal last week to double spending to $50 million to renourish Florida's shrinking shores.\n\nRelated story: Gov. Rick Scott proposes doubling state's beach aid to $50 million\n\nBeach advocates were elated by Scott’s proposal, which is twice the $25 million he’s called for each of the past four years. But even if lawmakers sign on, it would be just the first step to reversing years of neglect of Florida’s most valuable natural asset by state leaders.\n\nThe proposed $50 million, on top of $77 million to fully fund Florida’s share of the tab to repair coasts damaged by hurricanes last year, is the clearest sign yet from Tallahassee leaders of a renewed interest in protecting the state's beaches since the Naples Daily News published its “Shrinking Shores” series in November.\n\nThe series documented how the state has not delivered on funding commitments and has left some beach communities out of the annual funding mix.\n\nShrinking Shores: Every year, Florida loses more of its beaches\n\nRepairing Florida’s shoreline will require more than a one-time bump in spending. Just as important as finding more money, beach advocates say, is finding a dedicated funding source.\n\nAnd, they say, the state still needs to address the method by which the Florida Department of Environmental Protection scores and ranks projects — a process many believe is flawed.\n\nA first step\n\nIf approved by lawmakers, $50 million would be the biggest appropriation in more than a decade to Florida’s beaches, which generate billions of dollars in state revenue every year.\n\n“I think it speaks to this governor’s commitment and I think it will be a precedent for future governors,” Debbie Flack, president of the Florida Shore & Beach Preservation Association, said of Scott’s budget.\n\nBut for Florida’s beach advocates, increasing beach funding this year is only the start. In addition to finding more beach money, they also want beach funding to be more predictable.\n\nIn 1998, lawmakers tied beach funding to a real estate transaction tax. But that money was swallowed up by a catch-all environmental trust fund created after voters approved Amendment 1 in 2014, restructuring state money for conservation and water quality projects.\n\nBeaches now compete with other environmental projects for money.\n\nOf the $50 million Scott proposed, only $10 million would be recurring dollars from the trust fund. The remaining $40 million would come from general revenue and isn’t recurring.\n\nFlack said more predictable state money for beaches would make it easier to attract matching federal dollars and would give local governments a more reliable match for their beach money.\n\nShrinking Shores: How Florida leaders are failing the state’s famous beaches\n\nReworking the way DEP ranks projects to get state money is the focus of another push in Tallahassee this year.\n\nDEP decides how local beach projects rank by assigning projects up to 115 points among 29 criteria. A point or two can determine whether a community receives state money.\n\nSome local beach managers argue the process unfairly favors big projects over smaller ones, penalizes worthy projects that don’t receive federal money and undervalues the economic impact of beaches by ignoring the tax revenue they provide to a community.\n\nState Senate Appropriations Chairman Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, is expected to file a bill this week that would change how Florida manages its beaches. State Rep. Kathleen Peters, R-Treasure Island, and state Rep. George Moriatis, R-Fort Lauderdale, are expected to file a companion bill in the House.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the 227 miles of critically eroded shores already part of Florida’s beach program, the state needs to consider growing the program to provide assistance to another 184 miles of beach the DEP recognizes as critically eroded but hasn’t provided aid to renourish, Flack said.\n\nThose 184 miles include beaches like Manasota Key in Charlotte County and Flagler Beach, which lost a mile of road and saw significant flooding after Hurricane Matthew buzzsawed Northeast Florida in October.\n\n“I was really shocked to see how poorly those areas performed that had no history of maintaining their beaches. It was like a laser pinpoint,” Flack said. “Matthew showed you where our beaches had been neglected.”\n\nBack on track\n\nTo Flack, Scott’s $50 million spending proposal for beaches is an opportunity to put the state’s beach program back on the steady ground lawmakers set it on nearly 20 years ago.\n\nIn 1998, the state Legislature passed a law committing to spending at least $30 million each year on beach renourishment.\n\nSimply adjusting for inflation, beach advocates argue that $30 million should be closer to $50 million today. That doesn’t take into account the increased miles of critically eroded shoreline added to the program in the last 20 years or the spike in renourishment costs as offshore sand sources have become harder to find and more beach communities turn to expensive truck haul projects to rebuild their coasts.\n\n“This is really just a $20 million addition to a program that was based at $30 million in 1998 and is falling woefully behind,” Flack said.\n\nInstead of maintaining that $30 million commitment, Florida’s governors and legislators in some years lowballed the beaches. In the heart of the recession, they changed the law to reduce the obligation.\n\nShrinking Shores: Florida reneges on pledges to its beaches\n\nOver the last decade, beaches have received as little as $16.3 million annually from the state. Last year the Legislature approved $32 million for the beach program, in a year when local governments requested nearly $98 million — leaving a backlog of about $66 million.\n\nLatvala, the Senate appropriations chairman who has made increasing funding for beaches to at least $50 million a top priority, said Scott’s proposal “might help get us there.”\n\n“If he starts higher than he started in the past, hopefully we’ll be able to participate in going higher,” Latvala said. “There’s not any new money that we’ve discovered that’s fallen down from the sky, but in terms of splitting what we’ve got, to have him putting a little more attention on it certainly helps.”\n\nGetting $50 million from the House could be a heavier lift.\n\nBen Albritton, R-Wauchula, chairman of the House natural resources appropriations subcommittee that oversees beach spending, said he will do the “best I can for beaches.” Even though he represents an inland district, Albritton too has been an advocate for the state’s beaches.\n\n“I think what (Scott’s proposal) shows is that the governor is certainly showing a greater interest in beaches this cycle than he has in the past, and I congratulate him for that,” Albritton said. “That doesn’t mean that we’ll be on the same page at the end of the day.”\n\nMoriatis, vice chairman of the House appropriations committee, said the attention from the “Shrinking Shores” series and Scott’s backing make getting $50 million “more likely” this year.\n\n“I think there’s more momentum to do it,” he said.\n\nIn the money\n\nLocal governments requested $73 million in state aid this year for 26 beach projects and seven inlet projects. Manasota Key’s feasibility study is ranked 24th, near the very bottom of the beach list.\n\nEven at $50 million, getting money for that project and more than a dozen others will be a tall order.\n\nManasota Key’s low ranking wasn’t a surprise to Charlotte County Engineer Joanne Vernon. The state gives greater priority to construction projects that put sand on a beach over requests like hers for a study, even though feasibility studies are required before construction can begin, she said.\n\n“Once we have permits in hand, it will definitely improve,” she said of the project’s ranking.\n\nShrinking Shores: Florida sand shortage leaves beaches in lurch\n\nCharlotte County leaders aren’t expecting to add new sand to the Manasota Key beach until spring 2019 at the earliest. In the meantime, they’re trying to expedite permits so residents can build more seawalls.\n\n“We are doing everything we can to move this project along as quickly as possible,” she said. “Any help we can give (residents) to make their permitting easier, we will do what we can.”\n\nHow far Scott’s proposed $50 million would go depends on how the state handles the biggest request for state aid — $19.2 million to build a trap to keep sand out of Port Everglades in Broward County.\n\nFully funded, that project, the highest-ranked inlet project, would eat up more than a third of the $50 million. The DEP ranks beach and inlet projects separately, but funds them with the same pot of money.\n\nAnother sand trap project at Fort Pierce in St. Lucie County is ranked third on the inlet priority list and the state’s share would be $2.5 million.\n\nFlack, with the beach preservation association, said both projects will keep sand in areas that otherwise need frequent renourishment.\n\n“It’s an important part of a successful beach management strategy that we have not funded because of the cost,” she said.\n\nFlorida law requires at least 10 percent of the total appropriated for beaches go to the three highest-ranked inlet projects, which total about $23 million this year. If lawmakers fully fund the top three inlet projects, the money left for beach projects would run out at the 11th ranked project, a beach renourishment at Boca Raton.\n\nIn addition to the Manasota Key project, feasibility studies for Vero Beach in Indian River County and for South Ponte Vedra, Vilano Beach and Summer Haven beaches in St. Johns County likely won’t make the funding cut. Nor will most of the 11 projects proposed by Palm Beach County and its municipalities.\n\nDan Bates, Palm Beach County’s deputy director of environmental resources, said he’s still encouraged his projects could be reimbursed in coming years if funding were to increase.\n\n“It's cumulative,” Bates said of the beach program. “Even if we don’t get it this year, maybe we’ll get it next year because there will be fewer projects on the list next year.”\n\nIn Southwest Florida, Lee County’s request to be reimbursed $175,000 for a 2014 Bonita Beach renourishment — the 10th ranked beach project — would be on the bubble with $50 million.\n\n\"Our expectation is it will take an overall increased funding amount from the state in order for a project like Bonita Beach to have a reasonable expectation of receiving money,\" said Steve Boutelle, Lee’s natural resources manager.\n\nCollier County didn’t request state aid this year after completing a renourishment project in December.\n\nAt the top of this year’s beach list — and likely to receive aid — is a St. Johns County request for $100,000 to design a renourishment project along three miles of coast north of St. Augustine Inlet. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is preparing to add sand there this year as part of a $20 million federal project, 80 percent of which will be paid for by the federal government.\n\nShrinking Shores: Matthew's lessons for Florida's beaches\n\nGulf County, which has the second ranked project on the list, is asking for $5 million in state money to help fund a $14 million renourishment on Florida’s fastest eroding shoreline at Cape San Blas.\n\n“We’re counting on it,” said Warren Yeager, who manages the Gulf County program that will chip in Deepwater Horizon oil spill restoration money for the beach project. “We really need to get this project done in 2017.”\n\nIf lawmakers failed to put enough money into the beach aid program to help Cape San Blas, the county would have to “back up and punt,” Yeager said.\n\nLast April, residents of Cape San Blas reversed a previous vote and agreed to tax themselves to raise about $4 million in required matching money for the project.\n\nGulf County beach advocate Pat Hardman said the struggle for matching money and a \"brutal\" permitting process have left the Cape San Blas beach in \"critical condition.\"\n\n\"The process and the system is broken,\" she said.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nHere are the Top 10 beach projects on the DEP's priority list for funding in 2017-18:\n\nSt. Johns County Shore Protection $100,000\n\nSt. Joseph Peninsula Beach Renourishment-Gulf County $5 million\n\nPanama City Beaches Shore Protection $4.6 million\n\nSunny Isles Shore Protection-Dade County $2.5 million\n\nCortez Groins Replacement-Manatee County $793,000\n\nJupiter/Carlin Shore Protection-Palm Beach County $160,000\n\nTreasure Island Shore Protection-Pinellas County $2.5 million\n\nCentral Boca Raton Beach Renourishment $3.2 million\n\nSouth Siesta Key Beach Renourishment $6 million\n\nBonita Beach Renourishment $175,000\n\nHere are the Top 3 inlet management projects on the DEP's priority list for funding in 2017-18:\n\nPort Everglades-Broward County $19.2 million\n\nEast Pass-Okaloosa County $263,000\n\nFort Pierce Inlet-St. Lucie County $2.5 million", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/indian-river-county/2024/10/28/sebastian-inlet-state-park-north-jetty-closed-for-storm-damage-repairs/75892390007/", "title": "Sebastian Inlet State Park north jetty closed for storm damage repairs", "text": "The battle-scarred north jetty at Sebastian Inlet State Park has been worn by various storms, most recently Hurricane Milton, which pummeled the state Oct. 9.

News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — Nearly half of all third-graders in Delaware cannot read at grade level.\n\nIn 17 low-income ZIP codes in Wilmington, Dover, and western and central Sussex County, that rate increases to 63%. More than half of 8- and 9-year-olds living in those neighborhoods can't get through books like Charlotte's Web or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory without help.\n\nJayden Bowers is a third-grader at New Castle Elementary School. He has to sound out a lot of words before he can recognize them. He's making progress every day with the help of one-on-one tutors from Reading Assist, a nonprofit dedicated to teaching the foundations of reading to struggling students.\n\n\"I'm not that kind of a good reader,\" the 8-year-old said. \"Some people don't know some words.\"\n\nOn Thursday, for instance, he slowly sounded out the word \"squint,\" at first pronouncing each individual letter, then squishing them together.\n\nS - q - u - i - n - t.\n\nS - qu - i - n - t.\n\nS - qu - in - t.\n\nSqui - nt.\n\nSquint.\n\nWhen most people hear the word \"literacy,\" they think of the ability to read and to write.\n\nBut the issue goes beyond that.\n\nAsk someone in education, someone tasked with imparting those skills onto young children, and you'll get a much more complex definition.\n\n\"There's a lot of parts to literacy,\" said Vickie Innes, executive director of Reading Assist. \"You must be able to first read what's written on the page. You must be able to read it accurately and fluently and comprehend it. You must have vocabulary knowledge so you can comprehend and understand it.\n\n\"All those different parts make you a proficient reader.\"\n\nProficiency — that's what state and national tests measure and use as an indicator of students' overall literacy. Just being able to read words on a page isn't enough, state experts said, though students like Bowers struggle even with that.\n\nStudents must also be able to decode text and explain what it means, in both very simple and very complex terms.\n\n\"It's not just reading and writing,\" Innes said.\n\nReading Assist is just one group teaching kids how to read.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Way teamed up with the state Education Department to launch the Delaware Campaign for Grade-Level Reading. The goal is to bring together state government, nonprofits like Reading Assist, foundations, schools and other groups to improve literacy in Delaware.\n\n\"A child's ability to read on grade level is an important indicator of school success and high school graduation,\" said Michelle Taylor, president and CEO of United Way of Delaware. \"If there's anything we can do to set us on a good trajectory for the future, it's to make sure every kid, every child, can read on grade level.\"\n\nKishayla Payne-Miller, a student adviser at Bower's school, said reading is by far one of the most important skills anyone can have.\n\n\"There's not a day that goes by that I don't have to read something whether it be an email a text or reading to make myself more proficient at my job,\" she said. \"Reading to me is the root of everything you do in life.\"\n\nWhat are the facts?\n\nConversations around literacy are often tethered to the third grade.\n\n“That’s kind of the turning point where kids go from learning to read … to reading to learn,” said Janice Barlow, director of KIDS COUNT Delaware. The data center is part of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a large national nonprofit that monitors literacy in the United States and launched the national Campaign for Grade-Level Reading.\n\nIf you look at recent state test scores, only 52% of third-graders were reading at grade level in 2017, down from 54% in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThose numbers are much more favorable than those reported by the Nation’s Report Card for Delaware, raising the question of just how far behind Delaware has fallen in terms of literacy.\n\nAccording to the Report Card, which tests kids in fourth grade instead of third, only 37% of students were reading at grade level in 2015, compared to the national average of 36%.\n\nMore:Kids are better readers than they were more than a decade ago\n\nMore:Delaware high school staff save student's life twice\n\nDelaware, when compared to the rest of the United States, falls squarely in the middle, tied for 21st place with Maryland, Montana, North Dakota and Wisconsin in reading proficiency.\n\nStudents of color and low-income students performed much worse, according to the data.\n\nOnly 21% of black students were at grade level according to the Report Card, while 22% of Hispanic students were. Similarly, only 21% of low-income students were proficient in reading.\n\nResearch shows third-grade literacy has an enormous impact on students’ lives – a child who can read at grade level by third grade is four times more likely to graduate on time.\n\nAdd poverty to the mix, and a student is 13 times less likely to graduate on time.\n\n“If they’re struggling at the end of third grade, they’re going to struggle even more later in school,” said Donna Johnson, executive director of the State Board of Education. “Those students that don’t graduate on time or drop out have a much lower lifelong earning potential.”\n\nJust living in a high-poverty neighborhood can exacerbate the ill effects of poor reading skills and family poverty. More than a third of students with all three risk factors fail to finish high school, according to a \"double jeopardy\" study of third-grade reading proficiency.\n\nEven living in a high-poverty neighborhood for a short amount of time can have an impact – the study showed students continued to perform poorly after they moved.\n\nWhat are the barriers?\n\n“By the age of 3, a 30-million word gap exists between children from the wealthiest families and those who are economically disadvantaged,” Delaware Secretary of Education Susan Bunting said.\n\nSchool leaders and the state are quick to point out some of those students suffer undiagnosed physical, emotional, or learning challenges, live in unstable situations, are often absent, and may not benefit from after-school or summer learning experiences that enrich the lives of peers.\n\nYvette Davenport, a literacy coach at Booker T. Washington Elementary School in Dover, said it's not all the parents' fault.\n\nThink back 30 years. Many kindergarten classes emphasized socialization and learning through structured play, versus heavy academics.\n\nToday, children are expected to do more than ever before by age 5 or 6.\n\n\"A lot of parents don't realize the amount of work we do in kindergarten,\" Davenport said. \"It's different than it was when they went to school.\"\n\nSome people refer to kindergarten as \"the new first grade,\" and a study by researchers at the University of Virginia says in many ways it is.\n\nThere's a much heavier focus on reading and math, while time spent on things like art and playtime have decreased.\n\nTeachers in 2010 were about 33% more likely than teachers in 1998 to say kids should start kindergarten already prepared with two of the basics: their ABCs, and how to properly handle a pencil, according to the study.\n\nIn 1998, 31% of teachers said by the time a child leaves kindergarten, they should know how to read. In 2010, that figure had increased to 80%.\n\nThat's a significant change, and some parents haven't caught up.\n\nHigher standards aren't necessarily a bad thing but do mean kids may need to go to preschool or start learning to read at home if they want to start out on the right foot.\n\nDavenport suggested holding workshops for parents to make sure they know expectations, but did acknowledge the fact some families have a hard time affording preschool or early learning.\n\nKids from families with a stay-at-home mom or dad are often the furthest behind, Davenport said, because those children usually don't go to preschool.\n\nStacey Treut, a literacy coach at New Castle Elementary School, where Bowers goes, said students can't really be expected to know how to read before kindergarten.\n\n\"Learning to read is very complex,\" she said. \"If your brain is not ready when you are at the very beginning stages of kindergarten, then you're not ready to put those letters and sounds together.\n\nShe and Payne-Miller, the student adviser, dispelled the idea that it's only low-income students that struggle or that some students don't know how to read simply because their parents didn't expose them to enough words before kindergarten.\n\nThey see kids from just about every kind of socio-economic background struggle.\n\nThat's one of the reasons the Colonial School District partners with Reading Assist, which provides tutors through AmeriCorps, a service agency that uses federal grant money to place volunteers in programs that meet the goal of \"helping others and meeting critical needs in the community.\"\n\nReading Assist Intervention Corps members spend 45 minutes a day, five days a week with students like Bowers teaching the “mechanics of reading\" to children who struggle to connect letters and their related sounds, impairing their ability to \"decode” words and read fluently.\n\nReading difficulties affect about 20% of all students in any classroom and severely impact about 5%, according to Reading Assist.\n\n\"There's just too many children and not enough hands to do all the work,\" said Kim Phillips, director of professional development for Reading Assist.\n\nTreut said the Colonial School District is fortunate to have two reading specialists in every school as well as reading coaches, but that even with those support staff it's hard to spend time with kids one on one.\n\n\"It probably could be done in the school system, but something else would have to be sacrificed,\" Payne-Miller said.\n\nUltimately it comes down to money and staffing, which thanks to state budget woes, are in short supply.\n\n\"With the number of students that need this type of intervention, you'd never be able to do it with the existing school staff,\" said Innes, the program's director.\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nReading Assist's Reading Corps program, which has been piloted for two years in the Colonial School District, was recently accredited, and the nonprofit now hopes to roll it out to students all over Delaware.\n\nBut experts say targeted interventions are only one piece of the puzzle.\n\nDelaware's Campaign for Grade-Level Reading will focus on five areas, United Way's Taylor said, which she thinks can change the trajectory for Delaware's kids:\n\n1. Increasing the number of early screenings to detect physical, emotional, and/or learning barriers in children.\n\n2. Improving academic achievement.\n\n3. Reducing chronic student absenteeism.\n\n4. Reducing summer learning loss.\n\n5. Increasing the number of degreed professionals in the early childhood workforce.\n\nNone of these areas of focus are particularly new. The state and various nonprofits have been targeting them for years.\n\nTaylor thinks that by creating a statewide coalition, the campaign will be able to effect widespread change. Too many groups and state agencies use the \"spray and pray\" model, she said, throwing resources at the community in hopes of creating positive outcomes.\n\nOften, they see limited success or are only able to turn things around in small pockets of Delaware, Taylor said. There is little discussion about how to replicate successful programs or how to reallocate resources so they have broader impact.\n\n\"It's fragmented,\" Taylor said. \"And it doesn't work.\"\n\nTaylor says the campaign will hold regular meetings to discuss a more coordinated approach. Topics could include expanding after-school and summer programming by the Boys & Girls Club of Delaware and the Summer Learning Collaborative statewide or holding kindergarten sign-ups at local churches and nonprofits.\n\n\"Sometimes kids don't sign up for kindergarten on time so they start school late,\" Taylor said.\n\nShe also talked about the importance of meeting families' basic needs so that they can focus more attention on their children's education.\n\nExpanding the reach of Delaware 2-1-1 – a free, confidential referral and information helpline and website that connects people from all communities and of all ages to essential health and human services – could be one solution.\n\n\"You've got to deal with the basic needs stuff first,\" Taylor said.\n\nThe State Board of Education will be part of the new coalition and launched its own literacy campaign in 2014.\n\nReading proficiency rates have not significantly increased since then, according to The Nation's Report Card.\n\nOne of the group's main areas of focus was launching the Delaware Campaign for Grade-Level Reading, which with the help of United Way it has now accomplished.\n\nIt has also worked to bolster teacher prep programs and licensing requirements so educators are specifically trained in the science of teaching reading. Another area of focus is early learning centers, which have taken on an increasingly important role in preparing kids for kindergarten.\n\nStill, according to Delaware's fall 2016 Early Learner Survey, only 67% of all incoming kindergartners could recognize and name as many as 10 letters. Only 54% could follow multi-step directions and use long sentences to describe things.\n\nOnly 43% of kindergartners could count to 20.\n\nDennis Loftus, president of the State Board, said despite Head Start grants, stricter licensing requirements and incentive programs like Delaware Stars for Early Success, there are still too many facilities that act as little more than babysitting services.\n\nOne of the challenges, he said, is that it takes money for people to get degrees and learn how to teach kids basic literacy skills.\n\nNot everyone comes into the field with that knowledge.\n\nThe case for early learning is rooted in research that suggests much of the human brain develops before kids are old enough to enter kindergarten. Delaware has poured millions of dollars over the past few years into getting more kids, especially those from at-risk families, into good early learning centers, and this year received a $7.65 million grant to aid those efforts.\n\nCurrently, about 59% of low-income early learners are enrolled in high-quality early learning programs, according to the Delaware Early Childhood Council. That's up from 5% in 2011.\n\nDelaware has 67,700 children birth to five years old total, and 42% of those are considered at risk of falling behind in school because of their socioeconomic status.\n\n“Delaware is committed to aligning birth to grade 3 services throughout the state to benefit children now and for the long term,\" Bunting, the education secretary said. \"We know that building a solid foundation for language and literacy in the early years highly contributes to success throughout life.”\n\nFollow Jessica Bies on Twitter: @jessicajbies", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/10/12/school-attendance-remains-abysmal/71153809007/", "title": "Why are kids still behind in school? Their attendance remains abysmal", "text": "As schools and parents contend with uncomfortable and increasingly unavoidable truths about persistent learning loss, new data out Thursday points to a key source of the problem: Scores of students have in recent years missed so much school that catching up seems nearly impossible.\n\nThe U.S. Education Department data, analyzed by Attendance Works and Johns Hopkins University’s Everyone Graduates Center, shows that in the 2021-22 school year, 2 in 3 students attended schools with high or extreme levels of chronic absence. Chronic absence typically refers to missing at least 10% of the school year, and the analysis considers a school’s levels to be high or extreme if at least a fifth of its students are chronically absent.\n\nOverall, roughly 30% of students were chronically absent during the 2021-22 year. It was an era still reeling from the devastation of COVID-19 – quarantines were frequent, health needs were vast and hardship was widespread.\n\nGoing to school was hard during COVID.Why aren’t kids (or teachers) returning to class?\n\nAttendance challenges persist\n\nBut as in-depth reporting by USA TODAY revealed earlier this year, attendance challenges persisted into the subsequent school year – the one that was, at long last, supposed to feel normal. A separate recent analysis by Attendance Works of 11 states’ data found only a slight decline in chronic absence from 2021-22 to 2022-23. Last school year, 28% of those state’s students were chronically absent, down from 30% the year prior.\n\n“An unprecedented wave of chronic absenteeism has spread across the country,” the analysis notes. “Not only is teaching and learning more challenging when large numbers of students are frequently missing class, such elevated levels of chronic absence can easily overwhelm a school’s capacity to respond.”\n\nKids who are chronically absent have lower odds of graduating and, especially when they miss school in the early grades, of learning how to read. And while chronic absence generally is more common at the high school level, the latest report shows the increases were especially pronounced at elementary schools.\n\nThe rate jumped from 7% in 2017-18 to 38% in 2021-22. In fact, the number of elementary schools with extreme levels of chronic absence – more than 30% of kids missing 10% of the year – far exceeded that of high schools.\n\nWhich kids missed class during COVID?We asked, and shools don’t know.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2016/04/23/diabetes-delawares-billion-dollar-crisis/82669866/", "title": "Diabetes: Delaware's billion-dollar crisis", "text": "Margie Fishman, and Jen Rini\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe First State spends more on diabetes than either heart disease or cancer.\n\nThe cost is $1.1 billion a year, the second-highest health care bill behind mental health.\n\nThe average person is diagnosed with Type 2 five to seven years after living with prediabetes.\n\nDelaware has a $1 billion time bomb strapped to its back. It's called Type 2 diabetes.\n\nToday, 1 in 3 Delawareans has higher-than-normal blood sugar levels because they can't efficiently produce and use insulin. Left unchecked, prediabetes and full-blown Type 2 diabetes can disrupt every organ system in the body, leading to blindness, amputated limbs, heart disease, stroke and kidney failure.\n\nType 2 diabetes, linked to excess weight and a sedentary lifestyle, disproportionately impacts minorities and the poor.\n\n\"It's like a tornado,\" said Carrie Holmes, a Dover diabetes educator. \"It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.\"\n\nAfter nearly losing a foot to gangrene, Sharon Childress of Seaford can't ignore the signs of a “sugar shake” when her blood sugar levels plummet and convulsions rattle deep in the center of her chest.\n\nChildress developed gestational diabetes when she was pregnant in 1975. More than two decades later, in 1997, she was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.\n\n“I really keep an eye on it because I don’t want to lose my eyesight, I don’t want to lose my feet,” explained the 59-year-old. “I want to live today. And you can live with diabetes.\"\n\nNot only can you live with diabetes, if caught early enough, life-altering changes can be avoided. That's not the case with most chronic diseases. And it all starts with a simple blood test.\n\n30 vendors at Imagine Delaware to offer service, advice\n\nYMCA program puts families, youth on healthy path\n\nOnce diagnosed, patients willing to overhaul their diet and exercise regimens can lower high blood sugar, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Yet roughly a quarter of those who have diabetes don't even know they have it.\n\nThe average person is diagnosed with Type 2 five to seven years after living with prediabetes, according to Christiana endocrinologist James Lenhard. Some patients experience no symptoms warning them of trouble ahead.\n\nFaced with an aging population and widening waistlines, Delaware spends more on diabetes than either heart disease or cancer. The cost is a staggering $1.1 billion a year – the second-highest health care expenditure behind mental health – for screening, treatment, lost worker productivity and death. The national tab is more than $245 billion, threatening to bankrupt Medicare if current trends continue.\n\nNearly half of American adults have diabetes or prediabetes, according to a startling study published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association. And those statistics don't include the growing number of teens diagnosed with prediabetes, who don't yet qualify as Type 2 diabetics.\n\nBeing overweight is the No. 1 risk factor for youth. Children from African-American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American families are twice as likely to develop diabetes as those from Caucasian families.\n\nType 2 used to be a disease associated with 40-somethings and retirees, said C.J. Jones, associate executive director for the Delaware Diabetes Coalition.\n\n\"In the last 10 to 15 years, the age keeps coming down lower,\" she said. \"It scares the living daylights out of me.\"\n\nThe demand for diabetes treatment has spawned a more than $24 billion global insulin industry, with some brands raising their prices by 160 percent over the last five years. Patients, meanwhile, must bankroll a growing list of medications and supplies while negotiating higher insurance premiums and deductibles.\n\n\"It's an insidious disease,\" said Marianne Carter, a Delaware State University dietitian. \"If it's not under control, the complications can be devastating.\"\n\nBlame an aging population, spiraling obesity rates, behavioral economics, children sequestering themselves indoors to blow up virtual worlds, infrequent blood tests or the absence of a coordinated outreach campaign.\n\nOr just blame being set in your ways.\n\nThe other diabetes: Type 1 less known, no less serious\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune response typically diagnosed in children. But the more prevalent Type 2 is driving the uptick in cases. The nation's overall diabetes rate has more than doubled over the past two decades in tandem with the obesity rate. Today, diabetes is the seventh-leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\nThe News Journal spent months interviewing people on the front lines of diabetes education, including doctors, local and national public health experts, community advocates and nutritionists. We also talked to Delawareans with prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes who radically changed their way of life to stop the disease in its tracks.\n\nNational data show that prediabetics who lost 5 to 10 percent of their body weight and exercised regularly lowered their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by nearly 60 percent. Those who only took medicine lowered their risk by 31 percent.\n\nYet, in the race to contain an epidemic, prevention is a relatively new area of focus for state and national public health officials. It takes years to test programs to prove their efficacy, along with navigating the complex web of insurers, physicians, advocacy groups, federal regulators and legislators, according to Ann Albright, who heads the Division of Diabetes Translation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"If this were a drug, it would already be in people's hands,\" she said.\n\nAfter an infected hair follicle nearly killed him, Gary Stumpf doubled down on managing his Type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe Dover retiree had a family history of the disease, but that didn't stop him from scarfing down two orders of McDonald's hash browns for breakfast or a Wendy's hamburger for lunch.\n\nDiagnosed with Type 2 more than two decades ago, Stumpf's real complications began with what masqueraded as a nasty flu in 1998.\n\nDoctors advised him to rest for a week. The next day, Stumpf noticed swelling the size of a grapefruit in the scrotum area around his testicles.\n\nHe was diagnosed with Fournier's gangrene, an extremely rare condition caused by an infection in the genital region that destroys the body's tissues. People with diabetes are at higher risk of contracting the disease because high blood sugar impedes blood circulation, making it harder for the body to repair sores and wounds.\n\nType 2 diabetes is a chronic, progressive condition that affects the pancreas, an organ roughly the size of a hand. The pancreas makes enzymes that aid digestion and insulin, a hormone that helps the body store or break down sugar, or glucose, from the food we eat and convert it to energy.\n\nExcess weight, eating habits and genetics play a role in how quickly the disease progresses. Being overweight, particularly in the midsection, interferes with the body's ability to break down glucose in the blood, hamstringing the pancreas.\n\nThat's why many people with diabetes, like Stumpf, must take multiple oral prescriptions and shoot themselves with insulin several times a day to lower their sugar levels.\n\nDuring his first month in the hospital, Stumpf recalled submitting to 24 major surgeries and laborious, painful cleanings to remove all the dead skin from his gangrene.\n\n\"I was given a 10 percent chance to survive,\" the 65-year-old remembers. It took him nearly five months to relearn to walk and breathe on his own, followed by three months of in-home nursing care.\n\nSince that time, the former U.S. Department of Defense analyst has faithfully tracked what he eats, and his weight has dropped to 266 pounds from a high of 415 pounds.\n\nWith ritualistic precision, Stumpf needle-pricks his middle finger, squeezes a drop onto a plastic matchstick and shoves it into his glucose meter. Bleep. The screen flashed 131 (milligrams per deciliter) on a recent weekday. Normal is 70 to 100.\n\n“I figured it would be high,” Stumpf said, immediately regretting the patty melt he ate for lunch.\n\nStumpf hiked up his T-shirt and stabbed the right side of his stomach, where his Fournier's scar, encircling his waist like a belt, cushioned the blow.\n\nBetween chuckles, he pledged to eat a very light dinner – perhaps a salad or just five strawberries.\n\nOn most days, Christiana endocrinologist Lenhard feels a lot like Chicken Little, issuing doomsday diabetes forecasts to inspire action among his patients. Roughly a quarter of the health system's beds are filled with diabetes patients.\n\n\"It's a public health threat that could easily cause the bankruptcy of our public payers,\" he intones. \"Every prediction I've ever read about diabetes has been exceeded.\"\n\nLenhard, who directs Christiana Care Health System's Diabetes and Metabolic Disease Center, has listened to patients give lip service to changing their eating habits with no concrete results.\n\n\"That's the job of the health care professional – to find out what motivates patients,\" he said. \"The very best diet is the one you stick to.\"\n\nDoctors can't predict with certainty when prediabetes reaches a \"point of no return,\" Lenhard said.\n\nIf nothing is done, most people with prediabetes will develop diabetes within 10 to 20 years, on average, he said. That's when the beta cells in the pancreas, responsible for producing and secreting insulin, hit a death spiral.\n\nEarly symptoms of diabetes can be easy to miss. Telltale signs include frequent urination, thirst and hunger, blurry vision, fatigue and numbness in the hands or feet. Fifteen percent of those with Type 2 diabetes aren't overweight.\n\nResearch shows that many primary care doctors don't talk to their overweight patients about diet and behavior changes. One study found that only 1 in 4 doctors communicate blood sugar abnormalities to their patients.\n\nTime-strapped doctors are accustomed to treating the most pressing symptoms and may overlook diabetes as a risk factor, Lenhard said. The state's diabetes prevention program trains doctors to look for diabetes warning signs.\n\nRecently, the American Diabetes Association urged a federal task force to adopt broader guidelines for screening patients. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that doctors routinely screen obese and overweight patients ages 40 to 70. Diabetes association leaders want screening to begin at age 20.\n\nThe key to changing the tide in Delaware is to hold physicians more accountable, according to Jeffrey Burtaine, a medical director in clinical client relations for Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\n\"We believe the answer is to put it back on the provider,\" he said. Highmark evaluates providers based on positive patient outcomes for blood sugar and blood pressure. Participating doctors also must offer A1C blood tests used to diagnose diabetes and monitor patients' eyes for deterioration and feet for potential nerve damage.\n\nSome doctors argue that insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry have stymied their efforts.\n\nDr. Anita Raghuwanshi of Beebe Healthcare, who specializes in endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism, noted that physicians must fight insurance companies for diabetes medication a patient actually needs – not just what is approved by the insurer. Prescription drug coverage can change within six months, she added, which is frustrating once a doctor finds a regimen that works. Innovative, new medications are also more expensive.\n\nPharmaceutical companies, especially those that manufacture generic diabetes drugs, should be transparent about how much they spend for production versus what they charge the consumer, Raghuwanshi said. Insulin doesn't come in a generic form because regulatory approvals are so strict, but the cost of other generic diabetic drugs is increasing, she added.\n\n“That’s just pure greed,” Raghuwanshi said. “It’s a huge problem ... that we are putting profits above our nation’s well-being – both our financial well-being and the nation’s health.\"\n\nKristin Rogers, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman, said the drug manufacturer prices its medications to \"remain competitive, but more importantly so that we can invest in bringing new medicines to market to address unmet patients' needs.\"\n\nLast year, patients saved $617 million through an AstraZeneca program that offers free or reduced medicine to qualifying patients, she said.\n\nStill, patients with Type 2 diabetes spend an average of $6,000 annually visiting specialists, filling prescriptions and stocking up on supplies. That's 2.3 times higher than the annual health care costs for those who don't have diabetes.\n\nStumpf's bathroom counter is lined with miniature plastic cups, three for each day, 24 pills in all. They treat his blood sugar, cholesterol, stomach acid and more.\n\nOne vial of insulin costs him $55, and he needs two over 90 days. Medicare doesn't cover insulin, insulin pens, syringes, needles, alcohol swabs or gauze unless the use of an insulin pump is deemed \"medically necessary.\"\n\nChrissy Nelson of Seaford also has piles of supplies. But she occasionally rations her medicine.\n\nDiagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2007 after she had her gallbladder removed, the 46-year-old subsists on her $769 monthly disability check, which also supports her unemployed husband. The couple pays $400 a month to rent a room with a mini fridge and microwave in a friend's house.\n\nA local pharmacy has helped Nelson, a peer center volunteer, cover her co-pays of $30 or more. Some days, she wishes she didn't have to deal with diabetes. It's just one more thing to manage.\n\nBut after watching both her diabetic parents die before they could settle into retirement, Nelson won't ignore it.\n\nShe sticks to a fixed eating schedule, even if she can't afford frequent snacks or fresh fruit.\n\n\"I'm a stressed person,\" she said, softly.\n\nBurtaine, of Highmark, admits that insurers place limits on how much medication and supplies a person with diabetes can purchase. If a doctor authorizes additional blood sugar test strips for a patient, the patient can appeal to increase the coverage allowance, he said.\n\n\"The real issue I see in America with diabetes is one of compliance and adherence,\" he said. \"It's maddening. You look at this and go, 'There's no reason for this.'\"\n\nHealth experts seize on prevention programs as the most effective tool in reversing alarming rates of diabetes worldwide. More than 400 million people are diagnosed each year and 1.5 million die from the disease.\n\n\"As a country, if we were devoting all our resources to prevention rather than treating after the fact, we would be much healthier and richer,\" said Carter of DSU.\n\nBut public awareness campaigns have been slow to coalesce.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association closed its Delaware office, among others, at the end of 2014 due to funding gaps, according to Jones, who shares a part-time position with one other Delaware Diabetes Coalition staffer. The state contributes less than $30,000 a year to the coalition to pay for operations, an annual wellness expo and distribution of a diabetes resource guide to medical professionals.\n\nFor the last three years, Delaware's diabetes rate has hovered around 11 percent.\n\nDon Post, director of the state Division of Public Health's Diabetes Program, is hopeful that the state's diabetes numbers will decline over time. The state program offers free six-session training programs for people with Type 2 diabetes. Roughly 3,000 people have participated in the lessons, which target medication adherence, nutrition, mood and physical activity. About one-quarter of enrollees drop out, which is in line with the national average.\n\nThe program falls under a $500,000 annual budget funded by state and federal governments to tackle both diabetes and heart disease prevention.\n\nMore needs to be done, Lenhard said: \"We haven't scratched the surface in education.\"\n\nStudy ties higher blood sugar to dementia risk\n\nObesity surgery proves effective for treating diabetes\n\nHe praised England for recently rolling out the world's first nationwide program aimed at at-risk individuals for Type 2 diabetes. Covering 26 million people, or half of the country's population, the program will test different prevention models as part of a larger campaign to curb obesity rates.\n\nIn the U.S., which doesn't have single-payer national health insurance, it takes longer to build a prevention infrastructure, enlist all the stakeholders and complete clinical trials to determine the most successful approaches, said Albright of the CDC. Only in the last few years has the nation initiated a conversation about prediabetes.\n\n\"We have got to work to get most of the players to the table,\" Albright said. \"This is an incredibly serious issue in our country.\"\n\nThe CDC has certified more than 850 diabetes programs. Slightly more than half have reported the number of patients helped, totaling about 40,500 people. Nationally, the CDC estimates that more than 86 million U.S. adults have prediabetes and nearly 30 million live with diabetes.\n\nIn recent years, insurance companies, employers, the American Diabetes Association, the national YMCA and the American Medical Association have joined with government health officials in investing in wellness strategies to curb one of the costliest diseases in the U.S.\n\nHighmark, for instance, employs nurse educators who call noncompliant or very sick diabetic patients to discuss their treatment plans; prediabetic patients can access wellness coaches. If employers opt in, Highmark also offers discounts to help workers lower out-of-pocket costs for diabetes and other diseases, Burtaine said.\n\nUnitedHealthcare partnered with the CDC, the AMA and others on a national diabetes prevention campaign that began in 2010. The AMA recently determined that prediabetes and hypertension were critical areas to target improving patient outcomes.\n\nMaybelle Diane Delaney is borderline wistful when she describes the white bread-and-mayo sandwiches she inhaled as a kid sitting on her mother's lap.\n\nUntil recently, nobody told her how many carbs were in that sandwich. Or in a tomato for that matter.\n\nDiagnosed with Type 2 diabetes more than two decades ago, the quick-witted New Castle resident began the routine of pills and insulin. She had been warned of prediabetes – Type 2 runs in her family – but no one mentioned a food pyramid.\n\nDelaney watched her mother, a Type 2 diabetic, lose one toe after another. Then her entire leg.\n\nHer mother never complained, Delaney remembers, but she also never left the house, feeling too insecure to confront the outside world after losing her sight and hearing.\n\nType 2 diabetes also claimed Delaney's older brother, who died of a massive heart attack in 1998. His final words to his sister: \"Leave that candy alone.\"\n\nA retired bank worker who wears a tight curl in her hair, Delaney found her current Christiana Care specialist, James Hays, in the phone book.\n\nDuring her first appointment, Hays studied Delaney's long list of medications. \"We're getting off that,\" she remembered him saying. \"And we're getting off that.\"\n\n\"He was stern,\" Delaney said. \"He was what I was looking for. Like going to the sergeant.\"\n\nHays ordered a lifestyle makeover for his patient. Delaney, 65, stopped drinking her neighbor's syrupy lemonade and eating broccoli flavored with a stick of butter.\n\nShe got off the breathing machine she used for five years and the twice-daily insulin injections. She lost 50 pounds, and she's down to a single pill, three times a day.\n\nFor exercise, she'll walk the aisles of grocery stores, decrying how a Weight Watchers frozen entree can pack more than 500 mg of sodium.\n\nDelaney cheats, too. With a cupcake. OK, maybe two.\n\nBut she finds sustenance in lean meats, frozen vegetables and her doctor's annoyingly practical advice.\n\n\"I listen,\" she said, \"because I want to live.\"\n\nOn Wednesday beginning at 5 p.m., The News Journal will host \"Combating Diabetes,\" an Imagine Delaware event at Cab Calloway School of the Arts in Wilmington, which is serviced by public transportation.\n\nFollowing a vendor fair featuring preventive strategies and treatment solutions, a panel discussion will begin at 7 p.m. with health leaders from the American Medical Association, Christiana Care and the state Department of Health.\n\nShopRite will provide diabetic friendly snacks for the event.\n\n“Diabetes is a huge problem in Delaware and getting bigger,” said Susan Leath, president and publisher of The News Journal. “But we can help slow it down if people understand the danger of high blood sugar, and do what they can to monitor it.\n\n“We hope our journalism and Wednesday’s forum, sponsored by Christiana Care, will serve as a call to action for people to become better educated about this debilitating disease.\"\n\nImagine Delaware Series: Combating Diabetes | The News Journal Media Group Ticketing\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.

Individual ratings are also given in up to six categories.\n\nNot every school is rated on all six categories, however, because in some cases the category doesn't apply. For instance, one of the categories is graduation rate, which only applies to high schools.\n\nSchools with scores below 30.64 will be identified for state intervention.\n\nThe data can be found on the state's education data web site, www.mischooldata.org, which allows users to search by school.\n\nWelcome to the School Index Report\n\nThese are some of the metro Detroit schools that received a 100 rating:\n\nWashtenaw International High School, Ypsilanti (a consortium school that serves students from four counties)\n\nInternational Academy of Macomb, Clinton Township (a consortium school that serves students from across Macomb County)\n\nHarlan Elementary School, Birmingham Public Schools\n\nQuarton Elementary School, Birmingham Public Schools\n\nThe four are among 17 that received the top rating. However, some of those with the top rating were assessed based on only one category. For instance, the education program at the Genesee County Jail received a score of 100 based on one area: chronic absenteeism, which is part of a category that evaluates school quality.\n\nRead more:\n\nMichigan identifies 21 more failing schools\n\nReport: Mich. kids falter in 3rd grade reading\n\nGiven the jail setting, it's no surprise that more than 98% of the students were not chronically absent.\n\nIt's one of the challenges that exists in building a system \"that has to be accountable for all of the schools in the state,\" said Chris Janzer, assistant director of accountability in MDE's assessment and accountability office.\n\nTwenty-six schools received a zero rating, though none of them were traditional schools. Instead, the bottom was made up mostly of alternative education programs for students who struggle in a traditional setting and programs for incarcerated youth.\n\nHere's how the index scores were determined where all six categories were used:\n\n34% based on improvement on state exams\n\n29% based on the number of students proficient on state exams\n\n14% on school quality factors, such as availability of art, music, library and physical education programs; chronic absenteeism, advanced coursework and postsecondary enrollment\n\n10% based on graduation rates\n\n10% based on the proficiency of English language learners on a state exam\n\n3% based on how many students are tested\n\nState Superintendent Brian Whiston said in February that the new rating system is an improvement over the old top-to-bottom ranking, where each school received a percentile ranking based on how they compared with other schools. The list was often criticized because, inevitably, the schools that ranked in the bottom were schools in high-poverty areas. It was also criticized because it was difficult to understand and replicate.\n\n\"This is very easy to understand,\" Whiston said then.\n\nThe math used to develop the index score is simpler, though there's more of it, Janzer said.\n\n\"When we started to develop this, we wanted something that would be easier for people to replicate,\" Janzer said.\n\nContact Lori Higgins: 313-222-6651, lhiggins@freepress.com or @LoriAHiggins", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/09/15/how-to-read-the-new-ohio-state-report-cards-for-schools/69494403007/", "title": "How to read the new Ohio state report cards for schools", "text": "Ohio schools will no longer receive letter grades\n\nSchools will now receive star ratings\n\nSchools can earn up to 5 stars in each category\n\nOhio is releasing its annual report cards for public schools and districts Thursday, but they aren't going to have letter grades.\n\nInstead, the revamped report cards will feature star ratings along with new categories and new calculations.\n\nThe hope is that this new system will be fairer for schools and easier for parents to understand.\n\nFind your Ohio school district's report card\n\nHere's how to interpret the results:\n\nWhat do the report cards measure?\n\nOhio's Department of Education collects a lot of information from the state's 610 public school districts and funnels the data into six categories: achievement, progress, early literacy, gap closing, graduation and readiness (college, career, workforce, military).\n\nSchools can earn up to five stars in each category, and half-star ratings are possible.\n\n\"This helps give Ohio parents and schools a snapshot of the quality of education being provided to students,\" according to the department's website.\n\nBut only if parents understand what these categories mean.\n\nAchievement\n\nThis measures how students did on statewide tests and whether their schools met established thresholds.\n\nWhat this means is when students take statewide exams their scores get combined into an overall result for their school. That number then gets averaged with the totals for all other statewide tests administered in that building and the result earns the school up to five stars.\n\nMore stars mean higher achievement, but it's important to note that three stars mean the school met statewide expectations. Four stars are for exceeding expectations and five stars mean significantly exceeding expectations.\n\n\"I think that point is one of the reasons why the state moved away from A through F grades,\" Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, said.\n\nSchools used to be given a \"C\" for meeting expectations and some districts believed parents interpreted that negatively.\n\nProgress\n\nThis category tracks how children are doing year over year instead of how well they score on statewide exams.\n\nA child who is \"way behind\" could make a lot of progress in a year and still not pass his or her statewide exam, Brenner said.\n\nIt's a category that's been on Ohio's school report cards for years, but it got a little tweaking for the 2021-2022 academic year. High achieving districts had been dinged on previous report cards for not progressing when their students exceeded statewide achievement standards.\n\n\"If a kid is at the top, you aren't going to get any additional growth,\" Brenner said. \"Those things were taken into consideration.\"\n\nProgress can also show whether a school is \"trending in the right direction.\" A school with two or three stars for achievement and five for progress is doing much better than it has in previous years.\n\nEarly Literacy\n\nThis category is relatively straightforward. It measures reading improvement and proficiency for students in kindergarten through third grade.\n\nThe thing to keep in mind about this category is that a five doesn't mean every student in that school or district read at or above their grade level. It means the vast majority were proficient and were promoted to fourth grade.\n\nThree stars in this category means the school met statewide standards.\n\nMore:Ohio lawmakers may end Third Grade Reading Guarantee\n\nGap Closing\n\nThis component looks at several data points such as how many students are chronically absent, qualify for gifted programs, and whether certain subgroups of students (Black, Hispanic, disabled, economically disadvantaged) are meeting statewide standards.\n\nAnd while the overall star rating in this category is important, Brenner said the most interesting numbers to him were the ones for specific subgroups.\n\n\"If you don't dig in, you may not see some of the trends with particular groups,\" he said.\n\nMore: Ohio schools struggle with spikes in chronic absenteeism\n\nFor example, a school may score well overall but is failing their students with disabilities or those who test as gifted.\n\n\"Gifted and talented students should be extra challenged,\" Brenner said. \"What are they doing for kids who are already going to exceed expectations?\"\n\nGraduation\n\nThe category looks at the percentage of students who graduate with a regular or honors diploma.\n\nHere's how the star ratings work in this category:\n\nOne star means a graduation rate of less than 84%\n\nTwo stars mean a graduation rate of 84-89%\n\nThree stars mean a graduation rate of 90-93.4% (This is the statewide standard for schools.)\n\nFour stars mean a graduation rate of 93.5-96.4%\n\nFive stars mean a graduation rate of 96.5% or more\n\nReadiness\n\nThis is a new category on the report card and won't have an overall star rating for the 2021-2022 academic year.\n\n\"We didn't quite come to an agreement on it,\" Brenner said. \"We have time to analyze the data over the next few years and make adjustments.\"\n\nMore:Are Ohio students using the state's college credit program?\n\nBroadly speaking, the category is supposed to evaluate whether students are \"prepared for what comes next\" after they graduate high school. That could mean college, trade school, the military, an apprenticeship or a job.\n\nTo answer that question, schools submitted the number of students graduating with honors diplomas, AP credits, 12 or more College Credit Plus credits and state-recognized licenses.\n\nThe scores, when they become part of the overall ratings, will be calculated by the number of \"students who achieve one or more of the component measure goals,\" according to the Ohio Department of Education.\n\nAnna Staver is a reporter with the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau.

Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna. He ordered correctional officers to start allowing prisoners out of their cells for outdoor recreation.\n\n“By now it should be evident to everyone that the offenders are getting restless,” acting Warden Philip Parker wrote in a prison-wide email. “Not to mention that the weather has been very good as of late.”\n\nOne correctional officer shot back in emails obtained by The News Journal: “Staff are also getting restless that nothing is being done for our safety and yet still the focus is on the inmates not getting things.\n\n“Have we forgotten we work in a prison and not the Holiday Inn?”\n\nThe chain of emails obtained by The News Journal showed dozens of other correctional officers responding angrily, saying the administration was too quick to return to “normal” without correcting safety problems, including lack of cameras in the prison and low guard-to-inmate ratios in the recreation yards and chow halls.\n\n“We sacrifice so much to do so many things,” another officer wrote. “Why should we pay the price with another life?”\n\nThis combustible relationship with superiors and what officers call the slow pace to change unsafe conditions in the prisons is leading them to start speaking publicly about their concerns, before the takeover leaves the minds of the public and state officials. Many officers spoke with The News Journal, which is not identifying them because they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nChelsea Hicks, a spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said the department takes seriously concerns voiced by correctional officers about safety.\n\n\"We continue to work on a daily basis to ensure that Delaware's correctional facilities remain as safe and secure as possible,\" she said in a statement. \"Our ability to deliver important programs and services inside our facilities also depends on our ability to maintain a secure environment – so that remains our top priority.\"\n\nMonths after the email chain, prison staff said their concerns still aren’t being addressed by the administration or state officials, even though Gov. John Carney allocated $340,800 toward new communication and security equipment for staff.\n\nHe also has pledged to add 75 new correctional officers and an additional $1.2 million for equipment purchases for the next fiscal year.\n\nAlso, if Carney's budget proposal were to pass, correctional officers' starting salaries would rise to $37,120 from $32,060.\n\nIn March, Geoffrey Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware, called the proposal a “slap in the face,” arguing for an increase to $48,000. Klopp did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nCorrectional officers hope a higher salary will prompt more people to apply to vacant positions. On the day of the siege, short staffing left them outnumbered 75 to 1 in Building C, too few to quell the uprising, a union attorney said in February.\n\nThe chronic understaffing also has led to employees being overworked, they said. When enough officers don’t show up or a shift is understaffed, the administration will “freeze over” employees who are on duty, leading to 16-hour work days.\n\nSTORY: Delaware put dollars before safety at prisons, lawsuit claims\n\nSTORY: Questions over who delayed prison hostage rescue\n\nThe ongoing “freeze overs” and the slow pace at which changes are being made is fueling an “us versus them” mentality between the rank-and-file and supervisors, officers said.\n\nIt’s also made it even harder to sell new employees on joining the Department of Correction, they said.\n\n\"What kind of lie are we going to tell people when applying to this job?\" asked a correctional officer with 15 years of experience. \"What are we going to tell them that they're going to want to do this?\n\n\"Every second that passes that nothing changes, no conversations occur, and no precautionary measures are implemented, we lose faith and hope in those tasked with leading us to a better, brighter and safer future,” a correctional officer wrote in an email to the administration.\n\nA Blue Flu sweeps the prisons\n\nOn the morning of Feb. 1, inmates in Building C – a unit that transfers prisoners between security levels – took three correctional officers and a prison counselor hostage. Three maintenance workers also had to barricade themselves in the basement to avoid the hostage-takers.\n\nThe tense 18-hour standoff ended when Delaware and Maryland SWAT teams forced their way into the building. They were too late to save Lt. Steven Floyd Sr., who was beaten and held in a closet during the ordeal.\n\nFloyd’s widow and five staff members announced a lawsuit earlier this week against Delaware’s two previous governors. They claim 16 years of understaffing was never addressed, and instead, was patched with a $23 million a year overtime budget that forced officers to work long shifts at the expense of safety.\n\nDelaware State Police are still investigating Floyd’s death and have not brought charges against any inmates yet. Separately, Carney announced that two retired judges would conduct an independent review of the hostage crisis and will make recommendations by June 1.\n\nThe DOC is also undertaking its own internal affairs investigation.\n\nThe lawsuit and three investigations have done little to placate inmates’ families or the corrections staff.\n\nOn one side, inmates and their loved ones are campaigning for better treatment inside the prisons, including access to education. On the other, correctional officers said fewer inmate privileges – not more – is the key to keeping control.\n\nBoth sides agree that safety inside the prison is paramount. Connie Runyon, whose son was in Building C during the siege, said if the two sides don't come together, it will be impossible to accomplish any forward movement with the governor.\n\n\"The guards are not safe,\" Runyon said. \"And when they're not safe, the inmates aren't safe.\"\n\nOfficers argue their needs often do not align with those of inmates. The job for prison administrators and state officials is to juggle both sets of interests, an act officers said leads to lower morale and fears about safety.\n\nIn the first month after the siege, 25 correctional officers resigned from the department. Also, several medical staff members, including the Department of Correction’s medical director, Dr. Vincent Carr, have announced resignations or retirements.\n\nThe frustration grew to a point that on Monday officers staged a sick-out – commonly referred to as a Blue Flu – a strike in which employees don't go to work in protest.\n\nAlthough prison officials wouldn’t say how many employees didn’t come to work, one officer estimated it was as high as 200 statewide. The Department of Correction employs approximately 2,500, which includes accountants, medical staff, probation officers and correctional officers, according to state records.\n\nOfficers who participated said the call-out was meant to convey that Carney and lawmakers need to take their concerns seriously.\n\n“It’s all about security first,” one 15-year veteran correctional officer said. “We are running so far below protocol that officers are coming to work and telling them that they are literally terrified, they are scared to work in these facilities.”\n\nOn the day of the sick-out, Commissioner Perry Phelps tried to quell concerns in an email to employees.\n\n\"It may feel like change isn’t happening fast enough, but a 'sick out' is not the way to enact change or make a statement,\" he wrote.\n\nAn officer with 21 years of experience said safety concerns at Vaughn have gotten only worse in the past few years after negotiations with the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware led to mentally ill inmates being moved into a separate high-security unit.\n\nThe correctional officer said Building C was especially dangerous because the agreement forced prison leaders to shift maximum-security inmates to free up space for those with mental illness. In doing so, officials put \"a lot of heavy hitters\" together in Building C, he said.\n\nThe ACLU has defended the agreement, saying it brought the prisons into line with national standards for mental health treatment and made prison officials commit to increased staffing and expanded prison facilities to provide for greater mental health programming.\n\nExit surveys show mistrust\n\nThe disconnect did not begin with the ACLU settlement. Exit-survey comments from outgoing staff describe a mistrust that existed within the department for years.\n\nMany described how a day-to-day absence of high-level supervisors caused dysfunction. Others noted instances of retaliation against those who raised concerns.\n\n“The only time any interaction usually took place with the leadership was when something wrong had happened,” a former Vaughn correctional officer said in an exit survey from December, two months before the deadly siege. There is “never any recognition for positive. Negativity rules!”\n\nThe officer, who in a previous year had been commended as an exemplary employee, stated he was leaving corrections because of safety concerns, low pay and poor relations with the administration – common themes repeated by other outgoing staff in the past five years.\n\nThe poor conditions, many stated, led to low morale not only at prisons but within the Correction Department's other operations, including probation and courthouse intake.\n\nDepartment officials provided The News Journal with the exit survey documents in response to an open records request.\n\nSeparately, DOC data shows staff grievances from corrections staff spiked to 105 complaints in 2016 from 38 in 2015. Many of the grievances stem from disputes about disciplinary issues.\n\nIn one particularly harsh set of exit surveys from February 2016, employees described disorganized facilities, scarred by unprofessional behavior and constant confusion.\n\nExit surveys from 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 described similar conditions. It is unclear what actions department officials have taken in response to the criticisms expressed in exit surveys.\n\nOne question asked outgoing staff what they would change if they were in control of the department. Responses included pay raises, culture changes, improved lines of communication, better training and the removal of a warden.\n\nDespite numerous concerns expressed, more than 60 percent of outgoing staff in 2016 described their relationship with a direct supervisor as good or excellent.\n\nA couple staff comments also placed blame for workplace dysfunction on their colleagues. One commenter in February 2016 said the department should “get rid of dead weight.”\n\nOfficers said now is the time to address the concerns that they have expressed for years.\n\n“We have an opportunity to set an example – not just for our prison – but for all of Corrections,” an officer wrote to the administration. “The entire nation is watching us.”\n\nContact Jessica Masulli Reyes at (302) 324-2777, jmreyes@delawareonline.com or Twitter @jessicamasulli.

McMichael\n\nThe News Journal\n\nIn the space of two months, Marine Corps veteran Roger Miller's eyesight slipped from perfectly fine to practically gone.\n\nVeterans Affairs ophthalmologist Odette Callender was trying to help, Miller said. She became so dedicated to treating Miller for what was later diagnosed as an aggressive form of glaucoma that at one point in 2013, she saw him daily at the Wilmington VA Medical Center for two weeks – an extreme rarity in a VA system where getting a single appointment can take months.\n\n\"She told my wife, 'Can he come back every day?' \" said Miller, 71, a Seaford resident. \"Every day. Where you gonna find that? She forced that computer to give me an appointment every day. We drove 87 miles every day, to this clinic. She worked on me, tried this drop, that drop.\"\n\nCallender eventually sent Miller to Philadelphia for a consult. In March 2013, she operated on each of his eyes. The procedures arrested his visual deterioration, he said. For the succeeding year, she continued seeing him at regular intervals. He trusted her.\n\nThen in March, just like that, she was gone. Callender, like more than a dozen Wilmington health care providers and other workers over the past year, had been placed on administrative leave for reasons unknown.\n\n\"They removed her, and there's a gag order in the clinic,\" Miller said. \"We're not able to talk about it, we can't discuss it,\" he quoted workers as saying. \"All we can say is she's on administrative leave.\"\n\nThe unexpected move frustrated Miller. Callender, he said, had an intimate knowledge of his problem that succeeding specialists have not displayed.\n\n\"They're going over the same steps over and over again,\" Miller said.\n\nThe hospital, located near Elsmere, says Callender is still employed by Wilmington but won't elaborate, citing federal privacy law. Callender, reached at home in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, acknowledged being placed on administrative leave March 13. She declined to discuss the matter further, saying she didn't want to make a bad situation worse.\n\nAccording to a spreadsheet listing current doctor, nurse and social worker slots authorized and occupied at Wilmington that was provided July 30 at the request of The News Journal, the hospital's two ophthalmologist slots are filled. Since the hospital confirms that she remains on the staff, it appears that her job is only technically filled.\n\nWhether due to such reassignments or jobs that for various reasons are unfilled, Wilmington and its five outpatient clinics have a lot of care provider vacancies – 38.4 more doctors, nurses, social workers and psychologists than the 27.6 it acknowledged in response to a late July request by The News Journal. (The numbers include part-time providers.)\n\nAccording to data the Veterans Health Administration in Washington, D.C., provided separately to Gannett's USA Today in mid-July, Wilmington's vacancies represent 16.2 percent of those specific providers. The hospital reported it was short less than half of that.\n\nIncluding all medical jobs at the hospital and the clinics – diagnostic radiologic technologists and pharmacists are two examples – Wilmington is missing 102 of 728 workers, or 14.01 percent, according to the VHA figures.\n\nThe VHA data does not show the number of ophthalmologists authorized and currently assigned to Wilmington. They are lumped together with other doctors in the physician category. VHA said 15 of the hospital's 81 physician positions were unfilled as of July 16.\n\nIn a VA system that has been plagued with appointment delays and what investigators have called deliberate schedule manipulation, most concerning, perhaps, are the number of vacancies at Wilmington among medical support assistants – workers whose duties include scheduling and clinic workflow.\n\nOf the 95 slots Wilmington is authorized, only 76 were on hand as of July 16. That 20 percent vacancy rate falls just below the nationwide VA figure of 20.8 percent.\n\nThe hospital declined to answer questions about the discrepancy between its own and the VHA figures, directing questions about the data obtained by USA Today to VA's Office of Media Relations in Washington, D.C. VA did not respond to that request.\n\nIn defense of the care provided by the hospital's ophthalmology department, spokesman James Coty provided internal data showing that in the fiscal year to date, 97.93 appointments for established ophthalmology patients were completed within 30 days of the veteran's preferred date or the date clinically indicated, and that veterans waited an average of 4.83 days for those appointments to be completed.\n\nMiller and family members have this month begun regularly picketing the hospital in hopes of drawing attention to Callender's absence. On one occasion, he said, a VA police officer came out to photograph the homemade signs the group was displaying. Later, an officer and the hospital's patient advocate visited; in early afternoon, the latter returned with Coty, her supervisor, asking if he could help, Miller said.\n\nMiller said it was obvious the hospital wanted him gone. The family stood its ground.\n\n\"Our vets deserve our best care, but this facility is cutting staffing, services and care,\" said Miller's daughter, Dana Miller.\n\nHospital Director Robin Aube-Warren has acknowledged staff shortages but says Wilmington continues to recruit and hire health care workers. Some slots, particularly in rural clinics and in specialties such as psychiatry, are difficult to fill, she said.\n\nAt least part of Wilmington's vacancy issue, however, appears to stem from the status of physicians such as Callender. As of early July, sources said at least 10 health care and other workers were still performing jobs well outside their specialties and capabilities, rather than treating patients.\n\nThe exact number is unknown. The hospital has not confirmed specific reassignments but has said that workers against whom \"allegations of misconduct\" have been leveled \"may be detailed to other work areas to allow the gathering of information free of intimidation or retaliation.\"\n\nAube-Warren has denied that any retaliation against employees is taking place, saying in April she \"will not tolerate\" it.\n\nMiller doesn't know why Callender has been exiled. But he's tired of what he calls a new provider covering ground Callender already explored, such as the prescribing of various eyedrops he says he's already tried. He wants his doctor back.\n\n\"I can't take the chance of people playing with the little bit of vision that I have left,\" said Miller, who served from 1965 to 1969 and earned two Purple Hearts for wounds incurred over two tours in Vietnam. \"I need somebody that knows my case. I don't want to lose what I have. I like looking at my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren. Consult this woman. Please have them consult this woman.\"\n\nContact William H.

Kay Ivey is urging college football fans to get vaccinated before heading to stadiums this season. The first games kick off in a few weeks, raising concerns that crowded stadiums could help spread COVID-19. Asked about those concerns last week, the Republican governor said the remedy is for more people to get inoculated. “If everybody would just get the vaccine, we wouldn’t have a problem. Simply get the shot, then go enjoy your football game,” Ivey said after participating in an event with college mascots on the steps of the state Capitol. Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama’s state health officer, said the state Department of Public Health has issued guidance on sporting events including recommending spacing and emphasizing the importance of vaccinations. “Outdoor events are safer in general than indoor events, but having hundreds of thousands of people getting together during a pandemic is going to result in some disease transmission,” Harris said. “We hope people are vaccinated enough that that can be minimized.” Alabama coach Nick Saban has also been an outspoken advocate for getting vaccinated and participated in a public service announcement over the summer encouraging Alabamians to get the shots. The state has one of the nation’s lowest rates of fully vaccinated residents.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The city could see nearly a half-million cruise ship visitors next year after a new docking agreement was announced with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal between the cruise line and Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal came last week as one of the world’s largest cruise ships arrived, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. “It ensures they have a place to bring their ships and additional ships to Sitka for the future,” said Chris McGraw, manager of Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal. Halibut Point Marine, owned by McGraw’s family, is majority owner of the cruise terminal. The Royal Caribbean ship Ovation of the Seas, which is 1,138 feet long – or nearly the length of four football fields placed end-to-end – arrived Tuesday. Officials said the visit got off to a great Alaska start, with a bear walking along the dock as the ship pulled in. The ship’s arrival marked the formal completion of a cruise terminal dock expansion that McGraw called “phase one” of plans intended to position Sitka as a premier port in Alaska. The Ovation of the Seas, which can hold up to 4,900 guests, brought about 1,500 passengers to Sitka. There were fewer travelers aboard because of COVID-19 mitigation measures.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: After more than a year of silence due to the pandemic, mariachis are back playing Sunday services at Tucson’s St. Augustine Cathedral, where the colorful and sonorous tradition dates back a half-century and fuses Roman Catholicism with Mexican American pride. For the hundreds of worshippers gathered in this Spanish colonial church and other congregations across the Southwest, the unique sound of mariachi liturgy evokes a borderlands identity where spirituality and folk music have blended for centuries. “Syncretism is the reality of this land, the ‘ambos’ reality,” said the Rev. Alan Valencia, the cathedral’s rector, who grew up attending mariachi Mass in “ambos Nogales,” or “both Nogales,” as locals refer to the two cities of the same name straddling the U.S.-Mexican border about 60 miles to the south. “And that’s what we see in these mariachi Masses,” he said. “Faith and culture come together and grow.” The first canon of mariachi Mass was composed in Cuernavaca, Mexico, after the Vatican encouraged the incorporation of regional musical traditions into services in the 1960s. Called the Misa Panamericana, or Pan-American Mass, it features a specific order of instrumental arrangements, sung prayers and hymns, according to Dan Sheehy, director and curator of the Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 33 new COVID-19 deaths and more than 2,400 new coronavirus cases Friday as Arkansas reached a new high for virus patients on ventilators. The Department of Health said the state’s COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began rose to 6,614, while coronavirus cases increased by 2,407 to 431,507 total. The number of COVID-19 patients in the state’s hospitals dropped by 13 to 1,397, but only 19 intensive care unit beds were available across the entire state, the department said. There were 343 COVID-19 patients on ventilators, a new high for the state, while 533 were in ICUs. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University research data. The state’s cases and hospitalizations have surged in recent weeks due to the ultra-contagious delta variant and the state’s low vaccination rate. Only about 39% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated against the disease. The state on Thursday reported 9,143 additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines were given. “We must continue to work to increase vaccinations,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “Our children under 12 cannot get the vaccine and need our help to stay healthy.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Golden City became the first major city in the nation to require proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 on Friday for people dining inside restaurants, working out in gyms or attending indoor concerts. Restaurants and bars posted signs and added extra staff to begin verifying people’s proof of vaccination before allowing them in. “There’s definitely some anxiety around how it’s all going to work,” said Pete Sittnick, a managing partner of Waterbar and EPIC Steak restaurants on the city’s waterfront. He anticipates a slowdown in checking in diners, possible pushback from guests who disagree with the requirement and awkward scenarios where someone shows up without proper documentation. “The good thing is, if somebody doesn’t have their verification of vaccination, they can still eat outside,” he said. Mayor London Breed announced the requirement more than a week ago in an attempt to stem rising COVID-19 cases, saying she was worried the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus could disrupt the city’s economic rebound. The mandate goes further than New York City, which requires people to be at least partially inoculated for a variety of high-risk indoor activities, and New Orleans, which requires proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test for indoor dining or drinking.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper announced Thursday that he has a “breakthrough” case of COVID-19. The first-term Democrat issued a statement saying he tested positive for the coronavirus after experiencing mild symptoms and was self-isolating at the direction of Congress’ attending physician, Dr. Brian P. Monahan. Hickenlooper said he was “feeling much better.” “I’m grateful for the vaccine (and the scientists behind it) for limiting my symptoms and allowing us to continue our work for Colorado,” Hickenlooper said. “If you haven’t been vaccinated, don’t wait for the virus – get the shot today, and a booster when it’s available too!” Infections and illnesses can happen even after being vaccinated. Experts say inoculation could help make any illnesses less severe. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that newer variants of the coronavirus could be a factor in “breakthrough” cases. Hickenlooper, 69, is a former brewpub entrepreneur, Denver mayor and two-term governor who defeated incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner in the 2020 election.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A year after receiving a huge influx of federal aid for the mailing of absentee ballot applications, town clerks across the state are facing the prospect of not having enough money to do the same for Nov. 2 local elections. They told the Connecticut Post local budgets were set months ago, and there may not be additional money for printing, postage and office workers. Absentee ballots are supposed to be ready for the public by Oct. 1. “With cities and towns finalizing their annual budgets in the spring, town clerks do not have the necessary funds built into their current budget to cover the costs of postage and staff to process the possible increase in applications,” Kate Wall, president of the Connecticut Town Clerks Association, told the newspaper. The secretary of state’s office said a provision in the state budget allows people to continue to cite pandemic-related concerns to request using voting by mail or drop-off ballots this year. The $15 million in federal support for state elections last year, which also included cybersecurity measures, was a one-time event and is not available this year, the Post reports. A spokesperson for Secretary of the State Denise Merrill blamed the lack of funding this year on Republicans in the Legislature who oppose mail-in balloting.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Current and former students of the University of Delaware can pursue claims that the school breached contractual obligations and unjustly enriched itself by halting in-person classes and shutting down the campus last spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, a federal judge ruled Friday. Judge Stephanos Bibas said the students have plausibly alleged that the school promised them in-person classes, activities and services. “True, the school never promised them expressly. But promises need not be express to be enforceable,” Bibas wrote. “By its statements and history of offering classes in person, the school may have implied a promise to stay in person.” Bibas also said that, even if the university was justified in breaking any such promise because of COVID-19, it should not be unjustly enriched in doing so and may have to return the money it saved, if any, when it went online. The judge rejected the university’s arguments that it expressly reserved the right to go online and that the case involves claims of “educational malpractice,” which many states prohibit. Bibas also rejected the university’s argument that parents who paid their children’s tuition and fees do not have standing in the lawsuit because they had no duty to shoulder those costs and were not personally deprived of campus services or in-person classes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In a flash notice sent to all officers and members of the agency Thursday, the Metropolitan Police Department activated the entire force and postponed vacation days in anticipation of a Sept. 18 protest organized by supporters of Jan. 6 insurrection defendants, WUSA-TV reports. The rally, known as “Justice for J6,” is planned for the Union Square area of the Capitol grounds, the section of the west front encompassing the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial and Capitol reflecting pool. Matt Braynard, the head of data for the 2016 Trump campaign, announced the September gathering on Steve Bannon’s podcast, issuing a clarion call for his followers to seek justice for those charged in the riots two weeks before the inauguration of President Joe Biden. “As we continue to raise the profile of these individuals, it makes it harder and harder for the left’s phony narrative about an insurrection to stick,” Braynard said on Bannon’s podcast released July 30. “What’s going to define (the rally) is where it’s going to take place: We’re going back to the Capitol.” In a YouTube video, Braynard specifically asked rally attendees not to bring signs relitigating the 2020 election, including visible markers of support for specific political candidates.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The mayor asked residents Friday to stop watering their lawns and washing their cars immediately, saying water usage needed to be cut back because of the recent surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. The Orlando Utility Commission treats the city’s water with liquid oxygen, and supplies that ordinarily go toward water treatment have been diverted to hospitals for patients suffering from the coronavirus, Mayor Buddy Dyer said. “We acknowledge that the No. 1 priority for the liquid oxygen should be for hospitals,” Dyer said at a news conference. Since the 1990s, the utility has used liquid oxygen to remove the slight discoloration and rotten-egg smell that is found naturally in Florida’s water supply. The city-owned utility typically goes through 10 trucks of liquid oxygen a week, but its supplier recently said it would be cut back to five to seven trucks a week to accommodate hospitals, said Linda Ferrone, OUC’s chief customer and marketing officer. About 40% of the utility commission’s potable water is used for irrigation, so any strains on the water supply will be greatly reduced if residents stop watering their lawns, washing their cars or using pressure washers, she said. On its website, the utility said residents should prepare to follow the conservation measures for at least two weeks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The mayors of some of the state’s largest cities on Friday slammed Gov. Brian Kemp’s new order that aims to limit local efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. In an open letter, the mayors of Atlanta, Savannah, Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County suggested the Republican governor was putting politics above public health, and they defended mask requirements. “While Governor Kemp may find it politically necessary to hew to the course of others who live in the shadow of the former president, we are more concerned with the health and livelihood of friends we see in the grocery store, at the schools where we bring our children each morning, and who we encounter as we head into work,” the four mayors – all Democrats – wrote in the letter. “They overwhelmingly articulate support for the smart, tested public health measures that we have promoted for the past eighteen months.” An email to the governor’s office was not immediately returned. Amid a new surge of coronavirus cases that is straining hospitals, Kemp signed an executive order Thursday that says cities cannot require businesses and sports teams to enforce local pandemic restrictions. The governor presented the move as a way to protect businesses, saying some people in the state wanted to return to “lockdown mode” and close businesses.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s surging COVID-19 cases have overwhelmed its contact tracing efforts. Hawaii News Now reports the Department of Health recently expanded its contact tracing team to 313 people from 269 but still struggles to keep up with the hundreds of people newly infected each day with the coronavirus. In the middle of July, department data showed contact tracers were able to reach about 90% of people who were infected. The latest data for the first week of August showed they were only able to reach 62%. “One thing we’re seeing is there are a lot more people not picking up the phone,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, the Hawaii state epidemiologist. “That aside, we are seeing a record number of case counts in the state. Of course, that is a challenge to try to reach everyone.” A West Oahu hospital filled up Friday as the community faces a surge of COVID-19 cases. Jason Chang, CEO of The Queen’s Health Systems, said the Ewa Beach hospital has sent some patients to its sibling facility in downtown Honolulu. It has also asked staff from other parts of the Queen’s system to come help. The city has set up a triage tent outside the hospital with 25 cots. Chang said the hospital had 63 patients in its emergency room at one time, which is a crisis given the hospital only has 24 ER beds.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: Gov. Brad Little is directing $30 million to expand coronavirus testing in K-12 schools. The money is coming from emergency funds set aside by the Legislature to deal with unforeseen events, Little said. “It’s critical now,” the Republican governor said this month. “These school districts have got to have some resources.” House Republicans earlier this year killed a bill to use $40 million in federal coronavirus relief funds for voluntary testing in public and private schools. Little urged residents who haven’t been vaccinated to get their COVID-19 shots to help avoid disruptions at schools and the potential to overrun hospitals with coronavirus patients. He also said workers getting sick and schools shutting down because of coronavirus outbreaks and parents forced to stay home to care for kids and miss work could slow the state’s economic rebound. “Our workforce cannot afford to stay home because schools and day cares shut down due to outbreaks,” he said. “This threatens Idaho’s phenomenal economic success.” The Gem State has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation, with just over half of people ages 12 and up fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Masks will be required indoors throughout Cook County beginning Monday, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. The Cook County Department of Public Health issued the order Friday, saying it’s needed as new coronavirus cases continue to increase due to the more contagious delta variant. “We are in a dangerous period, with the delta variant surging, during which we must return to previous remediation measures,” said Dr. Rachel Rubin, co-lead and senior medical officer of Cook County Department of Public Health. “We have no choice but to mandate that people wear masks indoors to help contain this spread of the virus.” Illinois reported 4,904 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases Friday. That pushed the state’s seven-day average of new cases above the peak of a COVID-19 surge this spring. The health department order applies to all multi-unit residential buildings and public places such as restaurants, stores, fitness clubs and public transportation in suburban Cook County. Chicago reinstated its indoor mask mandate effective Friday, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker has already said masks are required in all schools. The mandate applies to anyone over age 2. Businesses also are required to post signs saying masks are required.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials have counted about 62,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines being tossed out in recent months across the state as the number of people seeking the shots has fallen drastically. That is about 1% of the some 6 million shots that have been given in Indiana since they first became available in December, but it’s a sign of the struggle that officials face in raising the vaccination rate. The state health department said doses can go unused by reaching their expiration date or a vial breaking, and officials knew eventually vaccine supply would outstrip demand. “We are taking every action possible to minimize wastage, including urging providers to use doses with the nearest expiration dates first and encouraging Hoosiers to get vaccinated if they are eligible,” the agency said in a statement. “In addition, we have been working with healthcare providers to allow them to order small batches of vaccine to have in their offices for patients and have increased the number of mobile vaccination clinics we are deploying across the state.” About 45% of Indiana residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, the 16th-lowest rate among the states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The city’s new mask mandate would impose the requirement on the University of Iowa’s campus, but the school will continue to strongly encourage but not require masks per guidance handed down from its own governing body, the state’s Board of Regents. Iowa City’s mandate announced Thursday evening goes against state law, said a spokesperson for Gov. Kim Reynolds, calling it “not enforceable.” May 2 guidance from the state’s Board of Regents says face masks are not required at the University of Iowa, Iowa State University or the University of Northern Iowa. Legally speaking, the regents could choose to make them required. The Board of Regents, as well as University of Iowa leadership, have not changed course on COVID-19 protocols ahead of the school year despite pressure from students and faculty to make them stronger, including mask and vaccine requirements or stronger incentivization. This month faculty and students sent a petition to the state’s board of Regents, and three faculty senate leaders sent a letter directly to President Barbara Wilson. Iowa City Mayor Bruce Teague declared a civil emergency and ordered a mask mandate late Thursday night. It applies to everyone within the limits of Iowa City when in public spaces where maintaining 6 feet of distance is not possible.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: Gov. Laura Kelly on Friday called for school districts to require masks and said she was contemplating an emergency declaration as hospitals buckle under the strain of increasingly young COVID-19 patients and as hundreds of students and staff become infected. “We really want people to understand that this is no fooling around,” Kelly lamented while speaking at Saint Luke’s South Hospital in Overland Park, which is brimming with patients. “This is an emergency.” The latest health department data shows 154 school clusters, with 1,889 cases. Kansas City, Kansas, Public Schools reported that 82 students and staff were infected in just the first nine days of the academic year, with 220 quarantined. The Turner school district began requiring masks after more than two dozen students were infected. The Wichita district, which is the state’s largest and isn’t requiring masks, has had “a few” COVID-19 cases since classes started last week, said spokeswoman Susan Arensman. She said the district won’t provide weekly updates on cases until next month. The school board for Perry-Lecompton public schools, where 16 students are quarantining, imposed a mask mandate Thursday night. “These are students that are not in school right now and cannot learn because of COVID,” Superintendent J.B. Elliott said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Top Republican lawmakers are promising to work with Gov. Andy Beshear to fight COVID-19 after a court ruling cleared the way for new limits on the Democratic governor’s emergency powers. Beshear’s allies said they’ll be watching to see if his critics follow through. Kentucky Republicans cheered the state Supreme Court ruling Saturday that ordered a lower court to dissolve an injunction that for months had blocked the GOP-backed laws. It comes as the highly contagious delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the state. The court’s decision “signals it is time for the Republican leadership to publicly put forth their plan to protect the commonwealth from this pandemic and the deadly delta variant,” said Rep. Joni Jenkins and Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the top Democrats in the Kentucky House and Senate. “We know what they don’t support; show us your plan.” The top legislative Republicans – House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers – said lawmakers are “ready to work with the governor, as we have for nearly a year and a half, and address what is a very real public health crisis.” The GOP holds supermajorities in both chambers, and Republicans accused Beshear of taking a go-it-alone approach in dealing with the pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Stressed with too little staff and too many patients in an unrelenting COVID-19 resurgence, some hospitals are pressing insurance companies to ease up on requirements that can slow the transfer of recuperating patients to other facilities. At issue are “Medicare Advantage” plans that supplement government-funded Medicare coverage. These insurance policies require extensive reviews and sometimes consultations with other doctors before transfers to inpatient facilities providing skilled nursing care, rehabilitation or long-term care. Some of these patients are clearly ready to be moved to a non-hospital setting, but the bureaucracy has them stuck in badly needed beds, said Dr. Leslie Dean, of the Willis-Knighton system in northwest Louisiana. “It’s almost impossible for them to move these people along in a timely manner right now because of these delays with some of these insurance plans, unfortunately,” she said. The delays are critical as COVID-19 numbers grow, but the issue doesn’t just involve coronavirus patients. The paperwork also can slow transfers of Medicare Advantage-covered patients recuperating from a stroke, a heart attack, or some other illness or injury that will need post-hospital attention. Statewide hospitalizations have set records almost daily through most of August.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: The pandemic put the kibosh on most of the state’s bicentennial celebrations last year, but Maine proved Saturday that it’s never too late for an old-fashioned parade. Riding in a 3D-printed boat created at the University of Maine, Gov. Janet Mills served as grand marshal of the pandemic-delayed State of Maine Bicentennial Parade that snaked its way through the cities of Lewiston and Auburn. Mills said the state has persevered in the pandemic “with the grit and grace that have shaped our state for generations.” “The Bicentennial Parade is another opportunity to honor the resilience of Maine people, to remember our history and to recommit to creating a better and brighter future for us all,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. The parade was held against a backdrop of a surge in coronavirus infections caused by the delta variant and an ongoing debate over rules put in place by the Mills administration to protect residents. Protesters opposed to the governor’s vaccination mandate for health care workers gathered on a bridge between the cities before the parade started to make their point. Some exchanged words with the governor’s supporters. Later, dozens of protesters followed the boat in which the governor was riding and shouted at her. Mills ignored them and waved to the crowd.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan, a cancer survivor, said Sunday that he’s received a third shot of COVID-19 vaccine, and he’s urging the federal government to make booster shots available earlier than currently planned. Hogan appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and said he received the additional dose this past week on the recommendation of his doctors. Asked if he wanted Marylanders to get the booster shot as soon as possible or wait the eight months that is currently recommended under federal guidelines, he said: “No, we can’t wait that long.” He said he’s pushing the federal government to speed up the time frame for providing booster shots, and he’s pushing for full FDA approval of the vaccines. He said many of those who have refused to get the shots have cited the fact that the available vaccines do not have full approval but are being administered under an emergency use authorization. Federal officials announced last week a plan to start administering booster shots to the general public beginning the week of Sept. 20. The recommendations call for people to wait eight months from their second dose, which they said was a judgment call about when vaccine protection against severe illness might fall. Some public health experts have said a booster shot administered too early won’t be as effective.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Masks will be required for all indoor public places starting this Friday as the city moves to contain rising coronavirus infections blamed on the highly contagious delta variant, acting Mayor Kim Janey said late last week. Janey’s office issued a statement saying the mandate will apply to everyone age 2 and older who enters a business, retail shop, club, government office or any other public venue. Janey said the mask mandate was being imposed ahead of the arrival of more than 50,000 college students from across the nation and a return to classes for more than 50,000 Boston Public School students. “There is nothing more important than Boston’s safe recovery, reopening, and renewal from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “We know that masks work best when everyone wears one. Requiring masks indoors is a proactive public health measure to limit transmission of the delta variant, boost the public confidence in our businesses and venues, and protect the residents of our city who are too young for vaccination.” On Thursday, Gov. Charlie Baker said tens of thousands of state workers will need to prove they’re fully inoculated against COVID-19 by October or risk losing their jobs. Massachusetts remains one of the most vaccinated states in the nation, with more than 64% of residents fully inoculated against COVID-19.\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: The Michigan Court of Appeals has granted a new hearing to a man who claimed his rights were violated when he was sentenced for a crime by video, a common practice during the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Christian participated and spoke during a hearing last fall in Oakland County court and had a lawyer present. But the appeals court still found problems. “At no point during the hearing did the trial court obtain a waiver of defendant’s right to be physically present in the courtroom for sentencing,” judges Jane Markey and Brock Swartzle said in a 2-1 opinion Thursday. Christian, 38, was convicted of uttering and publishing, a crime typically related to forging documents, and sentenced to a minimum of a year in prison. Judge Michael Riordan disagreed with the majority, saying Christian failed to show that the error “affected substantial rights.” “He has not shown or even argued, for example, that he would have received a lighter sentence if he was physically present,” Riordan said. Christian remains in prison for other unrelated crimes in Macomb County.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: St. Cloud State University and St. Cloud Technical & Community College, alongside all Minnesota state colleges and universities, will mandate COVID-19 vaccination or frequent coronavirus testing for certain student groups, according to a memo from Chancellor Devinder Malhotra. The memo, sent Wednesday to Minnesota State’s Leadership Council, said the system’s schools would require vaccination attestation for “specific student groups or populations that are in settings where there is close and frequent contact with others.” That includes students living in residence facilities run by the school system, those participating in intercollegiate athletics, and those required to by clinical or internship sites. Additionally, the memo said, colleges and universities could include other extracurriculars that pose difficulties for social distancing. As of Friday, the technical and community college hadn’t had conversations about student groups, though the school is limiting large group gatherings. Vice President of Administration Lori Kloos said extracurricular activities are being kept to a minimum but may continue in different ways, such as meeting outside or virtually.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: Two concert venues are now requiring guests to provide proof they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19 or show negative coronavirus test results. The Lyric and Proud Larry’s in Oxford announced last week that they would implement the requirements, The Oxford Eagle reports. Lyric general manager Lindsay Dillon-Maginnis said the regulations have been a trend nationwide for music festivals. “Promoters who have been in our line of work, we could see the storm coming,” Dillon-Maginnis told the paper. Not every venue in Mississippi is following suit. Entertainer Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit announced Friday that they would pull out of a show at the Brandon Amphitheater scheduled for October. Isbell said the venue would not require that attendees show proof of vaccination or a negative test. “Unfortunately, the powers that be were not willing to comply with the band’s updated Health and Safety standards,” a statement from Southeastern Records said. Dillon-Maginnis said there has been “overwhelmingly large majority of support” for the policy, with less than 1% of ticket holders requesting a refund. “I think what people see online or what you see in comments is vitriolic or negative,” she said. “But with those people, if you dig deeper, have no connection to the Lyric or Oxford or even Mississippi.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: New COVID-19 hospital admissions are reaching winter surge levels in the city, and southeast Missouri hospitals are under strain due to a surge in coronavirus cases and a rise in deaths. On Thursday, hospitals in St. Louis reported admitting 100 new patients with COVID-19 – the most since Jan. 16, according to the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force. A total of 585 people were hospitalized, including 25 children, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Twelve of those children are younger than 12 and not yet eligible for vaccines. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Southeast Hospital and Saint Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau has increased by more than 50% in the past week and a half, according to data released Thursday by both facilities. Saint Francis, which reopened its COVID-19 care unit last week, reported 39 coronavirus inpatients as of early Thursday afternoon, up from 25 just 10 days ago. At Southeast Hospital, the number of COVID-19 inpatients increased from 22 about 10 days ago to 32 as of Thursday morning, the Southeast Missourian reports. Statewide, the death toll from the rapidly spreading delta variant continues to rise in Missouri, with July shaping up to be an even deadlier month than earlier reported.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: While many large companies across the U.S. have announced that COVID-19 vaccines will be required for their employees to return to work in person, Montana stands alone in banning such mandates. Under a new law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this year, requiring vaccines as a condition for employment is deemed “discrimination” and a violation of the state’s human rights laws. Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a law like this for private employers, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. The law has raised concern among employers across the state as Montana struggles with a rise in COVID-19 cases that is once again straining the state’s health care system. Pushback swelled last week when physicians called on the Legislature to reverse the law. “This is against everything we’ve ever known or believed about public health,” said Dr. Pamela Cutler, president of the Montana Medical Association. “I believe it’s a travesty now, and it needs to be fixed so that we can make our offices safe for patients and our co-workers.” GOP lawmakers who supported the bill in the Legislature said it was needed in response to employers “coercing” employees to get vaccinations under threat of termination.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Nebraska Medical Center on Friday announced it’s reducing inpatient surgeries at the Omaha hospital because of the rise in COVID-19 cases. The change will take effect Aug. 30, Nebraska Medicine spokesman Taylor Wilson said in a news release. Wilson said inpatient surgeries likely will be limited through October. Nebraska Medicine is not limiting surgeries at Bellevue Medical Center or any other outpatient surgery clinics. Wilson said the rise in coronavirus patients, who need extra care and resources, strained Nebraska Medical Center. On top of that, he said, Nebraska is facing a nursing shortage. Nebraskans can help to ease the strain on hospitals by getting vaccinated against COVID-19, Wilson said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Half of all eligible residents are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, pushing the state closer to the national inoculation rate of about 60% for all people 12 and older, state health officials said. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said Friday that the 50% mark for residents 12 and up who are now fully vaccinated is an “incredible milestone to reach.” “We know there is more work to be done and we will remain focused on promoting vaccine opportunities throughout the state,” he said in a statement. Among those 12 and older, 60.5% have initiated vaccination, receiving at least one dose of vaccine, officials said. Nationally, 59.8% of that age group was fully vaccinated, and 70.4% had received the first of two shots as of Thursday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nevada’s 14-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases and positivity rate both declined through the week after a steady rise began in early June. At an emergency meeting Friday, the state Board of Health approved a vaccine mandate plan for Nevada’s public colleges and universities scheduled to take effect Nov. 1. The requirement will not affect enrollment until the spring semester.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House of Representatives will begin holding committee meetings on retained bills this week, without the option to participate remotely that existed during much of the coronavirus pandemic. In the calendar published Friday, House Speaker Sherman Packard reminded lawmakers that the emergency order allowing public bodies to meet remotely without a physical quorum present in the same location expired when the governor lifted the state of emergency June 11. That means House committees meeting to discuss bills that were set aside for more work must meet in person at the Legislative Office Building, which has reopened to the public. Packard said dozens of additional air purification units have been set up throughout the office building and Statehouse, and each meeting room will have air treatment that meets or exceeds federal health guidelines for office buildings. Masks will be encouraged but not required.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A group of parents wants Gov. Phil Murphy to remove the ban on virtual learning for the 2021-22 school year and provide a permanent remote learning option for K-12 schools. A change.org petition started by New Jersey Parents for Virtual Choice has garnered more than 17,000 signatures. The parents are driven by a variety of reasons, some related to health and safety concerns due to the coronavirus and the highly transmissible delta variant, said group spokesperson Karen Strauss. Some parents want to retain the virtual learning option from last year because their children excelled, she said. The petition asks Murphy to let K-12 schools continue to offer virtual learning for parents who want it and to create a permanent virtual learning option by approving free virtual-only public or charter schools. It also asks Murphy to meet with the group. “New Jersey needs to catch up,” Strauss said, referring to school systems in other states that offer virtual learning options. Strauss said she wants a virtual option for her 5-year-old son, who has asthma and high-functioning autism. She said he thrived during remote learning last year even though it took some getting used to, but her primary consideration is his health. “We already lost someone to COVID. I’m not risking him getting sick,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: About 150 people protested in front of the state Capitol on Friday, demanding an end to vaccine mandates for health care workers. Many protesters identified themselves as hospital workers – nurses, nursing assistants and clerical workers. Other attendees included correctional officers, retirees and children of health care workers. A state mandate requires nurses and other workers in high-risk environments to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and some hospitals have their own mandates. “I believe the vaccine is harmful,” said practical nurse Katrina Philpot, who was picketing along the road outside the Capitol complex with a sign that read: “Healthcare workers deserve rights.” Philpot said the hospital where she works in Rio Rancho is requiring her to be vaccinated by Aug. 27 or be fired. She fears she won’t qualify for medical or religious exemptions to the mandate. State employees, including prison guards, are required to get COVID-19 shots or submit to weekly testing. At least one prison guard has sued the state over the mandate. New Mexico has outpaced neighboring states when it comes to getting people vaccinated. About two-thirds of residents 18 and up have been fully inoculated, but state health officials have warned that evidence shows vaccinated people can still get infected and spread the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s public schools will require COVID-19 shots for student-athletes and coaches participating in “high-risk” sports including football, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, lacrosse, rugby and bowling, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday. The students and coaches will have to get at least one dose of vaccine before the start of competitive play, de Blasio said on radio station WNYC. Bowling, while not a contact sport like football or wrestling, is on the list because it is indoors, de Blasio said. Masks will be required for all students and staff when school starts Sept. 13, but while the mayor has urged all New Yorkers who are eligible for COVID-19 shots to get them, vaccination is not required either for school staff or for students over age 12. Asked about the possibility of requiring public school teachers to be vaccinated, de Blasio said: “We’re actively looking right now at different actions we could take.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Children now must get approval from a parent before receiving the current COVID-19 vaccine available to them under legislation that Gov. Roy Cooper signed into law Friday. The written consent requirement is contained in a broader measure that largely expands the medications or immunizations, including vaccines, that pharmacists trained to deliver shots can administer to consumers. It comes even as the U.S. and North Carolina see a marked rise in coronavirus cases due to a highly contagious variant. The measure, which received nearly unanimous support in the Republican-controlled General Assembly, also states that trained pharmacy technicians and interns can administer a COVID-19 or flu vaccine under a pharmacist’s supervision. “This important legislation will help our state administer COVID-19 vaccines more quickly and efficiently,” Cooper, a Democrat, said in a news release announcing the bill signing. Permission from a parent or guardian applies immediately to vaccines authorized by federal regulators for emergency use – such as the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer – and administered by any health care provider. State law had given minors the ability on their own to be treated for certain health issues, including communicable diseases.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Amid a COVID-19 resurgence, advocates are calling on nursing homes to require that all staff members get vaccinated, and a nonprofit tracking the latest data says there haven’t been enough workers getting on board. The latest COVID-19 dashboard from AARP shows that only 24% of senior care facilities in North Dakota have met the industry target of having at least 75% of their staffs inoculated against the disease. Josh Askvig, state director of AARP North Dakota, said experts don’t want to go back to last fall, when the state saw some of the highest coronavirus death rates among patients. “What’s concerning right now is as new variants are emerging, facilities cannot let preventable problems be repeated,” Askvig said. “We’ve got to increase vaccinations, and we’ve got to do it now.” The latest AARP dashboard also shows nearly 12% of North Dakota nursing homes lack personal protective equipment to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Askvig said the state should help to ensure they have enough supplies. As for the vaccinations, he said facilities need to step up in the area. “They’ve got the resources through the different relief funding to get it done,” Askvig said. “And so we’re encouraging everyone eligible for the vaccine to get vaccinated.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: While COVID-19 cases have reportedly risen nationally among children, that trend has yet to show up locally. Instead, another common virus has squeezed Nationwide Children’s Hospital in recent weeks: The pediatric hospital is dealing with a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus, which usually begins circulating more in the fall rather than late summer. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why RSV is showing up again now, but the coronavirus pandemic is likely the cause, said Dr. Mike Patrick, an emergency department physician at Nationwide Children’s. With everyone masking up, staying home and keeping their distance, RSV didn’t spread as easily in 2020. Now that more families are getting out and doing things, and kids are returning to school and day care, RSV is able to spread, Patrick said. “No one knows for certain what is driving this,” he said. “But being isolated and behind masks and then suddenly reintroducing people together really fuels the spread of these viral illnesses.” The spike in RSV cases is similar to what Nationwide Children’s usually sees at its peak in winter, Patrick said. But Patrick said he worries whether COVID-19 cases could also start showing up more in kids seeking treatment at Nationwide Children’s.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt is criticizing both a northeast Oklahoma school district that adopted a mask mandate and President Joe Biden over comments that the state’s ban on school mask requirements ban may violate a coronavirus aid package for schools. The Republican governor and state Attorney General John O’Connor released a joint statement Thursday criticizing the Hulbert school district for its mask requirement. “It is disappointing that one school district has chosen to openly violate a state law that was supported by 80 percent of the Legislature,” Stitt said in the statement. The district’s policy includes an opt-out option for medical reasons. Earlier this month Stitt praised two Oklahoma City school districts for mask mandates that included opt-out options for medical, religious or personal reasons. O’Connor said that the law is constitutional and that the state is fighting a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality. Stitt’s criticism of Biden comes after U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in letters to him and state school Superintendent Joy Hofmeister on Wednesday that the school mask ban may violate the American Rescue Plan that provided $123 billion to the nation’s schools to help them return to the classroom.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Managers from a senior living facility say a video posted to social media by a recruiter for the company saying she would hire unvaccinated health care workers does not reflect the company’s views. Shayna Hall, a recruiter for Salem-based Bonaventure Senior Living, a senior assisted living community with locations in Oregon, Washington and Colorado, posted the video on TikTok last month, as first reported by the Salem Reporter. In the video, which has been deleted from Hall’s account but can still be found on other posters’ accounts, Hall says she came across medical workers posting on TikTok about being fired or forced out of their jobs because they refuse to get a “brand new vaccine.” “I just wanted to tell you if you are a nurse, a caregiver, a med tech, and you now need a new job because of this, hit me up, I’ll hire you,” she says in the video. “I need nurses, caregivers, med techs in Washington, Colorado and Oregon. Take your pick.” While the COVID-19 vaccines are new, the research behind them is not. Scientists around the world have been working on vaccines for the SARS coronavirus for more 20 years. Hall’s video swiftly ignited controversy online. Many have decried the company’s willingness to hire unvaccinated employees to serve elderly and high-risk residents.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s unemployment rate dropped to a new post-pandemic low in July, and the labor force shrank, as payrolls jumped by nearly 29,000, according to figures released Friday. Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate dropped three-tenths of a percentage point to 6.6% from June’s adjusted rate, the state Department of Labor and Industry said. The national rate was 5.4% in July, more than a point below Pennsylvania’s. The figures come out as the federal government prepares to end supplemental payments of $300 a week to people who lost jobs or self-employment income during the pandemic. The $300 payments last through the week ending Sept. 3. In a survey of households, the labor force shrank by 16,000 in July, closer to 6.3 million. However, the number of employed grew slightly, while the number of unemployed slid by 19,000. The state hit a record-high labor force of almost 6.6 million just before the pandemic hit. In a separate survey of employers, payrolls grew in July by 28,800, to above 5.7 million. The state has regained about 65% of the 1.1 million jobs lost in the pandemic. It hit a record high for payrolls of 6.1 million just before the pandemic hit, according to state figures. The leisure and hospitality sector led all gainers, adding 16,000 jobs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s downtown arts festival has been canceled for the second year in a row amid rising cases of COVID-19, city officials announced Friday. PVDFest, a weekend festival that typically draws more 100,000 people to downtown Providence, was scheduled to make its comeback Sept. 25-26. But officials said it would be unsafe to continue amid high levels of coronavirus transmission. Mayor Jorge Elorza said the decision was made “after carefully considering the increased spread of the delta variant.” “Together we can beat this virus and return to dancing and celebrating together downtown next year,” Elorza said in a statement. Although the downtown event is canceled, smaller outdoor art programs affiliated with the festival will continue in the coming weeks. Officials said face masks will be strongly recommended. Rhode Island is averaging about 310 new COVID-19 cases a day, up from about 196 a day two weeks ago. The festival was started in 2015 and has featured more than 5,000 artists and performers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s health agency became the latest group Friday to ask lawmakers to make it clear that school districts can require students to wear masks without losing state budget money or facing any other penalties. The General Assembly put the mask ban item into the budget in early June when South Carolina was seeing an average of 150 COVID-19 cases a day. Ten weeks later, the state is seeing about 3,520 new cases each day. And that dire new case average comes before about 700,000 public school students completed their first week back in classrooms. Of the more than 5,200 new coronavirus cases reported Friday, more than 500 were in children 10 or younger. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control Board voted unanimously Friday to ask the state House and Senate to come back in special session to “provide local authority for mask mandates.” They joined the Republican state education superintendent, House Democrats, teacher groups, an association of school board members, a group of two Democratic and two Republican state senators, several school boards, and other groups that have asked lawmakers to reconsider the mask ban.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that she is planning to focus on water, sewer and broadband infrastructure projects as the state plans to spend nearly $1 billion in federal funds meant to help towns and cities recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The state government is readying to receive $974.5 million from the federal government over the next year and a half. Over the course of the pandemic, South Dakota has been alloted more than $4.8 billion in federal relief funds – a windfall that nearly matches the state’s annual budget. Under the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress, state and local governments must use the funds to respond to COVID-19. They can use the money for public health programs, addressing the financial fallout of the pandemic, replacing lost revenues, paying for essential workers, or infrastructure. The Republiacn governor said the state has “broad flexibility” in using the money. Meanwhile, daily coronavirus cases across the state on Friday topped 300 for the first time in more than six months as a fresh pandemic wave appeared to build. In the past two weeks, the state has seen case counts spike by 270%, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. However, the number of cases per capita in that time has remained one of the lowest in the country.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Bluff City teens have been leading the state’s surge of recent COVID-19 vaccinations. The 15-19 age group in the Memphis region showed the greatest growth of any age group across the state’s eight regions from late July through last week, according to a new study by researchers at the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt School of Medicine. Vaccinations among residents ages 12-14 also grew, according to the study. The increase in vaccinations comes as infections and hospitalizations surged through July and August, driven by the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The burden of new COVID-19 cases across the state is among the Tennessee’s younger populations, who are also less likely to be inoculated, researchers concluded. Findings show infections have grown the most among people in their early 20s. The two western Tennessee regions saw the greatest vaccination growth, according to the study, though each of the eight regions in the state saw growth in vaccinations beginning in late July. The state’s metropolitan areas of Nashville, Knoxville and Memphis have the highest vaccination rates in nearly all age groups, the researchers wrote. The lowest rates are among the Upper Cumberland region of Cookeville and surrounding counties.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The lieutenant governor blamed rising hospitalization and death rates from COVID-19 on unvaccinated Black people in comments that were quickly denounced as racist. Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick made the remarks Thursday night on a Fox News segment in response to question about the latest coronavirus surge in Texas, which is seeing its highest hospitalization rates since January. “The biggest group in most states are African Americans who have not been vaccinated,” Patrick said. He did not change course Friday, saying that “Democrat social media trolls” misstated facts and that he had used state data in his assertions. But statistics from the Texas Department of State Health Services don’t back that. Black people – who make up about 12% of Texas’ population – accounted for about 15% of total COVID-19 cases and just more than 10% of deaths. Patrick also told Fox News that Democrats were to blame for low vaccination rates among Black people, who frequently support that party, even though he believes Republicans should persuade more people to get their shots, too. But he also tiptoed around that issue, which has been sensitive for the GOP. About 8% of Texans who have been fully vaccinated are Black, according to state data. The resulting percentage of Black people who’ve been inoculated is unclear.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The mayor announced Friday that she had issued a mask order in the city’s K-12 schools as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus spreads. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she used her emergency powers to issue the order and plans to work with health officials to determine when it can be lifted. “As Mayor it is my responsibility to do everything I can to keep our City, and our school district, from going down the tragic and dangerous path many others are already on,” Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. The order came a week after the Salt Lake County Council overturned a school mask order for kids under 12 that the county’s top health official issued. Mendenhall said the majority of board members had privately told her they feared retaliation and urged her to issue the order. “Unfortunately, and despite all the evidence that masks protect children and the adults who care for them, this issue has become politicized to the point that elected bodies across the country, and in the State of Utah, worry about retaliation if they take stand as an organization,” she wrote. Masks were required in classrooms last year, but under a new state law, school mask mandates are banned. Local health departments can issue a rule with the support of elected county leaders, but anti-mask advocates have been vocal in their opposition.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state and Vermont Legal Aid have reached a settlement over the end of a hotel voucher program for some of the homeless population during the pandemic, the Vermont Agency of Human Services and the legal services group announced Friday. Under the settlement, eligibility for the general assistance emergency housing program will be expanded for people with disabilities, and a formal process will be created for applicants whose health or welfare would be at risk due to their disability if they were unsheltered, the groups said. Last year Vermont expanded eligibility for the program during the pandemic to allow more people to stay temporarily in hotels and motels. It ended the program for some in July and gave $2,500 checks to those who were no longer eligible. Vermont Legal Aid sued, and a judge signed an agreement extending the emergency housing for some people to show they had a disability and could remain eligible. “People with disabilities who are experiencing homelessness will now be able to access GA benefits even if they are able to work,” Vermont Legal Aid staff attorney Jessica Radbord said in a statement. “We believe this will protect some truly vulnerable members of our community from suffering negative health consequences as a result of being unsheltered.”\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: More than 200 University of Virginia students who didn’t comply with the school’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement have been disenrolled ahead of the fall semester. The move affected 238 students, including 49 students who were enrolled in fall courses, The Virginian-Pilot reports. That may mean that “a good number” of the remaining students “may not have been planning to return to the university this fall at all,” university spokesperson Brian Coy said. The students were disenrolled after “receiving multiple reminders via email, text, phone calls, calls to parents that they were out of compliance,” Coy said. They can reenroll if they comply with the vaccine requirement or file an exemption by Wednesday. About 96.6% of students have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to a news release. The university granted 335 permanent vaccine waivers for students with religious or medical exemptions. The university also granted 184 temporary vaccine waivers for students who couldn’t get inoculated but intend to get a COVID-19 shot once on campus. Exempt students must be tested weekly for the coronavirus and wear a mask in indoor and outdoor common spaces.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee’s announcement of mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for state workers comes at a time when the state ferry system is experiencing a severe staffing shortage. KUOW reports that in an Aug. 13 notice, Washington State Ferries Chief of Staff Nicole McIntosh said there were “an unprecedented 91 relief requests yesterday.” She thanked the crew members who helped cover for their absent colleagues. In response to the shortage, the agency canceled sailings and went from two ferries on the Edmonds-Kingston and Clinton-Mukilteo routes to one. Washington State Ferries spokesperson Ian Sterling said staffing issues have been a chronic problem throughout the pandemic, but that week was “as bad as it’s been, due to the labor shortage, due to people out with active COVID or having to quarantine.” Capt. Dan Twohig, the regional representative of the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, one of several unions representing ferry service workers, said last week’s staff shortages were an anomaly. A coalition of unions representing Washington State Ferries employees started bargaining with state officials last week over the implementation of the vaccine mandate. Twohig said the unions agree that the mandate is legal and will go forward.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Friday launched a second round of vaccination sweepstakes, this time with prizes aimed at enticing younger residents to sign up for COVID-19 shots as the pandemic continues to worsen. The first of six weekly drawings will be held Aug. 31. Registration opens Monday. All residents must register again for the new drawings, even if they were registered for the first series of prizes earlier this summer, Justice said at a news conference. The prizes include season ticket packages to West Virginia University and Marshall sporting events, ski lift tickets, and a 10-year supply of free gas. Also being given away each week will be a $150,000 dream wedding, a luxury sports car, a custom fishing boat, ATVs or high-end lawnmowers, and college scholarships for residents ages 12 to 25. The governor’s announcement came as the number of people hospitalized statewide from COVID-19 reached 447, the most since late January. More than 1,350 coronavirus cases had been reported statewide in the prior two days alone. Cases of the more contagious delta variant of the virus are now present in at least 46 of the state’s 55 counties, according to health department data.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOneida: At least three American Indian tribes in the state will put cash in the pockets of their members and employees to get COVID-19 shots. The Oneida, Menominee and Ho-Chunk tribes are offering a $500 incentive for vaccinations. The offer includes those who have already been inoculated. For the Menominee Nation, members ages 12 and older as well as tribal employees who are fully vaccinated on or before Oct. 31 are eligible. Oneida tribal members and employees have until Sept. 30 to show proof of their vaccination to receive the $500. Ho-Chunk Nation members have until Nov. 1 to provide proof. “We know that once we can get at least 75% of our community vaccinated, we’re going to be able to have that level of safety that we can,” said Debbie Danforth, director of the Oneida Nation Division of Health. So far, Danforth said about 5,000 tribal members, or about 30%, have been vaccinated, WLUK-TV reports. The rate for employees is about 50%. Marlon Skenandore, who had COVID-19 last year and is still dealing with its effects, said the incentive is not swaying his decision on whether to get vaccinated. “I’m just hesitant about the FDA not approving it and not going through its normal procedure, so I’m on the fence, but I’m leaning towards getting it,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Grand Teton National Park had its busiest month on record in July. July is almost always the busiest month for tourism in the park in northwestern Wyoming. In July 2021, almost 830,000 people visited, park officials said in a statement. That was up from 796,000 in July 2018, the second-busiest month in records dating to 1979. July was the first time Grand Teton topped 800,000 visitors in a month. Visitation was up almost 10% compared to July 2020, when the park had just reopened after being mostly closed by the coronavirus pandemic. Accompanying the tourism surge, camping was up 2.7%, backcountry camping was up 15%, and trail use was up 21% in July 2021 compared to July 2019. Researchers this summer have been studying the relationship between the number of vehicles entering Grand Teton and visitor traffic at key areas of the park, park officials said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/09/fermenting-skills-exodus-debunked-nurse-strike-news-around-states/115541110/", "title": "Fermenting skills, exodus debunked: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state’s mask mandate expires April 9 but not the recommendation to wear masks, the state health officer emphasized Friday. “There is nothing magical about the date of April 9. We don’t want the public to think that’s the day we all stop taking precautions,” State Health Officer Scott Harris told reporters. Gov. Kay Ivey has extended Alabama’s mask order through the evening of April 9 but said after that she will let it expire. She said then it will be a matter of personal responsibility. State health officials urged people to maintain precautions – particularly during spring break and Easter gatherings – as the state tries to ramp up COVID-19 vaccinations. Dr. Sarah Nafziger, vice president of clinic support services at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said she hopes people continue to wear masks when the mandate goes away. “I hope people do continue to make the right choice now because we are not out of the woods yet. We have a lot of vulnerable people in our population, and the last thing we want to do is for them to be sick and for them to die,” Nafziger said. So far about 14% of the state’s 4.9 million people have received at least one shot of vaccine. The Alabama National Guard will travel to the Black Belt this month to deliver vaccinations in communities with few medical providers.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Traveling across the rugged, unforgiving Alaska terrain is already hard enough, but whatever comforts mushers previously had in the world’s most famous sled dog race have been cast aside this year due to the pandemic. In years past, mushers would stop in any number of 24 villages that serve as checkpoints, where they could get a hot meal, maybe a shower and sleep – albeit “cheek to jowl” – in a warm building before getting back to the nearly 1,000-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off Sunday north of Anchorage. Participants will instead spend the next week or so mostly camping in tents outside towns, and the only source of warmth – for comfort or to heat up frozen food and water – will come from their camp cookers. “It’s a little bit old school,” said Iditarod CEO Rob Urbach. This year’s race will be marked by pandemic precautions, a route change, no spectators, vigorous coronavirus testing and the smallest field of competitors in decades. The route has also been shortened to 860 miles. For the first time in the race’s 49-year history, the finish line will not be in Nome. Instead, mushers will go from Willow to the mining ghost towns of Iditarod and Flat, and then back to Willow for the finish. This, Urbach notes, was the original vision of the race co-founder, the late Joe Redington.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state is reporting a daily number of new COVID-19 cases below 1,000 for the first time in months along with no new deaths. State health officials on Monday said there are 783 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus. With that latest figure, the state’s pandemic total number of cases sits at 827,237. The death toll remains 16,328. The number of vaccine doses administered around Arizona was up to 2.1 million, with more than 1.3 million people having received at least one shot. That’s more than 19% of the state’s population. The number of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized statewide dipped to 919, the fewest since Nov. 1. The number of intensive care beds used by COVID-19 patients fell to 256, the fewest since Nov. 6. In Sunday’s update from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Arizona ranked seventh in the nation for COVID-19 deaths per capita over the past seven days and 19th in cases. The number of infections is thought to be far higher than reported because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Plans for five mass COVID-19 vaccination clinics in the state each week starting Thursday have been announced by the Arkansas Department of Health. The first clinic will be Thursday at the Conway County Fairgrounds in Morrilton, the health department announced late Friday. Next Friday there will be clinics at Greater Second Baptist Church in Little Rock; Arkansas Northeastern College in Blytheville; the Fordyce Civic Center; and the Marianna Civic Center. Vaccines will be available to those currently eligible for a vaccination, including anyone 65 or older, those who work in education and those working in food manufacturing. The health department said separate clinics in each of the state’s five public health regions will be scheduled each week, and doses will initially be provided on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBerkeley: A popular notion that there was a mass exodus from the Golden State last year after the pandemic hit is wrong, according to research from a nonpartisan think tank. Most moves during 2020 happened within the state, the California Policy Lab said Thursday. Departures were consistent with historical patterns, but the biggest statewide change was that fewer people moved into California, the group said in a statement. The lab’s researchers used a dataset of quarterly credit bureau information called the University of California Consumer Credit Panel to analyze where people from each county moved after the coronavirus crisis struck a year ago. “While a mass exodus from California clearly didn’t happen in 2020, the pandemic did change some historical patterns,” author Natalie Holmes said. “At the county level, however, San Francisco is experiencing a unique and dramatic exodus, which is causing 50% or 100% increases in Bay Area in-migration for some counties in the Sierras.” Net exits from San Francisco between the end of last March and the end of 2020 increased 649%, compared to the same period in 2019. About two-thirds remained within the 11-county San Francisco Bay Area economic region, and 80% stayed in California.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Authorities have fielded hundreds of tips involving a massive, largely unmasked weekend gathering near the University of Colorado at Boulder in which participants damaged cars, set off fireworks, and tossed bottles and rocks at police, slightly injuring three officers, officials said Monday. Boulder County health authorities, meanwhile, warned of a possible surge in coronavirus cases because of the Saturday night melee in which as many as 800 people flooded streets in a neighborhood known as University Hill, home to many university students as well as residents. Caroline Wiygul, a junior majoring in environmental studies and English, said she was running errands with a friend Saturday when about 100 people milling in the street blocked their way home. They called police and hurried to a friend’s house, where they spent the next six hours inside as the melee outside grew larger, louder and more violent. “It was really stressful,” Wygul said. “It’s upsetting because obviously it became a big public health risk. I don’t think the police handled it that well. I think the party could have been shut down early in the afternoon.” University Chancellor Philip Distefano warned that any student involved in violence, property damage, refusing to disperse or violating virus-related protocols faces discipline up to expulsion. Health officials urged anyone who was at the scene to quarantine for at least 10 days and get tested for the coronavirus.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Not all businesses are planning to rush back into their shared workspaces following Gov. Ned Lamont’s decision to lift restrictions on offices. Many business leaders say they expect a slower reentry now that many office workers have spent nearly a year working remotely. David Griggs, president and chief executive of the MetroHartford Alliance, an economic development group, told the Hartford Courant that he sees more companies opting for a hybrid working life, with some time in the office and some time spent working remotely. “You’re going to see it trickle back in, and it’s going to be slow,” Griggs told the newspaper. Lamont also announced dramatic rollbacks on other restrictions Thursday, covering restaurants, stores, houses of worship, gyms and others that will be allowed to go back to full capacity March 19. Masks and social distancing protocols will still be required, which could put a pause on many workers returning to their offices right away. Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin told the newspaper he doesn’t expect significant change in downtown offices until the summer or fall. Meanwhile, he will focus on creating opportunities for outdoor activity in the warmer months.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state is expanding COVID-19 vaccine availability among educators and will hold an event next weekend at Dover International Speedway to inoculate thousands of educators, school staff and child care workers. The event in Dover on Saturday and Sunday will be hosted by the Division of Public Health, the Delaware Emergency Management Agency and the Delaware Department of Education. The Department of Education, in partnership with Albertsons Pharmacy, has vaccinated more than 5,500 educators and school staff, roughly a third of those who expressed interest in vaccination. More than half of those people have been fully vaccinated. Educators, school staff and child care workers who have expressed interest in vaccination should expect invitations from the department soon. The press release also said educators, school staff and child care workers can sign up for appointments at Walgreens as part of a partnership between the pharmacy giant and the federal government. Walgreens will pause new vaccination appointments for other eligible populations to prioritize educator vaccinations in Delaware through March, in accordance with federal guidance.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city is launching a vaccine preregistration system this week that allows people to input their information online or through a call center, WUSA-TV reports. DC Health will then contact those residents to make an appointment instead of select groups having to compete for a chance to sign up at a specific release time every week, which had frustrated citizens and overloaded the existing system. Councilmember Elissa Silverman said she still had questions about the site. “This system will put the control in the government’s hands ... and then it’s a little unclear right now to me how the prioritization will work,” she said. Silverman said she was also unsure how long people would have to claim their appointment once notified. Still, the current vaccine appointment system hasn’t made the process easy. D.C. resident Zelda Wait tried to sign up for an appointment Friday morning after she became eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine because of a medical condition. “I didn’t get notified until 12 minutes before the actual vaccine schedules were released,” Wait said. She rushed to the website and was put in a queue but didn’t end up getting a spot. “Why should we have to basically go through the Hunger Games to get this lifesaving vaccine?” Wait said. “It doesn’t make any sense.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOcala: Sometime this month, all Floridians age 60 and up will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines, an expansion beyond the current restriction limiting the shots to people 65 and older, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Friday. DeSantis said the shift in age restrictions will be made depending on the supply of vaccines coming to the state, and it may ultimately include people age 55 and older. “It will happen in March. We will move the age down,” DeSantis said at a retirement community in Ocala. For the past several months, only seniors, residents and staff of long-term care facilities, and health care workers have been eligible for the vaccines in Florida. Eligibility only in the past week opened up to school employees, along with police officers and firefighters age 50 and over. DeSantis also issued an order for the extremely vulnerable to have access to the shot at doctors’ offices and pharmacies beginning Wednesday. Previously the group could only get vaccinated at hospitals. But this past Friday, some lawmakers said people with doctor’s notes were turned away at a Miami vaccination site because they did not provide a state form that had to be filled out by their physician to confirm they were extremely vulnerable to the coronavirus and eligible for the vaccine. The form was released earlier in the week.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Classrooms, dorms, cafeterias and stadiums are likely to be full again this fall at the state’s public universities. The University System of Georgia on Wednesday announced it has asked all campuses to plan for normal operations during the fall 2021 semester. “This decision comes as wider availability of vaccines over the next few months is anticipated to control the spread of COVID-19,” the system said in a statement last week. Regents instructed the 26 schools, with more than 340,000 students, to maintain some level of in-person classes last fall and to increase the number of in-person classes this spring. Georgia Tech President Angel Cabrera wrote that the university plans to “return to campus with full operations and a complete residential experience for our students this fall.” Some faculty members and employees have criticized in-person class mandates, saying universities weren’t allowing many employees to work remotely, putting their health at risk. Several campuses had notable outbreaks in August and September after students first returned. And Gov. Brian Kemp did not include university employees when he widened eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines to groups including K-12 and preschool education employees starting Monday. But shots for teachers could be coming by fall.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Visitation at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park declined by more than half last year compared with 2019 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, park officials said. The National Park Service said 589,775 people visited the Big Island park in 2020 compared with the nearly 1.4 million people who visited the year before, West Hawaii Today reports. That’s a 57% decline. Park officials anticipated an increase early last year following the annual boost from the winter holidays and had reported a slight 2% increase in guests in January and February compared with the previous year. However, the park closed between March and June as a safety measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and visitation remained low even when it reopened, officials said. Hawaii tourism dropped significantly as a result of travel restrictions and business closures caused by the pandemic. Visitors are still required to wear facial coverings and encouraged to follow safety measures such as maintaining 6 feet of space between groups and washing hands, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park Superintendent Rhonda Loh said. Puukohola Heiau National Historic Site, on the other side of the Big Island, saw an 82% decline in visitors, officials said. Last year, 23,970 people visited the park compared with the 133,573 in 2019.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Under Gov. Brad Little’s direction, the state has launched a new COVID-19 vaccine solution to help alleviate the frustration of many Idahoans in trying to make an appointment to get a shot. The new COVID-19 vaccine appointment preregistration system is available at covidvaccine.idaho.gov. “The ability for Idahoans to get a vaccine – should they choose to do so – is my top priority,” Little said in a statement. The new system “is user-friendly, easy to understand, and it was built from the ground up with Idahoans in mind.” The website allows residents to add their names to one waiting list regardless of when they are eligible to get the vaccine. They will be contacted by an enrolled COVID-19 vaccine provider when it is their turn and when the provider has appointments and doses available. Idahoans will no longer have to repeatedly check websites or call different providers looking for an appointment. They simply sign up and wait for an enrolled vaccine provider to contact them. Idahoans 65 and older who have not received the vaccine are encouraged to use the new system so they can get on the list and an enrolled provider in their area can contact them to schedule an appointment. The system is open to all who live or work in Idaho.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Thousands of fans of the Cubs and the White Sox will get to see their teams play in person this season, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Monday. In a news release, Lightfoot said each team will be limited to 20% capacity. That means the White Sox can admit as many as 8,122 fans to Guaranteed Rate Field beginning on opening day, and the Cubs will be allowed to admit as many as 8,274 fans per game. “As a diehard sports fan myself, I’m personally excited to have Chicago take its first, cautious steps toward safely reopening our beloved baseball stadiums to fans this season,” Lightfoot said in announcing that fans can attend major league games for the first time since the 2019 season. The announcement comes after the city, citing a drop in the number of COVID-19 cases, recently started allowing limited indoor seating. Just last week, restaurants and bars were told they can increase their indoor seating capacity to 50%. “We believe this is a moment when baseball can indeed serve our fans and our communities again as we all hope for a gradual return to normal,” White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said in a statement. There was no word on when fans might be able to return to the United Center, the home of the NBA’s Bulls and NHL’s Blackhawks.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indianapolis Public Schools will return to all in-person learning in its high schools and middle schools after spring break April 5, the superintendent said. The decision was made based on updated data and a recent discussion with the Marion County Health Department, Superintendent Aleesia Johnson said Friday. Schools must be able to maintain 3 feet of social distancing, require masks and ensure a strong contact-tracing protocol, Johnson said. Middle and high school students are now on a hybrid model to curb the spread of COVID-19. In January, students in prekindergarten through sixth grade – except for sixth graders on a middle school schedule – returned to a full in-person schedules at school.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Des Moines Area Regional Transit began offering free rides to COVID-19 vaccine appointments Monday. Free rides are available on all local, express and on-call routes, according to a news release. Riders are asked to bring proof of their vaccine appointment. DART Bus Plus riders can reserve free rides to and from their appointment using DART’s paratransit services. Those rides must be reserved at least 24 hours in advance by calling 515-283-8136. Federal law requires riders to wear face masks on buses and at bus stations. “We ask all riders to continue following the guidance of local and national health officials by practicing social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands frequently, staying home and avoid riding DART whenever you feel ill,” the transit authority said in a news release.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Washburn University plans to start its fall semester with in-person classes after the Shawnee County Health Department updated its vaccine plan to include university faculty and staff. “We welcome this news as we prepare to provide a more traditional environment for our students this fall,” university President Jerry Farley said. “We have been able to deliver classes in person through the spring, but this additional level of protection should allow us to return fully to our traditional campus model.” University officials said Friday that Washburn University students can expect a more normal fall 2021 semester with university faculty and staff now prioritized for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. It was not immediately clear what prompted the change in vaccination policy. Distribution has ramped up in recent weeks, and coronavirus transmission rates and hospitalizations have likewise fallen. “We continue to encourage everyone on campus to get vaccinated just as soon as it is available to them,” Farley said. “The vaccine is completely voluntary, but we are encouraging it for all faculty and staff who are physically able to take it.” The university will continue to require face masks on campus and social distancing.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Take-home cocktails – concocted as pandemic relief for bars and restaurants – would become a permanent feature in the state under a bill that won final approval from lawmakers Friday. The state House voted 67-27 to send the measure to Gov. Andy Beshear. The bill, which previously passed the Senate, would allow restaurants and bars to sell alcohol in sealed containers for delivery and to-go orders as part of meal purchases. Carryout cocktails surged in popularity after the coronavirus struck, and Beshear issued an executive order temporarily allowing to-go alcohol sales to help cushion the financial blow from his COVID-19-related restrictions. “Local restaurants and bars are desperate for a sustained source of revenue, and cocktails to go provide a critical lifeline,” Jay Hibbard, with the distilled spirits council, said in praising Kentucky lawmakers for passing the bill. Under the measure, alcohol sales would be limited to amounts “a reasonable person” would purchase with a meal. The alcohol would have to be transported in a locked glove compartment, a trunk or another place not considered to be in the “passenger area” of a vehicle. While Kentucky is the epicenter of bourbon production, liquor sales are banned in parts of rural Kentucky, where to-go sales would remain out of bounds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Public school students across the state will resume their traditional standardized tests in math, science, English and social studies in the spring, a year after those exams were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The state hasn’t settled, however, whether those LEAP 2025 test results will be used to assign letter grades to schools and districts and to determine school performance scores. The Advocate reports the testing may be the subject of new legislative debates when the regular session begins in mid-April. The Board of Elementary and Secondary Education will discuss the test plans Tuesday, though it’s not clear members will reach conclusions on how the results will be used. Senate Education Chairman Cleo Fields said the exam results should be purely advisory. “At the end of the day, no kid should be penalized this year,” said Fields, a Baton Rouge Democrat. “We have to know where we are. But it should not be used against anybody.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature will once again meet at a more accommodating public space this week in an attempt to limit spread of the coronavirus. The lawmakers are slated to convene at the Augusta Civic Center on Wednesday. The proceedings are set to begin at 9 a.m. with the House of Representatives, state officials said Monday. The Legislature is making use of the civic center because it’s an easier venue for social distancing. Legislators were sworn in there in December. Agenda items are still being finalized, but lawmakers are expected to consider a supplemental budget proposal submitted by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills in December, state officials said. The positivity rate in Maine remained low Monday, as it has for weeks. The rate’s seven-day rolling average has risen just slightly over the past two weeks from 1.73% on Feb. 21 to 1.84% on Sunday. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported more than 45,000 cases of the virus and more than 700 COVID-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic. The Maine CDC said the state is working with health care organizations to offer COVID-19 vaccination clinics starting Friday for school staff and teachers 60 and older.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Two-thirds of Marylanders are unsatisfied with how the state has handled COVID-19 vaccine distribution, according to a new poll from Goucher College. The results mirror widespread criticism of the state’s vaccination campaign as disjointed and overly complicated to navigate. The Goucher poll found 66% of adults rated Maryland’s vaccine distribution as “poor/fair,” while only 32% rated it as “excellent/good.” The same poll also found that vaccine hesitancy has fallen in recent months. In October, half of those polled said they would not take a vaccine when one became available. Now, 64% say they plan to get a vaccine as soon as possible or have already received one. Even as more residents say they are ready to accept a shot, there are not enough doses available yet to inoculate everyone who is eligible. A spokesperson for Gov. Larry Hogan said he is not surprised the poll found dissatisfaction related to vaccine distribution. “It just stands to reason most won’t be satisfied with the vaccine rollout until most can actually get the vaccine,” spokesperson Michael Ricci said in an email. “What I’m really focused on in this poll is hesitancy. It’s still too high.” Vaccine reluctance was highest among Republicans and those who live outside the state’s urban corridor, the poll found.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Hundreds of nurses walked off the job at a hospital Monday morning after failing to reach an agreement with management over staffing levels. Nurses and their supporters gathered outside St. Vincent Hospital at dawn holding signs that said “Safe Staffing Now” and “Picketing for our Patients and our Community.” The strike started after negotiations with Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare, which owns the Worcester hospital, broke down. “We are sad to see that Tenet holds so little value for our patients, yet we are resolved to do whatever it takes for as long as it take to protect our patients, as it is safer to strike now than allow Tenet to continue endangering our patients every day on every shift,” nurse Marlena Pellegrino, co-chair of the local bargaining unit of the Massachusetts Nurses Association, said in a statement. The hospital has about 800 nurses. Management said in a statement Sunday said it is disappointed in what it called an irresponsible decision to strike during the pandemic but said the hospital has enough temporary nurses to ensure patient safety. St. Vincent nurses say they are required to care for five patients at a time, a difficult task with COVID-19 precautions and care requirements, while other hospitals have a limit of four patients per nurse.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Students in the state’s largest school district returned to classrooms for in-person learning Monday for the first time in months. Detroit schools stopped face-to-face learning in November because of rising COVID-19 infection rates in the city. High schools statewide were also told to suspend in-person learning at that time. Despite the resumption of in-person classes, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said many teachers have declined to participate. Teachers who agree to work inside classrooms will get a quarterly bonus of $750. Vitti said online learning has been a challenge for many students but still will be offered. “Some are doing well, but many have been disengaged, have become chronically absent, have disconnected completely,” he said. The district has about 50,000 students. Some Detroit families also send children to charter schools or schools outside the city. One parent, Nicole Kimble, said she’s going to keep her kids in virtual learning until more teachers show up. “I do want to send them to school, but their teachers not going to be there, so it’s a no-win for me. It’s a no-win at all,” Kimble said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: More than 10% of Minnesotans have now gotten shots to guard against COVID-19, but state health officials say the spread of a more contagious version of the coronavirus makes it important to avoid spring break travel. Dr. Ruth Lynfield, the state epidemiologist, pointed to recent infections in Minnesota that highlight the risk of such travel and said the health department urges people to consider delaying nonessential trips. Lynfield said people who must travel should follow safety guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including getting tested two to three days before leaving and avoiding contact with others for two weeks beforehand. Minnesota has found 165 cases of a virus variant first identified in the United Kingdom last year that is more contagious. On Sunday, the state reported 897 more coronavirus infections and four deaths linked to COVID-19. The seven-day average for new cases is 774. With the latest numbers, the seven-day average for new cases stood at about 774. That’s well below the peak seen in November.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state health department reported 70 new cases of COVID-19 and no coronavirus-related deaths Monday. Since the virus hit the state last March, a total of 297,651 cases and 6,808 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported. On Thursday, Gov. Tate Reeves announced in a tweet that Mississippians 50 or older are eligible for vaccination. There were 55 outbreaks at Mississippi nursing homes as of Monday. There have been 10,402 cases of the coronavirus in long-term care facilities and 1,957 deaths reported as of Friday. Residents between the ages of 25 and 39 represent the largest portion of the infected population in the state, with 65,139 cases reported last Tuesday, the latest data available. Among patients under 18, children between the ages of 11 and 17 have the highest infection rate, with 22,690 cases identified. The 65-and-older age group has the highest total number of deaths with 5,166 reported. According to health department data, 486,147 people had begun the vaccination process in Mississippi as of Sunday morning. About 274,434 people have been fully immunized against COVID-19 since the shots began in December.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: More than 7,700 doses were left over after mass COVID-19 vaccination events across the state last week, fueling frustrations that rural counties haven’t been able to find enough people to use them while urban residents are desperate for a dose. Records from the Missouri Department of Public Safety show the remaining doses were usually transferred to another local provider or held by the health department for later use, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Over the course of those clinics, 152 doses were thrown away, including in Putnam County, where 143 doses spoiled. In some cases, the spoilage resulted from dislodged needles, duplicate appointments and no-shows. In Putnam County, 1,488 doses remained after a vaccination event last weekend. In Bollinger County, only about half of the available doses were used at an event Feb. 24, and the leftovers were sent elsewhere. In Lewis County, a mass vaccination event concluded with hundreds of extra doses. That left enough vaccine for a follow-up day that catered largely to people from far outside the area. State agencies say they are adjusting. Missouri will transition mass vaccination teams to hold more large-scale events in the Kansas City and St. Louis areas.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Public access to Glacier National Park’s east entrances has been prohibited since last March as a result of the pandemic, with tribal, state, local, and federal officials reaching a consensus to maintain the closure even after other areas of the park reopened in an effort to safeguard vulnerable members of the Blackfeet Nation, the Flathead Beacon reports. That same spirit of consensus will inform when, if and how the famed park’s eastern boundary reopens prior to this summer, according to park officials. And while public health experts from the National Park Service, Glacier County, the state of Montana, the Indian Health Service and the Blackfeet Tribe have developed a “workgroup” to identify health and safety benchmarks that, once reached, would allow for a safe reopening, the mood is tense among gateway hospitality businesses who depend on visitation to the park’s eastern entrances as their livelihood. “The strain is pretty intense. Financially, situations don’t get much worse than this for a business, and our business is our home as well as our livelihood,” said Sanford Stone, whose family owns Park Cabin Co., a hospitality and lodging business in Babb, situated on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Roughly 5,000 area teachers received their COVID-19 vaccine shots this weekend. The Douglas County Health Department held two large vaccination clinics Saturday at Millard North and Omaha North high schools to distribute doses of the new Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine to educators. “Teachers across the metro have worked hard over the past year to make learning meaningful throughout this pandemic, and now we are excited to receive our vaccine,” said Paul Schulte, a kindergarten teacher in the Millard school district. Tim Royers, president of the Millard Education Association, praised the mass vaccination effort. “A lot of advocacy, both public and behind the scenes, really needed to happen to kind of get to the point where we are now where we’re seeing not just some educators being vaccinated but a large number being vaccinated,” Royers said. He said he’s optimistic all educators in Douglas County could be vaccinated soon. “If next week’s vaccine allocation holds up, it’s highly likely we’ll be done next weekend,” Royers said. The Omaha-area vaccinations were part of 13,674 shots administered statewide Saturday. Officials said 12% of the state’s population has now been vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: A year into the pandemic, Gov. Steve Sisolak is still trying to strike the right balance between protecting lives and livelihoods – keeping the state’s tourism and hospitality industry afloat while also containing the coronavirus. But after multiple sets of restrictions on businesses including hotels and casinos, he plans to use Nevada’s safety protocols as a selling point to bring conventions and trade shows back to Las Vegas. “Mark my words: Nevada will be the safest place to have a convention or to come and visit,” he said in an interview with the Associated Press on Friday, exactly one year after the state reported its first coronavirus case. Federal health officials have urged states not to relax their mitigation measures, warning that the pandemic is far from over. But some governors have lifted capacity restrictions and mask mandates, betting the recent downtrend in cases, deaths and hospitalizations marks the turning point in the pandemic. But not Sisolak. “If I’m going to take a vacation with my family – the people that I love the most – I’m going to go where I feel safe,” the first-term Democrat said. “I saw a picture of a Texas basketball game the other night. It was full, and nobody was wearing a mask. I mean, that’s not going to work.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has given preliminary approval to a bill aimed at improving children’s mental health at a time when the number of children waiting for inpatient psychiatric care has grown dramatically during the pandemic. A bipartisan law signed in 2019 allocated about $20 million toward creating a comprehensive system of care for children’s mental health, but the pandemic has slowed progress in implementing many of its features. The Senate voted 24-0 Thursday to advance a bill that would give the state more time. Sen. Becky Whitley said the bill is needed to support children and families desperate to receive the right care, at the right time, in the right place. “The children’s mental health crisis has been building for years and has only been exacerbated by the pandemic,” the Hopkinton Democrat said. Last spring, the state reached a milestone when no patients were waiting in emergency rooms for inpatient psychiatric beds. But that number has risen, and last month a high of 48 children were waiting on one day. “When I received a call from the governor when we got to zero, thanking me for our efforts, I never thought we’d get to where we are today,” said Senate President Chuck Morse, R-Salem.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPassaic: Domestic workers, warehouse employees and housekeepers were among immigrant women and their allies who gathered Sunday to demand that the state and federal government stop excluding them from financial assistance amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused many of them to lose their jobs. The women, many without legal status, have not received federal stimulus checks and are not eligible for unemployment benefits because of their immigration status. Marchers called for Gov. Phil Murphy and New Jersey lawmakers to create a fund to provide $600 weekly unemployment benefits to workers who have lost their jobs and to provide “stimulus-like” payments. “We are here on the anniversary of the pandemic, a year of suffering, a year of risk, a year of profound pain. It’s been the most difficult year for many of our families,” said Erika Martinez, of Make the Road New Jersey, who was translating for Margarita Rodriguez of Passaic. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, the federal and state government has failed us.” The “Excluded Women’s March” marked the first anniversary of the start of pandemic quarantines and shutdowns across the country, which led many of the women to lose their jobs or see their hours reduced, and was held to recognize Women’s History Month.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state on Monday expanded eligibility for COVID-19 vaccinations to all schoolteachers, early childhood educators and other staff with the goal of getting the group its first shots by the end of March. The state is making the move as part of a directive by the Biden administration to get more schools reopened amid the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state Health Secretary Dr. Tracie Collins said last week that the ability of New Mexico to meet the timeline will depend on the federal government increasing vaccine supplies. Collins said the state had been in discussions with the White House about how the directive would affect vaccinations for other groups. Under the latest plan, the state will start with educators outside the Albuquerque area this week. Those in the metro area can get shots next week, likely at a mass vaccination site, and the final week will target all of those statewide who have yet to be vaccinated. More than 15,000 educators already have received shots, as some were eligible as part of New Mexico’s phased-in approach to distributing vaccinations. The focus until now has been on the most vulnerable populations, including those 75 and over and younger people with chronic health conditions that put them at greater risk.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s public high schools will reopen for in-person learning March 22 after being closed since coronavirus cases began rising in November, officials announced Monday. The school system’s 488 high schools will open for the 55,000 students in grades nine through 12 who have opted for in-person learning, said Danielle Filson, a city Department of Education spokesperson. The rest of the 282,000 students in those grades will continue to learn remotely. “We are ready to go; we have all the pieces we need to bring high school back and bring it back strong and, of course to bring it back safely,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a virtual briefing. The Democrat said bringing students back to school is a crucial piece of the city’s recovery from the pandemic, which he said has left many young people feeling isolated and depressed. “There are so many reasons that we need to bring our kids back,” de Blasio said. About half the high schools will provide in-school instruction to all or most of their students five days a week, while the others will offer hybrid instruction, officials said. High school sports will also resume, starting with strength and conditioning sessions in early April, the officials said. Competitive play will start in May and continue through the summer.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Meg Chamberlain of Fermenti Foods thinks there’s room in everyday kitchens for the practical magic of lactic acid fermentation, which yields foods like sauerkraut, kimchi and pickles. She recently teamed up with Selina Naturally Celtic Sea Salt to help fight food insecurity in Madison County. Selina Naturally donated 1,200 pounds of sea salt to the Beacon of Hope Food Bank in Marshall, giving all clients a pound of salt in their free produce boxes. Chamberlain added recipes for sauerkraut, which handily teaches the concept of self-brining fermentation. Rather than seeing fermented foods as the purview of the health-seeking hipster, she thinks it’s a useful tool for home preservation and an important tool for anyone who helped fuel the resurgence of “Victory Gardens” during the COVID-19 pandemic. “In addition to the fact that more people are growing, they need to know what to do with what they’re growing in their gardens,” Chamberlain said. The past year has been stressful, which makes trying to eat nutritious food even more important for holistic health. “When you are living paycheck to paycheck, the extremely healthy and nutritious items are often luxuries that families simply cannot afford,” Beacon of Hope director Jessi Koontz said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum on Monday appointed his fourth state health officer since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Nizar Wehbi, the deputy director of the Center for Health Policy and an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, is scheduled to take over as leader of the North Dakota Department of Health on May 1. “Dr. Wehbi brings the right combination of experience in clinical medicine, policy development and health administration that we need to create the best public health system in the country right here in North Dakota,” Burgum said in a statement. The state health officer oversees the Department of Health and implements state laws governing the department. The officer also is a statutory member of several boards and commissions. The department oversees health-related programs dealing with issues ranging from disease prevention to hospital and clinic licensing to environmental regulation. The position has been a revolving door since Mylynn Tufte resigned a couple of months after COVID-19 was detected in the state. She was replaced by Dr. Andrew Stahl, who stepped down in late August. Dr. Paul Mariani quit after 12 days and was replaced by Dirk Wilke, who’ll return to his position as the Department of Health’s chief of staff.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Residents 50 and older and those with Type 2 diabetes or end-stage renal disease will be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine starting Thursday, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Monday. With the addition of those ages 50 to 59, nearly 4.4 million people, or 38% of the state’s population, are now eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. The vast majority of Ohio’s COVID-19 deaths, about 98.1%, were of people 50 or older, according to Ohio Department of Health data. “Age is by far the biggest indicator,” DeWine said. “It is just the best indicator, and it’s so important that we don’t get sidetracked.” Meanwhile, the state has reported its first case of P.1, a new, more infectious coronavirus variant initially found in Brazil. Ohio has reported 31 cases of the most prevalent variant, B.1.1.7, and one case of P.1, said the state’s chief medical officer, Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff. “COVID-19 isn’t giving up,” he said. Vanderhoff said the variants underscore the importance of getting vaccinated because the shots work against variants. He also encouraged people to wash hands and wear masks.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials reported 461 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday but no additional deaths linked to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The Oklahoma State Department of Health said the state has had a total of 428,997 cases of the disease and 4,534 deaths from it. The number of active coronavirus cases confirmed by a test in the state fell by 92 on Sunday to 12,286. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and some who get infected don’t show symptoms. More than 11% of Oklahoma’s population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. More than 1.2 million Oklahomans have received at least one dose. Over the past week, nearly 1 in 8 coronavirus tests has come back positive in Oklahoma, according Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nOregon\n\nScappoose: Gov. Kate Brown on Saturday received the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, the first one-dose vaccine offered in the United States. Brown said there have been a number of rumors and misinformation about the Johnson & Johnson shot since its approval by the FDA. She said her office fields questions every week asking, “If these vaccines are so safe, then why hasn’t Kate Brown gotten one?” “It was important to me to demonstrate today that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is safe and effective,” she said. “I want to reassure Oregonians that they should feel confident taking any of the three vaccines available to protect themselves and their loved ones.” As of Saturday, the Oregon Health Authority has reported 2,296 COVID-19-related deaths in Oregon. There have been 157,079 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases statewide. The state had administered a total of 1,115,802 first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines. “I want to encourage all Oregonians to continue practicing good health and safety measures while we work to get as many people vaccinated as possible,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Four of the state’s seven most heavily populated counties are airing their unhappiness over the size of their allotment of vaccines, saying Monday that a meeting with Gov. Tom Wolf’s top health official did not resolve their concerns. Leaders of Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties – home to more than 2.5 million people – called a Sunday meeting with acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam “disappointing and frustrating.” They said less populated counties have received disproportionately bigger allotments of the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, and their smaller-than-expected allotments have led to long waiting lists, cancellation of second-dose appointments, and frustration and anger among residents. They also said the state has been unable to clearly explain how it determined each county’s vaccine allotments. Wolf’s administration has not acknowledged a shortfall. But the counties said Beam told them no county will be allowed to vaccinate people in Phase 1B before each county gets enough doses to fully vaccinate residents in Phase 1A who want the shot. Still, the counties said they want the state to create a publicly available chart showing the breakdown of vaccines delivered to each county.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Walgreens has clarified that teachers, school staff and child care workers are now eligible to sign up for a COVID-19 vaccine at some of its retail pharmacies in the state. Walgreens added and then removed teachers from the eligibility list before adding them again Monday. “We apologize for the confusion this caused our customers, and will continue to work hand in hand with the state of Rhode Island to vaccinate our most vulnerable patients as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement. The announcement did come with some words of caution. The vaccine is still in high demand, and Walgreens said customers “may experience temporary issues with our vaccine scheduler, which may include delays and confusion in updating eligibility in their area.” Some CVS locations in the state are also offering vaccines to teachers. More than 232,000 people in Rhode Island have received their first dose of a vaccine, while more than 91,000 people have been fully vaccinated, according to state Department of Health numbers released Monday. Gov. Daniel McKee last week announced the state was working on a plan to prioritize teachers for inoculation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate has agreed to send an extra $9 million to public charter schools because of additional expenses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Senate on Thursday unanimously approved the proposal, which had already passed the House in January. But senators made a slight change in the bill saying the money could not be used for raises for administrators, so the House must give its approval again. The Public Charter School District told lawmakers it needs the extra money because its enrollment and other expenses increased significantly during the pandemic. There are about three dozen charter schools across South Carolina that are under the statewide Public Charter School District and the Charter Institute at Erskine College. They have about 40,000 students combined.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than $23.5 million in COVID-19 relief funds was split up among 25 applicants for the first two rounds of the state’s small-business grant program, leaving some proprietors to question the process. The grant program is a primary payout of Republican Gov. Kristi Noem’s plan to spend $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus money to help offset losses due to the pandemic. Businesses that applied for the grants had to show there was at least a 25% reduction in business, said Colin Keeler, director of financial systems for the South Dakota Bureau of Finance and Management. Those companies in the top 25 through the first and second rounds of distribution consisted mostly of hospitality, agriculture and commercial real estate and construction businesses. Fifteen businesses received $1 million in funding, after Noem raised the maximum benefit from $100,000 to $500,000 per round. Some businesses received more because they have several locations, such as Lester Hospitality, which received over $2 million between its three businesses. Some small businesses argue they were shortchanged. Grant awards ranged from $1 million to $538, according to recent data. The average amount paid out for businesses not in the top 25 was $76,449; the median was $29,818.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: More than 1 million residents became eligible for vaccines Monday after the state Department of Health announced it was expecting a large supply of the shots to protect against COVID-19. The new eligibility applies to people 16 and older who have high-risk health conditions including cancer, hypertension, obesity and pregnancy. Caregivers and household residents of medically fragile children will also be able to receive the vaccine. Tennesseans should check with their counties to learn more about eligibility and registration. Some counties can move at different paces for eligibility. Shelby County, which includes Memphis, and Nashville announced they would be entering the phase starting Monday. Both have caught up with the state in age-based eligibility by starting to inoculate people 65 and older.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: About two dozen protesters gathered in front of the Capitol on Monday to call on Gov. Greg Abbott to keep state-mandated mask orders in place until more essential workers are vaccinated. Abbott’s executive order, which will go into effect Wednesday, lifts the state’s requirement for facial coverings in public places. Organizers said the rally, organized by Amplified Sound Coalition and the Austin chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, was calling on state officials to get at least 70% of essential workers vaccinated before lifting rules on masks and business capacity. Jeannette Gregor, co-founder of the Amplified Sound Coalition, said the vaccination rate is not high enough to lift state-mandated coronavirus restrictions. “It needs to be accessible to everyone in every class bracket,” said Gregor, who works as a bartender and said workers in the service industry already face pushback from customers who don’t want to follow pandemic safety guidelines. Without state-mandated mask orders, she said workers who are employed at businesses that will no longer require face coverings might have to choose between their health and their jobs. Multiple medical advisers to Abbott have said that they were not consulted before the order was announced last week and that the governor is moving too quickly on dismantling statewide restrictions to slow the coronavirus’ spread. Dr. Mark McClellan, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under President George W. Bush, stressed that many of those at highest risk of severe illness – including seniors, half of whom haven’t yet received a first vaccine shot – are still in danger of infection. McClellan was one of four medical advisers on the Governor’s Strike Force to Open Texas, formed last April. The advisory group ended its work in October, according to Chairman James Huffines. Only one medical adviser, Dr. John Zerwas, executive vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Texas System, said Abbott spoke with him about his decision to lift pandemic restrictions.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: As the state opened up vaccine eligibility to everyone 50 and older Monday, health officials in the southwestern corner of the state counted a steep decline in new coronavirus cases in the first week of March. There were 307 new confirmed cases across the southwest health district in the week that ended Friday, down 36% from the previous seven-day period and representing the lowest number for a single week since the summer. Statewide, Utah reported another 570 cases Saturday, which brought the rolling seven-day average of new cases to 527 per day. The seven-day average for the rate at which tests came back positive was at 9.5%. The state also reported five new deaths, and the statewide total since the pandemic began rose to 1,975. Another 194 people were actively hospitalized with the disease. Health officials said they hope the state will continue to see numbers improve as more people get vaccinated, and through Saturday a total of 843,032 vaccine doses had been administered across Utah, with more than 26,000 people vaccinated in one day Friday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A program created by the Legislature last fall to provide pandemic stimulus checks to residents who were denied payments because of their immigration status has been extended for another two months. The fund’s new deadline is May 1. Those applicants may have been denied stimulus checks because they did not have proper documentation previously needed to get the initial $1,200 payments last spring. “Mixed status” families or households in which at least one member was a U.S. citizen or permanent resident while others were undocumented without legal immigration status were denied stimulus checks before last December. Congress passed a bill late last year that retroactively allowed those families to receive payments. The Vermont program has provided funding to 500 applicants so far, and 1,000 or so more are waiting to be verified, said Indra Acharya, project manager for the Vermont Economic Stimulus Equity Fund, which is being run through the nonprofit Vermont Community Foundation.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state has seen an uptick in the number of families who have delayed sending a child to kindergarten for one year. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the coronavirus pandemic has contributed to the increase. Delaying kindergarten enrollment is an annual occurrence in the state. And it’s normally sought out by families who are white, affluent and have sons. “It is this idea of giving kids the gift of time, the idea of giving them another year to develop, grow and play and potentially be in a less structured environment will allow them to get more out of it down the road,” said Daphna Bassok, an associate professor of education and public policy at the University of Virginia. Bassok’s research has found that statewide kindergarten enrollment is down 13%. Teachers could face larger gaps in the skills of young learners this fall. “I think teachers are going to see groups of children who had such different early childhood experiences this year and such different exposure to early literacy and early numeracy,” she said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: About 55,000 Washingtonians may have to pay back thousands of dollars in jobless benefits. The Seattle Times reports Cami Feek, the state Employment Security Department’s new acting commissioner, updated lawmakers Thursday on Washington’s response to pandemic-related job losses. Feek told a Senate work session that the department will be working with the 55,000 claimants who’ve received repayment notifications after failing to respond to agency requests for information and being ruled ineligible for benefits already received. “We’re going to proactively reach out to them and help them have the right information on how to fix (their eligibility),” Feek told the Senate Labor, Commerce & Tribal Affairs Committee during the work session. In some cases, claimants may not be required to repay benefits. Sen. Karen Keiser, D-Des Moines, said the overpayment notices often hit workers who are still unemployed – “and they’re suddenly being told they have to pay back $12,000, and they’re just in panic mode.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Monday heralded an 88% drop in COVID-19 deaths since the beginning of the year but still urged residents to take precautions. “Don’t drop your guard, West Virginia. We still got a ways to go,” he said at a coronavirus briefing. The state on Monday reported the lowest number of weekly deaths from the coronavirus in more than four months. State health officials said there were 25 virus-related deaths last week, the fewest since the week ending Oct. 25. No such deaths were reported on two different days last week. The number of weekly confirmed virus cases, 1,260, was the lowest since early October. As of Sunday, there were 178 people hospitalized for the virus, down from the peak of 818 on Jan. 5. The number of active statewide cases, 5,613, was the lowest since Nov. 2. Justice ordered the lifting of capacity limits on bars, restaurants, gyms, museums and most businesses over the weekend. The limit on social gatherings also went up, from 75 to 100 people. The Republican governor has implored people to continue wearing masks and social distancing. A statewide face-covering mandate remains in effect.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Some museums have opened their doors again as coronavirus cases wane and vaccinations roll out. The Milwaukee Art Museum, Milwaukee Public Museum and Harley Davidson Museum all opened this past weekend for the first time this year. Discovery World plans to open later this month. The museums reopened after careful planning and coordination with the city health department. Milwaukee Public Museum President Ellen Censky said the goal is that once the doors are open, they stay open. That means adopting similar safety protocols. Each museum requires guests to wear masks and has created a one-way path to regulate the flow of foot traffic and keep people physically distanced. Tickets must be purchased in advance online, and while the museums can go up to 25% capacity, they are staying below that limit while they learn how their protocols hold up. The art museum was open for a few months last summer and fall. Public relations manager Josh Depenbrok said he feels more confident that this time it’s for good. He cited the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, dropping case numbers and warmer weather that allows people to get outside.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state will join a handful of counterparts that have lifted mask-wearing mandates for adults to limit the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Mark Gordon announced Monday. The changes to the state public health orders take effect March 16. Also being lifted are requirements for bars, restaurants, theaters and gyms, where employees must wear masks while customers not seated in small groups keep at least 6 feet apart. Gordon cited Wyoming’s declining number of COVID-19 cases and success in distributing vaccines in lifting the restrictions. Newly confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Wyoming have fallen to levels unseen since the fall. They’re down to about 60 per day after peaking at more than 10 times that rate around Thanksgiving, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. Almost 20% of residents have received at least one dose of vaccine. Almost all of Wyoming’s 23 counties have entered a phase allowing restaurant, bar, gym and theater workers to get vaccine shots, according to the governor’s office. “I ask all Wyoming citizens to continue to take personal responsibility for their actions and stay diligent as we look ahead to the warmer months and to the safe resumption of our traditional spring and summer activities,” Gordon said in a statement.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/09"}]}

Effective Wednesday, the center will cease all operations indefinitely, its board of directors alerted in a late-night letter to parents Tuesday.\n\nThis comes as the Office of Child Care Licensing — which oversees day care and child care facilities in Delaware — substantiated some 14 claims against the center in its investigations.\n\n\"Holly Oak Child Care Center has served our community for 24 years,\" the board wrote this week. \"It is with heavy hearts that we share the news of our license suspension. We endeavor to make the right decisions at the right time for everyone involved — we hope in the interim you will do what's right for you and your family.\"\n\nA Delaware Online/The News Journal investigation, fueled by interviews with parents, board members and former teachers, alongside a review of texts, emails and recordings obtained by this news organization and the state, published July 1.\n\nIt found that the state quietly substantiated a slate of complaints before June's end by publishing them to its online database after weeks of questioning from Delaware Online/The News Journal reporters. By July 2, additional claims were added to the state's database, alongside a slew of noncompliance citations. It is unclear whether more could be on the way.\n\nOverall, this investigation has uncovered:\n\nHolly Oak educators failed to report concerns of rough treatment by one teacher, from yelling and cursing to yanking on arms and shoving, because it would mean losing staff and closing rooms.\n\nWhile the state's Institutional Abuse Unit indicated it \"did not have enough evidence supporting the allegations of abuse,\" the Office of Child Care Licensing began investigating. It has since substantiated that Holly Oak staff members failed to report suspected child abuse or neglect and that \"improper discipline\" was used on children, among other confirmed reports.\n\nHolly Oak also failed to notify the Office of Child Care Licensing of injuries that required medical or dental attention. Investigators confirmed an administrator knew at least two children sustained injuries that required stitches, according to the licensing database, while in attendance.\n\nInvestigators also confirmed all Holly Oak classrooms failed to maintain correct teacher-to-child ratios 98 times in one month, according to March 2024 records. More records appear to have been requested, according to the online database.\n\nHolly Oak has been hit with various other noncompliance citations over the years by licensing, but none had yet involved abuse, despite emails among staff that acknowledged previous issues.\n\nOther complaints included failure to notify the state of a change in the administrator, lack of supervision, not following state meal requirements, not following diapering procedures, poor sanitation of the facility and more.\n\nThe principal employee accused of roughly handling children had been on administrative leave since May 17. Bethany Hunt, the then-interim director, remained on leave since about May 21 for not reporting concerns, though the center told parents she continued work in the office. Nearly every then-board member resigned as initial reports reached the state.\n\nNow, that center will close entirely.\n\nSo what exactly happened at Holly Oak?\n\nREAD OUR INVESTIGATION:This Delaware child care center failed to report abuse concerns. What happened next?\n\nNext steps for Delaware parents\n\nAs the state probe into alleged child abuse at Holly Oak began, many parents were already left scrambling to find alternative care. Now, the same will be true of all families connected to the center off Philadelphia Pike.\n\nEducation department officials advise families researching child care centers to use the state Office of Child Care Licensing’s online database to review the facility’s licensing monitoring visits, which include inspection reports and substantiated complaints.\n\nReports from the last three years are available for all licensed facilities in Delaware, which can help aid in the search for a reputable center. The department said “unannounced full compliance monitoring” visits are conducted annually at all facilities, along with investigating any noncompliance complaints received.\n\nMy Child DE has resources for families on child care, along with connections to AccessCare, which provides free child care referrals and links parents to child care specialists. Families can also connect with a child care search resource specialist at 800-734-2388 who can provide a list of providers based on child care needs.\n\nOnce families have identified their top choices, visiting the locations and asking questions about cost, staffing and general operations will help parents narrow down their pick.\n\nAfter all, infants and toddlers often can’t articulate what is going on around them.\n\nSEARCH FOR LICENSED CHILD CARE FACILITIES IN DELAWARE\n\nWhat else should parents know?Child safety in Delaware day cares is again under the spotlight\n\nGot a tip?

In writing about them, we focused on the light of their lives instead of the darkness of their diagnoses, and sought to chronicle who they were, what they did and how they’ll be remembered.\n\nIowa Mourns was made possible by an unprecedented partnership of nine daily newspapers across Iowa’s two premier newspaper organizations — the Register, Ames Tribune, Burlington Hawk Eye and Iowa City Press-Citizen of the USA TODAY Network; and the Council Bluffs Daily Nonpareil, Mason City Globe Gazette, Quad-City Times, Sioux City Journal and Waterloo Courier of Lee Enterprises.

The measure was put in place Tuesday at Fort Rucker, home of the Army’s aviation program. If a soldier is not wearing a mask, base leadership can ask to see a vaccination card. In a video posted to Facebook, base officials said the measure is needed because of rising case numbers on the base and in surrounding counties. Alabama, which has the lowest vaccination rates in the country, is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases. State Health Officer Scott Harris said that is likely driven both by the low vaccination rates and by the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Alabama has risen over the past two weeks from 205.43 new cases per day June 28 to 559.57 new cases per day July 12. Only about 33% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, compared to about 48% nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It’s not the vaccinated people that are getting infected for the most part, and if they do, for the most part they aren’t the ones getting sick in the hospital,” Harris said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Biden administration said Thursday that it is ending large-scale, old-growth timber sales in the country’s largest national forest – the Tongass National Forest – and will focus on forest restoration, recreation and other noncommercial uses. The U.S. Agriculture Department, which includes the Forest Service, also said it will take steps to reverse a Trump administration decision last year to lift restrictions on logging and road-building in the southeast Alaska rainforest, which provides habitat for wolves, bears and salmon. A 2001 rule prohibits road construction and timber harvests with limited exceptions on nearly one-third of national forest land. The Trump administration moved to exempt the Tongass from those prohibitions, something Alaska political leaders had sought for years. Restoring those protections in the Tongass would return “stability and certainty to the conservation of 9.3 million acres of the world’s largest temperate old growth rainforest,” the Agriculture Department said. Under the plans announced Thursday, large-scale, old-growth projects that were being planned for the forest will not go forward, Moore said. Smaller timber sales, including some old-growth trees, will still be offered for local and cultural uses such as totem poles, canoes and tribal artisan use, the federal agency said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s largest county approved nearly $3 million Wednesday for new vote-counting machines to replace those used in the 2020 election, which were given to legislative Republicans for a partisan review of the results. The GOP-controlled Maricopa County Board of Supervisors said the machines were compromised because they were in the control of firms not accredited to handle election equipment. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had said she would seek to decertify the machines if the county planned to use them again. State Senate Republicans used their subpoena power to take control of Maricopa County’s voting machines after former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence that the 2020 election was rigged against him in Arizona and other battleground states. The Senate hired Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity consulting firm led by a Trump supporter who has spread conspiracy theories backing Trump’s false claims of fraud, to recount all 2.1 million ballots and forensically review voting machines, servers and other data. The firm had no prior experience in elections, and experts in election administration say it’s not following reliable procedures.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas on Thursday said it has asked a former Razorback challenging U.S. Sen. John Boozman to change his ads over their unauthorized use of the school’s trademarks. The school made the request after Jake Bequette launched his bid for the Republican Senate nomination with an online video touting his background playing for the Razorbacks and for the New England Patriots in the NFL. Boozman, a Republican, has held the seat since 2011. The video features footage and images of Bequette playing in his Razorbacks uniform, while a logo says: “Jake Bequette. Patriot. Veteran. Razorback.” “We have asked the campaign to modify its ads related to unauthorized use of the Razorback trademark for political purposes,” UA spokesman Mark Rushing said in an email. Bequette’s campaign did not say whether it planned to change or withdraw the ad. “Jake Bequette is proud of his time at the University of Arkansas where he was an academic All-American and All-SEC defensive end. He will continue to proudly call himself a Razorback,” the campaign said. UA made a similar request when Boozman, also a former Razorback, ran for the Senate in 2010. Boozman pulled a TV ad highlighting his time playing for the Razorbacks after the school asked that it be withdrawn.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County leaders are moving forward with a plan to return prime beachfront property to descendants of a Black couple who built a resort for African Americans but were stripped of the land by city officials a century ago. The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to pursue an action plan created by the county chief executive’s office on returning the land to the descendants of Willa and Charles Bruce once the state allows it. The county would be a sponsor of state legislation that is needed to enable the transfer. “We are on an important road to set a precedent that could be replicated across the country as we work to put actions behind our commitment to an anti-racist agenda and anti-racist county,” Supervisor Holly Mitchell said. The property that became known as Bruce’s Beach is along the shoreline in Manhattan Beach, now an upscale city. The land was purchased in 1912 by Willa and Charles Bruce, who built the first West Coast resort for Black people at a time when many beaches were segregated. They suffered racist harassment from white neighbors, and in the 1920s the Manhattan Beach City Council took the land away through eminent domain under the ruse of needing it for a park. The city did nothing with the property, however, and it eventually was transferred to the state in 1948.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A pre-pandemic shortage of licensed commercial drivers in the waste management industry has become worse, and now cities and companies are dealing with a shortage of workers to hoist trash and recyclables into trucks. Workers in the solid-waste industry were considered essential workers as COVID-19 started to spread, but now there aren’t enough of them, and many are likely looking for different lines of work or better pay, The Denver Post reports. Denver is working to hire more sanitation workers after cutting its budget and letting vacancies go unfilled when the pandemic hit, said Nancy Kuhn, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. The city provides trash and recycling collection services to 181,000 households and compost collection service to subscribers. Kuhn said Denver cut back on extra trash collection, which includes large items, from every four weeks to every eight weeks. In June, the city received 1,738 calls about missed trash pickup and 760 about missed recycling pickups. Denver makes about 724,000 trash collections a month. The solid waste industry is among those using signing bonuses to lure back workers as businesses emerge from cutbacks made because of the pandemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State regulators have approved a plan to spur the building of infrastructure across Connecticut for charging electric vehicles. The state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority said the nine-year program approved Wednesday creates incentives for the building of fast charging stations, home charging stations and workplace charging stations, both for individuals with electric cars and for companies that have fleets of electric vehicles. The decision directs the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource Energy and United Illuminating, to provide incentives to customers who install the necessary equipment. Those include rebates of up to $500 to homeowners who make electrical upgrades to allow charging at home and up to $40,000 for owners of apartment buildings, condominium complexes and businesses that install charging areas. The program also would provide up to $250,000 for the creation of direct current fast-charging stations in the state. Those who install the equipment in low-income and distressed communities would get the largest incentives, PURA said. “We’re eager to bring a statewide charging program to our customers and are currently reviewing the details of PURA’s announcement to ensure it maximizes all potential benefits for our customers,” said Mitch Gross, an Eversource spokesperson.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Residents of Donovan Smith Mobile Home Park say the untreated wastewater surfacing above an older septic system in the center of the park affects the environment, their safety and their quality of life. “This place started out as travel-trailers and weekenders. They didn’t need a big septic unit,” said resident Samuel Saunders. “Now people live here full time, and these tanks won’t hold that. It bubbles up, and it’s bad.” The park owner, Donovan-Smith MHP LLC, was issued a notice of violation from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control on July 8 for unauthorized discharge to groundwater. According to the notice, the park never renewed its septic system permit after it expired in 2008 and has been operating without one since. The department continued to inspect the system annually despite being without a permit, the notice says. DNREC declined to provide inspection records, citing an “ongoing investigation.” Park manager Clara McNichols, when reached by phone, declined to comment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metro Board of Directors Safety and Operations Committee approved a proposal Thursday to temporarily ban certain riders cited for sexual or firearms charges while riding the transit system, WUSA-TV reports. The full Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board is expected to vote on the proposal at an upcoming meeting, but a date on that vote has not been set. Metro says it has seen an increase in sex offenses over the past 18 months. The hope is that a change to the passenger conduct policy would help cut down on those incidents. The first offense would carry a 14-day ban and the second a 30-day ban, but the third offense would bring a 365-day rolling suspension that starts the day the citation is issued. Transit agencies in other major cities have similar policies in place.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that it planned to build a new regional campus in central Florida to house at least 2,000 professional employees who will be relocating from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development. In a letter to employees, Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said the move would allow creative and business teams to be better integrated. The company already has a theme park resort outside Orlando, Walt Disney World, that is the size of the city of San Francisco. The new Disney campus will be located about 20 miles to the east of Disney World, in a neighborhood by Orlando International Airport. “Florida is known for its rich culture of hospitality and active lifestyle as well as a lower cost of living with no state income tax,” D’Amaro said in the employee letter. While the company is still figuring out which employees will be asked to relocate, they likely will be in the parks division. Workers asked to relocate will have 18 months to make the move, D’Amaro said. “As someone who has moved with my family from California to Florida and back again, I understand that relocation is a big change, not only for the employee, but also for their families,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Former President Donald Trump is declaring his opposition to a high-ranking Republican’s bid for lieutenant governor, another sign of how state-level politics is being reordered by Trump’s insistence that all Republicans repudiate his 2020 election loss. Trump invited other Republicans to run against Senate President Pro Tem Butch Miller in a statement released late Wednesday. “I will not be supporting or endorsing Sen. Butch Miller, running for lieutenant governor of Georgia, because of his refusal to work with other Republican senators on voter fraud and irregularities in the state,” Trump said. “Hopefully there will be strong and effective primary challengers for the very important lieutenant governor position!” Trump weighed in as state Sen. Burt Jones of Jackson considers seeking the GOP nomination to succeed Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, whose support among Republicans collapsed after his outspoken defense of the Georgia election results that gave Joe Biden a narrow victory. Miller has not gone as far as Jones in promoting the false claim that Trump was cheated out of 16 electoral votes, but he counts Georgia’s restrictive new elections law among his top accomplishments and has said voters will support him as a conservative who gets things done.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. authorities launched an investigation and fined Louisiana tourists honeymooning in Hawaii after a video on social media showed a woman touching an endangered Hawaiian monk seal. The couple were “deeply sorry,” a man identified as Stephen told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “We love Hawaii and the culture. We didn’t mean to offend anyone.” A video posted on TikTok and other social media showed a woman touching the seal at a Kauai beach in June. The video showed her running away after the resting seal raised its head and snapped at her. There are an estimated 1,100 Hawaiian monk seals in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and 300 in the main Hawaiian Islands. It’s a felony to touch or harass a Hawaiian monk seal under state and federal laws, with penalties of up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The newspaper reports authorities from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contacted the couple over the weekend and assessed an undisclosed fine. Dominic Andrews, a spokesman for NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement, said an investigation is underway and declined to comment further.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Prisons in the state are so understaffed that correctional officers often end up working mandatory 16-hour shifts, leaving them just eight hours to sleep, eat and see their families before returning to duty, a prison official said. Idaho Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt told Board of Correction members about the staff shortages during a meeting Wednesday, saying roughly one-quarter of correctional officer positions are vacant. “We’ve seen a very alarming new trend in our staffing that is cause for concern for us,” Tewalt said, noting that there are about 180 vacant positions statewide. Most of the vacancies are in the five-prison complex south of Boise, where 156 correctional officer positions are vacant. That’s the lowest staffing rate the state has seen in the past six years, according to department data. The staff shortage means there are frequently not enough employees to allow prisoners to move normally throughout their daily schedule, forcing facilities to go on “restricted” status during which offenders may be denied time in recreational yards or day room areas. The shortage also means visiting hours can’t be held in some prisons. Prison understaffing can lead to dangerous conditions for workers and inmates and limit inmate access to programs designed to help them succeed upon release.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Frustrated with a lack of power to investigate unethical conduct by state lawmakers and an ethics reform bill on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s desk that she considered counterproductive, the Illinois legislative inspector general said Wednesday that she will resign in December. Carol Pope, 67, a former Menard County state’s attorney and former circuit and appellate judge based in Petersburg, emailed members of the Legislative Ethics Commission to say she plans to leave Dec. 15. Pope’s term normally would be up in June 2023. Before Pope, the General Assembly went four years without a permanent inspector general. “The last legislative session demonstrated true ethics reform is not a priority,” Pope said, despite ethics reform legislation that overwhelmingly passed this year and was praised by Democrats and Republicans as a good first step. Pope, in her letter, said the legislative inspector general “has no real power to effect change or shine a light on ethics violations.” She said the position “is essentially a paper tiger.” Pope, a Republican and Melrose Park native who became legislative inspector general in March 2019, said the position needs more independence to be effective.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Less than one-third of elementary and middle school students recorded passing scores on the latest round of state standardized tests, results released Wednesday show, confirming education officials’ concerns that the coronavirus pandemic has fueled substantial learning losses. The Indiana Department of Education released results from the spring ILEARN exam that show 40.5% of students at or above proficiency standards in English/language arts and 36.9% at or above proficiency standards in mathematics. Only 28.6% of students statewide in grades three through eight tested as proficient in both English and math, a drop from 37.1% the last time the test was administered in 2019. State data showed “significant” gaps persist among racial, ethnic and socioeconomic student groups. For example, just 8% of Black students passed both the English and math sections, compared with 46.5% of Asian students, 34.7% of white students and 15.6% of Hispanic students. Indianapolis Public Schools, which has one of the highest proportions of disadvantaged students in the state, saw only 10% of its students pass both English and math. Neighboring Warren Township schools reported less than 8% of students tested proficient. In northern Indiana’s South Bend Community Schools, 7.5% of students had passing rates on both sections of the exam.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly 20% more Iowans died of drug overdoses in 2020 than in the previous year, as the powerful narcotic fentanyl became more prevalent, and the COVID-19 pandemic compounded people’s anxiety and isolated them from addiction treatment services. A new report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates Iowa suffered 419 drug overdose deaths last year, compared to 350 in 2019. Most neighboring states saw steeper increases in overdose deaths than Iowa did, although South Dakota was one of just two states in the country that recorded a decrease. “I think it really reflects how difficult the pandemic has been on people,” said Alison Lynch, a psychiatrist and family practice physician who runs the University of Iowa’s Addiction and Recovery Collaborative. “It’s shocking.” Lynch said in an interview that the pandemic sparked or worsened struggles with drug and alcohol abuse. Social isolation, economic stress and fears of catching COVID-19 often prompted people to drink alcohol or use drugs. And many people who had been in recovery from addictions lost the crucial support of in-person group sessions, such as Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A racial justice panel appointed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has recommended expanding Medicaid, adding another income tax bracket for top-income earners, restoring a food sales tax rebate, and banning Native American mascots and team names in public schools. The 15-member Commission on Racial Justice and Equity created the recommendations after meeting with Kansas Department of Commerce officials, Kansas Department of Health and Environment staff and others, according to the report. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly established the commission last year in response to the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The report comes months after the panel crafted recommendations primarily focused on policing. Some advocates in Kansas have pushed for Medicaid expansion for a decade. Kelly promised this year to continue to push to expand Medicaid in Kansas, despite top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature opposing it. The panel wants to expand Medicaid eligibility to 138% of the federal poverty level and cited an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimating that about 82,000 uninsured non-elderly adults in the state would become eligible for coverage if Kansas expanded its Medicaid program.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Concerns about cybersecurity have led the state to extend its search for a company to modernize its pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system, Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration said Wednesday. The need for additional safeguards against hackers means the state will go through a rebidding process, said Jill Midkiff, a spokeswoman for the state Finance and Administration Cabinet. In doing so, the state will request enhanced security measures to protect the personal and financial information of jobless claimants, she said. The state is seeking a contract partner to overhaul its outdated technology for processing jobless claims. That search began about 16 months ago, and lawmakers were told last month that the state was in the “latter stages” of selecting a company to revamp the claims-processing system. But the need to provide enhanced cybersecurity forced the state to cancel the prior solicitation and rebid the contract, Midkiff said Wednesday. “The procurement was out for bid when Kentucky and most other states were targeted by one of the most sophisticated cyberattacks on our unemployment insurance system in history, which meant that significant additional elements needed to be added to ensure people’s bank accounts, and other information, could not be accessed,” Midkiff said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A policy governing the use of online social media and platforms by employees of the city unconstitutionally limits free speech, a lawsuit filed Thursday by two of the city’s library system employees claims. The Tulane First Amendment Law Clinic filed the suit on behalf of two employees of the city’s library system. One, Andrew Okun, is identified as a writer and editor “engaged in substantial online communications.” The other is Erin Wilson, who the suit says has a strong online presence and “engages in online humor and social commentary about the transgender experience and challenges gender stereotypes on multiple social media platforms.” Both reluctantly signed documents outlining the policies as a requirement of employment, according to the lawsuit, which focuses on a policy memo adopted last year that says employees can face discipline, including firing, for violations. Language deemed vulgar or offensive is off limits, according to the policy. It also instructs employees not to “engage or respond to negative or disparaging posts about city departments, employees or policies.” It specifically mentions a host of online sites where social comment can be made, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Slack, gaming sites and news websites.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state plans to study the burden student loan debt has on college graduates. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has signed a bill designed to study the impact of the debt. Democratic Sen. Mattie Daughtry, of Brunswick, proposed the legislation, which reinstates the state’s Commission to Study College Affordability and College Completion. Daughtry said Wednesday that the state needs to “make sure we understand how the cost of education, and the burden of student loans that come with it, is impacting Maine workers and our economy.” Daughtry cited that student loan debt in America is about $1.7 trillion, which is higher than the nation’s credit card debt. Maine’s average student loan borrower has more than $33,000 in school loans, Daughtry said. The senator said that is the sixth-highest average in the country. The commission is slated to provide a report to the Maine Legislature by January.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A jury on Thursday found the gunman who killed five people at a newspaper criminally responsible for his actions, rejecting defense attorneys’ mental illness arguments. The jury needed less than two hours to find that Jarrod Ramos could understand the criminality of his actions and conform his conduct to the requirements of the law when he attacked the Capital Gazette newsroom in 2018. The verdict means Ramos, 41, will be sentenced to prison, not a maximum-security mental health facility, for one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in the U.S. Prosecutors are seeking five life sentences without the possibility of parole. Survivors and family members of victims, some with tears in their eyes, embraced outside the courtroom and applauded prosecutors and jurors as they walked by after the verdict. “Having this going on for three years, it’s been a never-ending nightmare,” said Cindi Rittenour, the sister of Rebecca Smith, who died in the attack. “And then hearing that today – just all my anxiety over it, all the wonderings, the unknowns, it’s all gone away now, and all I feel is just relief and happiness. I feel like my sister can finally start to rest in peace.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston School Committee has unanimously approved an overhaul of the way students are selected for admission to the city’s elite public schools based on grades, an entrance exam and socioeconomic status. “We have come to a place where we are ready to move this district forward,” committee Chair Jeri Robinson said at Wednesday’s meeting. Under the new system, students will receive a composite score based on an admissions test and grades, then invitations to Boston Latin School, Boston Latin Academy and O’Bryant School of Math and Science will go out based on rank within eight socioeconomic tiers. Each tier will be allocated about the same number of places. The plan was opposed by some parent groups that wanted 20% of the spots at the schools set aside for the best applicants regardless of socioeconomic status. Superintendent Brenda Cassellius said she supported the change because it is easy to understand, maintains academic rigor and increases opportunity for disadvantaged students. “What is being considered tonight I believe to be a huge step forward for our students, especially our students who have not been able to access our exam schools through no fault of their own,” Superintendent Brenda Cassellius told the committee.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Canadian government has rejected a creative plan to have Ontario residents line up inside a U.S. border tunnel to tap into a surplus of COVID-19 vaccine held by Michigan, a mayor said. A white stripe was painted inside the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel in the Detroit River. Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens proposed that Canadians would stand along the border while health care workers jab them. “We’re not trying to send a man to the moon here. We’re using the infrastructure to accomplish a shared goal,” Dilkens said. “This is a sensible, reasonable alternative to vaccines heading to the landfill.” Motor vehicle travel between the countries is prohibited during the pandemic except for commercial truck traffic and workers deemed essential. Dilkens said partnering with Michigan, which has a vaccine surplus, would reduce the waiting time for Canadians who need a second shot. But the Canada Border Services Agency told Dilkens that the tunnel clinic could disrupt travel and carry “significant security implications.” Separately, Public Health Agency of Canada warned there could be trouble if the person giving the shot reached across the tunnel’s white line into Canada. More than 500,000 vaccine doses held by Michigan are set to expire by early August, said Lynn Sutfin, spokeswoman at the state health department.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order aimed at banning so-called conversion therapy Thursday but said it’s just a start and called on the Legislature to make it permanent. Minnesota is now one of about 24 states that, to varying degrees, ban mental health professionals from seeking to change a person’s sexual orientation. Eleven Minnesota cities already have local bans, including Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester and Duluth. Walz said conversion therapy is a “byzantine, tortuous practice” that’s not supported by any legitimate mental health organization. He said his order empowers state agencies to ensure that no Minnesotans under age 18 are subjected to it and that insurance companies don’t cover it. “There’s no place for hate in this state; there’s no room for division,” Walz said. “Our LGBTQ+ community is part, and a huge part, of what it means to be one Minnesota. When they are hurt or put through this, we all hurt. And when they succeed, we all succeed.” Attempts to get a ban through the divided Legislature failed in 2019. Sen. Scott Dibble, D-Minneapolis, said legislation is necessary to ensure a future governor doesn’t repeal the ban and to extend it to all Minnesotans. The Minnesota Family Council called the order an attack on the constitutional rights of patients, families and therapists.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has ordered that an independent monitor be put into place to oversee the state’s embattled mental health care system. The monitor will be tasked with verifying data submitted by the state analyzing the success of its mental health services. A key measure will be whether it’s preventing unnecessary hospitalizations by allowing people to be treated in their communities. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled on a remedial plan for the Mississippi State Department of Mental Health late Wednesday. The order comes 10 years after the federal government issued a letter in 2011 saying Mississippi had done too little to provide mental health services outside mental hospitals. The Justice Department sued the state in 2016, and Reeves ruled Mississippi was in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Federal attorneys said during a 2019 trial that mentally ill people were being held in jails because crisis teams did not respond. They said people had been forced to live far from their families because mental health services were not available in their hometowns. They also said people made repeat trips to Mississippi mental hospitals because there was no effective planning for them to make a transition to community services, and the most intensive kinds of services were not being made available.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The state’s health department on Thursday reported the highest daily count of new COVID-19 cases since the dead of winter, and the association representing the state’s hospitals is warning that the health care system is potentially on the brink of a crisis. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services cited 2,302 newly confirmed coronavirus cases, the largest one-day count since mid-January, as the delta variant continues to spread in a state with one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates. Hospitalizations ticked up statewide by 47 to 1,331, as did the number of patients in intensive care units, rising by 19 to 409. Nearly half of the ICU patients – 196 – are hospitalized in southwestern Missouri. Greene County and Springfield leaders are asking the state to fund an alternative care site since hospitals in Springfield are near capacity. The Missouri Hospital Association, in its weekly COVID-19 update, called the situation in southwestern Missouri “dire” and said signals for the rest of Missouri are “foreboding.” Mercy Springfield was reporting pandemic-high numbers of hospitalizations. Meanwhile, Gov. Mike Parson suggested Tuesday that some of that area’s health officials are trying to find someone to blame and want to scare people into getting vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s watercraft inspectors have intercepted a record number of boats carrying aquatic invasive mussels this year with nearly half of the boating season remaining, the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said. Inspectors identified two infested boats last week, bringing this year’s total to 41, the Montana State News Bureau reports. The previous record was 35 boats intercepted last year. The number of inspections has remained about the same, officials said. Aquatic mussels have no natural predators and can clog water pipes and displace native species. All watercraft including non-motorized boats must be inspected when coming into Montana to prevent zebra and quagga mussels from becoming established in the state. Adult mussels can attach themselves to the bottom of boats and survive out of water for up to 30 days. Mussel larvae are microscopic and can float undetected in boat live wells, bilges and ballast tanks. Thomas Woolf, the state’s Aquatic Invasive Species Bureau chief, said there’s some continued increase in outdoor recreation due to COVID-19, and Montana residents have been buying boats in the Midwest, where mussels are established. “We’re also seeing people moving here bringing their boats,” he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two weeks after the state quit publicly reporting daily coronavirus statistics, Nebraska launched a new website Wednesday to provide weekly updates on some of the information. The state’s decision to stop providing daily COVID-19 updates was widely criticized by health experts who use the data to track the virus’s spread. “I don’t think that was a well-timed decision,” said Dr. James Lawler, one of the leaders of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. “I think that if you are trying to drive down a rivet at night in the rain, blindfolding yourself is probably not the best idea.” Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Olga Dack said the state’s new website will be updated on Wednesdays with some of the latest information about the virus’s spread. The site includes the number of virus cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the state along with statistics on the vaccination campaign, but it doesn’t include as much detail as the previous version of the dashboard. Dack said part of the problem is that much of the data the state had been reporting previously is covered by state and federal health privacy laws, which were suspended as long as the state’s official virus emergency continued, but that ended June 30.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Washoe County Sheriff’s Office has been offering a “second chance” to motorists registered as organ donors by issuing a warning ticket as opposed to a fine for minor traffic violations. The Second Chance Organ Donation Awareness program was implemented this week through Friday because Wednesday marked the two-year anniversary of the death of Elizabeth “Lizzy” Hammond, a 9-year-old girl from Reno who saved three kids’ lives through the donation of her organs. At the discretion of the individual WCSO deputy, warning tickets are being handed out that note whether the offending motorist is an organ donor and give information about Donor Network West, the organization partnering with WCSO for the awareness campaign. “Through minor traffic infractions, we’ll pull people over and look at their card, and if their driver’s license indicates that they’re an organ donor, we thank them and then give them a second chance,” Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said. “Because they’ve taken that opportunity to give somebody else a second chance at life.” Balaam clarified that the program is for minor traffic infractions such as running a stop sign, minor speeding violations or not putting on a turn signal. “It’s not for your DUI or reckless driving cases,” he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRochester: A nonprofit has announced its plans to convert a building in the city to a drop-in youth center for young adults and children facing housing insecurity. Currently, Waypoint supports about 130 young people in the state. The nonprofit offers a variety of social services including adoption, mental health counseling and child care, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Erin Kelly, program director for Homeless Youth and Young Adult Services, said the center will be a safe place for young people to be able to drop in to receive support and resources from trained adults. The new center will also provide young people with meals, charging stations for phones, a food pantry, showers and group therapy. Kelly said the center will be officially open in 2022.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A white man captured on video yelling racist slurs at his Black neighbors and later arrested on harassment and more than a dozen other charges will remain in jail pending his trial, a judge ruled Wednesday. Edward C. Mathews, 45, of Mount Laurel, who stood silently from the Burlington County jail during a remotely held detention hearing, poses a “high risk of danger to the community,” Superior Court Judge Terrence Cook said Wednesday. Wednesday’s hearing marked the first time Mathews appeared in court on charges that stemmed from early July interactions with his neighbors at their Mount Laurel housing complex. He stood in an assembly room at the county jail during the proceedings, wearing orange and with his arms behind him. Prosecutors have charged Mathews with 14 counts, including harassment, stalking and weapons counts. Assistant Prosecutor Jamie Hutchinson on Wednesday said Mathews began harassing homeowners association board members, who were all of color, over a year ago, including by smashing windows of a neighbor’s vehicle with a rock and smearing their car with fecal matter.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico spent $1.5 million to advertise the state during the Virgin Galactic space launch Sunday. The state paid the money to display New Mexico’s logo on video of the flight, KOB-TV reports. The flight saw Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson briefly rocket into space aboard the company’s winged space plane for the first time. A third of the money came from a $500,000 special appropriation by the Legislature to market and promote the state during the flight, and the rest came from the Tourism Department’s budget, department spokesman Cody Johnson said. “We actually have a conservative estimate of around $3.5 million in media value just from the event itself – and, again, that’s a pretty conservative estimate – because we’ve seen so much coverage and viewership of the livestream that it’s going to grow over the coming days and weeks,” Johnson said earlier this week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A museum dedicated to telling Chinese American history marked its reopening to the public Wednesday, with an exhibit on Asian Americans and racism that it curated partially through submissions gathered during the pandemic and a surge of anti-Asian bias incidents around the country. The opening was a long time coming for the Museum of Chinese in America, not only because of the more than yearlong pandemic shutdown but because of a fire that ravaged though the space where its collection was housed in January 2020. Luckily, most of the collection was salvaged. Looking back, there was a question of “how were we going to survive, but we kept pivoting,” said Nancy Yao Maasbach, the museum’s president. That included a lot of virtual programming, including the call for submissions that became part of “Responses: Asian American Voices Resisting the Tides of Racism.” The exhibition’s outer walls are a running history of sorts, a timeline showcasing the racism and bigotry that’s been turned toward Asian Americans throughout their generations in the U.S. They touch on how stereotypes connecting them and disease have a long history, along with more recent issues like the treatment of Middle Eastern and South Asian communities in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and the anti-Asian bias of the pandemic.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House gave its final approval to wide-ranging energy legislation during an unusual overnight session early Thursday. The chamber met briefly after midnight to complete the second of two required votes on the measure, which now heads to the Senate. The first vote happened early Wednesday evening, but Democrats unhappy with the legislation blocked an immediate second vote. House Speaker Tim Moore announced the Thursday session would begin at 12:01 a.m. because several colleagues would be unavailable to vote during the daylight hours. The bill pushed by Republican leaders would retire early several Duke Energy power plants fueled by coal and expand solar production. The measure also lets Duke Energy seek multiyear rate increases, rather than year by year, and directs the utility to find a location for a new type of nuclear power plant. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and many manufacturers are among the bill’s opponents, citing in part costs to ratepayers and the shift of authority away from the state Utilities Commission. Environmental advocates say the coal-fired plant retirements rely too much on shifting to natural gas for electricity. Thursday’s final vote of 57-49 included five Republicans who voted against the measure. Roughly a dozen House members had excused absences.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The same stronger-than-forecast oil prices that are swelling the state’s treasury also could shrink dollars for road construction next year, officials said Thursday. Oil is used for road construction and making asphalt. The state Department of Transportation already has approved 174 contracts for road, bridge and other projects this year that total $350 million, agency spokesman David Finley said. Bids on those projects came in earlier this year before oil prices began surging, he said. Bids for next year’s construction projects will begin coming in November, but most will come in spring 2022, Finley said. Steve Salwei, DOT’s director of transportation programs, said none of the state-funded projects being done this year are affected by higher crude prices. Next year, however, things may be different. “We can only construct with money we have to pay for it,” he said. Contractors appear to be ample at present, and bidding competition could lower project costs, Salwei said. The state typically is required to match 20% of federal funding used road construction, Salwei said. North Dakota’s share of the funding won’t be known until a new federal highway bill is passed, he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: John Glenn’s birthplace and childhood hometown are joining forces to celebrate what would have been the history-making astronaut and U.S. senator’s 100th birthday with a three-day festival. Glenn, who died in 2016, was the first American to orbit Earth, making him a national hero in 1962. Before that, he served as a military fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War and set a transcontinental air speed record. In 1998, he became the oldest person ever to go into space at 77. He spent 24 years as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate. Running Friday through Sunday, the John Glenn Centennial Celebration is a collaboration between Cambridge, where Glenn was born July 18, 1921, and nearby New Concord, where he grew up and met his late wife, Annie, who died last year at 100 of complications from COVID-19. The celebration will include a Friendship 7-Miler race between the two communities and a Friendship 7 parade, both named for the aircraft Glenn rode during his famous orbit. Also planned are a presentation by space shuttle astronaut and fellow Ohioan Don Thomas, rocket car rides, space movies, and rides in the type of biplane a young Glenn flew over Cambridge to become hooked on aviation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials notified the Oklahoma County Detention Center on Tuesday that all juvenile inmates must be removed from the jail by Friday after a surprise inspection found numerous deficiencies at the problem-plagued jail. The Oklahoma State Department of Health notified the jail of numerous violations in a 61-page report from the June 23 inspection, including inadequate screenings of incoming inmates, failure to conduct proper inmate counts and obscured windows on cell doors that prevented proper “sight checks.” Jail administrator Greg Williams acknowledged in a statement that more improvements were needed but said he does not agree with all the report’s findings. “Decades of physical plant neglect and poor construction cannot be overcome in a few months,” Williams said. Only one current jail inmate meets the state’s definition of a juvenile, he said, and that person was expected to be transferred to the Oklahoma County juvenile detention facility before Friday’s deadline. Jail operations were taken over last July by a trust, which has drawn criticism for inmate deaths, escapes, assaults, and a hostage situation in which an inmate was fatally shot by police after beating and stabbing a jailer.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly 50 years after the Macleay landfill closed, Marion County is considering turning the rolling field on top of it into a park. The county is gathering public input and fielding ideas about what the land 7 miles southeast of downtown could become. So far, contenders include a bike park, a disc golf course or maybe both. “It is beautiful,” said Tom Kissinger, program supervisor of Marion County. “On a clear day, you can see Mount Adams and Mount Hood, even Mount St. Helens.” Some neighbors are less enthusiastic about the idea, however. Discussions began after the county sold Auburn Park to Salem-Keizer Public Schools in 2019 for an expansion of the adjacent Auburn Elementary School. The 4.37-acre Auburn Park was bought in two parcels with Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars in 1977 and 1979. By law, any sale of LWCF land must be balanced by the acquisition of another park of equal or greater economic and recreational value. That’s when “the idea came up of using the old Macleay landfill” for a park, Kissinger said. But multiple commenters on the county’s Facebook post about the land expressed concerns about contamination from the landfill and said they foresee an increase in the problem of people using the vacant land for camping and waste-dumping.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Six of Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities will be consolidated into two new institutions under a unanimous vote Wednesday by the State System of Higher Education’s governing board. Bloomsburg, Mansfield and Lock Haven universities in northern Pennsylvania will form one institution and California, Clarion and Edinboro universities in western Pennsylvania the other. The change will be phased in, starting later in 2022. They will have new names that have not been selected, but the plan is to keep all six campuses open with their own identities and brands, including existing sports teams. Both new institutions will have their own presidents and top administrators. The university system wants to cut student costs by 25% by getting them to graduate more quickly, enrolling high school students, raising more money from donors and grants, and expanding federal work-study offerings. There are 94,000 students in PASSHE, as it’s known, and enrollment has fallen by more than 20% since 2010. Chancellor Daniel Greenstein said students enrolled in the affected universities will be able to finish their degrees, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. In-person instruction and residences on campus will remain.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: The only home on a small island in Narragansett Bay has been sold. The 600-square-foot, off-the-electrical-grid cottage on Patience Island – with the unique address of 0 Patience Way – sold for $365,000, according to public records, lower than the $399,900 asking price when it was first listed in April. Realtor Michael Russo announced the sale on his Facebook page Tuesday. “Congrats to all parties involved with this special sale!” he wrote. He did not disclose the buyer, and the sale had not been recorded in town property records. The seasonal cottage comes with just under a half-acre of land, two bedrooms, a kitchenette, a half-bath and what is described as a “picturesque front porch.” Even though it’s off the grid, a single solar panel provides some electrical services. The island, officially part of the town of Portsmouth, covers about one-third of a square mile. According to property records, the cottage was built in 1972 and had been owned by the same family since.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina’s president has indicated he does not plan to ask the Legislature for permission to change the names of nearly a dozen campus buildings that a special committee says honors racists and Civil War figures. Instead, interim university President Harris Pastides said he will encourage school leaders to concentrate on honoring deserving people on new buildings with the same committee suggesting a number of prominent Black leaders. The police killing of George Floyd in May 2020 led to the removal of building names and statues to racists and Confederates across the South. None of that happened in South Carolina because of a law called the Heritage Act passed in 2000 that requires a two-thirds vote from the General Assembly to change the name of any building based on a historical figure. In the past 21 years, lawmakers have not even taken a vote on any request from the Civil War or segregation eras. The University of South Carolina has a special committee that has been studying building names across campus for two years. It found 11 that members felt were named for racists, including a health center named for U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, who died in 2003 and started his political career fighting against people who wanted to end segregation, according to a draft report obtained by The State newspaper.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Thursday fired the warden and deputy warden of the state penitentiary, following an investigation into an anonymous complaint that alleged supervising corrections officers regularly sexually harassed their fellow employees. The governor had suspended Darin Young, the former warden, on Tuesday, along with Secretary of Corrections Mike Leidholt. Noem said Thursday that she has also suspended Stefany Bawek, who was the director of a prison work program called Pheasantland Industries. The anonymous complaint released by Noem’s office alleges that supervising corrections officers at the prison were allowed to sexually harass employees and that attempts to report the harassment were ignored. The complaint says that schedules at the prison were adjusted so the officers could “work in the same vicinities as their interest/victims” and that employees who did not give in to the harassment were made to “suffer by being placed in less desirable posts.” The complaint further alleges that employee morale was low amid wages that lagged other industries, that corrections officers did not have body armor that was “up to standards,” and that promotions were based on personal connections. Nome’s statement said the investigation into the complaint is continuing.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s former top vaccination official received a dog muzzle in the mail a few days before she was fired this week in what she has said was an attempt to use her as a scapegoat to appease lawmakers. “Someone wanted to send a message to tell her to stop talking,” said Brad Fiscus, the husband of Dr. Michelle Fiscus. “They thought it would be a threat to her.” Michelle Fiscus had been facing harsh criticism from Republican lawmakers over the Tennessee Health Department’s outreach efforts to vaccinate teenagers against COVID-19. At a June legislative session, in which some lawmakers threatened to defund the Health Department, they specifically referenced a letter Fiscus sent to medical providers explaining the legality of allowing them to inoculate children 14 and up without parental consent. Fiscus was fired Monday. Her termination letter does not explain the reasoning for her dismissal, and a Health Department spokesperson has declined to comment on it. Brad Fiscus said his wife received a box in Amazon packaging containing a black dog muzzle at her office about a week before she was fired. But he said Michelle Fiscus was “taking it in stride” and continuing to “speak truth.” “She said, ‘Whoever sent that must not know me very well. That’s for a beagle, but I’m a pit bull,’ ” Brad Fiscus recalled.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Early in the pandemic, the Design Institute for Health, a joint program from Dell Medical School and the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas at Austin, studied the best way long-term care centers could help staffers follow sanitation guidelines. The institute’s team looked at creating clear signage about personal protective equipment, for example, and how to design stations for putting on that equipment and sanitizing hands. One finding of that initial study, paid for by a $410,822 grant from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, was that the effectiveness of infection control was directly related to the satisfaction of the workforce in the long-term care centers. The Design Institute for Health now is running three new pilot programs at three local long-term care centers, all of which participated in the previous study. The city of Austin and Austin Public Health are funding the $90,000 project, which began Monday. The first pilot program tries different design strategies to make the physical environment better for the staff and create spaces for breaks. Traditional breakrooms have been closed to staff during the pandemic. The second pilot program looks at what resources and partnerships can be created to help people working in long-term care centers.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The drought and COVID-19 pandemic have combined to make for a difficult year for agriculture, but the state’s farmers are finding ways to make the most of it. Utah farmers created a statewide food distribution program last year aiming to get food to hungry residents and their families, and managers announced this week that the “Miracle Projects” administered via the Miracle of Agriculture Foundation had helped serve more than 1.5 million pounds of food to more than 35,000 hungry people statewide. At the same time, farmers and ranchers were looking for additional ways to get their food products directly to consumers. Now, members of the Utah Farm Bureau are pushing to find new ways to fund the program and keep it going while still supporting area farmers and ranchers. Farmers Feeding Utah Inc., established to make buying local products convenient and reasonable, kicked off recently with a Utah-product-only subscription box that delivers new products to people’s doorsteps every month. Those interested can subscribe at Box.FarmersFeedingUtah.com. Each month’s box will include new products. Subscribers will also receive exclusive access to an online marketplace where they can purchase their favorite items from the boxes.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The U.S. Passport Agency ended its no-appointment walk-in service at its Vermont office after it was overwhelmed by people seeking the documents amid a backlog of 1.5 million requests, the State Department said Thursday. Dozens of desperate travelers from throughout the Northeast had been traveling to the St. Albans office after getting word that people could get passports on the spot and struggling to make appointments at other offices. The Vermont Passport Agency had been offering appointment slots from no-shows to last-minute customers on its premises, the State Department said in a statement Thursday. The agency has “discontinued this practice due to unintended safety and security consequences,” it said. More than 20 people, including small children, were waiting outside the Vermont office Thursday despite the policy change. On Wednesday, the State Department said the wait for a passport is now between 12 weeks and 18 weeks, even if people pay for expedited processing, because of ripple effects from the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, the State Department is accepting appointments at the Vermont Passport Agency and other public passport agencies for life-or-death emergencies. A limited number of appointments for urgent, non-life-or-death travel within 72 hours can be made online.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: After a pandemic-enforced hiatus in 2020, a popular summer event is making a comeback. While COVID-19 restrictions forced the cancellations of the island’s biggest event – the Chincoteague Pony Penning held each year in July – a small event that still attracts hundreds each year during that same time period is returning. From July 22 to 24, blueberry aficionados can sample the juicy berry in a wide variety of creations while browsing through arts and crafts at what is billed as the “largest fine arts and crafts event on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.” The 33rd annual Blueberry Festival promises plenty of blueberry treats for attendees, along with live entertainment and both indoor and outdoor exhibits featuring artists and crafters from the Shore and beyond. The festival will take place from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each day at the Chincoteague Center. In addition to popular blueberry=themed foods such as ice cream, pie and cakes, four food vendors will be on hand, offering options including pizza, seafood, and Middle Eastern and Mexican specialties. Live music will be offered throughout the three days of the festival, featuring popular returning and new acts.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A civilian police watchdog group has found that an officer repeatedly worked over 90 hours a week and earned so much overtime that he was the highest-paid city employee one year at more than $400,000 – and none of his supervisors noticed. The review by Seattle’s Office of Police Accountability of the case of Officer Ron Willis found 15 times in which he worked more than 90 hours a week in 2019 and identified numerous gaps in the Seattle Police Department’s ability to monitor overtime, The Seattle Times reports. In a letter to interim Chief Adrian Diaz, OPA director Andrew Myerberg urged the police department to track hours in a centralized database or require the department’s human resources staff to “flag employees who may be working excess hours.” As a result of the review, Willis was suspended for one day without pay for working more than the maximum hours allowed by department rules. A police spokesperson said Willis wasn’t available for comment, and efforts to reach him by the newspaper weren’t successful. The police department has long struggled to monitor overtime and has been the subject of multiple critical findings from city auditors and the oversight group.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: Gov. Jim Justice visited Thomas Jackson’s office at West Virginia University’s Robotic Technology Center in Fairmont on Wednesday to present the latest million-dollar prize in the state’s vaccination sweepstakes, according to a news release. Justice was accompanied by his pet English bulldog – Babydog – who is the mascot of the “Do It for Babydog” vaccination sweepstakes. The Republican governor also surprised two residents with brand-new, custom-outfitted trucks and two more with four-year scholarships to any public institution in the state. Other West Virginians won lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, custom hunting rifles, custom hunting shotguns, and weekend getaways to West Virginia state parks. Earlier in the week, Justice confronted outlandish conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines and set higher targets for vaccinating residents age 50 and older. He said at a news conference Tuesday that he recently had a meal with a group of people who believed in the baseless conspiracy theory that “there was something in the vaccine that would enable the federal government to track us.” The governor dismissed it and urged more people to get their shots. “It’s just a stretch beyond what I can believe,” he said. Justice noted that the phones people carry around with them have more tracking potential.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: Gov. Tony Evers joined local and state economic leaders in the city Wednesday to announce that he will direct $130million in federal funding toward workforce development programs. The funds, which come from the state’s American Rescue Plan Act allocation, will be spread across three programs that will help regions find solutions to workforce challenges and help unemployed or underemployed workers find job opportunities. The Democratic governor said there is “no one-size-fits all-solution” to workforce challenges. “I’ve heard from many Wisconsin business owners, employers, out-of-work job-seekers that while employment in Wisconsin continues to grow, our economy is facing obviously a workforce shortage. A shortage that existed well before I became governor but has been made worse obviously by this pandemic,” Evers said. Wisconsin’s unemployment rate in May 2021 – the most recent month reported by the state – was 3.9%, tied for the 10th-lowest in the country, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The largest block of funding will provide grants to at least 10 local and regional entities with about $10 million each to help meet needs including child care, transportation and housing. Evers said that funding would go out sometime in the fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A magician and comic has canceled performances at libraries in northeastern Wyoming because of threats over a social media post about her being a transgender woman, she said. The Campbell County Library posted on its Facebook page that Mikayla Oz, 24, was canceling shows planned for Wednesday and Thursday in Gillette and Wright out of safety concerns for herself, library staff and patrons, the Gillette News Record reports. The fact that Oz is a transgender woman was shared on a social media post, leading to misinformation about her performances and calls to protest the events, library officials said. Oz, from Des Moines, Iowa, has performed at libraries, schools and other events. She said the show she planned is family-friendly and doesn’t have an LGBTQ message. She was initially willing to do her show despite some complaints, but then she started receiving violent and frightening threats online and by telephone, she said. Library director Terri Lesley said her staff also received threats from a patron. Oz’s gender identity was not previously known to library staff, nor is it something they consider relevant, Lesley said. “It just breaks my heart, especially when my show has absolutely nothing to do with my back story at all,” Oz said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/17/tidal-basin-flooding-rally-raccoon-garden-razed-news-around-states/50241761/", "title": "Tidal Basin flooding, 'rally raccoon': News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A man convicted of murder more than a decade ago was captured Monday a day after escaping from a minimum-security corrections center near Mobile, prison officials said. Jeffery Strugg, 31, was discovered missing from community-based facility in Prichard on Sunday, according to a notice from the Alabama Department of Corrections. The agency didn’t release any information about how Strugg got out. He surrendered without any violence in Mobile County, corrections officials said. Strugg was 18 when he was sentenced to 29 years in prison after being convicted in the 2007 killing of Dewone Smiley, 15, in Selma, court records show. Strugg was accused of entering an apartment and shooting Smiley, a student at Selma High School, to death in front of two witnesses. Strugg is eligible for parole consideration Dec. 1, prison records show.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House on Saturday voted against accepting a spending package passed by the Senate that included payments of about $5,500 to residents. The vote to concur with the Senate package failed, with 18 members in favor of accepting the Senate plan and 22 against. The vote sets the stage for a conference committee, with the regular legislative session set to end by Wednesday. In a conference committee, House and Senate negotiators are tasked with hashing out differences between the state budgets that passed each chamber. The House, in its version of the budget, included a dividend of about $1,250 plus a $1,300 “energy relief” check. The Senate plan called for a dividend of about $4,200 from Alaska’s oil wealth fund, an amount in line with a long-standing formula last used in 2015. The Senate plan also included a $1,300 energy check. Some lawmakers have argued the state is benefitting from high oil prices and can afford to help Alaskans who are struggling. But critics of the higher payments to residents say oil prices are volatile, and the oil price in the state revenue forecast can’t be assured.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A federal appeals court has upheld a judge’s ruling overturning a federal agency’s approval of Toronto-based Hudbay Minerals Inc.’s plan for a new open-pit copper mine in southeastern Arizona. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the U.S. Forest Service’s approval of a permit for the Rosemont Mine project in a valley on the eastern flank of the Santa Rita Mountains near Tucson went beyond what is allowed under a federal mining law. The appellate court cited the planned use of Coronado National Forest land for long-term storage of waste rock, not actual mining, and the lack of valuable minerals on that property. Hudbay Minerals officials said in a statement Thursday that they were reviewing the ruling and would continue to pursue alternative plans for mining part of the Rosemont copper deposit on nearby private lands. A coalition of environmental and tribal groups challenging the mining hailed the appellate court’s decision, the latest in a series of legal obstacles to the project. “This momentous decision makes it clear that Hudbay’s plan to destroy the beautiful Rosemont Valley is not only a terrible idea, it’s illegal,” said Allison Melton, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. Hudbay has another mine project in the works on the western flank of the Santa Ritas.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A raccoon ran loose in the stands during Arkansas baseball’s Friday matchup with Vanderbilt, but a fan came to the rescue. Fayetteville native Grant Harmon grabbed the raccoon with his bare hands and held it up to cheers from the crowd at Baum-Walker Stadium as members of the Commodores’ bullpen looked on from left field. The incident was dubbed by fans on social media as the “rally raccoon,” as the Hogs came back to tie the game after being down 5-0 and then 6-5. Despite that, the rallies ultimately fell short as Vanderbilt won 9-6 in 10 innings. After grabbing the raccoon, Harmon continued to carry it out of the stadium. “The opportunity just came about, and I guess I just took action and grabbed it,” he said. “That was a first. I have no prior experience grabbing raccoons.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nModesto: The state will acquire a sprawling former farm property in the San Joaquin Valley and create a new state park for the first time in 13 years. Dos Rios Ranch, where the San Joaquin and Tuolumne rivers meet southwest of Modesto, will become California’s 280th state park and the first new one since Fort Ord Dunes near Monterey in 2009, the Modesto Bee reports. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday earmarked $5 million for the new park as part of his revised budget proposal for the fiscal year starting July 1. The nearly 4-square-mile expanse featuring willows and valley oaks will be donated by River Partners, a conservation group that’s spent the past decade restoring the site. State Parks Director Armando Quintero said Friday that the property will serve “a park-poor region” – the San Joaquin Valley – and help address inequities in access to state recreation sites. “Everyone deserves to have close access to vibrant parks, and this opportunity is an exciting one,” Quintero said. Dos Rios could get trails, picnic areas, restrooms and other basics within five years, state parks officials said. Campgrounds could follow within another five years, the Bee reports.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The city is enacting a fire ban after a series of blazes have spread quickly in hot and dry conditions, including a fatal one caused by smoking. Under the ban taking effect Monday, smoking and grilling will be banned in parks in Colorado’s second-largest city. People grilling at home will only be able to use gas or liquid fuel, not charcoal or wood, and chain saws must have spark arresters. Welding or torching work may still be allowed but only with a permit, the Colorado Springs Fire Department said. A woman died in a fire Thursday at a mobile home park that was blamed on “the improper disposal of smoking materials,” city spokesperson Natashia Kerr said. Eight homes were destroyed. Under the ban, smoking materials must be disposed of in a non-combustible container with a lid. Meanwhile, a wildfire in the foothills southwest of the city that also started Thursday has burned 2.4 square miles. The fire near the former mining town of Cripple Creek was 27% contained Monday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A former assistant police chief’s lawsuit claiming he was defrauded out of the police chief’s job can go forward, a state appeals court has ruled. James Nardozzi’s lawsuit stemmed from the hiring scandal that landed the city’s police chief and personnel director in prison last year. Nardozzi claimed former Chief Armando Perez and former personnel director David Dunn conspired with Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim to fix the selection process so Perez would be selected as chief, the Connecticut Post reports. Prosecutors said Perez, 65, received confidential information about the police chief’s examination that was stolen by Dunn, including the questions for an oral examination and the scoring guide for written essays. Perez, who was the acting chief at the time, also admitted that he had two officers complete his essays, passed the work off as his own and lied to federal authorities in an effort to cover up his actions. Last April, Perez was sentenced to a year in prison, and Dunn received a four-month term. Both have since been released, according to the Courant. The appeals court ruled Friday that Nardozzi’s suit can proceed even though the city had paid him to settle a previous lawsuit after he was fired by Ganim in 2016. The case could go to trial later this year.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State lawmakers have introduced bipartisan legislation that would put state law enforcement officials in charge of background checks for gun purchases. A bill filed Friday would resurrect Delaware’s Firearm Transaction Approval Program, which was eliminated more than a decade ago when lawmakers voted to rely on the federal government’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. That vote came amid concerns then that Delaware’s background check system was not providing the federal NICS with information about mentally ill individuals prohibited from buying or possessing firearms. The bill authorized state agencies to provide such information to NICS, created a federally mandated program allowing individuals previously deemed mentally ill to reestablish eligibility for gun ownership, and abolished the state’s existing background check system. Lawmakers now want to return responsibility for firearm transactions background checks in Delaware to the State Bureau of Identification. The SBI would be the point of contact between gun dealers and the federal databases checked by the FBI. The SBI would thus become responsible for determining whether a person is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm and would be able to search other databases other than NICS in making that determination.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In 100 years, if nothing is done, the historic Tidal Basin may be underwater, WUSA-TV reports. In 500, the Jefferson Memorial will be accessible only by boat. A combination of rising waters and a sinking human-made Tidal Basin puts the entire area – cherry blossoms, memorials, walking paths – at risk. But it’s not inevitable. The Trust for the National Mall and the National Trust for Historic Preservation have teamed up to create the Tidal Basin Ideas Lab, an initiative to plan out what the reservoir could become in the next century. It was once just a part of the Potomac River, but after the great flood of 1881, city planners got to work dredging up the river and Washington Channel to build the Tidal Basin. Teresa Durkin, executive vice president for the Trust for the National Mall, said the gates that engineers installed to control the water flow are no longer doing their job. “The gates have actually silted shut. So the water keeps coming through, but with it, it’s bringing all this silt and debris. So over time, it literally cannot open and close anymore. It doesn’t function as it was designed to,” Durkin said. “A lot of that sediment, because it’s not flushing out of the out gates, is also settling in the Tidal Basin itself. So it has likely raised the water.”\n\nFlorida\n\nVero Beach: A food truck exploded during a seafood festival Saturday, sending one person to the hospital with severe burns, according to authorities. The Vero Beach police said state and local fire officials are investigating the cause of the explosion. The department posted photos of the scene on Facebook that showed the sides and roof of the truck blown off the vehicle. One person was flown to a hospital burn unit in Orlando. There were no other injuries, and the festival continued as authorities secured the scene of the explosion, police said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group of voters who challenged U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s eligibility to run for reelection said Monday that they have filed an appeal of the Georgia secretary of state’s decision that she can appear on the ballot. The five voters from Greene’s district in March filed a complaint with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger alleging that the Republican congresswoman played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. They argued that puts her in violation of a seldom-invoked part of the 14th Amendment having to do with insurrection and makes her ineligible to run for reelection. Georgia Administrative Law Judge Charles Beaudrot last month held a daylong hearing that included arguments from lawyers for the voters and for Greene, as well as extensive questioning of Greene herself. He then sent his decision to Raffensperger on May 6. Beaudrot found that the voters hadn’t produced sufficient evidence to back their claims. Raffensperger affirmed that decision, writing that whether Greene’s political statements and actions disqualify her from office “is rightfully a question for the voters of Georgia’s 14th Congressional District.” Under state law, the voters are allowed to appeal that decision in Fulton County Superior Court.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines is exploring electric aircraft technology with an eye toward using the vehicles for interisland travel, Hawaii News Now reports. A Boston-based company called REGENT is designing “seagliders” that would each carry up to 100 people. Hawaiian hasn’t committed to purchasing any of the aircraft but is exploring the possibility. A news release from REGENT said Hawaiian agreed to strategically invest to support the initial design of the company’s next-generation seaglider. Hawaiian is the first airline to partner with the company, which hopes to have its Monarch seagliders in the air by 2028. “We look forward to working with REGENT to explore the technology and infrastructure needed to fulfill our vision for convenient, comfortable and environmentally sustainable interisland transportation,” said Avi Mannis, chief marketing and communications officer at Hawaiian Airlines. REGENT’s seagliders fly through the air close to the water’s surface. The company said the aircraft will service routes up to 180 miles with existing battery technology and routes up to 500 miles with next-generation batteries. The company said the seagliders will move at the speed of an airplane but have the operating cost of boats and will use existing dock infrastructure.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials have agreed to a $119 million settlement with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and three major distributors over their role in the opioid addiction crisis. Republican Gov. Brad Little and Attorney General Lawrence Wasden said in an announcement Friday that it’s the second-largest consumer settlement in state history, trailing only the 1998 national tobacco settlement. An Ada County judge on Wednesday approved the settlement that includes all 44 Idaho counties, 24 cities and the state’s seven health districts. The money will address damage wrought by opioids, which the federal government declared a public health emergency in 2017. Johnson & Johnson and the three distributors agreed to a national $26 billion settlement in February. “Idaho has made significant strides in recent years in combatting the opioid crisis, and the culmination of our legal action against opioid manufacturers – led by Attorney General Wasden and his team – now offers additional resources,” Little said in a statement. Wasden is continuing legal action against other opioid makers as well as the Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma. “This settlement holds some of those most responsible for the opioid crisis accountable and provides significant funding for treatment, recovery and prevention in Idaho,” he said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot tightened a citywide curfew for young people Monday, a day after she restricted access by unaccompanied minors to downtown’s Millennium Park following the weekend shooting death of a 16-year-old boy near “The Bean” sculpture at the park. The citywide weekend curfew for minors now will begin each night at 10 p.m., instead of the 11 p.m. curfew in place since the 1990s, Lightfoot said. At Millennium Park, which is a popular stop for tourists and Chicago residents, minors will not be allowed in the park after 6 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays without an adult. “We need to make sure they are safe and importantly that our young people understand and respect basic community norms, respect for themselves, respect for each other, and we must ensure that every one of our residents and visitors – no matter who they are or where they come from or how old they are – are able to safely enjoy our public spaces,” the mayor said at a news conference. Lightfoot said she hoped and expected that people would abide by the restrictions and that it would not lead to widespread arrests. She said officials “don’t want to arrest children,” but those who break the law will be.\n\nIndiana\n\nNoblesville: A tiny community garden that provided 1,500 pounds of free food over five years to people in need was bulldozed by city crews after a nuisance call about overgrown grass. City officials said the lease with the nonprofit that managed the garden expired more than a year ago, and there was no sign that the land had been maintained since. The overgrown six parcels next to Southside Park posed a safety risk, officials said. Garden caretakers said they were in talks with the city about entering a new contract and weren’t given a warning the plot would be flattened and its furniture removed. Hidden underneath the pollinators and overgrowth were viable shrubs and plants, said Renee Rule, coordinator of the garden since its founding. The plot is messy when it’s not growing season but was a little more scraggly this year because bad weather had delayed volunteers who were to prepare it for planting, Rule said. “I wish they would have given us a call, and we could have saved some of the plants,” Rule said. The garden has provided free tomatoes, green beans, zucchini, onions and lettuces to neighborhood families and served as an instructional farm for college students and Girl Scouts alike. Families rented plots so they could grow vegetables to eat. Schoolchildren were given pumpkins in the fall. A beekeeper gave demonstrations at a beehive.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: School districts across the state are up against a federal deadline that will end a pandemic-era free meals program for students next month. While many school officials are waiting to see if federal or state lawmakers will extend the program, at least one district, Des Moines Public Schools, is working to continue offering most of its students free meals next school year. Students have faced repeated upheavals since March 2020, when schools across the country closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to help districts feed students during the health crisis – whether they were at school or home – the U.S. Department of Agriculture temporarily relaxed rules that tied who received free lunch to family income and neighborhood poverty levels. As the June 30 deadline draws near, school district officials and school nutrition advocates are asking state and federal lawmakers to intervene by either extending the relaxed rules or offering free meals to all students permanently. If no legislation is passed, students who qualify for free or reduced-price meals will still receive those services. Educators and advocates stress that studies show students do better academically when they are not hungry. School meals reduce both hunger and anxiety about it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A federal judge is blocking a public school’s policy preventing teachers from outing transgender students to their parents after a teacher raised religious objections. Fort Riley Middle School math teacher Pamela Ricard sued USD 475 Geary County Schools over LGBTQ anti-discrimination policies that conflicted with her Christian beliefs. District Judge Holly Teeter issued a preliminary injunction Monday blocking the school from disciplining Ricard if she reveals preferred names and pronouns of her transgender students when communicating with their parents. “The Court relies on Plaintiff’s statements that she does not intend to communicate with a parent for the sole purpose of disclosing a student’s preferred name and pronouns,” Teeter wrote. Ricard has two transgender students in her class, the judge wrote, neither of whom has authorized the district to disclose a preferred name and pronouns to parents. While Ricard uses their preferred names in class and avoids pronouns, she has emailed parents using a student’s legal name and biological pronouns. “Plaintiff believes that addressing students one way at school and a different way when speaking to their parents is dishonest,” the opinion said. “Being dishonest violates her sincere religious beliefs.” Teeter was appointed by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: A judge entered a not guilty plea Monday for a man accused of fatally shooting the daughter of a former state lawmaker during a home invasion. Shannon Gilday, 23, appeared in Madison Circuit Court for a continued arraignment on charges of murder, attempted murder, assault, burglary and criminal mischief, news outlets report. His attorney tried to enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill on his behalf last week, but the prosecution argued against it, and the judge continued the hearing. Meanwhile, prosecutors filed a notice of aggravating circumstances seeking enhanced penalties upon a conviction, which stopped defense attorney Tom Griffiths from trying to enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill, news outlets report. Gilday allegedly broke into a multimillion-dollar Madison County home owned by former lawmaker C. Wesley Morgan and shot Jordan Morgan while she was asleep, according to court records and statements from Morgan. Gilday also exchanged shots with Morgan during the Feb. 22 break-in. State police investigators said Gilday told them he was determined to get access to a bunker in the home. He was arrested in Madison County about a week after the shooting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Child drownings are on the rise in Louisiana, according to the state Department of Health, which says inability to swim, lack of supervision, and unfenced pools, spas and water bodies are top causes of drownings among babies and children under 15 years old. “As temperatures heat up and families return to water activities, it is important for parents and families to stay aware of the precautions they can take to prevent child drownings,” the department said in a news release. The agency said the number of drownings among children had fallen steadily for years, from 26 in 2015 and 2016 to 15 in 2019. But the total rose 60% in 2020, to 24. And preliminary data indicates that last year’s total was 25, it said. The department’s most recent Louisiana Child Death Review Report, covering 2017 through 2019, found that an average of 17 children drowned each year. That made drowning the No. 3 cause of injury-related death in children up through age 14, behind vehicle crashes and homicide. It found that 96% of them could not swim, 72% were unsupervised, and 54% died in water that hadn’t been fenced off. It found that 60% drowned in a pool, hot tub or spa. Looking at all drownings including adults, Louisiana had the nation’s third-highest rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposed order from the state’s Board of Environmental Protection would let stand a permit issued for a $1 billion electric transmission corridor to serve as a conduit for Canadian hydropower. The draft order was written by environmental agency staff ahead of a hearing this week that was postponed because of COVID-19 illnesses. The board was supposed to meet Tuesday to decide whether to hold a public hearing or to begin deliberations the following day. The permit was suspended by Maine Environmental Commissioner Melanie Loyzim after voters rebuked the project in a statewide referendum. Because the permit was not permanently revoked, the Board of Environmental Protection was required to issue a final decision on consolidated appeals. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court, meanwhile, is weighing a lawsuit aimed at overturning the referendum on constitutional grounds, as well questions about the legality of a state lease for a small portion of land. Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the New England Clean Energy Connect would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower – enough electricity for 1 million homes – to the regional power grid. Supporters say bold projects are necessary to battle climate change. Critics say the benefits are overstated, and it would destroy woodlands.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen says he has suffered a minor stroke and is being treated at George Washington University Hospital. The Maryland Democrat said he has been told there are no long-term effects or damage. In a statement Sunday night, Van Hollen said he has been advised by doctors to remain under observation at the Washington, D.C., hospital for a few days out of an abundance of caution. Van Hollen, 63, was elected to the Senate in 2016 after serving seven terms in the U.S. House. The senator said he experienced lightheadedness and acute neck pain while delivering a speech in western Maryland. On the advice of a physician, he sought medical attention upon his return home. An angiogram indicated a minor stroke in the form of a small venous tear at the back of his head, Van Hollen said. “I look forward to returning to work in the Senate later this week and thank the medical team for their excellent care,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Chelsea Millsap, 32, who can trace her ancestry to the Pilgrims, is the first woman named sexton in the nearly 300-year history of Boston’s Old North Church. The critical job involves caring for and maintaining the parish buildings and equipment, including an 18th-century clock, the 75-piece chandeliers and the crypt where more than 1,100 people have been laid to rest. One of her first tasks will be managing a major renovation and restoration of the crypt. The church, still home to an active Episcopal congregation, is famous as the place where in 1775, two lanterns in the steeple signaled British soldiers were heading to Concord and Lexington, sending Paul Revere on the ride that sparked the American Revolution. One of the people who hung the lanterns was Robert Newman, the sexton at that time. “What an incredible opportunity to be able to sit in the very same pew as Robert Newman and in a world that is so divided to work in a place that welcomes all people from Bostonians to world dignitaries, like the Queen,” Millsap, a Detroit native and former firefighter with experience in fire prevention, security technology and project management, said in a statement. “I could have been the one to hang the lanterns 247 years ago. It is such an honor to show women that they too can hold these sorts of jobs.” Millsap is a descendant of teenage Mayflower passenger Mary Chilton, buried at nearby King’s Chapel.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A man walking on a footbridge to a Detroit Tigers game said he fell 15 feet to the ground when part of the concrete collapsed. Ely Hydes said the incident occurred May 9, but the bridge still was open until the Detroit News reached out to the state Transportation Department on Sunday. The Spruce Street pedestrian bridge is above M-10, also known as the Lodge Freeway. Hydes said he was walking to Comerica Park with a friend when “the bridge just collapsed under my feet.” “I remember thinking, ‘I hope I’m not over the freeway.’ I landed about 6 feet from the traffic. … After I hit the ground, I got the wind knocked out of me pretty good,” Hydes, 36, told the newspaper. He informed police, then resumed his walk to the Tigers game, a 2-0 loss to Oakland. Hydes went to a hospital a few days later. “I’m a giant walking bruise right now,” he said. The Transportation Department said it wasn’t aware of the hole in the bridge until notified by the newspaper. “The Spruce pedestrian bridge was built in 1953, and based on its age and condition, it is on a yearly detailed bridge inspection that is due this month,” spokeswoman Diane Cross said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLutsen: Communities in northeastern Minnesota are preparing to deal with more flooding and are calling for volunteers to help with sandbagging. Near Voyageurs National Park, most docks are underwater at area lakes, and some 200 homes and resorts are at risk. Kabetogama Township Supervisor John Stegmeir said his area is bracing for a record-breaking flood. Stegmeir said more volunteers are needed, especially since the average age of volunteers sandbagging right now is 65. The volunteers, along with some staff from Voyageurs National Park, have been working since last Tuesday, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “I think we’ve filled 8,000 bags this week, which isn’t big when you talk about the flooding on the Red River – they’re talking millions of bags – No. 1, we couldn’t do that, and the people who have been coming out to bag are older, you know,” he said. Volunteers are asked to check in at the town hall and to bring a shovel if possible. A flood warning is in effect for many communities in the Rainy River Basin of far northern Minnesota. In Cook County, the owner of Lutsen Resort on Lake Superior is hoping the iconic bridges on the property can be saved. Recent high water levels sent debris rushing down the Poplar River, damaging the bridges.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state has revised its landlord-tenant law to give renters time to gather their belongings from a home before being forced to leave, after a federal judge ruled that the previous law was unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills wrote in his Nov. 30 order that the old law was “unpredictable and absurd,” saying it went further than eviction laws in any other state. He wrote that it violated an occupant’s right to due process. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed the new law April 21, and it took effect immediately. It passed with broad bipartisan support. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the new law gives a tenant seven days to gather belongings and vacate a home after an eviction notice. An exception is made for emergencies. If the occupant does not leave during the initial order, a judge could issue a separate one authorizing law enforcement to remove a tenant. That would give the person another 72 hours to gather their belongings. The previous law allowed landlords to immediately seize and dispose of a delinquent occupant’s personal property. The impetus for his order was a lawsuit by Samantha Conner, a Columbus woman who sued her landlord after he took nearly everything she owned when she was evicted in 2019.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The state has retained a dubious distinction for the 10th time, topping the Humane Society’s list of the worst puppy mill problem. In their annual list of worst dog breeders in the country, the advocacy group listed Missouri as having 26 of the most abusive puppy mills. Since the “Horrible Hundred” list was first published 10 years ago, Missouri has topped the list each year. This year the Show-Me State garnered 26 spots on the list, compared to just 17 in Iowa, 12 in New York, and seven each in Kansas and Wisconsin. That Missouri has so many puppy mills is no surprise, according to Humane Society Stop Puppy Mills campaign senior director John Goodwin. “Missouri has always been at the heart of the puppy mill industry since the beginning,” Goodwin said. “The post-World War II era was a time period where there was a lot of consolidation in agriculture, and a lot of small farms closed. This industry was seen as a solution in Midwestern states, and Missouri became the epicenter of large-scale puppy mills.” That evolution was aided by state regulations allowing the mills to flourish, Goodwin said. That would have changed in a 2010 proposition approved by voters that would have required large-scale breeders to provide “sufficient food, clean water, housing and space” to the dogs under their care, along with “necessary veterinary care; regular exercise and adequate rest between breeding cycles.” After the initiative was passed, the Legislature changed the language of the regulations.\n\nMontana\n\nCrow Agency: Little Big Horn College, a tribal college on the Crow Reservation, in partnership with the Crow Language Consortium, will host the 10th annual Crow Summer Institute on June6-24. The three-week program offers free Crow language and culture classes. Participants must be at least 18 years old, and registration is now open, according to a news release. The institute offers two options, one for beginners and one for intermediate learners. Learners will have access to resources developed by Crow elders, speakers and knowledge keepers, including textbooks, flashcards, dictionaries and multimedia apps. The Crow Summer Institute is offering $100 gas cards to some early registrants and Crow dictionaries for those who complete the program. Participants may also earn college credit through Little Big Horn College. Ishkoochìia Chiiakaamnáah (Jacob Brien), a Crow language learner who attended past Crow Summer Institutes, said the program helped him “realize different connections and patterns within the language.” “It really helped me understand Crow jokes and, by extension, Crow culture, which of course usually doesn’t translate, as many subtleties of the language don’t work in English,” he said in a statement.

The lawsuit, filed by Terry Berry Jr.’s family against prison officials they argued were responsible for the 22-year-old’s death because they put him in the same cell as Patrick Schroeder, was dismissed last week after both sides agreed to the settlement. Berry was nearing parole on a sentence for forgery and assault when he was placed with Schroeder, who was serving a life sentence for killing a 75-year-old man and dumping his body in a well. The Lincoln Journal Star reports Schroeder later pleaded guilty to killing Berry and was sentenced to death. Berry’s family argued in the lawsuit that prison officials should have known there would be problems if they placed the two men together, and a caseworker at the prison even warned co-workers involved in the decision that Schroeder didn’t want a cellmate and wouldn’t likely tolerate Berry well because he was known to be “very talkative and bothersome.” Back in 2019, a federal judge dismissed the head of the state Department of Correctional Services and the prison’s warden as defendants, but the case had been allowed to move forward against several prison employees involved.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A proposed ballot initiative seeks to amend the state constitution to establish open top-five primaries and ranked-choice voting for general elections, though it isn’t without its critics. The Nevada Voters First political action committee is spearheading the initiative and must collect 140,777 signatures from registered Nevada voters by June 29 to qualify the measure for the 2022 general election ballot. Approval in November would call on the Legislature to institute the changes to the Nevada Constitution by July 1, 2025. In ranked-choice balloting, voters are directed to mark candidates in order of preference and to mark as many choices as they want. A voter may also choose only one candidate. The proposal would establish open primary elections, including all candidates regardless of party affiliation, squaring off in ranked-choice fashion. The top five finishers would advance to the general election, which would also be conducted using ranked-choice voting. About 30% of registered voters in Nevada list themselves as nonpartisan, and about 40% aren’t registered as Republican or Democrat, said Sondra Cosgrove, a representative with Nevada Voters First and a past president of the League of Women Voters of Nevada. “That’s a lot of people who are being shut out of important races,” she said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former Trump administration official running for Congress did not violate state law by voting twice during the 2016 primary election season, the New Hampshire attorney general’s office said Thursday without taking a position on whether federal law was broken. The Associated Press reported in April that Matt Mowers cast ballots in both the Feb. 9, 2016, New Hampshire presidential primary and the New Jersey primary four months later. Legal experts said Mowers could have a violated federal law that prohibits “voting more than once” in “any general, special, or primary election.” That includes casting a ballot in separate jurisdictions “for an election to the same candidacy or office.” Though the article did not allege violation of state law, the attorney general’s office investigated based on the report and complaints from voters. After reviewing Mowers’ voting history, rental and property records, driver’s license documents and other material, it concluded he did not violate New Hampshire’s law against double voting. Mowers is a leading candidate for the GOP nomination in the state’s 1st Congressional District, though New Hampshire has yet to complete its redistricting process and finalize the congressional map. He was the nominee in 2020 but lost to Democratic incumbent Rep. Chris Pappas.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The Ocean County Board of Commissioners plans this week to wade into the contentious debate over the state’s new health and sex education curriculum. While the five-member, all-Republican board has no legal authority to determine what is taught in schools, its bully pulpit is seen as influential in a county that is a bastion of conservatism in an otherwise progressive state. Commissioner Virginia E. Haines, who is also a Republican National Committee member, circulated a draft resolution among her colleagues last Wednesday to establish a “Parents’ Bill of Rights.” If approved as expected, the resolution would put the full weight of the county government behind a grassroots effort to establish such a bill of rights by providing political, administrative and legal support. The text of the draft resolution authorizes and directs the county commission director, the county administrator and county general counsel to organize parents, community leaders and unspecified professionals to develop the framework for such a document. The framework for such a declaration would then be used to marshal local school districts and county schools into adopting their own bills of rights.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s Asian American community is testing a new way to bolster security for Asian-owned businesses in the wake of two deadly shootings. KOAT-TV reports an Albuquerque startup is trying out an online service that connects armed security guards with Asian-owned businesses. Businesses would report suspicious activity to toServo. The service would utilize GPS-enabled mobile technology to put them in touch with a private security team, and the security on call would respond within minutes. It is part of an initiative established by the Asian Business Collaborative. The nonprofit started a Good Neighbor Program to check up on shops and restaurants. For now, four businesses will be chosen for the service. But there are hopes to expand its use by the end of the year. Collaborative organizers say the city’s Asian community has been on edge since shootings at two Asian-owned spas. In January, the female owner of one spa was shot and killed during an attempted robbery. Two men have been charged in her killing. Less than a month later, another woman of Asian descent was killed inside another massage business during a robbery. The suspect was killed in a police pursuit 10 days later.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City health officials issued an advisory Monday urging New Yorkers to wear masks in all indoor public settings as the city approaches “high risk” COVID-19 alert status. Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said everyone “regardless of vaccination status or past COVID-19 infection” should wear face coverings at all times in settings such as grocery stores, offices and building lobbies. People at high risk of severe illness from the virus, such as those over 65 years old, should avoid crowded settings and nonessential gatherings, he said. Vasan said he was issuing the guidance as the city approaches the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “high” level of COVID-19 alert, representing high community spread and increasing pressure on the health care system. New York City has been averaging about 3,600 reported new cases of COVID-19 per day over the past week – a number that is likely an undercount because it doesn’t include positive tests done at home. The daily case counts have been rising slowly since March but have leveled off somewhat recently. The CDC risk level for Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island is currently “medium,” while the Bronx is still “low.” But much of the surrounding metropolitan area has already moved into the CDC’s “high risk” category.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction in the shooting death of an endangered red wolf in North Carolina. The wolf was found in a muddy field in Tyrrell County on April 15, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The News & Observer reports it had been shot in the spine and collapsed in the mud – some of which was found in its lungs. Killing a red wolf is illegal, except under special circumstances. Red wolves once ranged across the Southeast, but after decades of habitat loss and killing by humans, they were nearly extinct by 1980. The Fish and Wildlife Service gathered up the remaining wild wolves and began a captive breeding program. The first captive wolves were reintroduced to the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern North Carolina in 1987. By 2006, as many as 120 red wolves were thought to be living in the wild. Since then, wolf populations have declined again. Last year, the Biden administration abandoned a proposal made under President Donald Trump to scale back the areas where red wolves are protected and allow the killing of wolves found outside federal land.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Hoping to head off an explosion of electronic pull tab machines at gas stations and liquor, grocery and convenience stores, state regulators want to change the definition of a bar to make clear where the wildly popular Las Vegas-style games that mimic slot machines will be allowed. The state attorney general’s office, which oversees gambling in North Dakota, has identified a handful of gas stations and convenience stores that have begun selling and serving booze and are now “masquerading” as bars so that they can put the machines in their businesses, Attorney General Drew Wrigley said. Wrigley and Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator, said the idea for the rule change is to clarify and preserve what they believe the intent of the Legislature was when it defined a bar as a “retail alcoholic beverage establishment where alcoholic beverages are dispensed and consumed.” The amended language specifies that a bar does not include gas stations or liquor, grocery and convenience stores. A bar in a hotel, bowling alley or restaurant could still have the machines, under the new definition. The North Dakota Gaming Commission scheduled a Thursday meeting at the state Capitol to discuss the proposed changes and to take public comments.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state took the formal step of signaling interest in expanding Amtrak passenger rail in Ohio, though it is far from saying yes to the idea. Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the Ohio Rail Development Commission to work with Amtrak to study potential new routes, according to Dan Tierney, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. The move was first reported by Cleveland.com. “It’s not to the point where we’re ready to go jump up and ‘yippee,’ but it’s significant, and we’re optimistic,” said Stu Nicholson with All Aboard Ohio, an advocacy group for rail. Amtrak wants to build a line connecting Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton and Cincinnati. The company agreed to cover the cost of construction, track upgrades and operating costs for at least five years, then split the estimated $17 million to $20 million annual operating costs with the state. The roughly $100 million cost to build the line would come from a massive infrastructure package Congress passed into law. The approach could better entice Ohio to expand rail given much of the upfront cost will be covered, advocates said. Nicholson said recent guidance allows the state to use other sources outside its general revenue, such as private grants, to go toward its share.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: New laws signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt will increase funding for local enforcement of the medical marijuana industry and target illicit sales of cannabis. Each of the bills moved through the Legislature last week, and as a result county sheriffs are now able to receive grant funding to dedicate a full-time deputy to assist with compliance visits conducted by the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority. The intent of the law is to allow enforcement officers to help the medical marijuana authority in situations where licensed cannabis businesses are not willing to allow inspections of their property. According to the bill’s authors, compliance inspectors were denied access 181 times between April 2021 and February of this year. “This bill is not meant to threaten anyone. We just want to make sure our compliance inspectors can safely do their jobs,” said state Rep. David Hardin, R-Stilwell, the House author. “This is a very important piece of legislation that will help rein in illegal marijuana operations and give Oklahomans the safe, fair, free market for medical marijuana that they voted for in 2018.” Logistics of the bill create a revolving fund, provided by the medical marijuana authority, that sets aside an annual $5 million for county sheriffs to dedicate an officer for one year to the medical marijuana authority.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Criminal defendants who have gone without legal representation for long periods of time amid a critical shortage of public defense attorneys filed a lawsuit Monday that alleges the state violated their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial. The complaint, which seeks class-action status, was filed as state lawmakers and the Oregon Office of Public Defense Services struggle to address the huge shortage of public defenders statewide. The crisis has led to the dismissal of dozens of cases and left an estimated 500 defendants statewide – including several dozen in custody on serious felonies – without legal representation. Crime victims are also affected because cases are taking longer to reach resolution, a delay that experts say extends their trauma, weakens evidence and erodes confidence in the justice system, especially among low-income and minority groups. “There is a public defense crisis raging across this country,” said Jason D. Williamson, executive director of the Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law at New York University School of Law, who helped prepare the filing. “But Oregon is among only a handful of states that is now entirely depriving people of their constitutional right to counsel on a daily basis, leaving countless indigent defendants without access to an attorney for months at a time.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz is stepping up his criticism of far-right candidates gaining traction ahead of Tuesday’s primary election. After spending much of the campaign steering clear of fellow Republican Senate contender Kathy Barnette, Oz on Saturday said she was out of step with the GOP and would be unable to win the general election in November. In an interview, he took issue with a 2015 tweet from Barnette in which she wrote that “Pedophilia is a Cornerstone of Islam.” Oz, who would be the nation’s first Muslim senator, described the comments as “disqualifying.” “It’s reprehensible that she would tweet out something that is defamatory to an entire religion,” Oz told the Associated Press. “This state was based on religious freedom. I’m proud as a Pennsylvanian to uphold those founding beliefs that every faith has its merits.” The Barnette campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier in the week, Barnette told NBC News that she did not make the statement, which was still live on her Twitter feed Monday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A congressional candidate recently arrested on a menacing charge in another state has dropped out of the race. Michael Neary said in a statement Friday that he was seeking medical treatment for non-epileptic seizures following his arrest in Ohio in March. He said the decision followed “careful consultation and prayer.” Neary, 28, was among a large field of candidates seeking the Democratic nomination in Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District following incumbent Democrat Jim Langevin’s announcement in January that he’s retiring. Neary has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of menacing by stalking March 23, as well as drug counts after marijuana and drug paraphernalia were allegedly found in his car. He’s previously said he’d remain in the race despite the charges. The Columbus, Ohio, resident, who grew up in Rhode Island, was stopped by police after another driver reported having been followed from Columbus to Troy, more than 60 miles away. Police said the driver reported that Neary’s car mimicked their every move, matching speed and lane changes and even stopping at a rest area after they did. Authorities said Neary told them he had recently returned from Rhode Island, was very stressed and had been focusing on the vehicle’s Ohio registration.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Grace Church has purchased a dormitory building from Greenville Technical College to convert into affordable housing as part of a special program to address the local housing crisis. The church will serve as the landlord for the property, and rent will be adjusted to fit families’ income. Rent prices will range from $450 for a single room to $1,000 for a three-bedroom unit. The goal, according to Grace Church’s care and recovery ministry director LeeAnne Cavin, is that the average family will pay in the $900 range for a unit. “We do have a crisis of housing,” Cavin said. “Our whole community is really starting to desire collaboration.” The units are expected to open for rent the first week of June, and the church already has almost 40 families ready to move in. The program will accept emergency housing vouchers through the Greenville Housing Authority but not Section 8 vouchers or extra subsidy from the federal government that goes directly toward rent. To sign a lease in one of the units, families agree to be a part of a Grace Church housing program that offers medical coverage, dental care, a savings matching program, mental health support, car maintenance, financial education, cooking classes, self-defense classes, and job and interview preparation.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The ongoing drought in South Dakota has been hard on the state’s wildlife. The U.S. Forest Service says the grouse population in the Fort Pierre National Grassland has declined by 15% in 2022, largely because of the dry conditions. The total grouse population has averaged about 300 since the mid-1980s. Over the past twenty years, both greater prairie chicken and sharp-tailed grouse populations have primarily remained stable or have grown. “The thing that I think was really damaging to us last year was we had record-high and record-dry conditions in early June, right when those birds started incubation or, for the earlier semester, to hatch. And, boy, that’s just so tough on a chick to thermoregulate and be able to find sufficient moisture,” District Ranger Dan Svingen said. Greater prairie chickens and sharp-tailed grouse both nest on the ground and require tall grass to hide their nests, the Capital Journal reports. Because they start laying eggs as early as April, before sufficient grass growth, they’re dependent on dead grass from the previous year as cover. However, the drought prevented extensive grass growth in 2021, leaving them more exposed to predators in 2022. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a little more than 76% of South Dakota is experiencing some kind of drought.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: In its quest to redefine tourism at the gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has inked a deal to bring an international entertainment company to the United States for the first time. Tribal Council and international theme park company Puy du Fou have signed a letter of intent to develop a new “spectacular immersive show” as part of a 200-acre development located at Exit 407 south of Interstate 40 on the way to the Smokies. The Tribal Council approved $75 million May 4 for phase one development of “The 407: Gateway to Adventure.” Its leaders are seeking world-class attractions to appeal to the record-breaking crowds flocking to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The 407 partners have estimated the development could attract 6.7 million visitors in the first year after phase one is complete. That’s expected sometime in 2024. “We are excited to take the first steps towards developing this world-class attraction that will help support our nation economically while creating a new platform to share dimensions of Cherokee history many have never heard,” said Chairman of the Tribal Council Richard French. Puy du Fou is known worldwide for its immersive experiences inspired by history.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Two people were killed and three more taken to a hospital with injuries after a shooting Sunday at a bustling flea market, authorities said. The shooting at the open-air market arose from an “altercation” that involved at least two guns and all five of the people, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. He said no “innocent bystanders” were injured. Investigators believe one of the people hospitalized was among those who opened fire, and two more suspected shooters were detained at the scene, a sheriff’s deputy told KTRK-TV. Thousands of people were shopping at the market 14 miles north of Houston’s downtown when the shooting began around 1 p.m. Sunday, Gonzalez said on Twitter. The sheriff said multiple shots were fired, and deputies recovered two pistols from the scene. Authorities did not immediately provide further information about what led to the shooting but said all the people involved were men in there 20s who appeared to know each other.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A copper mining company will begin manufacturing a rare mineral used in solar panels that used to be discarded along with the other mine tailings. Rio Tinto officials and Gov. Spencer Cox unveiled the plan Wednesday at the Kennecott refinery west of Salt Lake City where the tellurium will be produced, FOX-13 news reports. The company says it is one of two in the U.S. to produce tellurium, which is listed as a “critical mineral” by the U.S. government. Most of the tellurium produced comes from China and other countries. Rio Tinto is working with the U.S. Department of Energy on ideas to produce more tellurium. The company said it hopes to produce 20 tons of the tellurium each year. “If we can produce it here, we are all going to be better off,” said Cox, a Republican. “We desperately need more of it.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott signed legislation into law Monday that creates an advisory committee to make recommendations on how to spend the state’s share of settlement money with drug manufacturers and distribution companies over the toll of prescription opioids. The number of opioid-related overdose deaths in Vermont jumped 33% in 2021 to a record 210 fatalities, the Vermont Health Department reported last month. The committee will be made up of the state’s health commissioner; a member each from the state Senate and House; health care providers; two people who lived through the experience of opioid use disorder; an assistant judge; and representatives from municipalities. Each year, the committee will make recommendations to the Vermont Department of Health and legislative committees for expenditures from a special opioid abatement fund. The health commissioner is expected to call the first meeting of the panel to occur on or before June 30.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A professor whose research on pedophilia created a stir at Old Dominion University has landed a new job with Johns Hopkins University’s Moore Center for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse. Allyn Walker stepped down from ODU in November after using the phrase “minor-attracted person” instead of “pedophile” in research, leading to an outcry on campus and social media, as well as threats of violence. The Virginian-Pilot reports the Moore Center announced last week that Walker, who uses the pronoun they, would be joining the center as a postdoctoral fellow. The center said in a series of tweets that it was excited to welcome Walker and that they would be working on research and new projects to develop a “comprehensive public health approach to addressing child sexual abuse and effective prevention programs.” On its website, the center says it works “to change the way the world thinks about child sexual abuse, from inevitable to preventable.” In the series of tweets, the center referred to Walker as “a leader in the field of perpetration prevention research.” Walker was an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice before more than 15,500 people signed an online petition calling for their removal from ODU in the fall. That came after a controversial interview about “A Long, Dark Shadow: Minor-Attracted People and Their Pursuit of Dignity,” a book focused on people who do not act on their sexual attraction to children and strategies to prevent them from acting on the attraction.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amtrak will postpone restoring its Cascades passenger-train service between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., until possibly December because of a lack of personnel. The service gap occurred despite the Biden administration’s much-hyped $66 billion allotted in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to catch up on maintenance and spread Amtrak’s national railway service to new cities, The Seattle Times reports. Janet Matkin, rail spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Transportation, said transportation officials in the state hoped the trains would roll again by summer or even late spring. Amtrak doesn’t have enough conductors, mechanics and onboard service staff yet to operate the trains, though new classes of conductors are in training, according to a letter to Washington and Oregon rail directors from Ray Lang, an Amtrak vice president. Pre-pandemic, about 159,000 people per year rode between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., or 290,000 when including stations between the cities, Matkin said. Passenger fares traditionally cover about two-thirds of operation costs, while states cover the rest.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWelch: Gov. Jim Justice visited the site of a planned $147 million highway project that will connect Welch to the Coalfields Expressway. The 5-mile stretch of highway is expected to be completed in 2026. “This announcement today means we are one step closer to bringing this area of West Virginia to the world once and for all,” Justice said in a media release. “We have waited and waited in southern West Virginia for way too long.” Justice announced Friday that Bizzack Construction of Lexington, Kentucky, won the bid to build the new highway. The governor’s office said plans are in the works to build a 5-mile stretch of the Coalfields Expressway from Mullens to Twin Falls State Park and a 3-mile link from Twin Falls toward Pineville. The four-lane Coalfields Expressway that runs from Raleigh County to Wyoming County opened in 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSparta: The popular Elroy-Sparta State Trail officially reopened over the weekend following several years of flood-related repairs. Summer flood damage in 2018 closed the 32-mile-long trail which had about 60,000 visitors a year. The state Department of Natural Resources said the western Wisconsin trail needed two complete bridge replacements and landslide repairs, among other work. According to the DNR, $2.3 million needed for repairs came from the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the state. State Sen. Howard Marklein, of Spring Green, and state Rep. Tony Kurtz, of Wonewoc, spearheaded efforts in the Legislature to secure funds for the trail’s repairs, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “The easy part was the funding,” the DNR’s Missy VanLanduyt said. “The more difficult part was just the sheer amount of infrastructure that needed to be replaced, and designing all of that, and then going through the bidding process and then finally a very long construction period as well.” While repair work is largely complete, a 1-mile section of the trail was closed as of Friday because of bridge safety concerns. VanLanduyt said it’s set to reopen after Memorial Day weekend, with a permanent bridge replacement coming in late 2023 or early 2024.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis apologized Monday after getting booed and heckled for remarks she made on sexual identity during a University of Wyoming graduation speech. A first-term Republican from deep-red Wyoming, Lummis said in Saturday’s speech in Laramie that human rights are derived from God but that government seeks to redefine many of them. “Even fundamental, scientific truths such as the existence of two sexes, male and female, are subject to challenge these days,” Lummis said. She paused and smiled while many in the crowd responded with boos and heckling. “And I challenge those of you,” she said, without completing that thought, saying: “I’m not making a comment on the fact that there are people who transition between sexes.” Lummis is a former congresswoman, state treasurer and University of Wyoming graduate who’s been prominent in Wyoming politics for decades. Until now, at least, she has been less outspoken than many Republicans who’ve made a major issue of gender and sex identity. The stir happened in a community known for the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, a watershed event in LGBTQ activism. A college town of about 32,000 people, Laramie leans left compared to the vast majority of Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}]}

Bayha received his doctorate from the University of Delaware in Lewes and studied the jellyfish of the Delaware coast for many years. Collins is a curator and research zoologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nWhile jellyfish are just nuisances to most people, they are of extreme ecological importance, according to Bayha and Collins.

It has fewer tentacles than the sea nettle, and its sting is slightly less painful.\n\nMoon jellyfish: A large, clear jellyfish with four white circles in the middle of the bell. Their tentacles are very, very small, and their sting is less serious and more annoying. They're mainly found in ocean and estuarine waters.\n\nCrystal jelly: These ocean jellyfish have a flat-disc appearance, much like the bottom of a glass soda bottle. Their sting is mild.\n\nSea walnut: A ctenophore, not a jellyfish, that is extremely common off the coast of Delaware in summer. They're much smaller than the jellyfish in this list but are the largest animals that use cilia for movement. They do not sting.\n\nLion’s mane jellyfish: A large red jellyfish with hundreds of relatively short tentacles. It packs a painful sting, second only to the Portuguese man-of-war in this list.\n\nPortuguese man-of-war: An uncommon hydrozoan, not a jellyfish. It has a bluish-purple float that keeps it at the surface, and its sting is one of the worst in U.S. waters. If it is found in Delaware waters, it was likely transported from far off by winds. Several washed up in 2015.\n\nA jellyfish's sting comes from microscopic nematocyst cells firing a venom-containing barb into a person’s skin, according to Bayha and Collins. However, not all the cells fire, so flush away the unfired cells immediately with salt water, they said. Don't use fresh water, as it will cause the cells to fire. Don't use urine either because it doesn't work.\n\nUse vinegar to immobilize the stinging cells, Bayha and Collins said, and the lingering pain of a sting has been found to be most effectively treated with hot water.\n\nShannon Marvel McNaught reports on Sussex County and beyond.

Then he spotted another one. Then two more.\n\n“I saw four on a mile-long stretch of beach,” the Selbyville fisherman said. “That’s unusual in itself.”\n\nState officials and Fenwick Island Beach Patrol Captain Tim Ferry said Wednesday morning they have no confirmed sightings of men-of-war so far this year, but the stinging siphonophores do occasionally make an appearance on First State beaches.\n\n“It is more painful than a regular jellyfish, but it’s not like they’re seeking out swimmers,” Ferry said, noting that he shared a photograph of a man-of-war with his guards Wednesday morning to prepare them in case they are spotted during the day.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, another man-of-war had washed up on Fenwick Island, this time at Houston Street, according to a post on the town's Facebook page.\n\nFerry said a variety of factors — water temperatures, currents, the Gulf Stream — all play a role in whether the creatures wash up on the beach. But he said recent heavy rains make it less likely to see men-of-war and other jellyfish, which prefer very salty water.\n\nWhile resembling jellyfish, men-of-war are actually made up of a group of animals called zooids. Each man-of-war is made up of four parts, each with its own task of floating, capturing prey, feeding and reproduction, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe tropical marine species is known for its balloon-like appearance, which floats on the water’s surface and can be blue, violet or pink. Beneath the water’s surface, tentacles containing microscopic barbed tubes filled with venom can dangle 30 feet to 100 feet, NOAA states.\n\nIn 2015, the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control issued a warning to beachgoers after several men-of-war washed up between Cape Henlopen and Fenwick Island.\n\nOfficials at that time warned anyone who sees a man-of-war to tell a lifeguard immediately, remove the tentacles with a towel or other object, and if stung rinse the area on their body with water and avoid rubbing the impacted area. Anyone who experiences trouble breathing, swelling of the lips or tongue, closure of the windpipe, dizziness, fainting, vomiting, nausea or cramps should seek immediate medical attention.\n\nPain from the sting is rarely lethal, according to NOAA, but can last up to an hour and produce welts that can linger for several days. NOAA also advises those stung to use vinegar to prevent the firing of cells that cause the sting, and if there is pain, to apply heat.\n\nFisher said he believes a strong east wind last week, which he said also washed Sargasso grass from the deeper seas onto the shore, was likely the reason the men-of-war made an appearance. He said he has not seen any since that first sighting.\n\nNOAA officials said Delaware is within the normal range for the animals, and they have no evidence that they are expanding into new territory.\n\nRich King of Delaware Surf Fishing warned his fellow fishermen to be wary while wading in the ocean.\n\n\"We stand in the surf wash a lot and pieces or a whole one could easily wash across their feet,\" he said. \"A friend of mine had one wash up on the beach at night right next to him.\"\n\nFisher also speculated that dredging and beach replenishment work along Bethany Beach and South Bethany may be stirring things up.\n\n“It could be a one-time, isolated issue and if it is, good,” Fisher said. “I’d hate to see anybody get that kind of welt on them.”\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.\n\nDELAWARE TOP STORIES\n\nFive families in Wilmington public housing make over $90,000\n\nFull marijuana legalization up for a vote today in Delaware House\n\nDelaware General Assembly approves $4.27B spending plan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/03/16/delaware-seashore-state-park-guide-things-to-do-near-me-rehoboth-beach/70006978007/", "title": "Delaware state parks: What to do, see around Rehoboth Beach", "text": "Taking a weekend trip to a nearby city can be fun, but a hidden gem right here in the First State might have you thinking twice about leaving the next time you’re searching for a good time.\n\nDelaware Seashore State Park in Rehoboth Beach, known as Indian River State Park until 1967, is located within walking distance of the Atlantic Ocean and features 6 miles of ocean and 20 miles of bay shoreline.\n\nThe Indian River Inlet connects the Indian River and Rehoboth Bay with the Atlantic Ocean and boasts sprawling beaches on either side.\n\nWhen is Delaware Seashore State Park open?\n\nThe park is open daily from 8 a.m. to sunset.

But there appeared to be no significant damage to the already vulnerable beach, and no additional damage to the boardwalk.\n\nAs coastal storms went, this one turned out to be less than it was cracked up to be, which was probably a good thing since the coastline was so badly eroded in the big storm two weeks ago. As for the forecast snow elsewhere in the state, there wasn't even enough to prompt school closings Tuesday morning, but it did make for sloppy driving Tuesday night.\n\n\"I think people are mostly happy,\" said Dean Iovino, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, about the lesser snowfall totals. \"Maybe except schoolkids.\"\n\nAfter hefty predictions Monday, meteorologists backed down forecasts throughout the day Tuesday, finally ending up on about 2 to 4 inches for northern and central Delaware. Southern parts of the state saw even less, as temperatures dropped and shifted Tuesday's rain to snow overnight.\n\nAs of 10 p.m., 3.5 inches had fallen at White Clay Creek, 3.3 inches in Hockessin, 2.5 inches in Greenville, 1.1 inches in New Castle, 0.9 inch in Newark and 1 inch west of Dover. There was no accumulation south of Dover, according to the University of Delaware's Environmental Observing System.\n\nRoadways remained mostly clear for the Tuesday morning commute, but the state Department of Transportation and the National Weather Service warned that conditions would worsen into the evening hours. Wednesday morning's roads will likely also be slick. DelDOT crews treated roads susceptible to icing over throughout Monday night and Tuesday, as a winter weather advisory spanned through 6 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nWhile the coastal snowstorm was a moving target, forecasters are much more certain about what the next few days will bring. The big news: bitter cold on Saturday and Sunday as cold arctic air dips into our region with a southward shift in the jet stream.\n\n\"There's a pretty good dose of cold air coming in,\" said Carl Erickson, a meterologist at AccuWeather.\n\nIn Delaware, temperatures will be 20 to 30 degrees below normal for mid-February. And Erickson said that in some places to the north and west, it could drop below freezing on Saturday night.\n\nWorse yet, daytime temperatures will rise only into the 20s. Sunday will be slightly warmer but just slightly, he said.\n\nIt also will be windy, and that will make it feel even colder than it is, Erickson said.\n\nA coastal storm is also brewing, but Erickson said that isn't expected to be an issue because it is expected to track well off the coast.\n\nDelaware's shoreline, badly damaged during the Jan 22-24 winter storm, suffered more sand loss on Tuesday.\n\nCity officials blocked the area from Grenoble Place to Surf Avenue as a precaution.\n\nBut as the ocean receded, flooding began along Rehoboth, Indian River, Little Assawoman and Delaware bays.\n\nState Transportation officials closed Del. 1 south of Dewey Beach because of high water on the road. And there was flooding in other low-lying areas such as Savannah Road on the beach in Lewes.\n\nThe storm didn't pack the punch forecasters suggested it might, and it didn't come close to the might of the January 22-24 storm that set a high-tide record at Lewes – a record that had stood since the March Storm of 1962.\n\nLast month, lunar high tides combined with near hurricane-force winds and waves to damage or destroy protective dunes all along the coast and make the shoreline especially vulnerable – one reason state and local officials kept such a close eye on this storm.\n\n\"We watched this storm very carefully,\" said Anthony P. Pratt, the state shoreline and waterway administrator. \"While we are still so vulnerable along the coast, we dodged the bullet.\"\n\nThe coast was spared significant damage, and most of the rest of the state, which had been expecting significant snowfall, got a pass, too.\n\nState crews have yet to assess the latest damage. At high water, it is difficult to see how much shoreline erosion there is.\n\nShortly after 8 a.m. Tuesday, the waves lapped at and flattened some of the piles of soft sand that were pushed up last week in Rehoboth Beach to form some dune along the northern end of the boardwalk.\n\nThe city's renourished beach – and those in other ocean coast communities south to Fenwick Island – lost significant beach and dune during a strong nor'easter Jan. 22-24. That storm, Pratt said, left both the ocean coast and Delaware Bay shore extremely vulnerable. The one exception was Broadkill Beach, where a sand pumping operation is underway.\n\nThe National Weather Service on Monday warned that the Delaware and New Jersey coast could take a second beating Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nSlushy mix continues into Wednesday\n\nWhile there were plenty of big waves and churning surf and a higher-than-normal tide thanks to a new moon on Monday night, the storm was less powerful than expected.\n\nStill, Jason Slaysman, of Berlin, Maryland, couldn't believe the waves.\n\n\"It's incredible how rough the surf is,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, water pushed over a dune crossing and spewed debris onto the boardwalk at Rehoboth Avenue.\n\nMilton resident David Grant swung by to check out the surf, too.\n\n\"I think we've all been fooled by the weather reports before,\" he said.\n\nThe University of Delaware Environmental Observing System recorded peak wind gusts of around 18 miles per hour at both Indian River Inlet and the Rehoboth Beach Boardwalk on Tuesday.\n\nReach Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

The trend is coast-long, even in places where the strategy had been to allow nature to take its course.\n\nDelaware alone received $30 million in federal Sandy relief money to restore sand that was swept away during the hurricane in 2012. Another $38 million is being spent at Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge to restore wetlands and fill shoreline breaches that Sandy worsened.\n\nThe sand pumping there – in an area that federal officials had allowed to retreat as sand washed over into the adjacent marsh during storms – started last week.\n\nBut this new policy could be short-lived, said Howard Marlowe, with Warwick Group Consultants, a Washington-based consulting firm. Marlowe is an expert on beach rehabilitation funding, having lobbied on behalf of communities for several years. He has shifted his focus to a regional approach to shoreline management and to finding new sources of sand such as reuse of dredge spoils.\n\nHis predicts that when it comes time for maintenance and repairs of all these created beaches, there won't be enough federal money to go around.\n\n\"They'll be bumping into each other,\" he said of state and local governments who will be jockeying for a share of federal money. \"There's going to be a load of beaches between 2017 and 2020\" that will need maintenance and repairs – and that's without a significant storm or hurricane. \"There's going to be a significant lack of money if I had to bet on it.\"\n\nThat puts Delaware communities like Bethany and South Bethany – where as much of one-third of the protective sand dune was chopped off during a long-duration coastal storm earlier in October – in a predicament. The two communities are in line for federal maintenance sand pumping in 2017.\n\nAnthony P. Pratt, the state shoreline and waterway manager, said he isn't worried about availability of federal money for the Delaware projects. In each case, there is a 50-year contract for continued U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintenance.\n\n\"It really hasn't changed our world, at all,\" he said. All the projects that were initiated after Sandy were pre-approved, Pratt said.\n\nMarlowe has witnessed the struggle over money for beaches. He said it dates back to the Clinton administration, and the start of funding cuts for federal dollars for beach rehabilitation. Back then, there were fewer beaches in line for money. Among them: several in New Jersey, Florida and Ocean City, Maryland. These days – after emergency projects following Sandy – that funding pot may not be large enough to cover all the future repair needs.\n\nThe root of the problem, Marlowe said, is there isn't a federal coastal policy on beach renourishment. So while federal flood insurance may give people an incentive to build higher or farther from the sea, exactly where and how people build is controlled by local rules.\n\nHe believes states should work together on a regional basis to prioritize shoreline repair needs, reduce the cost of mobilizing dredge crews ( that mobilization cost can be significant) and work with federal agencies to find and use sand being removed as part of other projects.\n\nPratt said that before Sandy, officials in Delaware, Maryland, New York and New Jersey had started to work together but the effort was put on hold after the hurricane.\n\nThe idea, he said, was to find ways to make beach repairs more efficient by combining contracts to reduce overall costs.\n\nFowler Beach Fix\n\nAt Fowler Beach, there is a one-time effort to build a more storm resilient wetland and shoreline. Even before Sandy, lower Delaware Bay residents begged federal officials to fill the breaches along the bay shoreline.\n\n\"At first, it was a battle,\" said Jim Bailey, president of the Broadkill Beach Preservation Association, of the push by area residents, farmers and landowners to get federal officials to address the problem. \"Now it's a cooperative effort.\"\n\nThree years after Sandy, the Fowler Beach sand pumping project is the largest of the Delaware shoreline repair projects. The plan is to pump 1.1 million cubic yards of sand to fill a series of breaches and inlets blamed for flooding in nearby communities, killing trees in adjacent woods and flooding nearby farm fields with salt water. The repeated inundation prompted farmers to build earthen berms to keep the flood waters out.\n\nLast week, a survey boat made a final series of calculations and then a plug in the pipeline was removed. The pipe was primed with seawater and then, on Oct. 21, the first of the sand that will be pumped onto Fowler Beach, spilled through the pipeline. The area is southeast of Milford and is currently inaccessible. The road is closed while the dredging work is underway. Eventually, federal refuge officials may install a footpath into the restored area.\n\n\"In the beginning, it was a battle,\" said Jim Bailey, president of the Broadkill Beach Preservation Association, of the push by area residents, farmers and landowners to get federal officials to address the problem. \"Now it's a cooperative effort.\"\n\nThe plan, said Bart Wilson, the project manager for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, is to work north first and then shift to the south to fill the largest in a series of breaches between Fowler and Prime Hook beaches.\n\nWhile the Fowler Beach breach opened during previous storms – the first was in 2008 – it was worsened during Sandy. Today, it is more an inlet than a breach, sending water into and out of the marsh with every high and low tide on Delaware Bay.\n\n\"We have the Prime Hook Sound,\" now, Bailey said.\n\nOnce the breach formed, water flooded a manmade water holding structure originally designed to draw in ducks and geese during migration each fall. The area became a rich habitat for ducks that favored fresh and brackish water.\n\nBut once the shoreline was breached, the old structure flooded with water from Delaware Bay, the freshwater vegetation died and the structure of the marsh crumbled. In storms, saltwater followed the old drainage ditch system and flooded low-lying farm fields adjacent to the refuge. The salty water limited the crops that would grow.\n\nBailey said this restoration project will help property owners to the north in Slaughter Beach, to the south in Prime Hook and Broadkill beaches and also help area farmers.\n\nThe $38 million cost includes shifting drainage in several of the refuge marsh units to restore historic channels and allow the marshes to revert back to historic, tidal salt and brackish marshes. Federal officials believe that will make the marsh system more resilient during coastal storms and improve drainage. Salt tolerant grasses will be planted to help the wetlands built and keep pace with sea level.\n\nOne of the landmarks in the area – the foundation of a tower that dated back to WWII – now sits several feet offshore in deep water. It will be covered in sand, said Bart Wilson, the project manager for the federal agency.\n\nThe plan is to create a 220-foot-wide beach in the area, with a 40-foot wide dune that will taper into the adjacent marsh to the west. The dune will be 9-feet above mean sea level, said Al Rizzo, The Fish & Wildlife Service Coastal Delaware project leader for Bombay Hook and Prime Hook national wildlife refuges. The dune height is based on remnant dunes in the area, he said.\n\n\"We're crossing our fingers and praying we don't get a nor'easter or hurricane in the next five years,\" Rizzo said.\n\nThat will give thousands of sprigs of beach grass time to establish on the manmade dune and build resiliency.\n\nThe dune will taper into the adjacent marsh.\n\nThe area is one of the most dynamic along Delaware's coast. The remains of a bird viewing platform constructed less than a decade ago behind the dune, are now in deep water just off the beach. A series of studies found that manipulation of the area marsh over the last several decades kept it from keeping pace with sea level rise. Many of Delaware's coastal marshes are keeping pace with sea level rise by adding fractions of inches of decomposing plant matter year after year. Those marshes retreat naturally as waves cause the sand to over wash into the wetland and form a new beach just to the west. That didn't happen at Fowler Beach because the adjacent marsh flooded, the plants died and deep inlets were cut over the last several years. Rather than a beach, a mucky layer of exposed peat edged the shoreline.\n\nHurricane Sandy worsened the damage that had already occurred.\n\nThis massive marsh and beach restoration is designed as a demonstration project on coastal and marsh resilience in a refuge system. It is also designed to protect and restore thousands of acres of habitat at the refuge.\n\nRizzo said the project took two years to design, using sophisticated modeling to guide the marsh drainage work. Earlier this summer, crews started work on a plan to improve the drainage in the marsh system by clearing sand from the network of historic drainage channels.\n\nThe beach repairs could be completed as early as this spring with all of the work finished by October 2016, Wilson said.\n\nRizzo said the sand pumping contract is $14 million. Additional money will be spent to plant the rebuilt dune. The total project cost is $38 million from federal Sandy relief money.\n\nOther repair sites\n\nDelaware's other major Sandy repair projects are mostly complete, save for work on projects at two state wildlife refuges in Kent County.\n\nOne of the most iconic images after Hurricane Sandy in Delaware was of the damage at the north side of Indian River Inlet bridge. There, the approach road from the old bridge was destroyed by waves and storm surge – confirming the long-held fear that the old bridge was vulnerable and a new one needed.\n\nSince Sandy, both the approach road and the old bridge have been removed. State transportation contractors removed thousands of cubic yards of sand from the roadway and used it to rebuild the storm-flattened dune. In addition, they pounded steel-sheeting into the sand just east of the roadway to protect it from future storm damage. More sand was pumped from a bar in the inlet onto the north inlet beach to create a wider buffer for the new bridge approach road.\n\nElsewhere along the ocean coast, sand was pumped in to replace the losses at Rehoboth and Dewey beaches, Bethany and South Bethany and Fenwick Island. Total cost: $30 million.\n\nThe state received an additional $6.9 million for habitat restoration along the Delaware Bayshore.\n\nAt Mispillion Harbor, where the plan is to rebuild shorebird and horseshoe crab habitat by creating more sandy beach, state officials are ready to apply for state and federal permits.\n\n\"The whole point is to improve habitat for spawning horseshoe crabs and red knot\" shorebirds, said Karen Bennett, who administers the state's Delaware Bayshore initiative.\n\nThe existing rock wall at Mispillion Harbor will be raised three-feet higher than it is now to keep waves and storm high tides from topping it. An area that has breached in the past will be angled into an existing sand dune to prevent future breaching.\n\nThe idea is to recreate the habitat in the area as it looked in the 1940s and '50s, said Jeremey Ashe, the restoration project manager.\n\nSmall structures perpendicular to the rock wall will be built to help hold the sand in place, he said. The two final parts of the Mispillion project will be to fill an old ditch to create a tidal marsh and try a small, experimental project to create about two acres of shorebird roosting habitat in the old Fitzgerald Marsh to the west of the harbor.\n\nTo the north, at Milford Neck, the state, The Nature Conservancy and Delaware Wild Lands are working together to come up with a plan to restore the marsh to a more natural drainage system. Like most tidal wetlands in Delaware, the marshes at Milford Neck were cut with ditches to drain them and reduce mosquito populations.\n\nBennett said state officials know that coastal storms and flooding are inevitable so the idea with this project is to restore drainage so when flooding does happen, the water doesn't inundate the western edge of the marsh – the buffer between the marsh and the uplands. When that happens, saltwater kills the trees and vegetation, she said.\n\nAt the Ted Harvey State Wildlife Area east of Dover, state officials are planning a restoration of the existing impoundment, a manmade structure that holds water during times where birds are migrating through the area. The existing dike between the impoundment and Delaware Bay dates back to the 1960s, Ashe said.\n\nThe dike will be raised two to three feet to make it higher and less likely to be breached during coastal storms. A pumping system to raise and lower water levels will also be upgraded.\n\nAt Little Creek Wildlife Area, state officials are looking at how to make the impoundments there more storm resilient.The best strategy may be to create a buffer for future sea level rise but modeling work is still underway. The shoreline to the east is no longer a sandy beach and part of a restoration there, Ashe said, might eventually include restoration of a sand shoreline.\n\nAs a final state project, state wildlife officials are working with the state Department of Transportation to restore Port Mahon Road. The road ends at a boat launch ramp and parking lot but is especially vulnerable to storm and flood damage.\n\nFederal money to replace lost sand\n\nFor beaches alone, this breakdown of federal spending to replace sand losses from Sandy:\n\n509,000 cubic yards at Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach -- $9,172,794\n\n440,000 cubic yards at the north side of Indian River Inlet -- $6.6 million\n\n536,000 cubic yards at Bethany-South Bethany -- $7,832,731\n\n368,000 cubic yards at Fenwick Island -- $4,319,254\n\n22,000 cubic yards along the Delaware Bay at Lewes -- $752,420\n\nSource: Army Corps of Engineers\n\nReach Molly Murray at 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

LLC to buy and operate du Pont's estate in northern New Castle County. GRLLC is the limited liability company that owns the 100-year-old Granogue property.\n\nIrénée du Pont died on Jan. 16 at age 103. He was the great-great-grandson of DuPont Co. founder Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours. The acquisition continues a long history between Longwood Gardens and the du Pont family.\n\nThe Conservation Fund, a national nonprofit that's worked in all 50 states to protect 8.5 million acres of land, helped facilitate the deal.\n\nDetails of the agreement were not disclosed. Longwood officials declined to say how much they agreed to pay for the estate, which is 8 miles from the gardens near Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.\n\nLongwood Gardens is the most visited paid public garden in America. It saw record attendance last year with 1.61 million visitors.\n\nReal estate experts have estimated Granogue, widely considered the symbol of Delaware’s Chateau Country, is worth at least $50 million, likely more.\n\nThe estate will not be open to the public anytime soon, though it will play a crucial role in continuing the du Pont family's legacy of horticulture and land conservation.\n\n“Longwood Gardens is honored to play a part in the preservation of Granogue,” Paul Redman, president and CEO of Longwood Gardens, said in a statement.\n\n“We understand the important role this iconic landscape plays in our region’s ecology, community, and quality of life, and we look forward to working with our partners to ensure this treasure is stewarded for future generations to enjoy,” Redman added.\n\nIrénée du Pont:Patriarch of Delaware's du Pont family, dead at 103\n\nGranogue is from a bygone era\n\nThe stately Granogue estate, which sits on a hillside near Centreville off Smith Bridge Road and offers spectacular, panoramic views, is one of the largest privately owned open spaces left in northern New Castle County.\n\nThe mansion, with its milelong driveway, was built in 1923 and is a vestige of a bygone era. It has 11 bedrooms for family members and six for live-in employees. An oak-paneled music room is home to an Aeolian pipe organ that's similar to one at Longwood Gardens.\n\nDu Pont and Barbara, his wife of 77 years who died in 2021, were known for opening the grounds of their estate to local organizations for fundraisers, trail runs and mountain biking, as well as summer camps hosted by the Delaware Nature Society.\n\n\"I want people to enjoy this beauty,\" he said in a 2009 News Journal interview as he drove his 1918 Cadillac around the estate.\n\nGiving the public a peek at Granogue was a tradition started by his father, Irénée Sr., who with two brothers Pierre S. and Lammot du Pont served as president of the Wilmington-based DuPont Co.\n\nIn the 1930s, '40s and '50s, du Pont's father Irénée Sr. hosted spectacular fireworks displays held on the grounds of Granogue. Spectators lined fences and fields along Smith Bridge and Thompson's Bridge roads to watch the display. Autos often were parked for more than 2 miles around the property.\n\nAs early as 1979, du Pont Jr. began to worry about maintaining the sprawling site.\n\n\"We're hanging on by our fingernails,\" he told The News Journal. \"Right now, we're trying to keep this pile of rocks standing.\"\n\nIn the past century, some of the grand du Pont mansions and properties, such as Carousel Farm in Pike Creek, have been donated to New Castle County, turned into museums such as Nemours in Rockland and Eleutherian Mills in Wilmington, or quietly razed.\n\nInflation, taxes and family fortunes spread among several generations have made maintenance difficult.\n\nWhile area developers would have liked to get their hands on the prime real estate, representatives for du Pont began talks with Longwood in 2016 about preserving Granogue's rich natural heritage.\n\nStrong family ties\n\nThe du Pont family has long had a connection to Longwood.\n\nIrénée du Pont Jr.'s uncle was Longwood Gardens founder Pierre S. du Pont, who in 1906 purchased Longwood's original 202 acres to save a public arboretum the community adored.\n\nThe Longwood Foundation was established in 1937 to ensure the property, now a 1,100-acre botanical garden, would forever be open to the public.\n\nLongwood GardensTucks visitors into a warm flowerbed of Winter Wonder\n\nIn June 2000, the 200th anniversary of the du Pont's arrival on American soil in 1800 was celebrated at Longwood Gardens. More than 1,900 family members were expected to attend.\n\nThe CEO and president of Longwood Gardens said the nonprofit's goal of acquiring Granogue is in keeping with the spirit of why Longwood was founded.\n\n\"Here we are in 2023, we're invoking that same legacy and spirit of conservation to save this important piece of land that is connected to so many other parts of the Brandywine Valley that are already conserved,\" Redman said.\n\nThis agreement is \"a natural marriage\" that brings two properties with a familial connection even closer together, he added.\n\nHow will Longwood utilize Granogue?\n\nWhile detailed plans for how Longwood will use the property are not yet available, officials said their primary goal is to conserve the land.\n\nRedman said one of the best ways to preserve the mansion and land is to ensure a level of visitation that maintains the character of the historic landscape.\n\nLongwood Gardens travel guide 2023: What you need to know if you go\n\nLongwood's vision for Granogue is to preserve the property and conserve it in a manner so that the \"beautiful bucolic\" green space can be shared with visitors, Redman said.\n\nThere are no details yet for how the mansion will be used.\n\nRedman said Longwood and Granogue share a legacy of being gracious and welcoming to others, and they're committed to continuing that spirit of hospitality. How they'll achieve that is still to be determined.\n\nWhen can we tour Granogue?\n\nRedman said, \"We have a way to go\" before Longwood is ready to host the public at Granogue.\n\nLongwood first needs to complete the process of getting more familiar with the mansion and grounds to understand Granogue better. This includes assessing the plant communities and ecosystems on the estate, he said.\n\nGranogue also hasn't officially transferred to Longwood's ownership. That process can take up to a year, Redman explained.\n\nChateau Country:Delaware's Gilded Age: Here's a guide to 15 du Pont family estates\n\nBlaine Phillips, senior vice president of the Conservation Fund, said their organization's aim is for that transaction to go through before the end of this year.\n\nThe fund led negotiations between Longwood and GRLLC and helped facilitate the deal, Phillips said.\n\nA gem in Brandywine Valley\n\nThis agreement is a huge deal for the fund and for conservation in general, Phillips explained, because Granogue is \"the most important, unprotected big piece of property left in the Brandywine Valley.\"\n\nPeople have been talking about this property for decades, he added.\n\n\"What we have in the Brandywine Valley compares to or exceeds anything else around the country ... because of the scenic elements, the recreation elements, the historic elements and really the cultural landscape that defines this area,\" Phillips said.\n\nNew Castle County Executive Matt Meyer is calling Longwood's plan to own Granogue a major win for Delaware.\n\n“As a staunch supporter of green and open spaces, I join New Castle County residents as we celebrate the protection of such a vital piece of land that will now stand for generations as a part of Delaware’s history and heritage,\" Meyer said in a statement.\n\nHe continued, \"I want to extend our gratitude to the du Pont family who, in spite of increasing commercial pressure, chose to preserve this land for future generations.”\n\n'Dad supports this plan'\n\nGrace Engbring, daughter of Irénée “Brip” Jr. and Barbara “Barbie” du Pont, is a family representative for GRLLC.\n\nEngbring said her family never considered selling her parents' home to a developer.\n\nWhile she's still grieving the recent loss of her father, Grace said she's pleased his lavish estate will be in good hands with Longwood.\n\n\"Dad supports this plan wholeheartedly. He did. He knew every step of the way. He wasn't involved in the actual meetings or anything, but I was the mole. I kept him up to date,\" she said.\n\nTalks started in 2016\n\nAlthough Longwood Gardens will own and operate Granogue, the Mt. Cuba Center and the Longwood Foundation provided generous support to help fund the acquisition, Longwood officials explained.\n\nAdditionally, du Pont family members contributed funds to establish a permanent endowment for future operations and advancement of the vision for Granogue, they said.\n\nGRLLC began discussions in 2016 with Longwood Gardens and the Conservation Fund about the 1923 estate’s future.\n\nA preliminary study assessing current site conditions and encompassing site master planning was developed in 2018-2019, \"with a commitment for Granogue to remain a pastoral cultural landscape,'' Longwood said in a statement.\n\nLook for updates on new developments regarding this agreement between Longwood and GRLLC, and for future coverage of Longwood events, on Delaware Online.\n\nTo learn more about Longwood Gardens (1001 Longwood Road, near Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.), visit longwoodgardens.org or (610) 388-1000.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com and follow her on Twitter @pattytalorico.\n\nAndre Lamar is a features/lifestyle reporter.

He was 103.\n\nDu Pont was the great-great-grandson of DuPont Co. founder Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours who fled France for Delaware during the French Revolution and began building a vast family fortune by producing gunpowder along the banks of the Brandywine.\n\nHis father Irénée du Pont Sr., along with his father's two brothers Pierre S. du Pont, founder of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, and Lammot du Pont had each served as the Wilmington-based DuPont Co.'s president. They helped expand its interests from an explosives manufacturer to one of the world's largest chemical companies.\n\nIrénée du Pont Jr., who had eight sisters, was the youngest and only son of Irénée and Irene Sophie du Pont, who were second cousins.\n\nA graduate of Wilmington's Tower Hill School, he attended Dartmouth College and graduated in 1943 with a degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his father's and uncles' alma mater.\n\nHe was hired by \"the family business,\" as some du Ponts liked to call the DuPont Co., in 1946, by the late DuPont scientist Nathaniel C. Wyeth. Wyeth was the inventor of the plastic soda bottle and the older brother of famed Chadds Ford artist Andrew Wyeth.\n\nAs was the family tradition, Irénée Jr., known by his nickname \"Brip,\" worked his way up the company ladder. He learned the ropes and held various engineering and supervisory positions at plants in Arlington, New Jersey; Parkersburg, West Virginia, and Charleston, West Virginia.\n\nHe returned to Wilmington in 1953 and later served as the company's senior vice president before retiring in 1978.\n\nDu Pont told The News Journal in a 2000 interview that he declined all suggestions that he run the company.\n\n\"I as a stockholder would have objected to me as president,\" he said.\n\nDu Pont told The News Journal he had dyslexia and it would have kept him from doing the huge volume of reading needed to do the job well. \"I would have been a disaster. You've got to be a very astute and quick-witted person to take an executive level of leadership. It would have been in my financial interest not to go there.\"\n\nStill, du Pont was one of the last family members to reach one of the highest levels of management in the DuPont Co. The family who had led the DuPont Co. for most of the 20th century eventually ended its control in the late 1970s.\n\nLife at Granogue\n\nDu Pont was once considered one of the richest men in the world, according to various Forbes magazine rankings over the years. He brushed aside the reports and told The News Journal the $525 million net worth which Forbes attributed to him and his family in Montchanin in 1998 was based on money \"generated generations ago.\"\n\nWhen a News Journal reporter interviewed him in 2000, du Pont was more than delighted to show off the tag inside the blazer he was wearing. It wasn't from Brooks Brothers. He bought the jacket at Value City, which, at that time, was a well-known discount store.\n\nHe lived at Granogue, the hilltop estate and mansion with a mile-long driveway and 30 rooms in northern New Castle County, which can be seen along points of Smith Bridge Road. It is sometimes referred to as the symbol of Chateau Country, the name for Delaware's most exclusive region and for generations the home of extended members of the du Pont family.\n\nThe century-old house was built in 1923 by du Pont's father. The mansion has 11 bedrooms for family members and six for live-in employees. Walls are lined with paintings by family friends, like Maxfield Parrish, and Rembrandt Peale's original painting of DuPont founder Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours hangs over a hearth.\n\nDu Pont was proud of an oak-paneled music room, home to an Aeolian pipe organ housed in a chamber below the floor. The music is controlled by a computer, much like a player piano, but sometimes du Pont brought in musicians to play the organ. He enjoyed sharing the organ's music with others.\n\nHe and his wife Barbara also were known for opening the grounds of their estate to local organizations and groups for fundraisers.\n\nA 5K run and walk called Granogue & Bach were held in the 1990s to raise money for Brandywine Baroque. Musicians played Bach compositions for participants at the finish line. In recent years, the Beau Biden Foundation has hosted trail runs on the estate with more than 800 participants.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who attended the run when he was vice president, had raced motorbikes on the estate with Irénée when Biden was serving in the Senate. Biden's sister Valerie once lived on the Granogue property\n\nA passion for car collecting\n\nDu Pont told The News Journal he was a \"motorhead\" and enjoyed collecting motorcycles and automobiles which he stored in his 12-car garage.\n\nOver the years, his collection included everything from a 1980 two-door Chevette hatchback to a 1936 Oldsmobile coupe his father gave him on his 16th birthday.\n\nHe frequently brought his 1918 Cadillac to various events, including Winterthur Museum's annual Point to Point steeplechase races and to the Marshall Steam Museum at Auburn Valley State Park in Yorklyn.\n\nDu Pont found the car at a salvage yard in 1939 when he was a student at Dartmouth College. He said he paid $40 for it and joked he spent as much on immediate repairs. He said the car once was owned by actors Frank Fay and Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nDu Pont was known for upholding his family's legacy and served on DuPont's board of directors until 1990 and worked on various projects as a trustee for Wilmington University and Longwood Gardens, the former home of his Uncle Pierre.\n\nDespite the clannish nature of the family, another tradition du Pont had long upheld was never stepping foot on the Nemours estate of Alfred I. du Pont in Rockwood. It was due to a historic rift that happened a few years after cousins Pierre, Alfred and T. Coleman du Pont banded together to buy the DuPont Co. in 1902. Pierre and Alfred had a falling out about control and Alfred lost his role in the company.\n\nWhen Alfred built his Nemours estate, he installed a 10-foot stone wall topped with shards of broken glass to surround the majestic mansion inside. Supposedly, he said he built the wall with the glass shards around his estate “to keep out intruders, mainly of the name of du Pont,” according to Marquis James’s 1941 book \"Alfred I. duPont: The Family Rebel.\"\n\nIrénée Jr. told The News Journal in 2000 that his father was on his brother Pierre's side and gave his children strict instructions to never step foot inside the Nemours gates.\n\nDu Pont obeyed for years, but apparently changed his mind, and in 2008 he told The News Journal \"it's a great place — if you like that kind of thing.\"\n\nHe was predeceased by his eight older sisters; his daughter, Susanne; his son, Irénée du Pont, III; and Barbara, his wife of 77 years.\n\nDu Pont is survived by his daughter-in-law, Eugenie Collison du Pont, and his daughters Irene Light (Tom) of Lime Rock, Connecticut; Cynthia Tobias (Terry) of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania; Sally Quinn (Rob) of Winchester, Massachusetts; Grace Engbring (Paul) of Telluride, Colorado; 13 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held at a later date. Burial will be private.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com and follow her on Twitter @pattytalorico\n\nMore Delaware news\n\nMore:Longwood Gardens tucks visitors into a warm flowerbed of Winter Wonder\n\nMore:Fire destroys 113-year-old building in downtown Laurel beyond repair early Wednesday\n\nMore:Open Call: Serafin, Music School a testament to the power of collaboration", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/02/02/these-15-du-pont-family-estates-offer-glimpse-at-delawares-rich-past/69847345007/", "title": "These 15 du Pont family estates offer glimpse at Delaware's rich past", "text": "Delaware's prominent and influential du Pont family, one of the wealthiest in America, has long been mindful of preservation and conservation.\n\nThe late Irénée du Pont Jr.'s choice to offer Longwood Gardens the opportunity to buy his spectacular and historic Chateau Country Granogue mansion and its 505 acres is continuing the family tradition of ensuring the estate would remain as open space and not be developed.\n\nDetails of the agreement were not disclosed, although real estate experts have estimated the estate is worth at least $50 million.
