The Chicago-based airline added that it was anticipating residual delays and working to get customers to their destinations.\n\n\"Due to a technology issue, we are holding United mainline flights at their departure airports,\" United Airlines said in an earlier statement. \"Safety is our top priority.\"\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he was briefed on United Airlines’ \"internal tech outage\" and noted that the FAA was in contact with the company’s systems operations team.\n\n\"The issue was specific to United’s operations and is unrelated to the broader air traffic control system,\" Duffy said in a statement on X.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

The agency said it was aware of the technology issue disrupting the airline's operations.\n\nBy 10:25 p.m. ET, FlightAware, which monitors air travel, showed that 1,038, or 34%, of United flights, had been delayed on Aug. 6.\n\n\"Some delays may continue as they work through the recovery process,\" the FAA told USA TODAY. \"We’ve offered full support to help address their flight backlog and remain in close contact with United.\"\n\nThe outage comes weeks after Alaska Airlines grounded all its flights for about three hours due to an IT outage, the second time in just over a year. In April 2024, Alaska grounded its entire fleet due to an issue with the system that calculates the weight and balance of its planes.\n\nTechnology issue not related to cybersecurity concerns\n\nUnited Airlines said the issue was related to its Unimatic system, which \"houses information about each flight that is then fed to other systems, including those that calculate weight and balance and track flight times.\"\n\nThe outage began at around 6:12 p.m. ET and was resolved within a few hours, according to the airline. The company added that it was treating the problem as a controllable delay and paid customer expenses, such as hotels, when applicable.\n\nThe airline noted that the outage was not associated with \"recent concerns about cybersecurity in the airline industry.\"\n\nTravelers express frustration amid flight disruptions\n\nA system outage was causing flight disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport and other airports, with some travelers delayed for hours, the Newark Airport said in a post on X. The airport urged travelers to check with their airline on the status of their flights.\n\nUnited Airlines, in its responses on social media to frustrated customers, wrote: \"We're aware of the system error at this time and are working on a fix to have you on your way as soon as possible. We understand that this disruption has caused frustrations during your travel and appreciate your continued patience.\"\n\nTravelers expressed their anger with the airline, with one posting: \"Another ground system failure at @EWRairport has me locked on the tarmac for nearing 2 hours now…perhaps look for another hub @united.\"\n\nAround 9:30 p.m. ET, FlightAware.com was reporting departure delays of an average of 45 minutes and all inbound flights were being held at their point of origin until 10 p.m.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/08/winter-storm-weather-updates-snow-forecast/77537885007/", "title": "Winter weather coming for more: Warnings issued, more snow ...", "text": "Another major winter storm is expected to slam portions of the central and eastern U.S. this week, with heavy snow and strong winds threatening to induce dangerous travel conditions, knock out power and ground flights, forecasters warned.\n\nUnlike the deadly storm that barreled over the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions days ago, the incoming system will first bring snow to the South before swinging toward the Northeast, where it could bring flurries to Washington, D.C., and other major cities.\n\nBeginning Wednesday night, the storm system will move over Texas, Arkansas and the Tennessee Valley, bringing 4 to 8 inches of snow to a portion of the south-central and southeastern U.S. that has experienced bitterly cold temperatures from a blast of Arctic air.\n\n\"In places that don't get snow or ice very often, such as Austin, Dallas, Little Rock, and Nashville, it will be a big deal,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Tom Kines told USA TODAY earlier this week, noting that cities like Dallas could see their most significant snowfalls in several years.\n\nAs the storm pushes east, forecasters expect it will bring snow to Nashville, Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, as it begins passing over the Appalachians early this weekend. Major airports throughout the central and eastern U.S. could see delays and cancellations.\n\nWinter storm warnings issued across south-central US ahead of snow\n\nWinter storm warnings in northeastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana are set to take effect early Thursday morning and expire Friday afternoon.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Dallas – where the yearly historical snowfall average is 1.6 inches – said the storm could dump 2 to 4 inches of snow in the city and the surrounding area, with some isolated snowfall amounts reaching 8 inches.\n\nIf Dallas gets half a foot of snow, it would be among the \"top-five snowfalls on record,\" according to AccuWeather.\n\n\"Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will likely become slick and hazardous,\" warned the weather service office in Shreveport, Louisiana. \"The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic power outages.

Scenarios vary widely depending on how much momentum the storm keeps up as it barrels over the Appalachians.\n\n\"These scenarios range from the storm continuing on nearly straight to the east with little (or no) snow reaching the central Appalachians and upper mid-Atlantic to a storm strengthening and turning northward with an extensive zone of major snow and ice reaching through the mid-Atlantic and into southeastern New England from Saturday to early Sunday,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Paul Pastelok in an online forecast.\n\n(This story has been updated to add additional information.)\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/11/25/thanksgiving-weather-forecast-winter-storm/76563196007/", "title": "Thanksgiving weather forecast: Winter storm could affect travel", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on weather and Thanksgiving travel for Monday, Nov. 25. For the latest news on snow, storms and Thanksgiving travel, view USA TODAY's updates for Tuesday, Nov. 26.\n\nWinter weather could cause travel delays and disruptions this week as millions of people hit the roads and skies for Thanksgiving.\n\nIn the West, heavy rain and snow were forecast to slam much of California on Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. That's because of \"another atmospheric river event\" that will bring copious rainfall to coastal and valley locations and 3 to 4 feet of snow to the Sierra, forecasters said.\n\nThe storm will move into the Rockies by midweek: \"One tricky travel area will be in and around the Denver area as snow spreads across the area on Wednesday, where 1-3 inches of snow is expected to fall,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Emma Belscher said in an online forecast.\n\nThe forecast for Thanksgiving Day \"doesn't look great for much of the East,\" Weather.com said. It forecast \"possible thunderstorms in the Southeast to wintry mix and slush in the Great Lakes, to a little bit of everything in the Northeast and New England.\"\n\nMidwest snow expected on Monday\n\nThe weather service also said Monday that a pair of low-pressure systems moving through the Upper Midwest will generate several inches of snow over Michigan's upper peninsula Monday, while show showers were expected across the greater Upper Midwest and Lower Great Lakes.\n\nElsewhere, Monday's mild weather will be short-lived in the central U.S.: \"Temperatures will remain above average for one last day from the Southern Plains into the Midwest before a strong cold front pushes through on Tuesday,\" the weather service said in its Monday morning forecast.\n\nThanksgiving storm targeting the East\n\nLater in the week, a new storm packing the \"potential for accumulating snow\" is set to take shape across the eastern portion of the United States on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, according to AccuWeather meteorologists.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, two scenarios could play out:\n\nThe first scenario involves a slow-moving storm that could mean longer-lasting consequences from the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys through the Northeast.\n\nThe second scenario sends the same storm farther south and off the Carolina coast through Thanksgiving, which would mean a less intense storm with rounds of rain and even snow from the Tennessee Valley eastward to the East Coast.\n\nCharlotte airport workers on strike over low wages\n\nAdding to the travel chaos, service workers at Charlotte Douglas International Airport went on strike Monday morning at the start of the busy Thanksgiving week to protest unfair labor practices and demand higher wages.\n\nOfficials with Service Employees International Union announced the strike by workers employed by American Airlines contractors, ABM and Prospect, in a statement obtained by USA TODAY on Monday after the workers on Friday voted to authorize their strike at the busy airport.\n\n\"The (employees) are paid so little that they struggle to secure basic housing,\" SEIU officials wrote in the release. \"Some have become homeless, sleep in their cars, or cram their families into rented rooms, while others face the looming threat of eviction.\"\n\n– Natalie Neysa Alund, USA TODAY\n\nThanksgiving weather update: Will it snow? Foul forecast looms over travel\n\nTravel records are also in forecast\n\nAnything that jams up flights would be coming at a historically bad time.\n\nLast week, the Transportation Security Administration said it expects to see its busiest Thanksgiving travel period on record, estimating its agents will screen 18.3 million people from Tuesday through Dec. 2. That would represent a 6% increase from 2023.\n\nPassenger volumes have reached record highs in 2024; there has been an increase of 17% since 2022, the TSA said in a statement. TSA Administrator David Pekoske said the 10 busiest travel days in the TSA's history have all occurred in 2024, adding that \"we anticipate that trend to continue.\"\n\nLow gas prices could drive record travel\n\nAAA projects 79.9 million people will travel 50 miles or more from their homes for Thanksgiving from Tuesday to Dec. 2. That represents 1.7 million more travelers than last year and 2 million more than in 2019.\n\n“Thanksgiving is the busiest holiday for travel, and this year we’re expecting to set new records across the board, from driving to flying and cruising,” said Stacey Barber, Vice President of AAA Travel.\n\nLow gas prices are expected to fuel record travel.

In Arkansas, the National Weather Service had issued a tornado emergency, the highest warning possible, as a \"large and destructive tornado” hit Lake City, Arkansas, and surrounding areas in the northeastern part of the state in the evening.\n\nDozens of tornado watches and warnings remain in effect Wednesday night from northeastern Texas to Ohio, including Indianapolis, as a major storm is hitting the Lower Ohio Valley and Mid-South. By the afternoon, severe weather was being felt across the middle of the country, with hundreds of flight delays, tens of thousands of power outages, and crews examining damage from possible tornadoes.\n\nA dire forecast in central US this week: You've never seen rain like this\n\nThis is just the start of a daylong rain event that could be disastrous, experts warn, using words such as \"catastrophic,\" \"generational,\" and \"life-threatening\" to describe the forecast. Parts of the mid-South, including areas of Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky, could see upwards of 15 inches of rain by Sunday.\n\n\"The forecast heavy rainfall in this event has a return interval of anywhere from 25 to 100 years. In other words, a heavy rainfall event of this magnitude falling within 4 days is an event that happens once in a generation to once in a lifetime,\" said the weather service office in Newark, Arkansas. \"Historic rainfall totals and impacts are possible.\"\n\nMore than a dozen tornadoes were reported across Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center. The center reported one person injured in Stoddard, Missouri, when a home was destroyed by a tornado, and four others injured after structures were damaged in Gage, Kentucky.\n\nAn EF-1 tornado that hit Vernon County, Missouri, around 12:30 p.m. caused widespread damage, knocking over “multiple semi trucks” on Interstate 49 and eight train cars, according to the weather service office in Springfield, Missouri.\n\nAmong several dozen reports of large hail, baseball-sized hail was reported in five locations across Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee.\n\nMore than 480,000 power outages were reported across the U.S. just before 2 a.m. Thursday.

This is a rare, high-impact, and potentially devastating event,\" the statement said. \"Heavy rainfall will likely lead to widespread river, flash, and areal flooding that could cause severe disruptions especially along and north of I-40.\"\n\nWhere will it rain the hardest?\n\nThe epicenter of the rain and floods is expected to be in the mid-South, forecasters said. Some of the heaviest rain is projected to fall along the Ohio River between Kentucky and Illinois, where the weather service in Paducah, Kentucky, warned of \"catastrophic\" flooding.\n\nThe major rivers most likely to have significant water level rises include the Ohio, Wabash, White, St. Francis, Kentucky, and Tennessee, according to AccuWeather.\n\nMeteorologists say record flooding is possible in Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and Mississippi.\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nOwasso, Oklahoma, hit by possible tornado\n\nA suspected tornado hit the Oklahoma city of Owasso on Wednesday, damaging buildings, topping utility poles, and uprooting trees.\n\nThe path of destruction stretched about 11 miles in the city outside Tulsa, and radar indicated a possible tornado had formed, according to a statement from the city government.

Meanwhile, departures at the airport were delayed by an average of over two hours \"due to thunderstorms,\" according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nIn Texas, the FAA said a temporary ground stop was issued at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Nearby departures at Dallas Love Field were delayed by over half an hour due to the potent storm system.\n\nConfirmed tornado touches down in Missouri\n\nA confirmed tornado touched down in west-central Missouri on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe twister was measured moving at 50 mph northeast of Adrian, a city near the Kansas state line.\n\n\"Flying debris will be dangerous to those caught without shelter. Mobile homes will be damaged or destroyed. Damage to roofs, windows, and vehicles will occur. Tree damage is likely,\" said the weather service in Pleasant Hill, Missouri.\n\nSchool closings\n\nA late-season winter storm impacting states in the northern Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes regions has led school districts to cancel classes on Wednesday as bands of heavy snow and ice make travel dangerous.\n\nDozens of schools in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota switched to virtual learning, delayed the start of class or closed schools altogether.\n\nThese states, which have had heavy snowfall since the weekend, could get 8 inches more of snow, with higher amounts possible in some areas.\n\n\"Gusty winds may lead to areas of blowing snow and very difficult travel conditions,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nMap of active tornado watches, flood watches\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2019/01/25/government-shutdown-flight-delays-3-airports-due-staffing-new-york-new-jersey-philadelphia/2676807002/", "title": "Government shutdown: Flight delays in at 4 airports due to 'staffing'", "text": "At least four major airports suffered flight delays Friday because of an increase in air traffic control employees calling in sick amid the government shutdown, which ended Friday afternoon after 35 days thanks to a short-term deal.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration’s flight delay map had showed significant departure delays at Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey, Friday morning. Lesser delays also showed at New York LaGuardia earlier in the day. By early afternoon, “staffing” delays had dissipated at Philadelphia but had popped up in Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport.\n\nThe FAA listed “staffing” as the cause and had issued a “traffic management” initiative to slow down the rates of departures. Typically, that “metering” effort helps controllers space out planes to keep the pace of either arrivals or departures from exceeding their capacity.\n\nThe FAA confirmed it had initiated procedures to adjust flights because of an increase in sick calls by controllers.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\n“We have experienced a slight increase in sick leave at two facilities,” a spokesman for the FAA said in a statement to USA TODAY. “We’ve mitigated the impact by augmenting staffing, rerouting traffic, and increasing spacing between aircraft when needed. The results have been minimal impacts to efficiency while maintaining consistent levels of safety in the national airspace system. The public can monitor air traffic at fly.faa.gov and they should check with airline carriers for more information.”\n\nAt one point Friday morning, the FAA site had listed departure delays averaging more than an hour at both Newark and Philadelphia. The Philadelphia delays had dissipated later in the morning, according to the FAA site. Just before noon ET, LaGuardia remained a trouble spot, with delays on arriving flights averaging nearly 90 minutes. Atlanta's delays, which popped up after noon, were more than an hour. Delays persisted at Newark as of 12:55 p.m. ET, though the cause was no longer staffing but \"wind,\" according to the FAA.\n\nFlyers could face sporadic delays at those airports, and possibly others, throughout the day.\n\nThe delays were caused by an insufficient number of air traffic controllers in two regional facilities near Washington, D.C., and Jacksonville, Fla., according to the FAA’s Air Traffic Control System Command Center. Those facilities help coordinate the thousands of flights that fly through an area of the East Coast that stretches from Florida to Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nThe news of staffing issues comes two days after leaders of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union which represents the controllers, held a press conference on the steps of Capitol Hill arguing that the now-ended shutdown was harming the safety of air travel in the United States.\n\nAir traffic controllers have been working without pay since Dec. 22. They have received paychecks during that time, but each check read $0.00, said Bill Striffler, the union’s representative at Newark airport.\n\n“We have a growing concern for the safety and security of our members, our airlines and the traveling public due to the government shutdown,” the union said in a statement issued prior to the end of the shutdown. “In our risk averse industry, we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break.”\n\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders said President Trump has been briefed on the airport delays.\n\n“The President has been briefed and we are monitoring the ongoing delays at some airports. We are in regular contact with officials at the Department of Transportation and the FAA.”\n\nThe travel troubles come a day after a trio of airline CEOs sounded alarms that the shutdown had reached a tipping point. The CEOs of American, Southwest and JetBlue specifically warned about the potential for flights to be delayed because a shortage of air traffic controllers would require more spacing between flights.\n\nOne major airline, Air Canada, issued a rebooking waiver for customers headed to Newark and LaGuardia because of “Air Traffic Control restrictions.” So far, none of the biggest U.S. airlines were waiving fees, though they said they were monitoring the situation.\n\n“We haven’t experienced significant impacts to our operation or schedule at this point, but continue to monitor and are working closely with the FAA,\" American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said to USA TODAY before the shutdown-ending deal was announced. \"Our goal is to minimize disruptions for our customers and our team members taking care of our customers. In this spirit, we urge that the federal government be re-opened before shutdown impacts begin to escalate.”\n\nJetBlue Airways passengers traveling Friday may experience delays or longer-than-normal flight times due to air traffic control staffing shortages, spokesman Philip Stewart said. Customers should check their flight status at jetblue.com or on the airline's mobile app, he said.\n\nDelta Air Lines said about 200 flights at LaGuardia and other airports in the Northeast were delayed Friday morning due to the FAA's ground delay program.\n\n\"Delta is working to reaccomodate customers to their destinations and encourages customers traveling on Friday to check delta.com or the Fly Delta App for their current flight status,'' spokesman Drake Castañeda said.\n\nLabor officials also began to weigh in Friday on the staffing-related issues with controllers, saying that they had already sounded the alarm for potential harm to aviation from the shutdown.\n\n\"This is exactly what AFA and other aviation unions have been warning would happen,” Sara Nelson, president of Association of Flight Attendants that represents about 50,000 attendants at numerous airlines, said in a statement.\n\n“The aviation system depends on the safety professionals who make it run,” she added. “They have been doing unbelievably heroic work even as they are betrayed by the government that employs them. They are fatigued, worried, and distracted – but they won't risk our safety. So the planes will stay on the ground. This is anything but a sick out - it is only about our safety and the air traffic controllers' absolute commitment to it.”\n\nContributing: David Jackson and Dawn Gilbertson of USA TODAY and Christopher Maag of The Record of Bergen County, New Jersey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2025/09/19/dallas-radar-outage-flight-delays-diversions/86246959007/", "title": "Radar outage prompts flight delays in Dallas similar to Newark ...", "text": "AI-assisted summary A telecommunications outage caused the FAA to slow air traffic into the Dallas Fort Worth area.\n\nFlights to Dallas Love Field and Dallas Fort Worth International were held at their departure points, with some diversions.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration slowed air traffic into the Dallas Fort Worth area after a telecommunications outage hindered air traffic controllers.\n\n\"The FAA is slowing flights at Dallas Love Field and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport due to a reported local telephone company equipment issue that does not involve FAA equipment.

If the impasse persists by the Sept. 30 expiration date, parts of the government may shut down.\n\nA partial shutdown could negatively impact the country's travel economy, according to the U.S. Travel Association, which estimates a loss of $1 billion every week. During this time, federal agencies and services not considered \"essential\" must pause working, such as national parks, while others, including TSA officers, will continue.\n\n\"What we've seen in the past when the government shuts down is that airports slow down and our economy slows down with it,\" said Erik Hansen, senior vice president of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association.\n\nA shutdown typically doesn't heavily affect airports or airlines, but could still inconvenience travelers.

Air passengers should still be able to continue with their flights during a partial government shutdown.\n\nThose workers who screen at airport security checkpoints, give flight clearance, and verify at border control are deemed essential, so they are still required to work. Instead, a shutdown puts federal funding on hold for agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Security Administration, and Customs and Border Protection.

Then Trump deployed California and Texas Guard troops, but the Oregon judge stopped all federal troops from entering.\n\nA similar standoff also was unfolding in Chicago.\n\nHere's what to know about the National Guard deployments.\n\nTrump's Portland deployment sets up of legal fight\n\nTrump's first attempt to go after Portland demonstrators was Sept. 28: he ordered 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the region for an initial 60 days, according to court documents.\n\nThe troops, he said, would \"protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists\" and would use \"Full Force, if necessary,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nAfter Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, filed suit, a federal judge suspended the deployment Oct. 4.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, ruled the deployment was unnecessary because the demonstrations did not amount to a \"rebellion,\" and law enforcement was capable of handling the protests without military intervention.\n\nNational Guard Whac-A-Mole\n\nThe Trump administration then took up a new strategy: switch states.\n\nHours after the judge barred the Oregon troops, he tapped California guardsmen to take on the same job. Early Oct. 5, about 100 California National Guard troops arrived at the Portland Air National Guard base, followed by another 99 guardsmen that afternoon, according to court documents. That prompted California Gov. Gavin Newsom to join Kotek's lawsuit in an attempt to take back control of his state's troops.\n\nThe administration also ordered 400 members of the Texas National Guard to \"perform federal protection missions where needed, including in the cities of Portland and Chicago,\" according to a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nHegseth's order to the Texas National Guard – which came with Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's permission – notably left open that the troops could be deployed \"where needed.\"\n\nImmergut then issued an order temporarily halting all federal National Guard deployments to Portland.\n\nTrump appealed that ruling Oct. 6, seeking to wrest control of those troops.\n\nJoseph Nunn, a legal expert at the Brennan Center who specializes in National Guard deployments, said at the heart of Immergut's ruling was \"whether the facts on the ground justify deploying troops.\"\n\n\"The fundamental problem for the Trump administration in Portland is that what they are saying is happening in Portland simply isn’t true,\" Nunn said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said of Immergut's ruling: \"With all due respect to that judge, I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law.\"\n\n\"The ICE facility has been really under siege by these anarchists outside,\" Leavitt said. \"We are very confident in the president's legal authority to do this.\"\n\n'Chipocalypse now'\n\nWhile the battle over Portland played out, Trump also ordered 300 Illinois National Guardsmen into Chicago on Oct. 4. He had also threatened an Illinois deployment in taunting comments and social media posts, including one that read \"Chipocalypse now\" in a reference to the Vietnam War-era film \"Apocalypse Now\" that depicted Trump in the foreground as the lieutenant colonel from the movie with helicopters flying over a burning Chicago skyline behind him.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, sued Oct. 6 to stop the deployment.\n\n\"Let me be clear – Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation's cities,\" Pritzker said at a news conference.\n\nTrump deploys military to multiple cities\n\nThe Trump administration also sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, DC, earlier this year. Both deployments drew similar lawsuits from Democratic leaders.\n\nIn the nation's capital, more than 2,000 troops from the city's own National Guard force and other states have been deployed since mid-August. Those troops also have been assigned to pick up trash and help out with soup kitchens, among other \"beautification\" projects. Brian Schwalb, the city's attorney general, filed suit in early September to end the deployment.\n\nThe Trump administration sent about 5,000 California National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to control possible violence amid demonstrations against a wave of deportations. All but a few hundred of the soldiers – some of whom were sent to Portland over the weekend – have gone home.\n\nA judge later ruled the deployment was illegal and violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids National Guard members acting on federal orders from carrying out law enforcement functions. The Trump admistration is appealing that ruling.\n\nTrump also has deployed troops to fight crime in Memphis, Tennessee – with the consent of the state's Republican governor – and to assist immigration enforcement agents at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump's use of National Guard called 'unprecedented'\n\nNunn, from the Brennan Center, said Trump's wielding of the National Guard is \"unprecedented in American history.\"\n\n\"The president seems to want the U.S. military to spend a lot more time pointing their weapons at Americans than defending Americans,\" he said. \"That is a dramatic shift from how we have always done things in the United States.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/10/09/trump-national-guard-portland-chicago/86599000007/", "title": "Trump's National Guard deployments in Chicago, Portland face ...", "text": "CHICAGO – Attorneys for the states of Oregon and Illinois argued in court Thursday, Oct. 9, that President Donald Trump's recent deployment of National Guard troops was unwarranted, as legal battles over the mobilization of soldiers to blue cities played out simultaneously.\n\nIn Chicago, a federal judge decided to grant in part Illinois' request to block the deployment of troops to the nation's third-largest city. A government lawyer argued violent clashes between protesters and federal agents justified the president marshaling guardsmen to Chicago. An attorney representing Illinois accused the government of exaggerating the facts on the ground.\n\n\"DHS’ account of events are simply unreliable,\" said U.S. District Judge April M. Perry, explaining why she was ruling in favor of Illinois attorneys and against the Department of Homeland Security’s move to call troops to Chicago.\n\nPerry referenced a number of recent legal rulings against the Trump administration in federal court in Chicago: \"In the last 48 hours, four separate, unrelated legal decisions all cast significant doubt on DHS credibility and assessment of what’s happening on the streets of Chicago.\"\n\nIt’s unclear how soon National Guard troops would have to adjust their movements in response to Perry’s ruling. The judge said she would issue a full written opinion on Oct. 10.\n\nTrump’s lawyers have indicated that they don’t believe Perry’s ruling would actually matter, arguing that the president’s decision is not subject to judicial review.\n\nIn California, a federal appeals court heard arguments centered on a lower court's order that prevented the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland. The panel's conservative majority appeared skeptical of the state's arguments and said the president is entitled to deference in determining when troops are necessary.\n\nThe legal battles come as National Guard troops began patrolling an immigration facility in Broadview, Illinois, a village about 12 miles west of downtown Chicago. The facility has been the site of protests against aggressive ICE raids in the city, with occasional clashes erupting between federal agents and demonstrators.\n\nState and local officials have pushed back and accused the White House of manufacturing a crisis to justify sending soldiers into Democratic strongholds. Trump characterized the cities as in crisis and accused leaders of impeding immigration operations.\n\nMeanwhile, leaders in Memphis announced Tennessee National Guard troops will begin patrolling the city on Friday, Oct. 10. Unlike the governors of Ilinois and Oregon, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee welcomed the federal intervention.\n\nJudge in Chicago presses federal government on deployment\n\nU.S. District Judge April M. Perry, a Biden appointee, questioned the government's lawyers on how much latitude Trump has in mobilizing federal troops, their definition of a \"rebellion\" and what soldiers will be doing in Chicago.\n\nJustice Department attorney Eric Hamilton said there doesn't have to be an \"actual rebellion\" for the president to mobilize the National Guard, adding that there only needs to be \"a danger of rebellion.\" Perry said the government's definition of the word was broad.\n\nHamilton also could not precisely say what troops would do or where they would be stationed in Chicago, drawing more skepticism from the judge.\n\nPerry said it wasn’t clear to her that the troops' mission would be limited to protecting federal agents or the immigration facility in Broadview, Illinois, where anti-ICE protests have been concentrated.\n\n\"I am very much struggling with where this would ever stop,\" Perry said.\n\nPerry is expected to rule on whether to block the federal government's use of National Guard troops in Chicago.\n\nJudges appear skeptical of Oregon's case against Trump's troop deployment\n\nIn San Francisco, the three judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared skeptical of Oregon's arguments that Trump's deployment of National Guard troops was unlawful and unwarranted.\n\nThe judges pressed Stacy Chaffin, who is representing Oregon, on the size of the protests and flare ups of violence in recent weeks. The judges also noted that the law grants deference to the president in determining when troop deployments are necessary to protect federal agents and property.\n\n\"The president gets to direct his resources as he deems fit, and it just seems a little counterintuitive to me that the city of Portland can come in and say 'No, you need to do it differently,'\" said Judge Ryan Nelson, a Trump appointee.\n\nChaffin argued that while that may be true, Trump has consistently mischaracterized and exaggerated the protests in Portland.\n\n\"The president is entitled to great deference, but that deference has a limit,\" Chaffin told the court. \"And that limit is this case, where the president's determinations are untethered from reality.\"\n\nEric McArthur, an attorney representing the federal government, asked the court to overrule the lower court's order preventing National Guard troops from entering Portland. He accused the state of downplaying violence at demonstrations.\n\n\"These are violent people and if at any point we let down our guard there is a serious risk of ongoing violence,\" he told the court.\n\nLawsuits pile up against Trump's deployments\n\nThe Trump administration is battling four lawsuits over National Guard deployments to Democratic-led cities, including Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Portland and Chicago. So far, judges in Los Angeles and Portland ruled the deployments to be illegal and unwarranted.\n\nIn the Portland case, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, blocked an initial deployment of Oregon National Guards troops before the White House announced it would send guardsmen from California and Texas. The attempt to sidestep Immergut's initial order led her to prohibit any troops from entering Portland.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed the decision to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has previously ruled in its favor. The appeals court in June overruled a lower court's finding that the deployment of troops to Los Angeles over the summer was illegal, citing flare ups of violence and property damage during anti-ICE protests.\n\nIn Illinois, state and local leaders this week sued the Trump administration over its deployment of troops. U.S. District Judge April M. Perry at an emergency hearing allowed the deployment to move forward but warned that any troop action before an Oct. 9 hearing could be used as evidence against the Trump administration.\n\nTrump, Democratic officials clash amid tensions over ICE, National Guard\n\nTrump said Portland was \"war-ravaged\" and described Chicago as \"the worst and most dangerous city in the world.\" City and state officials have challenged the president's characterizations and claimed the rhetoric was being used to justify a mobilization of troops.\n\nIn Portland, a judge appointed by the president said anti-ICE protests were small and mostly peaceful. She said Trump's description of Portland being under siege by radical terrorists was \"untethered to the facts.\"\n\nIn Chicago, larger protests erupted after Trump launched an immigration enforcement blitz in the city, leading to increasingly aggressive operations. One raid saw masked federal agents repelling from Black Hawk helicopters and wrecking an apartment building. In the Logan Square neighborhood, a school held recess indoors after federal officers deployed a chemical agent nearby.\n\nAt protests, federal authorities used rubbed bullets and pepper spray to clamp down on demonstrations in Chicago. This week, groups of nonprofits, journalists, protesters and a pastor filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration saying federal agents responded to demonstrations \"with a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians.\"\n\nTrump cabinet officials have defended the tactics employed by federal law enforcement, saying they are carrying out the president's mass deportation campaign and alleging that agents were under constant threat of attacks.\n\n\"It's an extremely dangerous situation and unprecedented,\" said Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem in an appearance on \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/10/trump-national-guard-illinois-condemned-oklahoma-kevin-stitt-national-governors-association/86621747007/", "title": "Oklahoma Gov.

Greg Abbott offered to turn over control of them to the administration.\n\nOn Thursday, however, an Illinois federal judge temporarily blocked Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in the state for 14 days.\n\n“I find that allowing the National Guard to deploy will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants have started,” U.S. District Judge April Perry said.\n\n“I was surprised that Governor Abbott sent troops from Texas to Illinois,” Stitt told the Times. “Abbott and I sued the Biden administration when the shoe was on the other foot, and the Biden administration was trying to force us to vaccinate all of our soldiers and force masks across the country.”\n\nStitt said he believes more Republican governors share his views.\n\n“Maybe you just haven’t asked the right ones,” he said.\n\nThis story was produced as part of a partnership between NOTUS and Oklahoma Watch.\n\nOklahoma Watch, at oklahomawatch.org, is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that covers public-policy issues facing the state.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/06/trump-invoke-insurrection-act-if-necessary/86555308007/", "title": "Trump says he would invoke the Insurrection Act 'if it was necessary'", "text": "WASHINGTON ‒ President Donald Trump said he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act to send the military into cities if courts block his deployment of National Guard troops.\n\n“I’d do it if it was necessary.

If I had to enact it, I'd do that,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Oct. 6.\n\nThe Insurrection Act, invoked only 30 times in American history, gives the president the power to deploy U.S. armed forces to suppress rebellions and civil unrest when federal laws are being obstructed.\n\nTrump's remarks come as his deployment of federal troops to protect federal buildings and crack down on crime has faced setbacks in court and invited new legal challenges from Democrats.\n\n\"If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I'd do that,\" Trump said of the Insurrection Act. \"I want to make sure people aren't killed.

Most recently, troops have deployed to Portland, Oregon and are expected to deploy to Chicago.\n\nThe Trump administration has already signaled an unwillingness to allow dissent in the ranks. At a recent gathering of generals, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lambasted \"decades of decay\" at the Pentagon and said that new measures would weed out political correctness among the world's most powerful armed forces.\n\n\"If the words I'm speaking today are making your heart sink,\" Hegseth told hundreds of generals. \"Then you should do the honorable thing and resign.\"\n\nVets rally around the country\n\nHughes and other Chicago-area veterans are just a chapter in About Face’s national efforts to rally troops to refuse what they view as Trump’s \"unlawful orders\" to deploy to American cities.\n\nIn Washington, DC, the group members were arrested protesting the deployment of soldiers to Los Angeles; outside military bases, including Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune, they’ve set up billboards questioning if supporting immigration agents is what soldiers signed up; and as Trump threatened to send troops to Baltimore, members rallied against the planned potential deployment.\n\n\"A lot of vets out there are feeling really devastated right now to see everything they had felt they signed up to protect crumble,\" said About Face Organizing Director Brittany Ramos DeBarros. But, \"there's still an opportunity for us to stand up for the values we signed up for.\"\n\nDeBarros said the local chapter organizations are staging protests around the country, trying to spread information about what options troops facing deployment have and eventually develop more legal avenues for troops to claim conscientious objection.\n\n\"I know there are thousands and thousands of vets out there who would agree with us but haven’t heard of us,\" said DeBarros, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. \"I want people to know the door is open and there’s a community here that will have your back.\"\n\nDeBarros said the organization has about 2,000 members nationwide at the moment, but that hundreds of new members have joined in recent months. Among them are active-duty soldiers, said the former Army captain, who resigned from her position in 2018 after being investigated by the military for speaking out against the war in Afghanistan.\n\nCan soldiers claim conscientious objection?\n\nSoldiers do have at least one path to resisting orders to deploy: Conscientious objection. The process refers to soldiers who won’t fight based on moral or religious grounds.\n\nBut conscientious objection is a narrowly defined status that can be difficult to claim because a soldier must object to all conflicts to qualify, not just a single deployment, several experts told USA TODAY.\n\n\"If you are willing to be part of an armed force but just don’t like this moment, then you don’t qualify,\" Steve Woolford, a GI Rights Hotline worker, told USA TODAY. \"For those people, the military considers that a political objection.\"\n\nWoolford, who has been taking calls at the GI Rights Hotline since before Sept. 11, 2001, said in recent months he’s seen about a 50% uptick in calls from soldiers interested in conscientious objection or in exploring options to resist orders to deploy to U.S. cities.\n\n\"There’s people asking a lot of different questions they weren’t asking before because they’re seeing themselves in roles they didn’t expect to see themselves in,\" said Woolford. \"They’re not talking about things in political ways, they’re not shirkers, they’re people who are dedicated to serving the country, willing to risk their lives and they don't want to feel like they’re doing something wrong.\"\n\nCan soldiers refuse orders?\n\nThe U.S. military is a volunteer fighting force, but while in the service, soldiers can’t pick and choose which orders to follow. Doing so could lead to serious consequences, including years in prison, according to Steve Levin, a University of Maryland Carey School of Law professor.\n\n\"In the military, disobeying a lawful order threatens the entire chain of command,\" said Levin, on why resisting orders can be a serious offense. \"The system depends on discipline and the military runs on instant obedience for the simple reason that defiance can cost lives.\"\n\nThe only exception, according to Levin and other legal experts, is for unlawful orders, though meeting that standard can be exceedingly difficult, even as Trump opponents, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, call deployments illegal.\n\n\"Under the present deployments, the legality of the orders is dubious, but historically it’s not within the ken of any individual service members to make a decision,\" said John W. Hall, a professor of military history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nCan soldiers resist anyway?\n\nA lack of legal options hasn’t stopped U.S. soldiers from resisting orders in the past.\n\n\"The U.S. has had a democratic tradition when it comes to military service where, though you pay a price for dissent, when that occurs, it’s a warning to the political leadership that even the troops who are ordered to do these things will speak out,\" said David Cortright, a professor at the Notre Dame Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies.\n\nCortright participated in that kind of resistance himself after being drafted to serve in the Vietnam War. Stationed in New York, he participated in protests in Manhattan when he was off duty and signed a petition against the war.\n\nHis efforts to resist got him reassigned to a base in Texas, where \"all we did was clean the barracks floor continuously for months,\" said Cortright.\n\n\"If you join in protests, you have to know or expect you could face punishment, commanders never like it when their soldiers disagree with the mission. But back with Vietnam, we didn’t care,\" he said. \"The thinking soldier is a real thing, thank goodness for our society, we’re not just robots.\"\n\n'Legacy of freedom fighters,' vet says\n\nHughes signed up to join the National Guard at an armory in Chicago before 9/11, imagining he would be helping flood victims or sandbagging the Mississippi River. Instead, he deployed to Iraq and Kuwait, where a gung-ho belief in the mission gave way to misgivings.\n\n\"I wanted to go help build a democracy, but it didn't take long to realize occupying forces don't build democracies,\" Hughes said.\n\nHughes and others began resisting orders in passive ways, showing up late or taking patrols extra slowly.\n\nFor Hughes, it was the start of a new sense of patriotism: U.S. soldiers don’t just follow orders, they uphold American ideals and sometimes that means refusing orders. In About Face, he discovered thousands of other soldiers who felt the same way.\n\n\"It’s often that they think they’re alone and they’re not, there’s a history and legacy of freedom fighters that they are a part of that we want to connect them to,\" Hughes said. \"What gives me hope is that the figures who have captured our security state still depend on people complying and acting out their orders and historically, those people have shown that when things are unjust and immoral, we have the power to withdraw our consent.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/10/06/ice-chicago-immigration-shutdown-hurricane-hamas-israel-fashion-week-taylor-swift/86544386007/", "title": "ICE, Chicago, immigration, shutdown, hurricane, Israel, Hamas ...", "text": "It's a new week!🙋🏼‍♀️ I'm Nicole Fallert.

In response to questions from USA TODAY, officials also would not say how many troops would be involved in the deployment.\n\nThe move follows weeks of protests outside ICE's field office in South Portland opposing Trump's mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Some of those protests have turned combative with law enforcement, resulting in tear gas being deployed by officials.\n\nAs of Sept. 8, the U.S. Attorney’s Office had brought federal charges against 26 people for crimes including arson, assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest, according to a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\n'We do not need or want federal troops in Oregon,' governor says\n\nState and local leaders in Portland denounced Trump's military deployment at an outdoor news conference in the heart of downtown Portland hours after the president's announcement.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tina Kotek said she made it \"abundantly clear\" with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in recent conversations that the city and state \"can manage our own local public safety needs.\"\n\n\"There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security, and there is no need for military troops in our major city,\" Kotek said, calling Portland a \"far cry from the war-ravaged community\" that Trump has portrayed. \"We do not need or want federal troops in Oregon, stoking fear, creating conflict and, frankly, escalating a situation that is under control.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has provided no timeline on the military's arrival in her state, the governor said.\n\nKotek threatened potential legal action against the Trump administration, saying she doesn't believe Trump has the legal authority to deploy federal troops to a state. She said she's coordinating with the state's attorney general to \"see if any response is necessary, and we will be prepared to respond if we have to.”\n\nPortland Mayor Keith Wilson said Portland does not need military intervention. \"The president will not find lawlessness or violence here,\" said Wilson, whose office is a nonpartisan position.\n\n\"If President Trump came to Portland today, what he would find is people riding their bikes, playing sports, enjoying the sunshine, buying groceries from a farmers market,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, this may be a show of force, but that's all it is.

My message to Donald Trump is this: We don’t need you here. Stay the hell out of our city,\" Wyden said.\n\nPentagon not releasing details about deployment\n\nAs has happened in states across the country, federal agents and protesters have clashed regularly outside the ICE building in Portland, resulting in several arrests over the past few months. In a press conference on Sept. 26, local officials urged residents not to react to an increase in federal officers in the city.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a question from USA TODAY asking what Trump meant by authorizing the military's \"Full Force.\"\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"we are not going to allow domestic terrorists to attack our law enforcement.\"\n\nChief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the military is ready to mobilize at the president's direction, adding the Defense Department \"will provide information and updates as they become available.\"\n\nDemocrats in Congress said they intend to fight Trump’s military deployment. “Portland is not ‘war ravaged.’ U.S. troops are not political playthings. And Trump is not a king,” Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “Democrats will fight in Congress to stop him.\"\n\nThe protests outside the ICE facility in Portland have occasionally been violent, but have largely been peaceful, beyond causing tension between residents and federal officials.\n\nIn a Sept. 26 news release, DHS pointed to arrests on two dates in June as examples of how people in Portland “have repeatedly attacked and laid siege to an ICE processing center.”\n\nOne person was charged for shining a laser in the eyes of ICE agents, another for throwing a smoke grenade at ICE officers and a third for attempting to damage equipment at the facility and then striking and kicking officers while being arrested.\n\nThe news release also stated that ICE agents have been doxed and were subject to death threats.\n\nTrump earlier deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, amid strong criticism from Democrats in those areas and legal challenges. Only in Memphis has Trump’s order been welcomed by the governor, Republican Bill Lee.\n\nEarlier in September, Trump described living in Portland as “like living in hell” and said he was considering sending in federal troops. He has made similar threats in other Democrat-led cities, including Chicago and Baltimore.\n\nSince the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump has blamed the “radical left” for the country’s problems with political violence. In a memo Sept. 25, ordering a crackdown on alleged “organized political violence,” Trump wrote that “riots” in Portland and Los Angeles have resulted in a significant increase in attacks on ICE agents.\n\nTrump indicated Thursday that an operation was underway.\n\n“We’re going to get out there and we’re going to do a pretty big number on those people in Portland,” Trump said.

JB Pritzker and Chicago’s mayor, both Democrats, “should be in jail” for failing to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement crackdowns.\n\nTrump’s threats to send troops to Illinois were fulfilled with the arrival this week of Texas National Guard members at a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood. Their exact role has not yet been publicly disclosed, though the president, contrary to statistics, has repeatedly claimed big cities run by Democrats are overwhelmed with crime. An immigration enforcement building outside Chicago has also been the site of clashes between federal agents and protesters.\n\n“The federal government has not communicated with us in any way about their troop movements,” Pritzker told reporters in Chicago. “I can’t believe I have to say ‘troop movements’ in an American city, but that is what we’re talking about here.”\n\nA judge will have a role in determining how many boots are on the streets: There’s a court hearing Thursday on a request by Illinois and Chicago to declare the Guard deployment illegal. Elsewhere, an appeals court has scheduled a hearing the same day over the government’s desire to send the Guard to Portland, Oregon. A judge blocked that effort over the weekend.\n\nAnd in Memphis, Tennessee, the Guard could arrive by Friday, though the number of troops is unclear. Republican Gov.

However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.\n\n“This is about authoritarianism.

Though it was initially put out, it continued to burn underground until winds ignited it and turned it into the Palisades Fire, special agent Kenny Cooper said during a news conference.\n\nThe flames, along with the Eaton Fire in another part of Los Angeles County, erupted on Jan. 7 and burned for weeks. They claimed at least 31 lives, but the toll was likely much higher, researchers said. Over 23,000 acres were burned in the Palisades Fire, and thousands of homes and other structures were destroyed.\n\nRinderknecht, who authorities say repeatedly watched a music video featuring flames and had AI images of fiery scenes, is charged with a federal count of destruction of property by means of fire. If convicted, he could face between five and 20 years in prison.\n\nHe did not enter a plea during his initial court appearance on Oct. 8 in Orlando, Florida, as he was appointed a public defense attorney, according to Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. Rinderknecht is due back in court for a detention hearing on Oct. 9. He won't enter a plea until he's extradited back to California.\n\nHow did the blaze allegedly start?\n\nRinderknecht was working as an Uber driver on New Year's Eve and dropped off a passenger in the Palisades neighborhood, officials said Wednesday. Two customers he drove that night told investigators he \"appeared agitated and angry.\"\n\nHe then walked up a trailhead onto a hilltop at about 12:12 a.m. on Jan. 1, igniting what became known as the Lachman Fire, said Acting District Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli.\n\nRinderknecht made several attempts to call 911 after lighting the fire just after midnight, according to the criminal complaint against him. Many attempts didn't go through, but officials said the man may not have had cell signal in the area. He was eventually able to reach emergency services, by which time a nearby resident had already reported it to 911.\n\nThe suspect also used the ChatGPT AI platform to ask “Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic]because of your cigarettes,” according to the criminal complaint.\n\nThe search and the calls to 911 were screen recorded using his phone, indicating he \"wanted to preserve evidence of himself trying to assist in the suppression of the fire and he wanted to create evidence regarding a more innocent explanation for the cause of the fire,\" the complaint said.\n\nHours later, he also allegedly turned around and went back to the trail, where he took videos and photos of the fire and firefighters battling it, authorities said.\n\nRinderknecht, also known as \"Jonathan Rinder\" and \"Jon Rinder,\" lived in Southern California, before later moving to Melbourne, Florida. Essayli said the case will go before a grand jury, and prosecutors could seek additional charges.\n\nThe criminal complaint against Rinderknecht further alleges he lied to authorities, telling them he first spotted the fire after leaving a clearing and walking back down the hill toward his car.\n\nSuspect allegedly watched fiery music video, used ChatGPT after sparking blaze\n\nBefore the Jan. 1 flames broke out, Rinderknecht used his iPhone to listen to the song “Un Zder, Un The,” by the French artist Josman, the criminal complaint said. Rinderknecht also told investigators he grew up in France and was fluent in French.\n\nRecords also showed Rinderknecht listened to the song nine times in the four days leading up to the fire. The music video, which he watched three times during that period, shows someone lighting things on fire.\n\nInvestigators found an AI-generated image of a city burning on one of Rinderknecht's devices , Essayli noted Wednesday. The image was made using the following prompt in July 2024, according to the complaint: “A dystopian painting divided into distinct parts that blend together seamlessly. On the far left, there is a burning forest. Next to it, a crowd of people is running away from the fire, leading to the middle. In the middle, hundreds of thousands of people in poverty are trying to get past a gigantic gate with a big dollar sign on it.\"\n\n\"On the other side of the gate and the entire wall is a conglomerate of the richest people. They are chilling, watching the world burn down, and watching the people struggle,\" The prompt continued. \"They are laughing, enjoying themselves, and dancing. The scene is detailed and impactful, highlighting the stark contrast and the direct connection between the different parts of the world.”\n\nJan. 1 fire turned into the Palisades blaze\n\nThe Palisades Fire, which was believed to have started on Jan. 7, is what's known as a \"holdover fire,\" authorities said. A holdover fire, also known as a \"zombie fire\" can continue to burn underground and flare up again later.\n\nFirefighters put out the Jan. 1 Lachman Fire later the same day after it burned 8 to 10 acres, and intentionally left behind fire hoses in case they needed to redeploy to the area, the criminal complaint said. They collected the hoses on Jan. 2.\n\nThe Lachman Fire was caused by an open flame, likely a lighter, the complaint added. Other causes ruled out included fireworks, lightning strikes, electric lines, refraction of sunlight through glass and smoking.\n\n'A total shock'\n\nNews of an arrest came as a complete surprise to Perry Akins, 85, and his wife Methal, 77. The couple lost their Pacific Palisades home of 45 years where they raised their two children to the fire.\n\n“I’d call it a total shock, if that’s even the right word,” Perry Akins said in a phone call with USA TODAY on Oct. 8. “I didn’t think someone would even start the fire, on purpose? I had no idea.”\n\nMethal Akins said she was even more at a loss for words.\n\n“I always thought it was natural causes. Wow,” she said. “That would be terrible if someone actually did that.”\n\nThe couple, who has decided not to rebuild, has since moved to nearby Brentwood, California. Perry Akins, who is president of the Rotary Club of Pacific Palisades, said the organization has been spending months helping get donations toward a Palisades Fire relief fund.\n\nSome 16 Rotary members lost their homes during the fire, Akins said. He added that the arrest will definitely be the topic of tonight’s scheduled meeting.\n\n“I don’t think we will talk about anything else,” Akins said.\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen and Christopher Cann", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/14/los-angeles-fires-california-wildfire-live-updates-tuesday/77680984007/", "title": "Los Angeles fires updates: Wind reprieve but fast-moving fire warning", "text": "Editor's note: This file captures the news of the California wildfires from Tuesday, Jan. 14. For the latest updates on the LA fires, follow USA TODAY's live coverage for Wednesday, Jan. 15.\n\nSANTA MONICA, Calif. – The powerful Santa Ana winds expected back in the Los Angeles area Tuesday probably won't materialize until late at night and early Wednesday, but they'll still be capable of stoking quickly spreading blazes, the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service said Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDespite milder-than-predicted conditions during much of the day, wind gusts of 50 to 70 mph in the mountains and 30 to 50 mph on the coasts and valleys are still forecast for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, only later than initially anticipated.\n\n\"Wind are weaker than expected today, but looking for one more enhancement late tonight and Wednesday,\" the weather service's Los Angeles office said Tuesday. \"Not quite out of the woods yet.\"\n\nRed Flag Warnings with the rare \"particularly dangerous situation\" designation issued for those counties will now be in effect from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time on Wednesday.\n\nScores of firefighters, including additional personnel from Canada, Mexico and other nearby U.S. states, have been combating the fires from the air and on the ground. Officials worry the high winds could further expand the Palisades and Eaton blazes as well as ignite and expand new ones.\n\nHigh winds combined with low humidity and a relentless drought have fueled the deadly wildfires that have destroyed entire neighborhoods and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes over the last eight days in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAt least 25 people have been killed in the fires, according to the Los Angeles Medical Examiner's Office. The wildfires have destroyed or damaged more than 12,000 homes, businesses, and other structures as officials ordered over 92,000 people to flee their homes.\n\nGet weather and fire alerts via text: Sign up to get current wildfire updates by location\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ President Joe Biden has decided the federal government will pick up the entire cost of emergency work California will require over six months because of the fires instead of only 75%, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said.\n\n∎ The Sheriff's office lifted evacuation orders for some communities in Altadena, hit hard by the Eaton Fire, starting at 3 p.m. PT Tuesday.\n\n∎ The Palisades Fire, which reduced the Pacific Palisades neighborhood to rubble, has consumed 23,713 acres and is 18% contained, according to Cal Fire. The agency said the Eaton Fire, located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, has burned 14,117 acres and is 35% contained.\n\n∎ California Gov. Gavin Newsom said 11 new fires broke out overnight, including the Auto Fire in Ventura County, but were quickly extinguished. By Tuesday night, the Auto Fire burned 61 acres and is 47% contained. The county's fire department said the blaze's forward progress was stopped.\n\nSet of remains tied to Eaton Fire determined to be not human\n\nIn an update Tuesday night, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office said a set of remains the office was investigating in connection to the Eaton Fire was determined to be non-human. The remains were discovered in Altadena.\n\nThe medical examiner's office also confirmed an additional death tied to the Palisades Fire, raising the death toll to at least 25. It is believed that nine people died in the Palisades Fire while 16 others died in the Eaton Fire.\n\nOf the 25 cases, 21 remains are confirmed to be human, according to the medical examiner's office. The remaining four cases are still being processed.\n\nLawsuit blames public utility for water supply failures\n\nMore than a dozen victims of the Pacific Palisades wildfire are suing the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for water supply failures they say contributed to the devastation of the Los Angeles inferno.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by residents and a pizzeria owner, blames the utility for hydrants drying up within hours of the blaze's ignition. The plaintiffs said they all lost their homes or businesses to the fire.\n\nThe LADWP, the largest U.S. municipal utility, should have maintained water in a nearby reservoir, which was dry at the time the flames erupted, the complaint said. The Santa Ynez Reservoir, which can hold as much as 117 million gallons of water, had been empty since February 2024, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe suit follows other legal actions in connection with the California wildfires. A group of residents and business owners recently sued Southern California Edison over the Eaton Fire.\n\n— Minnah Arshad\n\nAt least a dozen schools damaged in wildfires\n\nThousands of students across Los Angeles attend schools that were destroyed or damaged by wildfires that ravaged communities over the past week surrounding the nation's second most populous city.\n\nSome schools in the region that paused last week due to fire hazards were unharmed and have resumed instruction, while others remain in limbo about how they'll proceed amid the continuing threat from wildfires, school officials said.\n\nThe Palisades Fire, the Eaton Fire and others have burned more than 40,000 acres across Los Angeles since Jan. 7 and destroyed thousands of buildings, including at least a dozen K-12 schools, such as Palisades Charter High School, Marquez Charter Elementary School, and Eliot Arts Magnet Academy.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Kayla Jimenez\n\nSheriff urges thousands under evacuation warnings to flee\n\nOfficials urged the 84,800 residents in Los Angeles County under evacuation warnings Tuesday to start packing up and leaving their homes.\n\n“When we’re giving you warnings, that's probably the time you should think about going,” Sheriff Robert Luna said at a news conference Tuesday. “We recommend you go. Don’t wait until the order is given.”\n\nLuna said approximately 88,000 residents in the county remained under mandatory evacuation orders Tuesday morning. He said that while the number has decreased in recent days, the situation “is still very dangerous” as strong winds return to the region.\n\nA curfew will again be in place from 6 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Wednesday for areas scorched by the Palisades and Eaton fires.\n\nNonresidents and others caught in areas under evacuation orders during curfew are subject to arrest, Luna reiterated, adding that at least 11 people have been arrested for curfew violations.\n\nMapping the LA fires: See latest evacuation zones and fire locations\n\nFirefighters rush to beef up containment lines as strong winds return\n\nFirefighters battling the wildfires are focusing on reinforcing and maintaining containment lines as winds pick up throughout the region.\n\nCal Fire said in an update Tuesday morning that authorities will \"conduct tactical patrols and mop-up operations, addressing smoke and heat sources to minimize the chance of fire escaping the perimeter.\"\n\nAdditionally, urban search and rescue efforts as well as damage assessments were ongoing throughout areas torched by the blazes. \"These operations are unprecedented in size and scale and are critical for mitigating existing hazards, confirming missing persons reports, and obtaining accurate numbers of structures loss,\" Cal Fire said.\n\nHouses turned into 'highly toxic debris'\n\nWildfire evacuees returning to their homes in increasing numbers around Los Angeles are being warned to take special care in cleaning up toxic ash and debris.\n\nAuthorities have banned people from using leaf blowers to clean up ash due to the inhalation risk; are advising residents wipe down countertops and other surfaces; and use a mop to remove ash from floors instead of a vacuum.\n\nOfficials issued a blowing ash advisory and cautioned Los Angeles residents to stay indoors with the windows closed, and to wear an N-95 mask or respirator for protection. Dust and ash \"may cause irritation or exacerbate pre-existing health conditions, particularly for children, older adults, pregnant individuals, and those with heart or lung conditions,\" the Los Angeles County Public Health Department said.\n\nLos Angeles officials have not yet said when residents of the hardest-hit areas may be allowed to return.\n\nOne expert told USA TODAY that residents should start thinking about the destroyed neighborhoods in terms of the dangerous \"burn pits\" once used by the military in Iraq and Afghanistan to dispose of waste.\n\n“Residents should not, not, not, go home and sift through the debris,\" said Katie Arrington, an environmental cleanup expert who has been helping manage the aftermath of a suburban Denver 2021 wildfire that destroyed about 1,000 homes. \"It is highly toxic debris. It’s the mixing all the materials together, along with it burning. It’s not just your house, but your neighbors' houses, your car in the driveway.”\n\n'Like Iraq': Couple describes fires, looters\n\nPartners Robert Bullock and David Anderson stayed in their historic home just outside Pasadena as the Eaton Fire flared up last week. The flames later receded and people swept into the neighborhood for no other apparent reason than to loot the empty homes.\n\n“The first night or two, there were a lot of people with backpacks loitering,” Anderson said. “They were walking up and down driveways and streets.”\n\nThe pair relied on a rifle purchased some two years ago for security but were unable to fall asleep the first night of the fires.\n\n“The first two nights were terrible,” said Bullock, noting he could hear the booms of propane tanks and ammunition exploding in the distance as the fire raged. “It sounded like Iraq.”\n\n- Sam Morgen, The Desert Sun\n\nFormer contractor making do amid the destruction\n\nGeorge Wilken, 79, rode out the fire in Pacific Palisades, racing from spot fire to spot fire in his SUV with water and watching hopefully as firefighting planes dropped water to douse the flames. Although the retired general contractor saved some homes, he said, hundreds of his longtime neighbors lost theirs, including a handful of houses he’d built or remodeled over the years.\n\nA week later, he’s still in the evacuation zone, keeping an eye on his church, Palisades Lutheran, and making tea and cooking meals, including leftover Christmas ham, on a barbecue grill. Monday night he fried some shrimp after heating water on the grill to sponge off in a wash tub. He made bacon and eggs for breakfast Tuesday, keeping the food cool in a church refrigerator he occasionally powers with a small gas generator.\n\n“It’s makeshift but it’s home for a while,” he said. “It’s a little crazy, I know.”\n\nAt night Wilken had been returning to his nearby apartment. Without power or gas service, it’s easier to spend his days at the untouched church where he’s been clearing debris from the grounds and keeping an eye out for looters.\n\nWhile the church where Wilken helps with operations was untouched aside from ash that’s drifted through the doors, the Palisades Presbyterian church across the street burned to the ground. The fire was so intense it lofted and melted a piece of roofing copper from its tower, dropping it hundreds of feet away.\n\n“I’m just eating whatever’s available. It’s not like I can go to the market,” Wilken said Tuesday before cooking breakfast. “But I’ve got enough food for a week.”\n\nPolice searching for dozens of missing people amid fires\n\nLos Angeles authorities continued search and rescue operations, going door-to-door seeking missing people a week after a series of blazes began burning large swaths of Los Angeles County.\n\nLuna said 24 people remain missing in areas scorched by the Palisades and Eaton fires. He said those missing are all adults, adding that six of them are believed to be in the Eaton area and six in the Malibu area.\n\nMcDonnell said Los Angeles police officers were searching for eleven missing people as of Tuesday morning. So far, 21 people reported missing in the city have been found safe. The chief added that two people reported missing have most likely been \"found deceased, but have yet to be positively identified.\"\n\nCollege student reflects on 'strange time right now' in Malibu\n\nAn eerie calm pervaded over Malibu on Tuesday morning. Although the National Weather Service had forecast high winds for much of the surrounding area, little more than a cool breeze blew along the coast just north of Los Angeles.\n\nFirefighters cleared up smoldering hot spots and worked to tear down unstable structures that had been damaged last week by the Palisades Fire. Residents remain barred from certain parts of the city, as authorities work to bring back utilities and worry about looting.\n\nPepperdine University has been mostly unscathed. Parts of the private Christian school were scorched by the Franklin Fire in early December, but that created a buffer zone for the latest blaze. Most of the students were still on winter break when the Palisades Fire broke out Jan. 7, and they remained at home because the school moved to remote classes this week.\n\nSam Jones, a 22-year-old senior, trekked to his job at a gym from a nearby apartment. He credited the previous fire with protecting his apartment and the campus. But as he enters his last college semester, Jones yearns for a return to normalcy. Much of Malibu remains locked down, and many residents have not been allowed to return.\n\n“The city is just so weird right now,” Jones said “I’ve talked to some friends that live (outside) Malibu, and none of their houses have electricity. None of the gas stations are open, so they can’t even drive their cars because they just have no more gas left in them to get through the canyon. It’s a strange time right now.”\n\n− Sam Morgen, The Desert Sun\n\nLA mayor signs executive order focused on recovery, rebuilding\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she signed an executive directive in an attempt to cut red tape and streamline recovery and rebuilding operations. Bass said the order will address debris removal efforts and make available 1,400 housing units for those who have lost their homes in the fires.\n\n\"We're going to make it through these next few days but we want to begin to think about how we rebuild the massive destruction that I saw from the air,\" Bass said, referencing a helicopter tour she took of the disaster areas Monday. \"We don't want people burdened by red tape and bureaucracy.\"\n\nHigh wind speeds recorded across Los Angeles area\n\nHere are some of the highest wind speeds recorded early Tuesday across Los Angeles and Ventura counties, according to the National Weather Service office in L.A.\n\nMagic Mountain Truck Trail – 72 mph\n\nMillcreek RAWS – 62 mph\n\nSandstone Peak – 60 mph\n\nN3 Highway – 58 mph\n\nJulians Ridge – 56 mph\n\n3 arson suspects arrested, accused of starting fires across LA\n\nThree arson suspects have been arrested across the Los Angeles area since Sunday, the Los Angeles police chief told reporters Tuesday.\n\nChief Jim McDonnell said officers in North Hollywood responded to a call reporting a man was using a barbecue lighter to ignite fires. The man was arrested for an outstanding felony warrant for arson and booked into Van Nuys Jail, McDonnell said.\n\nTwo men had been arrested on arson charges Sunday. The first was taken into custody after people reported he lit a section of brush aflame, McDonnell said. The second arrest occurred in the west Los Angeles area, where a suspect had allegedly lit a trash can on fire. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to both incidents.\n\nWhen will it rain in Los Angeles?\n\nThe Los Angeles area may see light showers next week, but the rainfall is not expected to be substantial, said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr.\n\nIn fact, all of Southern California is expected to be drier than average over the next two weeks, according to a Monday forecast from the Climate Prediction Center.\n\nWhile heavy rain would certainly help firefighters battling the blazes across L.A County, there are concerns that torrential downpours might trigger mudslides in areas charred by the fires, city officials said.\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nNine people arrested for looting; stolen Emmy Award recovered\n\nOfficials say nine people have been charged with looting while police recovered an Emmy Award and at least $200,000 in other items stolen from homes abandoned during wildfire evacuations in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAuthorities on Monday announced charges against nine people accused of burglaries and looting in the Eaton and Palisades fire areas. They also said they are pursuing charges against people accused of impersonating firefighters to improperly access evacuation zones.\n\nAuthorities have also arrested dozens of people accused of violating closure orders, and security has tightened across the evacuation areas. Officials did not release additional details Monday regarding who the Emmy belonged to. However, they said several of the people arrested had criminal records that could land them lengthy prison sentences if convicted.\n\nPacific Palisades resident: Homes couldn't escape firestorm\n\nAuthorities said it may be Thursday until evacuees are allowed to return home, as Red Flag Warnings are expected to last through Wednesday. Firefighters are continuing their assessments of burned areas, and on Monday evening reported that at least 5,000 structures had been destroyed in the Palisades Fire. A curfew remains in effect for much of the area.\n\nBeverley Auerbach and her husband, who lost the home they've lived in since 1980, fled to safety last Monday, thinking they would be gone just a few days. But the wind-driven firestorm burned through their Pacific Palisades neighborhood known as the Alphabets, scouring homes down to their concrete steps and brick chimneys.\n\nAuerbach said they still haven't seen what the area looks like in person, though a neighbor accessed the evacuation area and recorded some video for the neighborhood WhatsApp group chat.\n\n\"We all hoped that our home would be the one that the capricious winds would bypass,\" Auerbach, a travel marketing consultant, said via text. \"In our case, we had a clay tile roof and stucco walls with little wood trim, unlike our neighbors' homes with a lot of wood and composite shingles.\" Auerbach added: \"The truth is that in such a conflagration, with homes close together, none could escape, even those with wildfire protection. Still, we hope against hope until someone shows you a photo or video that settles the matter.\"\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/10/los-angeles-california-wildfires-friday-live-updates/77586897007/", "title": "LA fires live updates: Inferno still rages; more wind in forecast", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the LA fires for Friday, Jan. 10. For the latest updates on the Los Angeles wildfires in California, please read USA TODAY'S live updates for Saturday, Jan. 11.\n\nLOS ANGELES – Firefighters made progress Friday in the battle against deadly wildfires that have decimated entire neighborhoods in coastal Southern California, but officials cautioned that strong winds would return to the region, raising the threat of further devastation as the death toll rose to 11.\n\nFive wildfires remained active in Los Angeles County, scorching more than 36,000 acres or about 56 square miles, an area about the size of Miami, according to Cal Fire. The largest blaze, the Palisades Fire, which ranks as the most destructive in Los Angeles history, scorched over 20,000 acres, including picturesque coastal enclaves between Santa Monica and Malibu.\n\nEvacuations from the Palisades Fire continued Friday, and hundreds of residents drove away along narrow, winding roads as emergency responders sent personnel and equipment into the fire zones, said Cal Fire Battalion Chief David Acuña. Anticipating the fire's trajectory is a never-ending challenge, he said.\n\n“One of the issues we’re having right now is we can’t tell where the fire is going to be in 30 minutes,\" Acuña told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Eaton Fire near Altadena and Pasadena was at 3% containment as it grew to more than 13,600 acres. Several other fires have ignited across the county as fierce winds persisted, including the Kenneth Fire that broke out Thursday near Woodland Hills. The blaze prompted evacuation orders Thursday night, which have since been lifted.\n\nThe blazes turned entire neighborhoods into ash, destroyed over 12,300 structures, and prompted officials to order the evacuation of more than 150,000 residents. At least 11 people have died in the two biggest blazes, according to the Los Angeles County medical examiner – six from the Eaton fire and five from the Palisades fire.\n\nOn Friday, the battle against the Los Angeles wildfires turned into an international effort as Mexico and Canada announced they would send firefighters and other resources to California. Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday afternoon that firefighters from Mexico were en route to the Eaton fire, joining over 10,000 personnel on the ground. The National Guard and neighboring states have also deployed resources as California faces rapidly growing devastation.\n\nMeanwhile, the California governor on Friday announced an independent investigation into water mobility issues that reportedly hampered firefighting efforts. Newsom's announcement comes as politicians, including President-elect Donald Trump, have pointed fingers at California's elected leaders, saying they weren't prepared for the fires.\n\nAlso Friday, Newsom invited Trump to come to California and meet with those affected by the fires.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of Americans – displaced from their homes and fearful for the future – deserve to see all of us working in their best interests to ensure a fast recovery and rebuild,\" Newsom wrote in a letter to the incoming president on Friday.\n\nGet weather and fire alerts via text: Sign up to get current wildfire updates by location\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ WATER ADVISORIES: Residents in Altadena, Malibu, Pasadena, Pacific Palisades and a northern section of the San Fernando Valley, including Sylmar, were under boil water advisories on Friday, with authorities asking residents to use bottled water.\n\n◾ CURFEW: A curfew order has been issued for mandatory evacuation zones related to the Palisades and Eaton wildfires from 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, said Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna. He said those who do not obey the curfew will be \"subject to arrest.\"\n\n◾ FEDERAL HELP: President Joe Biden promised the federal government would cover the total cost of the wildfire response in Southern California for 180 days. Biden also announced the immediate availability of funding assistance and urged those affected by the devastating fires to visit disasterassistance.gov or call 1-800-621-3362 for help.\n\n◾ POWER OUTAGES: More than 175,000 homes and businesses across California were without power Friday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n◾ SCHOOL CLOSURES: The Los Angeles Unified School District, the second-largest school district in the nation, announced all of its campuses will be closed Friday due to the fires and hazardous air quality. The University of California, Los Angeles, canceled in-person classes on Friday.\n\nPowerful Santa Ana winds forecast for next week\n\nGusty Santa Ana winds are forecast to come and go over southern California in the next several days, which could further exacerbate the deadly and devastating wildfires across the region.\n\nThe strongest gusts are expected early next week, especially Monday night and into Tuesday, forecasters said. And as strong as the wind is forecast to be next week, \"we are not forecasting a replica of the winds from earlier this week,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr told USA TODAY Friday.\n\nThose howling winds, measured at speeds approaching 100 mph, fueled the ferocious firestorms that followed.\n\nA red flag warning expired in Los Angeles as winds slowed down to 15 to 25 mph by Friday evening, but the National Weather Service warned wind speed would start to pick back up Saturday.\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nGovernor calls for probe of water system\n\nThe California governor on Friday announced an independent investigation into water supply issues that may have impeded firefighting efforts amid historic blazes devastating the Los Angeles area.\n\nReports of loss of water pressure in local hydrants and unavailability of water from the Santa Ynez Reservoir are \"deeply troubling,\" Newsom wrote in a letter to leaders of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Los Angeles County Public Works. He said state water and firefighting officials would conduct an independent review of what caused the malfunctions.\n\nThe governor noted that local fire hydrants are not designed to extinguish massive wildfires, but losing anticipated water supply from them \"likely impaired the effort to protect some homes and evacuation corridors.\"\n\n\"We need answers to ensure this does not happen again and we have every resource available to fight these catastrophic fires,\" Newsom said in a post on X.\n\nThe governor's announcement comes as criticism mounts over a critical lack of water during the early stages of the fires.\n\nBiden on Thursday said local utilities shut off power over concerns that power lines could be \"blown down and spark additional fires,\" adding that the move had hampered \"the ability to generate pumping water.\" California Congresswoman Judy Chu, who represents the Los Angeles area where the fires are, reiterated Biden’s explanation Friday to CNN.\n\nBut this may not be a one-time occurrence, said Los Angeles Department of Water and Power CEO Janisse Quiñones, who addressed the situation on Wednesday. During a news conference, Quiñones said by 3 a.m. Wednesday, the city utility’s three 1-million-gallon water storage tanks in the Palisades area \"went dry,\" reducing the water flow from hydrants in higher elevations.\n\n\"We pushed the system to the extreme. Four times the normal demand was seen for 15 hours straight, which lowered our water pressure,\" Quiñones said. \"It was like a worst-case scenario, but I think we should be planning for those worst-case scenarios.\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nNeighbors lend a helping hand\n\nChester Griffiths pulled long hoses Friday morning in a continued effort with his father to save neighbors’ houses in smoky Malibu.\n\nGriffiths, 24, said his family’s house survived the Palisades fire with only minor damage. Neighbors just a few doors down weren’t so fortunate. Entire structures were destroyed, leaving a view of the Pacific Ocean framed by charred debris.\n\nThe hill across from their home on Pacific Coast Highway had gone up in a blaze, leaving nothing but charred ground and patches of burnt vegetation. Embers from the fire jumped the multilane highway, burning houses on both sides.\n\n“Firefighters saved what they could, but a lot of it isn’t recoverable. It’s heartbreaking,” Griffiths said.\n\nIt wasn't just homes. Signs stood near debris where former businesses including Willie’s Fish & Tackle, had burned to the ground.\n\n– Dave Mason, Ventura County Star\n\nFamily digs through the rubble: 'We've been crying for days'\n\nSarah and Ben Treger rode borrowed electric bicycles through their neighborhood, north of Pacific Palisades city center, checking on a list of addresses from a neighborhood group chat. Near the end of the list was their own home, which they found collapsed in a pile of rubble.\n\nWith gloved hands, Ben Treger shoveled through the debris, hunting for the box where he’d stashed a collection of family watches. The couple had evacuated in a hurry, taking their two small children – 6 months and 21 months old – to Santa Monica, where Ben’s parents live.\n\nThe small family doesn’t know where they will go next. Sarah Treger said she has been trying to find a nearby Airbnb, but they’re being booked so quickly the website’s calendars cannot keep up. “We’ve been crying for days,” she said, watching her husband dig.\n\nFrom the pile of dust, the corner of a watch strap protruded. Ben tugged. It was the remains of his grandfather’s watch, six decades old.\n\n“I think it still tells time,” he joked, looking at the hunk of charred metal strap and watch case.\n\n– Isaiah Murtaugh, Ventura County Star\n\nErroneous evacuation alerts are 'top priority,' LA county officials say\n\nLos Angeles County officials said they are working to address the erroneous evacuation alerts that have incited panic and frustration across Los Angeles this week.\n\nKevin McGowan, the director of the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management, on Friday apologized for the mistakenly issued alerts, saying \"I can’t express enough how sorry I am for this experience.\"\n\nHe said that \"every technical specialist is working to resolve this issue,\" and urged people not to disable the alert messages on their phone.\n\nMcGowan said there are \"life and death\" consequences if you don't receive a necessary alert.\n\n'Hazardous' air quality levels in LA as wildfires rage\n\nUnhealthy and hazardous air quality levels have been detected in Pasadena as multiple wildfires rage across Southern California.\n\nAt Jefferson Park in Pasadena, a quality monitor recorded an index of 526, a \"hazardous\" Code Maroon, which is the highest of six categories on the U.S. Air Quality Index. The categories range from good to moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy and hazardous.\n\n\"At this extreme, there's a health warning of emergency conditions,\" said IQAir. \"The entire population is likely to be severely affected.\"\n\nOther portions of Pasadena and San Marino saw Code Purple air quality levels, which indicates that the air quality is unhealthy for everyone, especially for vulnerable groups of people.\n\nAmid LA wildfires, insurance commissioner seeks to protect coverage\n\nCalifornia's insurance commissioner issued a one-year moratorium to prevent homeowners insurance companies from canceling or not renewing policies in areas devastated by the wildfires raging in the Los Angeles area.\n\nCommissioner Ricardo Lara's moratorium is aimed at helping those impacted by the Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County, according to a state website. The department may issue \"a supplemental bulletin\" if additional areas are determined to be in need.\n\n“My heart goes out to my fellow Angelenos. Our top priority is protecting Californians during this crisis and helping us recover,” Lara said in a statement. \"I am working on all fronts to make sure wildfire victims get the benefits they are entitled to, and they get it as soon as possible.”\n\nErroneous evacuation alert sent to Beverly Hills residents\n\nSome residents in the city of Beverly Hills received evacuation alerts that were mistakenly issued early Friday morning, the city said in a statement.\n\nThe erroneous alert from the Los Angeles County Fire Department was sent to residents around 4 a.m. Friday, said a statement on the official X account for the city of Beverly Hills.\n\n\"The County’s Office of Emergency Management has confirmed this was another error,\" the statement said. \"There are no evacuations currently affecting BH.\"\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, residents in Los Angeles County received an evacuation warning that was \"mistakenly issued countywide due to a technical error,\" Janice Hahn, the county supervisor, said in a post on X.\n\nDrone collided with firefighting aircraft over Palisades Fire\n\nA firefighting aircraft was grounded on Thursday after it was struck by a drone while flying over the Palisades Fire, the Federal Aviation Administration said.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Department spokesperson Erik Scott said the incident occurred Thursday afternoon when a Super Scooper plane, Quebec 1, was hit by a civilian drone not assigned to fire operations. \"Quebec 1 sustained wing damage and remains grounded and out of service,\" Scott said in a statement on X. \"There were no reported injuries.\"\n\nFirefighting \"Super Scooper\" planes refill by descending to the placid waters of bays and lakes and skimming the water’s surface to load their tanks, according to Reuters. They then release the water to douse a blaze and repeat the process until they refuel.\n\n– Thao Nguyen\n\nPolice: no probable cause to charge arson suspect\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said it arrested a possible arson suspect Thursday afternoon near the Kenneth Fire in the Woodland Hills neighborhood but ultimately did not have probable cause for the incident.\n\nDominic Choi, Los Angeles Police Department assistant chief said at a news conference Friday the man was detained by residents who said he was “attempting to light a fire in the community.\"\n\nAfter interviewing the suspect and reviewing evidence, officers determined they did not have probable cause to arrest the man on charges related to any fires. They instead arrested him on a felon probation charge.\n\nChoi said the investigation is ongoing.\n\nPresident Biden: 'Spare no expense' to fight fires\n\nBiden on Thursday declared the deadly fires in Southern California \"a major disaster\" and told state and local officials to \"spare no expense to fight\" as the federal government would cover 100% of the cost of disaster assistance.\n\nBiden announced the immediate availability of funding assistance and urged those affected to visit disasterassistance.gov or call 1-800-621-3362 for help.\n\nDuring a briefing at the White House, Biden said that California Gov. Gavin Newsom asked for more funds to help battle the deadly wildfires that have scorched thousands of acres.\n\n\"Due to the magnitude of the disaster, I was talking with the governor and he requested if I could increase the federal funding that was authorized under this legislation from 75% to 90%,\" Biden said. \"We're increasing it to 100% of all costs to be covered by the federal government for both the fire management assistance grants and what they call disaster declaration.\"\n\n\"I'm announcing the federal government will cover 100% of the costs for 180 days,\" Biden continued. \"It's going to cover debris and hazard material removal, temporary shelter, first responder salaries, and all of the necessary measures to protect life and property.\"\n\nPalisades Fire evacuees: 'Everybody at this point is just numb'\n\nSome residents of Pacific Palisades returned home briefly Thursday to find much of their houses and possessions in cinders.\n\nJimmy Dunne, a longtime resident who raised his children in the area, was one of the lucky ones. Dunne walked and hitchhiked back to the neighborhood before grabbing his bicycle from his unburnt home to see the damage.\n\nMany places he’s known for years didn’t make it.

Upon arrival, they saw the front of the building engulfed in flames and smoke, and began rescuing people while trying to quell the blaze.\n\nMultiple people were declared dead at the scene while over 30 were rushed to area hospitals, including at least five firefighters with minor injuries. As of Monday evening, nine people were dead and one person was in critical condition, said Fall River Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon. Approximately 70 people lived in the building when the fire broke out.\n\nKerry Leckey lived in a first-floor apartment and fled the building using her walker. She was scrolling on her phone when she heard fire alarms ring out, and as she made her way out of the building she saw upper levels \"completely engulfed in flames.\"\n\nEverything in her apartment was destroyed and three of her friends are among the dead, she told the Herald News, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n“I’ve only been there two months but I met a handful of really nice people and became pretty close to them in a short period of time, and three of them are gone,” she said. “They passed in the fire.”\n\nThe cause of the incident remains unclear and is under investigation. However, the Bristol County District Attorney’s Office confirmed that the fire \"does not appear to be suspicious at this time.\"\n\nOfficials said the building owner has been cooperative and the facility will soon be boarded up.\n\n\"The fire at Gabriel House in Fall River is a tragedy,\" Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement. \"My heart goes out to those who are waking up to the most horrific news imaginable about their loved ones this morning.\"\n\n'Everything is gone, gone, gone'\n\nLeckey said the fire at Gabriel House was “not just a tragedy, it’s a travesty.\"\n\nShe said the building was old and that there was not enough people on staff. It unknown how many staff were working the night of the fire.\n\nThe only thing she has from her apartment is her walker. She said she was lucky to still have that. \"Everybody else’s medication, money – everything is gone, gone, gone,\" Leckey said.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, she said she did not know where she would go next. A placement had not yet been arranged for her.\n\n“I guess they’re working something out for people. But as of now, I have no idea. And that’s the worst part of all of it,” she said. “You just don't know what you’re going to do from here on out. But thank God there are good people around helping us.”\n\nResident says fire was an accident waiting to happen\n\nThe Timao Center, a community facility in Fall River used to help the homeless, was a hive of activity with volunteers finding clothes, food, canes and walkers for displaced Gabriel House residents.\n\nNurses were making phone calls to local pharmacies to arrange for replacement medications — any meds left behind in the blaze were removed by the fire department, Bacon said, and were unusable.\n\nDonna Murphy, who has lived at the facility for five years, said she was at her granddaughter’s house the night of the fire, which she described as an accident waiting to happen. Murphy said multiple people in the building smoke in violation of rules and use prohibited devices.\n\n“There’s oxygen tanks, people smoking. … There’s toasters, people have got fryolators … microwaves,” Murphy told the Herald News, while smoking a cigarette.\n\nShe also referred to maintenance trouble, recalling a recent 8-month period where the elevator was broken and she had to crawl up the stairs to her room. Murphy said the fire destroyed all her belongings and that she planned to move in with her family.\n\nAt the community center, she struggled to remember her litany of medications to be replaced.\n\nWhat we know about possible cause of deadly Fall River fire\n\nWhile inspectors worked to pinpoint what led to the fire, officials have begun describing potential hazards in the building when the blaze broke out.\n\nAt a news conference, Bacon noted the presence of “several” oxygen tanks, which are commonly used by elderly residents and can be fire hazards. However, the chief said they were “irrelevant to the fire at this time\" and cited an ongoing investigation headed by the Massachusetts Department of Fire Services.\n\nWhat is Gabriel House in Fall River?\n\nThe Gabriel House assisted living facility opened in 1999 and is made up of 100 units, according to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Aging & Independence.\n\nGabriel House's website says is meant for people 55 and older, and that it provides a range of care for residents with diseases such as diabetes or those who struggle to control their bodily functions.\n\nIt remains unknown if Gabriel House had and followed an evacuation plan. The building's owner Dennis Etzkorn has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Herald News, part of the USA TODAY Network. Fall River Mayor Paul Coogan said Gabriel House – like all the city’s nursing facilities – are on the city’s radar for health and safety inspections, but he did not describe what recent inspections showed.\n\n\"We know this building,\" Coogan said. \"We know it well. We work with the staff here and the management to try to make sure if they need help, we’re here for them.”\n\nFirefighters carried residents out of burning building\n\nBacon at a news conference described the chaotic scene that saw residents begging for help and \"hanging out of windows looking to be rescued.\" He said firefighters and police pulled dozens of people to safety, squeezing them through small windows or breaking down doors and carrying residents – some of whom were in wheelchairs – out of the building.\n\nThe number of window air conditioning units made rescues difficult and forced first responders to use smaller windows to pull people out, Bacon said.\n\nThe chief added that the fire damage was limited to one wing of the building, but that smoke had engulfed the facility's interior, likely leading to deaths and dozens of injuries.\n\n\"The fire attack was very quick, it was just a very smokey fire,\" said Bacon.\n\nWho died in the fire? Officials release names of residents killed\n\nThe Bristol County District Attorney's Office identified seven of the nine victims of the Gabriel House fire. The office has not yet confirmed the names of a 70-year-old woman and a 77-year-old man who died in the fire, saying their next of kin notifications were pending.\n\nRui Albernaz, 64\n\nRonald Codega, 61\n\nMargaret Duddy, 69\n\nRobert King, 78\n\nKim Mackin, 71\n\nRichard Rochon, 78\n\nEleanor Willett, 86\n\nEvacuees left behind medicine amid frantic escape\n\nThe building's many evacuees were taken to the city's homeless overflow shelter, where city staff and others were assisting them with getting medicine, clothes and other belongings they had to leave behind in the frantic evacuation.\n\nCoogan, the mayor of Fall River, said all the assisted living facility’s medical records were in file folders that survived the blaze.“We just carried out a bunch of medical records,” Bacon told reporters. “The room they were stored in was salvaged, so we were able to get all those records down so they can get medications for all the displaced people.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/15/los-angeles-fires-california-wildfire-live-updates-wednesday/77703668007/", "title": "LA fire crews make progress but dangers remain; EPA hazmat ...", "text": "Editor's note: This file captures the news of the California wildfires from Wednesday, Jan. 15. For the latest updates on the LA fires, follow USA TODAY's live coverage for Thursday, Jan. 16.\n\nPASADENA, Calif. − Firefighters were battling two monstrous wildfires Wednesday as weary residents across Los Angeles County stayed alert for another round of the Santa Ana winds that have fanned the flames of a catastrophe unfolding across sprawling, once-picturesque communities.\n\nWinds were weaker than predicted Tuesday, and firefighting crews made progress containing the deadly blazes. The National Weather Service office in Los Angeles said around 2 p.m. PT Wednesday that the winds had started to die down − no major new fires were reported to that point − and red flag warnings would expire in most areas by 6 p.m.\n\nStill, Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said residents eager to return to evacuated areas must remain patient.\n\n\"We understand your desire to return to your communities,\" Crowley said at a briefing Wednesday. \"However, significant safety and infrastructure issues remain, including downed power lines, broken gas lines, hazardous materials, unsafe water.\"\n\nThere were some positive developments amid the ongoing tragedy.\n\n\"The good news is that the winds through the Santa Monica mountains will be focused on the western third of the range far away from the Palisades Fire,\" the weather service said in a forecast discussion. \"The really good news is that today will be the last really windy day.\"\n\nAt least 25 people have died in the fires. About 82,400 county residents remained under mandatory evacuation orders and another 90,400 were under evacuation warnings, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Wednesday.\n\nGet weather and fire alerts via text: Sign up to get current wildfire updates by location\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The fire department in San Bernardino County, due east of L.A. County, said it responded Wednesday afternoon to a brush fire that quickly burned 30 acres in a mountainous area and could threaten structures. The Little Mountain Fire's progress had been stopped with no injuries or structural damage reported but it remained 0% contained, Cal Fire said Wednesday evening.\n\n∎ The Palisades Fire was 21% contained after consuming 37 square miles , Cal Fire said in an update Wednesday evening. The Eaton Fire has decimated over 22 square miles of Pasadena and Altadena and was 45% contained. The fire was expected to remain \"within its current footprint,\" Cal Fire said.\n\n∎ Firefighters made significant progress on the Hurst and Auto fires. The Hurst Fire was 98% contained, according to CalFire. The Auto Fire has burned 61 acres and was 85% contained, Cal Fire said. Forward progress on the fire that began Monday evening in Ventura County was stopped,the department said.\n\n∎ Cooler temperatures and a reduced fire threat are expected for the Los Angeles area the rest of this week, but the chances of red flag warnings for L.A. and Ventura counties jump back up to 60% Monday, the weather service said.\n\n∎ Hilton and American Express announced Wednesday that they will make 20,000 hotel room nights available \"at no charge\" for people displaced by the wildfires in Los Angeles County. Hilton said it is working with 211 LA, a local non-profit organization, to coordinate the distribution of rooms.\n\n∎ A coalition of Los Angeles arts organizations and philanthropists, led by the J.

Gavin Newsom announced. According to EPA incident commander Tara Fitzgerald, crews will remove household hazardous waste from parcels.\n\n\"Once teams complete the removal of explosive and highly toxic materials, residents will be one step closer on the road to recovery,\" Newsom said in a statement on X.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Health Officer issued a new order prohibiting the cleanup or removal of fire debris from damaged and burned properties until a hazardous materials inspection is completed by an approved government agency.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health noted that the order only applies to fire debris and does not restrict the removal of personal property from residential areas.\n\nSource of fires unknown, but clues emerge\n\nIt has been well established that strong winds, low humidity and drought contributed in a major way to the Los Angeles County fires. What remains elusive is the cause of their ignition.\n\nOfficials say they're still investigating what started the fires, but new lawsuits and eyewitness accounts offer an inkling of some possible sources of the sparks that set off the infernos.\n\nInvestigators looking into the Palisades Fire are focusing on a ridgeline in western Los Angeles where the fire is believed to have started, in the same area where a New Year's Day blaze was ignited by fireworks, according to media reports. The Los Angeles Fire Department contained the fire, but reignition under such dry conditions, even weeks later, is always a concern.\n\nThe Eaton Fire in the Altadena community has been the source of several lawsuits alleging the equipment of power company Southern California Edison ignited the flames. The utility said it had not been informed its equipment could have caused the fire.\n\nReport: LA Mayor Bass was at party in Ghana when fire started\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who has been severely criticized for being away on an international mission when the fire crisis began at home, was attending an embassy cocktail party in Ghana as the Palisades Fire ripped through the community, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nBass had joined a Biden administration delegation traveling to the inauguration of the Ghanaian president, and \"by the time she departed the gathering for her flight home, massive plumes of smoke were visible across a wide swath of (Los Angeles),'' the newspaper wrote.\n\nThough Bass couldn't have known the Palisades and then the Eaton fires would ravage parts of the city in her absence, the Times pointed out that she headed to the African country on Jan. 4 despite National Weather Service warnings about intense winds that exacerbated fire danger.\n\nBass, a former U.S. representative, had said early in her mayoral campaign she would forsake international travel − an activity she relished − if elected as Los Angeles' leader.\n\nDisney plays fairy godmother, opens wardrobe warehouse to employees\n\nThe Walt Disney Company is offering a spoonful of sugar to employees impacted by the fires raging north of Disneyland.\n\nDisney Entertainment Television invited employees - and their families - who lost their homes in the fires to pick up new clothes and shoes from the production company's wardrobe warehouse in Hollywood, according to a Disney release. The employees and their families can keep the items.\n\n“Most companies are not sitting on an entire warehouse full of wardrobe — some of which has been barely used, if it’s been used at all,” said Heidi Chong, Vice President of Production Shared Services for Disney Entertainment Television. “We really want to emphasize to the families: ‘If you come here, we’ve already organized everything for you. It’s all on display on the racks. You can find what you need.’ There are no limits to the amounts that people are getting; it’s really about what they need.”\n\nThe wardrobe items include fits from the following productions: Genius: MLK/X, grown-ish, The Old Man, Station 19, UnPrisoned, and Wizards Beyond Waverly Place, Disney said.\n\nHot wheels unscathed by fires\n\nThe wildfires decimating Los Angeles-area neighborhoods, businesses and cultural institutions left at least some precious things unscathed: classic cars.\n\nPhotos taken after wildfires decimated houses in storied communities from the Pacific Palisades to Altadena show vintage rides from baby blue Fords to early Volkswagen Beetles untouched by the flames.\n\nThe mint-condition cars stand in stark contrast to the apocalyptic landscapes.\n\nAccused arsonist reportedly said she 'enjoyed causing chaos'\n\nPeople are setting fires in the region even as major fires burn. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said Wednesday that suspects were arrested on arson charges for small fires in Irwindale and Industry.\n\nIn the city of Los Angeles, Police Chief Jim McDonnell released details on two arson arrests, including one man who admitted setting a tree on fire and told officers he likes the smell of burning leaves. Later, a woman suspected of setting fire to multiple trash piles told officers she \"enjoyed causing chaos and destruction,\" McDonnell said.\n\n\"There are people out there; this is what they do,\" McDonnell said. \"If you know of these people, please give us a call before something really bad happens.\"\n\nPartners ride out the Eaton Fire in Pasadena\n\nPartners Robert Bullock and David Anderson stayed in their historic home just outside Pasadena as the Eaton Fire flared up last week. Although their home was inside the mandatory evacuation zone, they wanted to protect their home from burning embers that landed in their yard and on their roof.\n\n“If we were a house in the middle of the forest and the forest was burning, then I could see abandoning it, but I couldn’t see it otherwise,” Bullock said.\n\nBut as the flames receded, Bullock and Anderson had to contend with people who appeared to be looters, who swept into their neighborhood seemingly for no other reason than to take advantage of the empty homes. The pair relied on a rifle purchased about two years ago for their own security but were unable to fall asleep the first night of the fires.\n\n“The first two nights were terrible,” Bullock said, noting he could hear the booms of propane tanks and ammunition exploding in the distance as the fire raged. “It sounded like Iraq.”\n\nPacific Palisades residents sue Los Angeles water agency\n\nMore than a dozen victims of the Pacific Palisades wildfire are suing a public utility for water supply failures they say contributed to the devastation of the Los Angeles inferno. The lawsuit, filed by residents and a pizzeria owner in the now devastated Los Angeles area, blames the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power − LADWP − for hydrants drying up within hours of the blaze's ignition. The plaintiffs said they all lost their homes or businesses to the inferno.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has announced an investigation into LADWP's water supply failures, while the utility says its water system was pushed past its limit from the massive blazes. The agency blamed the water shortages on \"unprecedented and extreme water demand\" that hampered efforts to refill water tanks and some hydrants.\n\n\"As soon as LADWP identified the risk of losing water in the tanks and water pressure in the system, we immediately deployed potable water tankers to sustain support for firefighting efforts,\" the ageny said in a statement.

Cal Fire, however, said an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook claims random people can come to California to join a cleanup crew in areas affected by the fires.\n\n\"This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available,\" Cal Fire said in a statement. \"We kindly ask that you refrain from calling in to inquire about this.\"\n\nCritical fire weather, high winds in store for LA area next week\n\nThe latest round of strong Santa Ana winds is expected to abate later this week and over the weekend, but forecasters say the reprieve won't last long as windstorms could return to the Los Angeles area next week. From Jan. 22 to Jan. 25, “another round of Santa Ana winds may emerge, coupled with anomalously dry weather conditions,” the National Weather Service said in a forecast, adding that “the exact timing and magnitude remain uncertain.”\n\nCritical red flag warnings across much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties were set to expire Wednesday evening. Fire weather warnings over a mountainous area north of Los Angeles were extended into Thursday.\n\nLA area could see more power shutoffs amid strong winds\n\nMore than 90,000 homes and businesses in Southern California were without power Wednesday, including more than 30,000 in Los Angeles County and 32,000 in neighboring San Bernardino County. Additionally, residents in areas at risk for wildfires could experience power shutoffs this week as Los Angeles remains under a critical red flag warning, the city’s water and power department said.\n\nThe department asked residents across the region, especially those living in mountainous areas, to prepare for power outages by charging their phones and keeping a flashlight and extra batteries handy.\n\n“Local fire authorities may ask LADWP to de-energize power lines as a preventative measure, to help prevent wildfires and protect communities,” the Los Angeles Water and Power Department said in a statement.\n\nRestoration may not happen quickly for those who lose power: “LADWP crews may not be able to automatically re-energize power lines serving your home or business,” the department said. “LADWP is taking these steps to protect public safety.”\n\nWhat schools are open in Los Angeles?\n\nThousands of students across Los Angeles County attend schools that were destroyed or damaged by the wildfires. While most schools in the Los Angeles area continued to welcome students back into their classrooms Wednesday, some remained closed as the return of strong winds threatened to stoke the blazes again.\n\nThe Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest school district in the nation, reopened most of its schools on Monday and has since announced it may start to resume activities such as recess, outdoor PE classes and athletics this week.\n\nNot all schools have reopened since the fires began last week. The Pasadena Unified School District, which serves about 14,000 students, is not set to resume classes until at least next Monday.\n\nUndergraduate and graduate classes at the University of California, Los Angeles, will remain online through Friday.\n\nLA fires damaged at least 12 schools: Here's what we know\n\nAnguished families struggle to retrieve pets\n\nThe wildfires gave triggered a massive pet-rescue effort, and Krissy Simmel is among the unofficial volunteers on its front lines.\n\nErik Morentin, a 35-year-old non-profit consultant, drove to Pacific Palisades last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday trying to rescue cats belonging to his aging mother-in-law and her roommate. Morentin told USA TODAY he was turned away each day while being told residents could enter only to retrieve medication, not pets. On Friday, Morentin said, he was ready to give up.\n\nThat's when Simmel stepped in, persuading security to allow her to bring Morentin to the home. It was intact and the cats were alive, Morentin said.\n\n“I ran back to Sunset (Boulevard) and Krissy met me up in her Jeep, and it was just completely overwhelming,’’ he said. “I just said, ‘Thank you so much. You just saved these cats' lives.’ ” Read more here.\n\n− Josh Peter\n\nSpiders, fish and oysters saved: These pet rescuers are capturing hearts amid the LA fires\n\nAuthorities search for missing people\n\nAt least 25 people have been killed in the wildfires, according to an update from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner, which initially reported an additional death from the Eaton Fire on Tuesday that was later determined to be non-human remains.\n\nBy Tuesday night, the county medical examiner attributed another death to the Palisades Fire. In total, the Eaton Fire has killed at least 16 people while the Palisades Fire has left at least nine others dead.\n\nSearch and rescue operations remained ongoing as local authorities continued going door-to-door to find missing victims.

The Los Angeles Fire Department said it is still investigating the cause of the fires as of Jan. 13.\n\nSupposed link between fires and MAGA supporters is baseless\n\nA set of deadly wildfires continues to rage across Los Angeles County, with the Palisades Fire ranking as the most destructive in the county's history. The fires destroyed more than 12,000 businesses, houses and other structures, displaced nearly 180,000 residents and killed at least 24 people as of Jan. 13.But neither the LAPD nor the Los Angeles Fire Department have linked the fires to any \"persons of interest\" related to a MAGA website.\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone and Chief Deputy of Emergency Operations Jon O'Brien said in Jan. 8 and 9 press conferences the cause of the fires is unknown and still under investigation. O'Brien said the department would announce the cause as soon as it is determined.\n\nThe LAPD did arrest a man Jan. 9 after he was seen trying to start a fire in an area that was burning in the Kenneth fire, the Los Angeles Times reported. The man was arrested on suspicion of a probation violation, but a Ventura County Sheriff's Department spokesperson said the man is a \"person of interest\" in the fire, which began near the Ventura and Los Angeles county line, the newspaper reported. That fire was 100% contained as of Jan. 12. There was no indication the man had any ties to a MAGA website. The arrest happened after the Threads post was published.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection lists the causes of the fires as \"under investigation\" on its website.\n\nFact check: Was Hollywood Sign surrounded by fire?

About 84% of Los Angeles County was experiencing a drought prior to the fires, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.\n\nUSA TODAY reported the fires were fueled by the Santa Ana winds, which occur most often in the fall and winter and push dry air from the California and the Southwest deserts toward the coast.

Alex Padilla, D-Calif., one of her chief antagonists, said as that hearing ended. \"Today, Pam Bondi demonstrated exactly why she is an excellent choice to serve as the next Attorney General of the United States,\" the Trump transition team said in a statement.\n\nOther Trump appointees gliding toward likely confirmation included Marco Rubio for secretary of state; John Ratcliffe, CIA director; Sean Duffy, transportation secretary; Chris Wright, energy secretary; and Russell Vought, to lead the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY for a day of pivotal hearings.\n\nConfirmapalooza closes: Trump's nominees in good shape\n\nWith the end of Russell Vought's hearing before the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, that's it for Wednesday's Senate marathon. Most of Trump's choices enjoyed at least a measure of bipartisan support and Pam Bondi, his prospective Attorney General, easily navigated through rough questioning from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nHearings will continue Thursday with questioning of witnesses in Bondi's confirmation, and hearings for Scott Bessent, Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary and former North Dakota Gov.

Marco Rubio, Trump's prospective Secretary of State, indirectly addressed the president-elect's threats to reclaim the Panama Canal, possibly by force, over concerns about Chinese influence over the waterway.\n\nRubio said he hadn't yet looked into the legality of reclaiming the canal.\n\n“But I'm compelled to suspect that an argument could be made that the terms under which that canal were turned over have been violated, because while technically, sovereignty over the canal has not been turned over to a foreign power, in reality, a foreign power today possesses… through their companies − which we know are not independent − the ability to turn the canal into a choke point in a moment of conflict,\" Rubio said.\n\n\"And that is a direct threat to the interests and the national security of the United States.\"\n\nAt the same time, Panama has been a \"great partner\" to the U.S. in other areas, he told senators. \"And I hope we can resolve this issue of the canal.\"\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nBarely a peep about Project 2025 at Vought hearing\n\nRussell Vought, tapped to once again lead the Office of Management and Budget under Trump, helped contribute to the controversial and sweeping conservative policy blueprint known as Project 2025. The document was a Democratic rallying cry during the 2024 campaign and Trump was forced to disavow it.\n\nHowever, Vought faced little questioning on the document at his confirmation hearing Wednesday.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., noted in his opening statements that Vought is “one of the architects of Project 2025,” having written a 25-page chapter on executive power. The Michigan senator said he has “serious questions” about Vought’s candidacy for a myriad of other reasons.\n\nOtherwise, Democratic senators largely focused on issues such as Vought's views on Congress’ power of the purse and his appetite for disagreement with Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans were predominantly concerned with federal spending and asked Vought his plans to decrease it.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nBondi hearing wraps; senators expect confirmation\n\nSenators finished their questioning of Pam Bondi on Wednesday after nearly five and half hours.

Adam Schiff, who had been another harsh questioner of Pam Bondi, Trump’s choice to become attorney general, asked for her help prosecuting arsonists, looters, fraudsters and price gougers in the aftermath of the California wildfires.\n\n“I hope you will demonstrate a willingness to go after anyone who is engaged in price gouging,” said Schiff, D-Calif. “The price at the pump in California is through the roof. Are you willing to take on even powerful interests like the oil industry if you determine that they are gouging consumers?”\n\nBondi reminded Schiff she represented Florida as attorney general during the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. She said she could help fight crime throughout the state.\n\n“Crime is rampant in California and it’s only going to get worse based on these fires,” Bondi said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump’s pick for budget director faces questions on abortion\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asked Vought a series of questions related to “policies of life,” or the issue of abortion, including whether abortion providers should be excluded from federal grant money and if pregnancy resource centers, known for their opposition to abortions, should in turn be entitled to government funding.\n\n“The president has made his views on abortion really clear throughout the administration, the campaign,” Vought said. “I’m not going to get ahead of the president with regard to the budget process.”\n\nTrump has celebrated his role in appointing three conservative Supreme Court justices who were crucial in overturning Roe v. Wade. But he waffled during the 2024 election on some abortion issues, at one point seemingly suggesting he would vote in favor of a pro-abortion access ballot measure in Florida, before eventually clarifying his opposition.\n\n“Again, the president’s a pro-life president. He had a very pro-life record,” Vought said Wednesday. “I think the country has a good sense of where he is on the issues.”\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nBondi says her hope is to 'restore integrity' to DOJ as polls show polarization\n\nAsked by Republican Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt about her overall vision for the Justice Department, Bondi said she plans to surround herself with \"great people\" and look at different parts of the department, but \"first and foremost,\" she wants to \"keep America safe and restore integrity to that department.\n\n\"I don't think I can stress enough that 72% of Americans have lost faith in the Department of Justice,\" Bondi said.\n\nBondi didn't explain the source of that statistic, but polls indicate American views on the department may be polarized based on which presidency it falls under.\n\nOnly 17% of U.S. adults are either \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident that the Justice Department will act in a fair and nonpartisan way in Trump's second term, according to a new poll from the Associated-Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Another 32% are somewhat confident.\n\nRepublicans views of DOJ grew more critical in recent times, according to a July Pew Research Center survey. It found 56% Republicans and Republican-leaning independents had an unfavorable view of the department, up from 50% the year before. By contrast, only about a third of Democrats and Democratic leaners had an unfavorable view.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nStrings attached for Trump wildfire aid?\n\nSen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., pressed Russell Vought, Trump's choice to run the White House Office of Management and Budget, on whether, if confirmed, he would ensure that federal grants do not hinge on a grantee’s political affiliation – or a state’s political makeup.\n\n“So, if the president says to you, ‘I don’t care what the law says, I don’t like California, and I’m not going to give them the disaster aid they need,’” Hassan asked, “you’re going to stand up to the president and say, ‘Sir that’s not appropriate’?”\n\nTrump has threatened to put conditions on disaster aid to California in the wake of deadly and devastating fires in the Los Angeles area. Some House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have signaled interest in the same.\n\n“Senator, I don’t engage in hypotheticals, but the president would never ask me to do something along those lines,” Vought told Hassan Wednesday.\n\n“Well, history speaks a little bit differently to that point,” Hassan replied.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nBipartisan support for Ratcliffe CIA bid\n\nJohn Ratcliffe won bipartisan support on the Senate Intelligence Committee as he widespread reforms the CIA and promised he would not hire or fire employees based on their political views.\n\nRatcliffe’s pledge, made repeatedly in response to questions from committee Democrats, may put him at odds with Trump and some of the president-elect's other national security picks who have vowed to test intelligence officials based on their support of Trump.\n\nBut Ratcliffe, citing his time as Director of National Intelligence in Trump's first administration, said he will not waver.\n\n\"If you look at my record as DNI, that never took place. That is never something anyone has alleged, and it is something that I would never do,\" Ratcliffe told the committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.\n\n−Josh Meyer\n\nBondi ‘terrified’ of potential ISIS attack\n\nPam Bondi, Trump’s choice for attorney general, told her Senate confirmation hearing she is “terrified” of a potential ISIS attack on the United States.\n\nA U.S. citizen who claimed membership in ISIS rammed a rental truck into a crowd in New Orleans on Jan. 1 and killed 14 people.\n\nFormer FBI Director Christopher Wray told CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday a threat like that inspired from afar is one of the most challenging types of terrorist the agency faces.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked whether Bondi worried about an attack on the homeland by ISIS or its affiliates.\n\n“Only from the public reporting that I’ve seen, I’m terrified,” said Bondi, who does not yet have a security clearance.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nBondi calls Schiff ‘reckless’\n\nAnother feisty exchange erupted between Sen. Adam Schiff and Pam Bondi, Trump’s choice to become attorney general, over whether she would investigate or destroy evidence from the investigation of the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Are you frightened because evidence was destroyed against President Trump that was false?” Bondi replied. “I can’t believe you’re asking such a question.”\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., who investigated the Jan. 6 attack while serving in the House, said a Supreme Court decision granting presidents immunity for official acts could allow Trump to order the investigate former special counsel Jack Smith. Schiff asked Bondi if she would investigate Smith, secured an indictment against Trump that was dismissed after he won the election.\n\nBondi said it would be irresponsible to answer but that politics would play no role in prosecutions.\n\nThe exchange grew more heated as Schiff accused her of being unable to tell Trump who won the 2020 election or not to pardon Jan. 6 defendants.\n\n“You were censured by Congress, senator, for comments like this, that are so reckless,” Bondi said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nDuffy dismisses concerns about Project 2025\n\nTowards the end of the Transportation Secretary confirmation hearing, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., raised concerns about Project 2025, an extensive 920-page plan put together by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, that aims to reshape the federal government. She asked Duffy whether he assures he won’t prioritize actions in Project 2025 that would undermine safety for consumer protections.\n\nBut Duffy waved off her concerns, saying that Project 2025 is not Trump’s agenda.\n\n“I have never read Project 2025, so I'm not sure what's in it, but the president's going to decide policy, and he made me the secretary…the President stepped away from it. It's not part of - it hasn't been part of his agenda,\" he said.\n\nThough Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025, which critics have called “authoritarian,” many officials from his previous administration helped work up the plan.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBondi clashes with Padilla, says won’t be bullied\n\nA fiery clash erupted when Sen. Alex Padilla asked Pam Bondi, Trump’s choice for attorney general, repeatedly about elections and immigration, seeking yes or no answers, and cut off her longer attempts to answer.\n\nBondi had traveled to Philadelphia a day after the 2020 election to claim Trump had won Pennsylvania while votes were still being counted. President Joe Biden eventually won the state.\n\nPadilla, D-Calif., asked whether Bondi had any evidence of election fraud or wanted to retract her statement, yes or no. But Bondi couldn’t get a word in edgewise as he interrupted.\n\n“You pointed your finger at me said you were speaking,” Bondi said. “I’m not going to be bullied by you Sen. Padilla.”\n\nPadilla also asked about her familiarity with the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides citizenship to people born in the U.S.\n\n“Senator, I’m here to answer your questions, I’m not here to do your homework and study for you,” Bondi said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Russell Vought?\n\nRussell Vought served as Office of Management and Budget director in Trump’s first term. The president-elect tapped Vought, 48, to return to the position and once again oversee the president’s budget, federal regulations and the White House’s coordination with government agencies.\n\nBetween Trump administrations, Vought founded the Center for Renewing America, an advocacy group dedicated to furthering the GOP leader’s agenda.\n\nHe is also credited as author of a 25-page chapter on executive power for Project 2025 – which Trump repeatedly denied association with throughout his 2024 campaign. Democrats are expected to press him on the controversial policy blueprint in today’s hearing.\n\nVought appears this afternoon before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, led by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nBondi: 'No one will be prosecuted, investigated because they are a political opponent.'\n\nBondi said Wednesday that she hasn't had any discussions with President-elect Donald Trump about seeking to prosecute President Joe Biden or members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, including now-California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney.\n\nBondi was responding to questions from Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch, who asked for her assurance that the Justice Department won't try to pursue political adversaries over the next four years.\n\nIn August, Trump shared memes on his Truth Social media platform calling for the House committee to be indicted and depicting Biden and other political rivals in jumpsuits.\n\n\"Every case will be done on a case-by-case basis,\" Bondi said. \"No one should be prosecuted for political purposes. Absolutely not.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDuffy says he’d allow Musk’s Tesla vehicles to continue to be investigated\n\nTransportation Secretary nominee Sean Duffy said that he’d allow the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to continue its investigation into Tesla vehicles, regardless of outside political pressure, when asked by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.\n\nThe investigation came after reports of multiple crashes caused by a feature that allows drivers to control their cars remotely.\n\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has become an influential voice in the incoming Trump administration and a member of Trump’s inner circle.\n\n“Yes, I commit to this committee and to you that I will let (NHTSA) do their investigation. And I think I also mentioned to you that a lot of the players in these spaces, I haven't met any of them,” Duffy said. “So yes, it's going to be a lot of pressure here.”\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRubio: U.S. position on Ukraine war is not realistic, concessions must be made\n\nSecretary of State nominee Marco Rubio argued it should be the official position of the United States that the Ukraine-Russia war should be brought to an end. Rubio, currently a Florida GOP senator, also defended Trump’s push for accelerated negotiations.\n\nThe Biden administration's approach to the war on Ukraine aid is “not a realistic” position, Rubio said, nor is it realistic to believe that Ukraine will be able to forcibly remove troops from a nation the size of Russia from the territory it has taken.\n\n“Now what that master plan looks like is going to be hard work,” he said. “My hope is that it can begin with some cease fire.”\n\nRubio also told his Senate colleagues: “There will have to be concessions made by the Russian Federation, but also by the Ukrainians…It's also important that there be some balance on both sides.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nDemocratic senators target Trump FBI pick Kash Patel at Bondi hearing\n\nSpeaking at Pam Bondi's confirmation hearing, Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she has \"serious concerns\" about Trump's pick to head the FBI, Kash Patel. Patel's confirmation hearing hasn't yet been scheduled.\n\nKlobuchar voiced alarm about comments from Patel that the FBI's intelligence division is \"the biggest problem\" the bureau – which falls within the Justice Department – has had.\n\n\"I have not seen those comments from Mr. Patel,\" Bondi responded. \" I would review them, but we have to do everything we can to protect our country. Again, Mr. Patel would fall under me and the Department of Justice, and I will ensure that all laws are followed, and so will he.\"\n\nKlobuchar suggested that assurance wasn't enough.\n\n\"While I agree you would be the boss of Kash Patel, I'm not sure that you would be able to intervene with every decision or position that he had, or know what he's doing,\" Klobuchar said.\n\nLater, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut also questioned Patel's fitness, pointing to comments from Patel on a list of people belonging to the \"deep state\" that he thinks should be targeted.\n\nBondi said if both she and Patel are confirmed, he will follow the law.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRubio warns ICC could try to arrest Americans next\n\nThe International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes is a “test run” of its power to prosecute the head of state of nonmember nations that could be used against the United States in the future, Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio warned at his confirmation hearing.\n\nIf the ICC doesn’t drop this, he said, its credibility will be damaged. “And I think the United States should be very concerned, because I believe this is a test run for applying it to American service members and American leaders in the future.”\n\nNeither Israel nor the United States are party to the international treaty that established the ICC.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nDuffy adds possible Hawaii and Alaska trips to his to-do list\n\nTrump Transportation Secretary nominee Sean Duffy made clear with Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, that he would work in a bipartisan fashion as it relates to transportation policy. However, he also joked with the Democrat.\n\n“I think you mandated that I go to Hawaii to see you,” Duffy said, to which Schatz replied, “I'll issue my demand letter shortly.”\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, later invited Duffy on a trip to Alaska, saying he can bring his family and go salmon fishing. “Maybe you go after your trip to Hawaii, but will you come to my state and see these challenges, because they're real challenges,” he asked.\n\n“I would come to Alaska, and I promise you, I will not sing…I sang to him in the office,” Duffy said.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBoeing mid-air scare takes center stage in Transportation hearing\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican senators pressed Sean Duffy, Donald Trump's choice for Transportation Secretary, how he plans to improve Boeing after an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet lost a door panel mid-flight last year. The Federal Aviation Administration has maintained tougher oversight over Boeing since the incident.\n\nSen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, asked what steps Duffy would take to get Boeing back on track.\n\n“You have to push the FAA to make sure they're implementing their safety plan,” said Duffy.\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell, of Washington − home to Boeing − said the Federal Aviation Administration under prior administrations hasn’t pushed for a strong safety management culture. Duffy said if that's what it takes to get a \"better safety record at Boeing, I'm on board.\"\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBondi can’t talk about TikTok ban\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked Bondi if she would enforce the congressional ban on TikTok that goes into effect Sunday if the social media company isn’t divested from its Chinese parent, ByteDance.\n\nTrump has said he would “save” TikTok and the solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, represented TikTok while asking the Supreme Court to delay implementation of the law.\n\n“I can’t discuss pending litigation,” Bondi said. “But I will talk to all the career officials – prosecutors – who are handling the case, absolutely.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump energy pick pushes fossil fuels\n\nChris Wright, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the Energy Department, told senators in his confirmation hearing on Wednesday his first priority is expanding domestic energy production including liquefied natural gas and nuclear power.\n\nWright, 60, believes fossil fuels are the key to ending world poverty, which is a greater problem than climate change's \"distant\" threat, according to a report he wrote as CEO of oilfield services company Liberty Energy.\n\nThe hearing was briefly stopped several times by protesters, with at least one shouting about the deadly fires in Los Angeles and the role fossil fuels play in global warming.\n\nWright supports some fossil fuel alternatives, such as small nuclear power reactors, which are not yet commercially available, and geothermal power. But he has criticized solar and wind power as insufficient.\n\n−Reuters\n\nRubio's opening remarks draw protests, laughs\n\nSen. Marco Rubio’s introductory remarks were interrupted three times by protesters, who were quickly escorted out of the hearing room. One shouted in Spanish at Rubio – who is Cuban-American – prompting him to joke that he gets bilingual protests.\n\n“That’s a first here for us, at least in recent times,” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, replied to laughter.\n\nRisch also said he had a goodbye gift for his colleague as the hearing got underway. It is expected to be Rubio’s last with the committee, of which he is also a member, before he joins the Trump administration.\n\n“I thank you, and I hope I can earn your support, whether it's because you believe I would do a good job, or because you want to get rid of me,” Rubio told senators as he concluded his remarks.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nBondi: ‘Politics will not play a part’ in Justice Department\n\nAnother former prosecutor, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said attorneys general of both parties prevented White House interference with criminal investigations and asked Bondi if she would continue that policy.\n\n“Yes, I believe that the Justice Department must be independent and must act independently,” Bondi said. “The No. 1 job is to enforce the law fairly and evenhandedly, and that’s what will be done if I am confirmed as the attorney general.”\n\n“Politics will not play a part,” Bondi added. “I’ve demonstrated that my entire career as a prosecutor, as attorney general and I will continue to do that.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\n'Great bipartisan love’: Sean Duffy’s hearing opens in a lighthearted manner\n\nSean Duffy, Trump’s transportation secretary pick, introduced his family, including his five-year-old daughter Valentina, to senators in his opening remarks.\n\nDuffy resigned from Congress in 2019 a few months before Valentina was born, announcing that he had learned she had health issues, including a heart condition, and that he wanted to support his family. She was born with Down syndrome.\n\n“She, no doubt, is our family's favorite,” he said. “She was hugging Senator Baldwin on the way in, showing great bipartisan love. Hopefully, she'll be behaved for the hearing today.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDurbin asks Bondi about pardons for Jan. 6 defendants\n\nCiting President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to pardon defendants from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked Bondi if she would support clemency for people who attacked police officers.\n\n“I have not seen any of those files, of course,” Bondi said. \"If confirmed and if asked to advise the president, I will look at each and every file.”\n\n“I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country,” Bondi added.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWatch live: Confirmation hearings for Marco Rubio, John Ratcliffe and Sean Duffy\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee tells Trump CIA nominee Ratcliffe change is needed\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee opened its nomination hearing for John Ratcliffe, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CIA, by saying it needs to do more to address a range of global threats.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., the committee chair, kicked things off by saying the CIA has repeatedly failedin its core mission of “stealing secrets … handling spies … hacking computers.”\n\n“Suffice it to say, we’re too often in the dark,” Cotton said, citing the intelligence community’s failure to predict the fall of Syrian strongman Bashar Assad and other geopolitical events. “The CIA must get back to its roots.\"\n\nRatcliffe is considered well-qualified for the job and an easy confirmation for what is essentially the top operational intelligence position in the government. He served as Director of National Intelligence during Trump’s first term, which oversees all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies including the CIA.\n\nRatcliffe is also a former federal prosecutor and was a staunch Trump ally during his time representing Texas, where he was a member of the House Intelligence Committee. If approved, he will succeed outgoing CIA Director William Burns.\n\n−Josh Meyer\n\nBondi won't say Joe Biden won 2020 election\n\nBondi refused to say President Joe Biden won the 2020 election, although she acknowledged he \"was duly sworn in.\"\n\nThe refusal came after Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois pressed her on the topic.\n\n\"I accept, of course, that Joe Biden is President of the United States, but what I can tell you is what I saw firsthand when I went to Pennsylvania as an advocate for the campaign,\" Bondi said.\n\nIn 2020, Bondi helped fuel Trump's false claims that widespread fraud stole the election when she spoke at a press conference in Pennsylvania alongside Eric Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. There, as votes were still being counted, Bondi said she was concerned about poll watchers gaining access election sites and falsely claimed, \"We've won Pennsylvania and we want every vote to be counted in a fair way.\"\n\nResults showed Joe Biden won Pennsylvania. Numerous recounts and audits have since confirmed Biden's 2020 victory. Bondi didn't cite any specifics Wednesday as she refused to rebut Trump's false claims about the 2020 voting outcome.\n\n\"I was an advocate for the campaign, and I was on the ground in Pennsylvania, and I saw many things there. But do I accept the results? Of course, I do,\" Bondi said.\n\n\"Do I agree with what happened, and...\" Bondi continued, trailing off. \"I saw so much.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDurbin asks Bondi about potential lobbying conflicts\n\nThe top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, asked Bondi how she would deal with potential conflicts involving former clients from her lobbying at Ballard Partners.\n\nThe firm was paid $115,000 per month for a period by the government of Qatar. Bondi said many people worked under the contract and that she was proud of her work against human trafficking leading up to the World Cup.\n\nDurbin also asked about a potential conflict with the GEO Group, a private prison company he said stands to receive millions of dollars from detaining immigrants under President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for mass deportations.\n\n“If there are any conflicts with anyone I represented in private practice, I would consult with the career ethics officials within the department and make the appropriate decision,” Bondi said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nBondi pledges ‘one tier of justice for all’\n\nIn her opening statement, Bondi said she would fight every day to restore confidence and integrity at the Justice Department.\n\nGrassley, R-Iowa, had complained about the “weaponization” of the department leading to investigations of protesters at abortion clinics and at school board meetings. Republicans have also alleged a two-tier system of justice that treats defendants differently.\n\n“The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone,” Bondi said. “America will have one tier of justice for all.”\n\nBondi began by introducing a slew of relatives in the audience and reeled off the names of five female friends and mentioned former coworkers.\n\n“Ranking member Durbin, if you want to get dirt on me, these women have known me since I was a child,” Bondi said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\n'Rot infesting the Department of Justice': Grassley opens with litany of GOP grievances\n\nGrassley's opening remarks laid out a litany of Republican grievances against the Justice Department and the FBI, including investigations of Donald Trump that led to two federal indictments of the now president-elect.\n\nThe committee's chairman accused the department of leaking information from special counsel Robert Mueller's 2016-2019 investigation into Russian election interference as recently as last August to hurt Trump's 2024 election chances − while \"stiff-arming\" congressional requests for information that would embarrass the Biden administration.\n\nGrassley assailed what he said were prosecutions of people peacefully praying outside an abortion clinic and investigations into parents who expressed concern about school curriculum choices and COVID-19 mandates. He accused DOJ of putting \"undue pressure\" on social media platforms to censor users.\n\n\"These are only a few particularly egregious examples of rot infesting the Department of Justice,\" Grassley said. \"The impact to this political infection in our once storied law enforcement institutions is catastrophic\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDurbin: Would you tell President Trump 'No'?\n\nThe top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said he would question Pam Bondi about her independence from Trump after she joined him trying to overturn the 2020 election and repeatedly called investigations of him “witch hunts.”\n\n“This time around, President-elect Trump has vowed not just to use the Justice Department to advance his political interests, but also to seek ‘retribution’ against ‘the enemy within,’” Durbin said. “I need to know you would tell the president ‘No’ if you were asked to do something that is wrong, illegal or unconstitutional.”\n\nDurbin also planned to ask Bondi about her lobbying for major firms including Uber and Amazon, and the embassy of Qatar.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nAnd we're off\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, gavels in the first of a marathon of Wednesday confirmation hearings, with former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in the hotseat at the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDem senators are warm to Marco Rubio\n\nWhile Trump's second-term appointments include a number of controversial figures − think Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. − Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is at the other end of the trouble spectrum. His Senate colleagues like and trust him.\n\n“I think that will be the closest hearing that’s a lovefest of any of the confirmation hearings. I can't say that about the other ones,” Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said.\n\nA former presidential candidate and senator of 14 years who served as vice chair of the Senate's famously bipartisan intelligence committee, Rubio is one of Trump’s only Cabinet picks expected to win widespread Democratic support.\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, who chaired the Intelligence Committee when Rubio served as ranking member, praised Rubio in a statement as someone who would be a “strong voice for American interests around the globe.”\n\n“While we don't align on the issues of foreign policy, I know his values, I know his work ethic, there's so many things I respect about Sen. Rubio that make me very inclined to support him,” Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nWho is Pam Bondi?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department, ex-Florida Attorney General and corporate lobbyist Pam Bondi, is set to face formal questioning from senators as her confirmation hearing kicks off at 9 a.m.\n\nBondi, who was a defense lawyer for Trump in his first impeachment trial, is generally expected to be confirmed after Trump's controversial first pick – former Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz – dropped out. Gaetz faced accusations that he paid women for sex and had sex with a minor. Gaetz has said he gave money to women he dated and strongly denied having intercourse with someone underage.\n\nStill, Bondi could face tough questions about her significant corporate lobbying record and whether she is committed to the Justice Department's independence. Trump critics have expressed concern that he may seek prosecutions against his political rivals and personal foes following the four criminal cases he faced in recent years, which have largely dissolved in the wake of his November election victory.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\nHegseth wins key senator's support\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, who had been cool to Hegseth when Trump first named him in November, was cordial during his hearing and by Tuesday night announced her support.\n\n\"I will be supporting President Trump's pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth,\" Ernst told Iowa radio host Simon Conway.\n\nHegseth \"was adequately able to answer questions on the issues,\" she said.\n\nErnst, along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, was one of three Republican senators who seen as possible \"No\" votes. Republicans have a three-vote majority in the Senate, with Vice President-elect JD Vance as a tie-breaker after Jan. 20.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat time do the confirmation hearings start on Wednesday?\n\nThe hearings are set to begin with Pam Bondi at the Senate Judiciary Committee at 9:30 a.m.\n\nWhen is John Ratcliffe's confirmation hearing for CIA director?\n\nRatcliffe's hearing starts at 10 a.m.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/20/fire-advances-general-sherman-flags-mark-virus-deaths-news-around-states/118840688/", "title": "Fire advances on General Sherman, 660K flags mark virus deaths ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state could see its shipments of monoclonal antibodies reduced as federal officials take over distribution to equitably dispense the limited life-saving resource amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the state health officer said. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the change was needed after just seven states – Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas – accounted for 70% of monoclonal antibody orders in the country. “Given this reality, we must work to ensure our supply of these life-saving therapies remains available for all states and territories, not just some,” the department said in a statement. The seven states are also among those that have the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday that federal officials told states providers would no longer be able to order the drugs directly but would have to place those orders through state health departments. “We are really sorry to say there are probably going to be some patients who aren’t able to access that drug who thought they were going to have that available to them,” Harris said. Doctors continue to emphasize that vaccination, rather than a secondary treatment after the fact, is the best way to prevent severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nAlaska\n\nJoint Base Elmendorf-Richardson: Military leaders on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson have declared a public health emergency and encouraged all personnel to avoid places that do not require masks or social distancing in response to increasing COVID-19 cases across the state, officials said. “We’ve all seen COVID-19 cases continue to spread rapidly across our nation, the state of Alaska and in our local community,” U.S. Air Force Col. Kirsten Aguilar, 673rd Air Base Wing and JBER commander, said in a statement Friday. “After close consultation with JBER mission commanders, I have decided to declare a Public Health Emergency.” Aguilar said the declaration will remain in effect for 30 days but could be shortened or extended based on cases and community transmission of COVID-19. The base has also transitioned to Health Protection Condition Bravo, which means Aguilar will be able to implement additional measures to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, “including restricting access to off-base establishments,” the statement said. Hospitalizations and COVID-19 cases throughout the state have increased as a result of the highly contagious delta variant. Alaska on Friday reported more than 1,200 newly confirmed cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Board members overseeing Arizona’s most populous county reached an agreement Friday evening with the Republican-controlled state Senate that will end a standoff over a Senate demand that they hand over computer routers for use in an unprecedented partisan election review. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors announced that a special master will take questions from the Senate’s election review contractors and provide them with information contained on the routers that they say they need to finish the election review. Supervisor Bill Gates said the deal will protect sensitive information contained on the routers while avoiding a massive penalty the county faced if they had not complied. Gates called the deal “a win for transparency, and it’s also a win for protecting sensitive data in Maricopa County.” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a decision last month that the county must comply with the subpoena issued by Republican Senate President Karen Fann or lose about $700 million in yearly state funding. The county agreed to drop a $2.8 million claim it filed with the Senate after election equipment it handed over to the auditor was decertified and needed to be replaced.\n\nArkansas\n\nRussellville: A former sheriff’s deputy was charged Friday with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists. A special prosecutor announced the felony charge against Michael Davis, a former sergeant with the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office, in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain. Davis faces between three and 10 years in prison if convicted. Davis shot Brittain during a June 23 traffic stop outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, a city of about 26,000 people roughly 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. Davis told investigators he shot Brittain once in the neck after the teen reached into the back of his truck and did not comply with his commands to show his hands, according to the arrest affidavit. Brittain was holding a container – which his family members have said held antifreeze – and no evidence of firearms was found in or near the truck, the affidavit said. A passenger with Brittain said he and the teen had been working on the transmission for Brittain’s truck. The passenger told investigators he never heard Davis tell the teen to show his hands. Davis, who is white, was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley in July for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThree Rivers: Hot, dry weather Sunday added to the challenges facing firefighters battling to keep flames from driving farther into a grove of ancient sequoias, where the base of General Sherman, the world’s largest tree, has been wrapped in protective foil. Fire officials warned that stronger winds were also contributing to “critical fire conditions” in the area of the KNP Complex, two lightning-sparked blazes that merged on the western side of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning through Sunday, saying gusts and lower humidity could create conditions for rapid wildfire spread. The fires forced the evacuation of the park last week, along with parts of Three Rivers, a foothill community of about 2,500 people. Crews have been bulldozing a line between the fire and the community. More than 34 square miles of forest land have been blackened. The National Park Service said Friday that flames had reached the westernmost tip of the Giant Forest, where it scorched a grouping of sequoias known as the “Four Guardsmen” that mark the entrance to the grove of 2,000 sequoias. Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires – fueled by climate change – can overwhelm the trees.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A civil rights investigation that was launched amid outrage over the death of Elijah McClain – a Black man put into a chokehold during an encounter with suburban Denver police two years ago – found a deeply ingrained culture of racially biased policing within the department, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. He said Wednesday that the investigation found the Aurora Police Department has long had a culture in which officers treat people of color, especially Black people, differently from white people. He said the agency also has a pattern of using unlawful excessive force, frequently escalates encounters with civilians, and fails to properly document police interactions with residents. It’s the latest mark against the Aurora department since Weiser’s office indicted three officers and two paramedics on manslaughter and other charges this month in connection with McClain’s death. “These actions are unacceptable. They hurt the people that law enforcement is entrusted” to serve, Weiser said. Police stopped McClain, a 23-year-old massage therapist, as he walked home from a store Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed “sketchy.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington: The town’s police force is warning residents to stay away from aggressive minks. In a recorded message sent to residents, Capt. Todd Olson of the Stonington Police Department urged people to stay away from a mink if they see one, The Day of New London reports. Olson said that even though they resemble a pet ferret, minks are territorial and are not friendly. One of them chased a person Wednesday, he said. Olson said the department’s animal control officer notified the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection about the minks, and the agency is looking into the situation. A mink farm once operated in the town.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: African folk music played through the Herman M. Holloway Sr. Park as the community gathered Saturday to participate in the 25th African American Family Festival. The festival, designed to celebrate “everything African,” also serves as an opportunity to raise awareness about social issues – including COVID-19. “We want to do good things for the people in our community so they don’t feel like all good things happen in majority-white neighborhoods,” said Harmon Carey, the event organizer. “A lot of African American festivals have moved away from the community, near white communities, or they have completely stopped doing events.” The aroma of African cuisines filled the park as children playfully jumped in a bounce house, and adults gathered around jewelry and clothing stalls, adorned with traditional African stones and colorful fabrics. A Mobile Health Unit set up by the Life Health Center conducted coronavirus tests and encouraged people to get vaccinated. “It is kind of a hit and miss, but every time I come out, I cross my fingers and hope that we get a good response,” said Kyme McCleary, a nurse at the mobile unit. The unit focused on vaccinating children ages 12 and up during the first half of the event, followed by adults for the later part of the day.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than 660,000 white flags are waving in the air on the National Mall, each honoring one American life that has ended due to COVID-19. The installation, called “In America: Remember,” covers more than 22 acres in 143 sections near the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, WUSA-TV reports. Volunteers from Ruppert Landscape installed the flags over the course of three days, completed Friday. The installation will be up for a total of three weeks, lasting until Oct. 3. Visitors are invited to get involved in the memorialization, come to the mall and personalize a flag for someone they have lost. Those who can’t make it in person can dedicate a flag virtually on the installation’s website. Artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg conceived the idea, beginning last fall with 267,080 flags placed outside RFK Stadium in Northeast D.C. Firstenberg – described as a “social action artist” based in the D.C. area, according to the installation’s website – has also spent 25 years participating in hospice volunteering.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: The mayor says officials will revamp a program that allowed police officers to notify landlords when their tenants had been arrested, even in cases in which charges were later dropped. The decision to reform Tampa’s Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program was announced by Mayor Jane Castor on Saturday following an investigation by the Tampa Bay Times that showed police officers were reporting tenants after arrests for misdemeanor crimes and the arrests of juveniles, and about 90% of the 1,100 people flagged by the program were Black tenants. Under the announced changes, the city will inform landlords only about “certain serious drug and violent felonies.” A police captain must sign off on notices sent, and landlords will be notified only about arrests that happen on their properties. The program was created in 2013 with the goal of stamping out drug and gang crime in apartment complexes. At its peak, about 100 apartment complexes were enrolled. While Castor touted the program as having “improved the safety and quality of life for tens of thousands of people,” Yvette Lewis, president of the Hillsborough County NAACP, said it could still violate a renter’s civil rights by resulting in an eviction based solely on an arrest. “This program needs to be stopped,” she said. “You’re treating housing as though it’s a privilege.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A disaster relief organization founded by actor Sean Penn is boosting the state’s drive to inoculate people against COVID-19, though some of its pop-up vaccine clinics have struggled to attract people. CORE has offered COVID-19 shots at hundreds of sites in big and small communities around the state, including schools, farmers markets and meat plants. But it has had few takers at some locations – a likely reflection, at least in part, of skepticism about vaccines in Georgia. The percentage of people who are fully vaccinated in the state is well below the national average, and that’s a big factor in Georgia’s nearly three-month surge in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. On a recent weekday, one person came in to get inoculated over six hours at an Atlanta church where CORE was offering the Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. State health officials say regardless of how many people show up at each site, the group has been a key partner in their mobile vaccination efforts. “We feel like every opportunity is not wasted if we can get a shot in an arm,” said Chris Rustin, a senior adviser to the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: At least seven people were injured Saturday in the collapse of a large tree branch in Waikiki, Hawaii News Now reports. A large branch of a banyan tree came crashing down about 12:15 p.m. at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the heart of the popular tourist district, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services told Hawaii News Now. The seven people who suffered multiple injuries included some with serious head injuries and multiple cuts. Four of the seven were treated and transported to a nearby hospital, Honolulu EMS said. Among those seriously injured were a 50-year-old man, a 22-year-old woman, a 28-year-old woman and another woman whose age was not disclosed, according to Hawaii News Now. Three others evaluated at the scene refused to be transported. The banyan reaches a height up to 100 feet and spreads laterally indefinitely, with its branches dropping new roots to the ground, creating a structure that can appear to be composed of many separate trees. Hilton Hawaiian Village said in a statement after the incident: “Our thoughts are with those who have been affected and their families. Our hotel team along with several guests responded immediately and the proper authorities were contacted. The wellbeing, safety and security of our guests and team members are of paramount importance.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Republican state officials are warning President Joe Biden of legal action if his proposed COVID-19 vaccine requirement for about 100 million Americans goes into effect. Gov. Brad Little, Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, House Speaker Scott Bedke and Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Winder said in a letter Friday that there appears to be no legal basis for the requirement. “If you choose to continue to move forward in this direction, the State of Idaho will have no choice but to take the necessary legal actions to uphold its sovereignty, check the overreach of power by federal bureaucracy, and uphold the system of checks and balances our Constitution guarantees,” they wrote in the letter to Biden. Many Idaho Republican lawmakers are angry with the vaccine mandate that requires employers with more than 100 workers to require the workers either to be vaccinated or to be tested for the coronavirus weekly. The officials’ letter comes a day after the entire state entered crisis standards of care because of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 patients filling hospitals. The standards allow health care providers to give scarce resources, such as ventilators, to the patients most likely to survive. The letter also comes as Republicans jockey for position ahead of the GOP primary early next year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A kind of bird that not that long ago was so rare in Illinois that people traveled hours just to catch a glimpse of one has lately been winging its way through the Chicago area. Snow-white 30-pound birds called the American white pelican are on their semiannual migration through Illinois right now. The trip means hundreds of them stop to rest near the Four Rivers Environmental Education Center in Channahon, 50 miles southwest of Chicago. Thousands more stop for a bit about 150 miles beyond Channahon at the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge in Lewistown. Among reasons this might be happening is that decades of wetland restoration across the country have helped increase the number of birds from about 40,000 in the 1960s to 180,000 today. As to why Illinois has seen so many more, American Birding Association webmaster Greg Neise told the Chicago Tribune that perhaps the birds that traditionally breed in Canada and the Great Plains and migrate to the Gulf Coast every winter started breeding in northern Wisconsin. He said another possibility might be that Asian carp that have invaded Illinois waterways in recent years are, as the pelicans have discovered, good eating.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s largest hospital system says more than 100 workers are no longer employed with the health network after they did not comply with its mandate for all employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Indiana University Health said Thursday that 125 employees had departed from the hospital system after a two-week unpaid suspension period that ended Sept. 14. Officials did not say whether those workers quit or were fired, saying in a statement that they “chose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and have left the organization.” IU Health did not provide details on what kinds of positions were affected or whether any of the employees worked in bedside care. The 125 former employees were a small percentage of IU Health’s work force of about 36,000. IU Health announced in June that it would require all its doctors, nurses and other employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 1. The health system operates 15 hospitals and dozens of outpatient clinics around the state. Two weeks ago, IU Health said suspended employees would be allowed to return to work if they attested to partial or full vaccination. At the time, it said that fewer than 300 workers had been suspended, according to the Indianapolis Business Journal.\n\nIowa\n\nBurlington: Paint-A-Thon participants are hoping the goodwill it brings to the community each year will spread much like the virus that resulted in the cancellation of last year’s event. Each year, hundreds of Burlington and West Burlington residents work with their neighbors, co-workers and friends to paint houses for those most in need. “It’s like a good virus,” said Mark Rosenburg, team leader for Bethany Lutheran Church, who was painting a house on Elm Court. “It goes to the community and spreads.” The Burlington/West Burlington Paint-A-Thon is hosted each year by Two Rivers Bank and Trust in collaboration with Diamond Vogel Paint and Community Action of Southeast Iowa. One of the program’s goals is to beautify the homes of those who cannot afford a fresh coat of paint. This year’s event marks the 28th annual Paint-A-Thon. Last year’s was canceled because of COVID-19. When Paint-A-Thon first started in Burlington, an organizer reached out to all the churches in the city asking for help. Since then, it has become an annual tradition for many houses of worship. Individuals can apply to have their home painted or can be nominated by someone else. Community Action goes through a selection process in which members seek out the neediest homeowners to receive assistance.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Sit-ins and marches have followed alleged sexual assault on two major university campuses in the state. Dozens of University of Kansas students staged a sit-in in front of the chancellor’s office Friday in an ongoing protest of the handling of allegations that a fraternity member sexually assaulted another student. A spokesman for Phi Kappa Psi has said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. Protesters are demanding that university officials take action against the fraternity as well as the alleged perpetrator, The Kansas City Star reports. They changed a placard at the entrance of the office of the chancellor, renaming it “Office of the Complicit,” and taped other signs with messages to the glass windows at Chancellor Doug Girod’s office. Meanwhile, more than 200 people marched to the Wichita State University police station to protest the handling of a reported rape in a dormitory. The Wichita Eagle reports students gathered Friday at Shocker Hall, where the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred Sept. 12. They then marched to the campus police station. Some carried signs reading: “We deserve a rape-free campus,” and “WSU, do better.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A $21 million project at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport will install geothermal wells to heat and cool the facility. Crews will drill 648 vertical geothermal wells that go 500 feet deep on the east side of the airfield. Geothermal wells use the earth’s natural temperature to heat and cool. The new system will cut carbon emissions by 80% and use 40% less energy than traditional systems, the airport said. “Not only will this innovative technology make systemwide improvements and increase efficiencies, but we are also setting an example in the industry to reduce carbon emissions and energy use,” said Dan Mann, executive director of the Louisville Regional Airport Authority. Airport officials held a formal groundbreaking Thursday for the project, which is part of a larger set of improvements to the airfield and terminal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Garbage and debris are piling up along many streets almost three weeks after Hurricane Ida pounded southeast Louisiana as residents react with increasing anger and, in some cases, dark humor. Several residents told a City Council committee Friday that they haven’t had their garbage collected since days before the storm hit Aug. 29. “I was at the point of naming every maggot in my garbage, and I was going to put them on my income tax as dependents,” a woman told council members at City Hall. “This is not good government. This is just incompetence.” Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration has said much of the problem arises from labor shortages that have plagued the city for months, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and, then, the storm. The city sought bids from companies wanting to supplement its two main waste contractors, officials said Thursday. A Sept. 8 deadline was extended to Sept. 13 due to a lack of response. After the later deadline, one contractor was hired to aid trash collection efforts Thursday in part of the city. Another contractor who bid on another area had 20 trucks available – but no labor. On Thursday, Cantrell’s office announced a plan to use workers and equipment from various city agencies to supplement trash pickup.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The public gets an opportunity Monday to weigh in on Democratic and Republican proposals for reshaping the border of Maine’s 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts. Both proposals released Thursday focus on Kennebec County, and both parties agree on moving Augusta, the capital city, to the state’s northern district. There’s disagreement, however, on reshuffling a dozen other towns. Democrats want to move both August and Waterville, along with several other Democratic-leaning towns. Republicans targeted a different grouping of towns. Based on the 2020 election, the Republican proposal would have meant nearly 900 additional votes for President Joe Biden and the Democratic proposal would mean about 6,200 extra votes for Biden in the district, according to an analysis by the Bangor Daily News. Former President Donald Trump won the vote in the 2nd Congressional District, picking up one of Maine’s four electoral votes. Sen. Rick Bennett, R-Oxford, who is serving on the commission for Senate Republicans, said he’s optimistic the differences can be ironed out. “I think we are pretty close, at least on the congressional side,” he told the Portland Press Herald. The state’s bipartisan redistricting commission is racing to meet a Sept. 27 deadline.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Legislative auditors found that glitches in the cashless tolling infrastructure at the state’s bridges, tunnels and express lanes overbilled motorists thousands of dollars. The Baltimore Sun reports the Office of Legislative Audit’s report on the Maryland Transportation Authority comes about a year after the state announced it permanently ceased cash toll collections – put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic – and moved to fully electronic tolling systems. “We received allegations on our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline alleging that MDTA was not taking sufficient action to detect and address the overbilling of customers for electronic tolling due to issues with its new toll equipment,” Legislative Auditor Gregory Hook wrote in a letter to the legislature’s Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee. “Our audit disclosed that MDTA was inconsistent in its actions related to the impact of issues with its electronic toll collection system on its customers and potential customer overbillings.” The report identified tolling issues at the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the Intercounty Connector in Montgomery County and the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge in Cecil County.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: The city known for its witch trials more than three centuries ago will require a negative coronavirus test for people to attend some large Halloween events, officials said as they brace for the typical influx of visitors in the weeks ahead of the holiday. The Salem Board of Health voted Friday to require people to have a negative test taken within 72 hours to attend indoor events with more than 100 people at a public space. The requirement goes into effect Oct. 1 and lasts through Nov. 1. Masks are required inside all public businesses through mid-November. “The delta variant is so transmissible. We are seeing an increase in COVID case counts in Salem,” Mayor Kim Driscoll said. “Thankfully, more people are vaccinated, so we’re not seeing the crush of hospitalizations. But those numbers are up, too.” Details about rapid testing in the area will be announced soon. Vaccine mandates are in place for some events like the Horror Fest, which includes 50 indoor movies throughout October. “We’ll do whatever it takes to keep our audience safe,” said Kay Lynch, of Horror Fest. “We’ve capped our audience. We’ve required vaccination. Masks are required indoors.”\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: After hearing from critics, including the homeless, city officials have rejected an ordinance that would have cracked down on panhandling. The measure would have stopped people in Jackson from asking for money by speech or sign near banks, building entrances or outdoor dining or on public transportation. A violation would have carried a $100 fine. Kevin Hardman, who said he’s homeless, told the Jackson City Council that finding solutions to poverty would be a better step. “To penalize me or anyone because I’m poor, I don’t dress nice – if you see somebody in that condition, why won’t you help them?” Hardman said. A first reading of the ordinance was defeated 5-2 on Tuesday, MLive.com reports. Council member Karen Bunnell, who voted for the ordinance, said panhandling is a serious issue downtown. “Those are not just my constituents. Those are also my business owners,” she said. Mayor Derek Dobies, who opposed the ordinance, said it violated free speech. “The city can’t say it’s OK for the Salvation Army or firefighters to collect donations in some of these places but not allow poor people to ask for spare change,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Regulators have ordered Enbridge to pay more than $3 million for allegedly violating state environmental law by piercing a groundwater aquifer during construction of the Line 3 oil pipeline replacement. The state Department of Natural Resources said Enbridge, while working near Clearbrook in January, dug too deeply into the ground and pierced an artesian aquifer, which resulted in a 24 million-gallon groundwater leak. “Enbridge’s actions are a clear violation of state law, and also of the public trust,” said Barb Naramore, DNR deputy commissioner. “That is why we are using all of the tools in our authority to address the situation.” Enbridge said in a statement that it was reviewing the DNR’s order and would work with the agency on a resolution. It wasn’t until mid-June that the DNR discovered something was wrong after speaking to independent construction monitors who had observed water pooling in the pipeline trench near Clearbrook. The DNR has ordered Enbridge to put $2.7 million into escrow for restoration and damage to nearby wetlands. Enbridge is also required to pay $300,000 to mitigate the lost groundwater and $250,000 for long-term monitoring of the wetlands. Enbridge’s 340-mile Line 3 replacement pipeline, opposed by environmental groups and some Ojibwe tribes, is nearly complete.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An interactive exhibit prompts visitors to speak aloud the names of people who were killed in acts of racist violence in the United States during the civil rights era – incantations in a darkened room to honor some 150 men, women and children whose lives were cut short. The names appear on lighted glass panels, backed by images of trees. Next to each name is a code that visitors can scan with their cellphones. “Say his name to begin his story,” or “Say her name to begin her story,” says the recorded narrator, journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who made history in 1961 as one of the first Black students to enroll in the University of Georgia. The traveling exhibit, “Un(re)solved,” was created by PBS Frontline with artist, filmmaker and technologist Tamara Shogaolu. It is on display until Oct. 24 at the Two Mississippi Museums, which houses the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and Museum of Mississippi History under one roof. The exhibit opened in downtown Jackson on Aug. 28 – 66 years to the day after Emmett Till, a Black teenager from Chicago, was abducted, tortured and killed in the Mississippi Delta after witnesses said he whistled at a white woman. “Un(re)solved” focuses on the federal investigation of more than 150 cold cases under a law enacted in 2008, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Mississippi has 56 names in the exhibit – more than any other state.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A crowd gathered Saturday to celebrate the state’s bicentennial, with a World War II nurse leading the parade. KTVO reports Edith Harrington waved to the crowd from a military jeep, followed by about 100 entries that highlighted the history of the Show-Me State. The 98-year-old Harrington joined the United States Cadet Nurse Corps in 1943. The festivities also marked the election of state officeholders in 2020 whose traditional inauguration events were delayed because of the coronavirus. Missouri turned 200 years old last month. Territorial residents first sought statehood in 1818, but the request became bogged down in Congress by a dispute over whether slavery should be allowed. In March 1820, President James Monroe signed legislation known as the Missouri Compromise. Maine was allowed into the union as a free state and was allowed to draft a constitution as a slave state, so long as no other new slave states formed north of Missouri’s southern border. Missourians thought they had become a state, but the parties were premature. Missouri’s first constitution, which sought to exclude free “Negros or mulattoes” from the state, prompted further opposition in Congress. After a second compromise, Monroe signed legislation finally making Missouri the 24th state on Aug. 10, 1821.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Interior Secretary Deb Haaland signed the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes water rights compact Friday, settling a decades­long battle over thousands of individual water rights in Montana and on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The deal also created a $1.9 billion trust to settle claims and refurbish the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project. The tribes have claims to more than 10,000 water rights beyond their reservation land. The compact offered a deal in which the tribes relinquished their claims to most of the water outside of the reservation. In exchange, the tribes will receive 211 water rights on their reservation, 10 water rights outside the reservation and co-ownership of 58 other water rights, along with the funding. “Our elders continually remind us to protect our water, and this day marks the beginning of the water compact implementation that will protect the water for all generations to come,” Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes Chairwoman Shelly Fyant said in a statement. Montana lawmakers passed legislation approving the compact in 2015. Under the compact, the federal government will initially provide the tribes with $90 million over a 10-year period to rebuild the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project, which was built in the 1900s.\n\nNebraska\n\nAlvo: A massive, flammable mountain of scrap tires that had grown to more than twice the size allowed under state environmental rules in a small eastern Nebraska town now appears to be in compliance. The Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy said a report that B-Rose Tire Recycling of Alvo had made significant progress in coming into compliance with a Sept. 1 deadline to bring its inventory below 160,000 passenger tire equivalents, according to the Omaha World-Herald. In April, the business signed a consent agreement with state regulators to drastically reduce its pile of shredded tires or face fines or other sanctions. By the middle of last year, the business’ pile of tires in the town halfway between Lincoln and Omaha had grown to as much as 323,228 passenger tire equivalents. B-Rose fell short of benchmarks in the agreement for July and August, but after a warning letter from the state agency Aug. 9, B-Rose reported hauling out 123,176 passenger tire equivalents to the landfill during August, exceeding the number of tires hauled out in the months of May, June and July combined. Officials at the State Fire Marshal’s office said Wednesday that they hadn’t yet conducted an inspection to determine if the business had created fire lanes for emergency vehicles between the tire piles.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A fire burned the main building of the Mount Charleston Lodge in a forest area that is a popular retreat from summer heat for Las Vegas residents. A fire official and a representative of the company that owns the business said the building that houses the lodge’s restaurant was a total loss, but cabins used for lodging weren’t damaged. No injuries were reported, officials said. The fire was reported about 4:45 a.m. Friday. Its cause wasn’t immediately known. Photos posted online showed flames flaring from the building, and Clark County Assistant Fire Chief Thomas Touchstone said the lodge’s dining area was fully engulfed when the first units arrived about 5 a.m. The lodge was built in the 1960s after a previous lodge on the site that had been operating since at least 1948 was destroyed by a fire in December 1961, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Since 2018, the property has been operated by Ellis Island Hotel & Casino. “The Lodge was a beloved landmark, and we plan on rebuilding and recreating the atmosphere and charm that so many were able to enjoy throughout the years,” Christina Ellis, the company’s marketing director, said in a statement. Touchstone said it appeared the fire started inside the building when no employees were there, and it was too dangerous for firefighters to enter the building to battle the blaze.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The head of the state’s health department on Friday accused a Republican lawmaker of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette was telling the Legislature’s fiscal committee that 90% of those hospitalized in New Hampshire due to the coronavirus are unvaccinated when she was interrupted by Rep. Ken Weyler of Kingston. “That is in doubt,” he said, adding that he has heard from emergency room workers who say 90% of those admitted have been vaccinated. “That is incorrect, and that is misinformation,” Shibinette told him, according to video of the exchange shared by WMUR-TV. “I have no idea why someone would say that, but that is incorrect, and that is the problem that we are having in increasing our vaccination rate: spreading misinformation about the COVID vaccine.” Republican members of the committee voted to table $27 million in federal virus relief funds that would have gone to the state’s immunization program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge who suggested to a domestic violence suspect that men are “in control” has been suspended without pay two years after he made the comments. The state Supreme Court announced Friday that it adopted the recommendation of a panel on judicial conduct to suspend Municipal Court Judge Steven Brister for one month, beginning Wednesday. The panel wrote in 2019 that Brister, who has served in both East Orange and Newark, told the man that men “can’t punch; you can’t hit. At best, you treat as if you’re holding a feather, just to let them know you’re the man, and you’re in control.” The panel wrote that the comments violated conduct rules, were disparaging to women and could create the perception of bias. It also wrote that Brister allowed his personal religious beliefs to influence his judicial role because he referred to women as being created “with the curve of the rib of Adam.” In a subsequent response to the panel’s report, Brister didn’t deny the remarks and called them “well-meaning but undeniably misguided” and said he had completed several ethics courses. An email message seeking comment was left Friday with an attorney who represented Brister.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s film industry has come roaring back to life this year and so far managed to avoid significant COVID-19 outbreaks. Many credit the stringent protocols put in place by the industry, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Film and TV productions in New Mexico got the green light to resume in September 2020. According to the New Mexico Film Office, from Sept. 1, 2020, through Sept. 1, 2021, there have been 176,598 coronavirus tests administered throughout the various productions. Of those, 183 were positive. “This is a testament to the film industry, as they want to mitigate and remain safe,” said Amber Dodson, director of the New Mexico Film Office. “There have been less than eight productions that have paused for their own safety during the last year.” As of Aug. 31, there were 18 film and 24 TV productions in various phases currently in the state. When the film industry paused in March 2020, leaders spent months developing protocols that would be put in place when it resumed. In June 2020, a white paper was created by a task force of the Industry-Wide Labor-Management Safety Committee describing health and safety guidelines to resume film and TV production.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Most nonviolent parole violations will not result in jail time under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The “Less is More” law largely eliminates New York’s practice of incarcerating people for technical parole violations, including being late to an appointment with a parole officer, missing curfew, or failing to pay fees or to inform a parole officer of a change in employment. Starting in March, people on parole will land back behind bars only for drug or alcohol use if they were convicted of driving under the influence of those substances. Supporters of the law say that New York has one of the the nation’s highest rates of incarcerating people for technical parole violations and that the practice is costly and fuels the cycle of people landing behind bars again after serving their time. Criminal justice advocates applauded the law but urged Hochul and lawmakers to make it effective immediately. The move means an estimated 5,000 people who are behind bars for technical parole violations could eventually be eligible for release. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will be releasing “hundreds and hundreds of people the right way.” The governor also said she would sign off on the release of 191 eligible inmates from the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail complex, troubled by years of neglect.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Judges struck down the state’s latest voter photo identification law Friday, agreeing with minority voters that Republicans rammed through rules tainted by racial bias as a way to remain in power. Two of the three trial judges declared the December 2018 law is unconstitutional, even though it was designed to implement a photo voter ID mandate added to the North Carolina Constitution in a referendum just weeks earlier. They said the law was rushed and intentionally discriminates against Black voters, violating their equal protections. The law “was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters,” Superior Court Judges Michael O’Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their 102-page order. “Other, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate nonracial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence.” The majority decision, which followed a three-week trial in April, will be appealed, Republicans at the Legislature said. A state appeals court had previously blocked the law’s enforcement last year. The law remains unenforceable with this ruling.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Air Force Base has been selected for a military satellite mission, the state’s U.S. senators announced Friday. Republican Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer said the base will be home to a Space Networking Center, which is part of the Pentagon’s Space Development Agency’s new low-Earth orbit mission. NASA defines low-Earth orbit as having an altitude of 1,200 miles or less. Hoeven said the mission serves as the backbone for all U.S. military communications. “Grand Forks is the ideal location to house this new Space Networking Center,” Hoeven said in a statement. The mission “provides essential support for our national security and will help our nation stay ahead of our adversaries in developing critical new technologies,” he said. Hoeven’s office said a military installation in Alabama also was selected as a center for the mission.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As Republican lawmakers try to limit drop boxes and early voting, a new report shows rural Ohio voters want more flexibility in how they can cast their ballots. A poll commissioned by the nonpartisan election group Secure Democracy found that roughly three-quarters of rural voters support allowing counties to provide multiple early voting and ballot drop-off locations, as well as expanding the types of acceptable voter identification. They also back 24-hour drop box access and the use of a secure website to request an absentee ballot. The poll comes as legislators push separate bills that would alter the state’s rules for conducting elections. Supporters say the changes are necessary to prevent fraud, but opponents contend they would sow confusion and suppress votes. One proposal would eliminate in-person voting on the Monday before Election Day, limit drop boxes to 10 days before Election Day and require Ohioans to request mail-in ballots no later than 10 days before an election. A stricter measure would ban drop boxes entirely and significantly reduce the number of days for early voting, among other provisions. Officials with Secure Democracy say the bills could hurt voters in 17 rural counties who relied on voting flexibility even before the pandemic drove people toward absentee and early voting.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court will expedite an appeal of an injunction limiting a ban on mask mandates in public schools. The court, in an order dated Wednesday, placed the appeal on its fast-track docket, giving Attorney General John O’Connor 20 days to file briefs in the case and opponents 20 days to respond. The appeal argued the law passed earlier this year by the Legislature is constitutional. “The Legislature may reasonably exercise its … power over public schools without regulating private schools,” the filing said. The appeal also said the state is immune from the lawsuit filed by the Oklahoma State Medical Association and four parents. District Judge Natalie Mai cited the fact the law did not apply to private schools in approving the temporary injunction. Mai’s ruling allows for exemptions to mask requirements for medical or personal reasons, which Oklahoma State Medical Association President Dr. Mary Clarke said some schools have adopted. “It’s disappointing to see the Attorney General appeal a decision that even Gov. Stitt supported,” Clarke said in a statement. “We’ve seen several schools implement masking programs with opt-out clauses.”\n\nOregon\n\nBend: About two dozen people have contacted the state’s poison center after self-medicating against COVID-19 with a drug used to treat parasites, with five becoming hospitalized and two winding up in intensive care units, authorities said Friday. The drug they used was ivermectin, which has no proven use against the coronavirus and is instead approved to treat some parasites in people and some animals. “COVID-19 is a devastating disease and can be very frightening, but the public does not need to use – nor should it use – unproven and potentially dangerous drugs to fight it,” said Robert Hendrickson, medical director of the Oregon Poison Center at Oregon Health & Science University. Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 14, the Oregon Poison Center at OHSU managed a total of 25 cases. Five of those cases involved hospitalization, and two people were so severely ill that they had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for antiviral efficacy would require administration of doses of the drug up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans, the National Institutes of Health said. The Oregon Poison Center said its recent cases involved people experiencing mental confusion, balance issues, low blood pressure and seizures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Democrats in the state Senate sued Friday evening in a state court to block a Republican-approved subpoena seeking voter information and to put a stop to what Republicans call a “forensic investigation” of last year’s presidential election. Democrats had said they would sue within days after the GOP-controlled Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee voted Wednesday to issue a subpoena that seeks detailed state election records, including communication with counties and the names of who voted in last year’s presidential election, their birth dates, addresses, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers. The subpoena is an outgrowth of former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims that he was cheated out of victory last November and ongoing pressure by Trump and his allies for battleground states where he lost to investigate the election. “The latest ploy by the Senate Republicans is unprecedented and completely unwarranted,” Democrats said in a statement. “All aspects of the certified 2020 election have been thoroughly reviewed and adjudicated in the courts with no findings of irregularities or fraud. The timeframe to contest the 2020 certified election results is long overdue.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A group of parents and grandparents has filed a legal challenge to Gov. Daniel McKee’s statewide school mask mandate. The lawsuit filed in Providence Superior Court on Thursday alleges the Democratic governor violated state law and the state constitution in both signing the K-12 mask mandate and declaring a new state of emergency due to the delta variant of the coronavirus, WPRI-TV reports. The 16 parents and grandparents from Glocester, Smithfield, North Smithfield and Warwick argue there is a double standard because the state no longer requires masks in restaurants, retail shops and other indoor spaces. They also question the science of mask-wearing, which state and national experts have said helps slow the spread of the virus. “Often, it appears that those at highest risk for the effects of COVID-19, the elderly, the obese, and those with multiple comorbidities, are willing to force the young and healthy, who are little affected by COVID-19, to suffer these irreparable harms on unproven science,” the complaint says. McKee spokesperson Alana O’Hare, citing the pending litigation, declined to comment. In the suit, the plaintiffs also say masks make it difficult for their children to breathe, hear and communicate, hampering the learning process.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The capital city will not allow people to carry guns in the open during protests, festivals or other events that need a city permit. The resolution passed unanimously earlier this month by the Columbia City Council also bans the open carrying of guns in city-owned buildings without written permission from the city manager, The State newspaper reports. The South Carolina General Assembly passed a law this year allowing people with a concealed weapons permit to carry those guns openly. But the law allowed local governments to ban open carry for specific events for a limited period of time. Columbia’s resolution will keep people safer, Mayor Steve Benjamin said. Concealed weapons permit holders “are incredibly responsible with the use of firearms, and I’m thankful for that,” Benjamin said. “But the ability for a good, hard-working police officer to be able to ascertain who’s who when someone has a sidearm on fully exposed is very difficult.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislative leaders on Friday distributed a petition to lawmakers asking them to support a special session to consider impeaching Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg for a car crash last year that killed a pedestrian. House Speaker Spencer Gosch released the text of the petition. Two-thirds of both the Republican-controlled House and Senate must sign on to convene the special session. Lawmakers would meet in November, the day after they are scheduled to hold another special session to consider new legislative districts. The petition says the special session would be called for “investigating and evaluating whether the conduct of Jason Ravnsborg … surrounding the death of Joe Boever, involved impeachable offenses.” Gosch has said that if the special session is approved, he will appoint a committee to investigate the conduct of the attorney general, a Republican whose term runs through 2022. The South Dakota Legislature has never tried to impeach an official as powerful as an attorney general. It would require a simple majority of the House to approve articles of impeachment, while two-thirds of senators must vote to convict and remove him from office. The attorney general pleaded no contest to a pair of misdemeanors last month, and prosecutors dropped a third misdemeanor.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge has indefinitely blocked Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County, saying Friday that evidence shows Lee’s order prevents children with health problems from safely going to school during the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the preliminary injunction after parents of students with health conditions argued that the Republican governor’s executive order endangered their children and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing others to opt out of a mask mandate. “It is that unmasked presence that creates the danger to these Plaintiffs,” the judge wrote Friday. Meanwhile, two families in Williamson County, just south of Nashville, sued in federal court Friday, also challenging Lee’s order. In Shelby County, Lipman had already issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 3 stopping schools from allowing parents to opt out. It was set to expire Friday. The preliminary injunction continues blocking Lee’s order as the federal lawsuit proceeds. The injunction applies to all seven public school districts in Shelby County, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Shelby County Schools is Tennessee’s largest, with 100,000 students.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A man linked to the “boogaloo” movement who livestreamed threats to kill police was sentenced Friday to 50 years in prison after being convicted of attempted murder of a peace officer. On Thursday, a jury in Bowie County found 38-year-old Aaron Caleb Swenson guilty of attempted capital murder of a peace officer and found he’d violated the Texas Hate Crimes Act, the Texarkana Gazette reports. On Wednesday, before testimony began before the judge, Swenson had pleaded guilty to terroristic threatening and evading arrest. The newspaper reports that on Friday, the jury sentenced him to 50 years in prison for attempted murder, 20 years for terroristic threatening with a hate crime enhancement and 10 years for evading arrest. Prosecutor Kelly Crisp said the terms will run concurrently. The jury also assessed maximum fines on each of the three charges for a total of $30,000. Swenson testified he was trying to be killed by police in April 2020 when he made the threats and never intended to hurt anyone when he streamed on Facebook Live while driving in Texarkana, Texas, that he was searching for a police officer to kill. Texarkana crime scene analyst Spencer Price testified about the two pistols, 12-gauge shotgun, handmade sword and 156 rounds of ammunition found in Swenson’s truck.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Salt Lake: The Wasatch Youth Center is no more. Demolition crews began work last week tearing down the former long-term, secure lockup for child offenders. A backhoe knocked down brick walls and tore off the roof of a gymnasium. A stray office chair was picked up with some debris and thrown into the back of a dump truck. The juvenile detention facility is no longer necessary. “Because of some of the shifts in reforms in Utah in juvenile justice, this is a space where we don’t need this capacity anymore,” said Brett Peterson, the executive director of Utah’s Division of Juvenile Justice Services, told Fox13. “We’re able to reinvest our dollars in serving youth in their home, schools and communities.” It’s a result of a series of laws the Legislature passed beginning in 2017 dubbed “juvenile justice reform.” Instead of incarceration, the state has placed more of an emphasis on rehabilitation and community oversight for youth offenders. Funding has been shifted to ensure there are proper services to keep children facing what are termed “low risk” offenses out of detention facilities. The Utah Division of Juvenile Justice Services had actually planned to expand Wasatch Youth Center prior to the reform legislation. Instead, the land will be given back to the state for other needs.\n\nVermont\n\nSpringfield: The state plans to spend $25 million of its own funds to help redevelop old industrial sites. Historically, the costs of cleaning up former industrial sites that may be contaminated from previous industrial or commercial activities, known as “brownfields,” have been funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Vermont officials traveled Thursday to Springfield, where they highlighted that some of the state funds will be used to help redevelop the 270,000-square-foot former Jones & Lamson Machine Co. building that once employed 1,500 factory workers. Other sites that will be redeveloped with some of the money are in St. Albans and Burlington. “It’s an understatement to say this is just another brownfield site,” said Bob Flint, the executive director of the Springfield Regional Development Corp., which owns the 14-acre property. “This beats them all.” The projects were announced by Gov. Phil Scott. “This presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address longtime challenges and finally make good on the promise to increase economic equity from region to region and bring growth to all areas of the state, not just Chittenden County,” Scott said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Residents have a new digital option for proving they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Virginia Department of Health has added QR codes, barcodes that can be scanned with smartphones, to state COVID-19 vaccination records, officials announced Thursday. People will be able to prove they’ve been inoculated by showing a digital or printed QR code instead of a paper card, and they won’t need a special app. As more employers and businesses require employees and customers to be vaccinated, officials said this will boost the consistency and security of vaccination information while protecting individual privacy. Anyone vaccinated in Virginia can visit the department’s Vaccinate Virginia website to obtain their free vaccination record with QR code, which can then be saved to a phone gallery or printed out. The codes contain the same information as paper records, but the format offers more security, and the information is only available if a person chooses to share it, officials said. Because the digital records are digitally signed by the Department of Health, officials said they can’t be altered or forged. Businesses and employers can use a free app to scan the codes.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe has filed a class-action lawsuit against the city on behalf of its members and the public, saying the electric utility’s green power claims are misleading and hurting the tribe. The lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court on Friday seeks to stop Seattle City Light from claiming that it’s a fish-friendly, green and environmentally responsible utility until Seattle provides fish passage at its three Skagit River dams. “Until that happens, they are not as green as they say they are,” said Nino Maltos, chairman of the tribe. More than 80% of City Light’s energy comes from hydropower, which doesn’t directly emit climate-warming carbon dioxide. The city of Seattle is in the midst of a relicensing process for the dams. The tribe insists the utility can’t claim its dams are green while they block salmon passage on the region’s premier salmon river. Julie Moore, spokeswoman for Seattle City Light, said the utility won’t comment on litigation. But she said the relicensing process “gives us the opportunity to update the research and determine what additional measures may be necessary to protect fish moving forward. This includes looking at fish passage.” Native wild Chinook salmon, steelhead and resident bull trout within the Skagit River drainage all are threatened with extinction.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic this month has already doubled the total from August. There have been 286 reported deaths from COVID-19 in September and at least 3,370 since the start of the pandemic, according to state health data. The September total includes at least 32 virus-related deaths added to the count after being reconciled with official death certificates. Deaths during the pandemic peaked in January, when there were 654 reported from Jan. 4 to Jan. 31. They slowed to 49 total deaths in July but picked up again in August with 148. “We’re going to have a bunch more die. That’s all there is to it,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a news conference Friday. “And the only way we can stop it from being a bunch more and then a whole lot more on top of that, in my opinion, is one thing, and that’s to get vaccinated. I’m going to continue to plead with you to do that because I don’t know anything else we can do.” Justice lifted a statewide indoor mask requirement in June as the number of cases dropped, and he’s balked at issuing a mandate vaccination or new mask requirements. He has said mandating masks is “penalizing” some people, but he’s not convinced it’s going to significantly help as the pandemic goes unchecked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The return of a popular annual music festival wasn’t what some vendors expected. After the event was canceled last year due to the coronavirus, Summerfest 2021 ended with mixed reports. Sellers who set up shop for the first time generally marked it a success, while longtime vendors saw it as a “total bust.” Vendors said during Saturday’s final day of the two-week concert that the crowds had picked up a bit more from the start but remained low compared to previous years. Surging cases of the delta variant of the virus and new pandemic protocols were cited as possible factors. “This was not what I expected,” said Kagan Tate, owner of Butterfly Connection. “A total bust.” Tania Espinoza Bonilla, owner of T for Textile, was selling for the first time at a large festival. Although she didn’t see the crowds she had hoped for, she said she was thankful for the exposure and connections she made for her business. “I’m sure the vaccine rule made a lot of people angry, but I supported it,” she said. Even before the pandemic, Summerfest had already experienced reduced attendance and in 2019 saw the lowest participation since 1986 with just more than 718,000 festivalgoers. Officials have not provided daily attendance numbers and would not comment on the numbers while the event was running.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Human remains found in a reservoir on the Wyoming-Idaho state line have been identified as a kayaker who drowned in 1995, investigators said. Kyle Martin, 24, was kayaking on the Hoback River when a companion lost his paddle. Martin went ahead but was never seen alive again. Relatives of Martin and sheriff’s officials briefly saw Martin’s body after a helicopter dislodged his kayak from a snag in the river a couple of days later, Teton County sheriff’s deputy Dave Hodges told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “He separates, and he’s on the surface, but I didn’t expect him to then submerge almost as quickly as he emerged,” Hodges recalled. Last winter, Hodges saw an entry in Forensics Magazine about human remains found in Palisades Reservoir, downstream from the Hoback River. A DNA sample from Martin’s mother confirmed they were her son’s remains. Hodges called Martin’s brother with the news Sept. 10. “It was an incredible moment to call family after 26 years and say that your son and your brother is finally coming home,” Hodges said. “We both had a moment of tears. It was a sense of closure for a family that’s been waiting so long to have their son and their brother home.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/20"}]}

Israel's military campaign in response has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nHere's what we know about the apparent peace deal between Israel and Hamas:\n\nIsrael and Hamas agree on peace deal: Trump says hostages will be released 'very soon'\n\nWhat are the details of the deal?\n\nAl-Ansari, of Qatar, wrote on X Oct. 8 that the details of the deal would be announced at a later date.\n\nThe first phase of Trump's plan called for the release of Israeli hostages within 72 hours of an agreement in exchange for the release of Palestinians jailed in Israel.\n\nOnce every hostage has been released, Trump's plan said Hamas members who agree to give up their weapons would receive amnesty. It also called for the immediate restoration of humanitarian aid.\n\nAl Jazeera quoted a statement from Hamas saying that the organization had \"submitted lists of Palestinian prisoners to Israel,\" according to the criteria agreed upon in the (ceasefire) agreement.\"\n\nHostages are likely to begin to be released on Monday, Oct. 13, although they could be returned sooner, U.S. officials have said. Trump said he expected their release to come on Monday or Tuesday. Of the 48 remaining hostages in Gaza, 20 are believed to be alive.\n\nThe U.S. knows where most of the living hostages are, Trump said at an Oct. 9 Cabinet meeting. \"The bodies are a bigger problem, because some of the bodies are going to be a little bit hard to find,\" the president said of the roughly 28 who are assumed to be deceased.\n\nTrump did not spell out what the next phase of the Middle East deal would look like. But he indicated it would follow the 20-point plan he released at the end of September.\n\n\"There will be disarming, there will be pullbacks, there will be a lot of things that are happening,\" Trump said. \"I think you could end up with peace in the Middle East.\"\n\nHe also said the U.S. would be working with \"immensely wealthy countries\" to rebuild Gaza. He declined to take a stance on an independent Palestinian state, telling journalists during his Cabinet meeting, \"I don't have a view, I'm going to go with what they agree to.\"\n\nWill the Trump-brokered deal end the war?\n\nThe deal appears to be a step toward ending the brutal conflict. However, a previous ceasefire during negotiations to end the conflict fell apart in March.\n\nIsrael conducted airstrikes into the battered enclave on March 18 that ended a truce that began in January.\n\nAl Jazeera reported that Israel continued operations following the announcement, including fighter jets that have bombed western areas of Gaza City, striking at least one house in al-Shati camp and an armored vehicle laden with explosives near homes south of Gaza City. No casualties have been reported.\n\nIsraeli military Arabic Spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned Gaza residents in an X post that \"the area north of the Gaza Valley is still considered a dangerous combat zone\" shortly after 5 a.m. in Jerusalem on Oct. 9.\n\nResponse in Israel\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on X that he would convene the government to approve the deal on Oct. 9, calling it \"a great day for Israel.\"\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement to the Jerusalem Post that it welcomed the agreement but remained ready for \"any scenario.\"\n\n\"During a situation assessment held last night, the Chief of Staff instructed all forces on all fronts to prepare strong defensive measures,\" the Israeli military said in the statement.\n\nFamilies and supporters in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square celebrated news of Hamas' acceptance of Trump's deal. Dozens of people and TV cameras flooded the square at 4 a.m. local time. The plaza has been occupied for 734 days since Hamas' brutal attack, during which militants kidnapped 251 people.\n\nAmong those in the crowd were former hostages Emily Damari and Omer Shem Tov. \"You feel happiness and pressure, because until you have reached your mother and hugged her, it hasn't happened,\" Shem Tov told I24 News.\n\nHamas' response\n\nHamas has appeared willing to hand over governance of Gaza to a coalition of Palestinian technocrats as part of the plan. It has been less willing to completely disarm and commit to playing no future role in the governance of Gaza.\n\nIn a statement, the group thanked Trump for his efforts to end the war and bring about a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\n\"Our people's sacrifices will not be in vain, and that we will remain faithful to our pledge and will not abandon our people’s national rights: to achieve freedom, independence, and self-determination,\" a statement posted to Telegram said, according to Reuters.\n\nIsraeli news outlet Walla reported that four prisoners demanded by Hamas – Marwan Barghouti, Ahmed Sa'adat, Hassan Salameh and Abbas al-Sayed – will not be released as part of the deal.\n\nU.N. Secretary General praises peace agreement\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General António Guterres said in a statement on X that he welcomed the deal and commended the diplomatic efforts of the United States, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey.\n\nHe pledged that the U.N. would support the implementation of the deal and ramp up humanitarian aid.\n\n\"The stakes have never been higher,\" Guterres wrote.\n\nAmerican voices praise deal with varying enthusiasm\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson credited Trump for the peace deal.\n\n\"Through strength and conviction, he’s accomplished what others have only talked about: bringing hostages home, security for Israel, and laying the groundwork for lasting peace in the Middle East,\" Johnson wrote on X.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Chairman Brian Mast, R-Florida, said in a statement on Oct. 8 that Trump had brought the world closer than it’s ever been to peace in Gaza. \"This deal only works if Hamas follows through,\" he added. \"We don’t trust terrorists, we trust results.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the agreement brings a huge sigh of relief to the hostages' families.\n\n\"We must begin the even harder work of closing negotiations: to end the war, to start building the day after in Gaza without Hamas, to surge humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza, and to build a lasting peace that ensures security and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians alike,\" Schumer said in a statement.\n\nPro-Israel Democratic Sen. John Fetterman praised the deal on X, calling it historic. \"Now, enduring peace in the region is possible,\" the Pennsylvania senator wrote.\n\nJewish anti-Zionist organization Jewish Voice for Peace said in a statement that it looks forward to the release of both Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, but it noted that the deal does not address what it called the \"root cause of injustice.\"\n\n\"While a ceasefire does not bring an end to the genocide, right now we are holding tightly to the hope that Israel will, in fact, finally be compelled to the first elements of this agreement: halting the mass killing of Palestinians through bombardment, and stopping its blockade of food and medicine,\" the organization wrote.\n\nRequests for comment to Democratic representatives Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as Independent Sen.

The government of Greenland, according to the agency, has done several “resource assessments throughout the ice-free land” and the government “recognizes the country’s potential to diversify the national economy through mineral extraction.”\n\nSfraga said that pro-mining stance is not without regard for the environment, which is central to Greenland’s culture and livelihood.\n\n“The government of Greenland supports the responsible, sustainable, and economically viable development of their natural resources to include mining of a broad range of minerals,” Sfraga said.\n\nA Bluejay Mining employee digs during exploration for critical minerals in Greenland.

But it should.\n\nTrump's Israel, Hamas agreement is extraordinary – and worthy of Nobel Peace Prize\n\nIt's almost impossible to overstate the gravity of Trump's accomplishment in brokering an agreement between Israel and Hamas to enter the first phase of a ceasefire. According to Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Majed Al Ansari, it will result in \"ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid.\"\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal in the most Trumpian way possible, posting on Truth Social. \"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America. ... BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\" the president concluded, a nod to the Gospel of Matthew, in his signature all-cap style.\n\nTrump might sound dramatic, but the deal almost seems biblical in its proportion. It's been two years since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The terrorist organization slaughtered about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people hostage, including Americans, forcing Israel to defend itself.\n\nAs a result of the ongoing war, according to Hamas, Israeli forces have killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza. The cost of this war has been grievous and seemed eternal.\n\nThis conflict should never have started, but it certainly needs to end ‒ and now, Trump has helped end it.\n\nNorwegian Nobel Committee will ignore Trump's achievements\n\nI understand why the Norwegian Nobel Committee would hesitate to award Trump its peace prize. I will point out that the deadline to nominate Trump for this specific achievement has passed, but neglecting this opportunity in the future would reek of bias. The committee members would miss their chance to honor his peacemaking efforts around the globe.\n\nTrump's already been nominated by Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-New York, who also nominated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for their collective work on the Abraham Accords.\n\nTrump also helped end an escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Though he has not yet been successful, Trump has tried to bring Russia and Ukraine to the peacekeeping table.\n\nIf there's another person or organization who has brokered more peace this year, I'm ready to give them an enthusiastic nod.\n\nBut this isn't the only reason the Nobel Committee should give it to Trump. He has reached a level of achievement close to that of previous presidential winners. President Barack Obama, anyone? Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter were also awarded the prize. If Trump's accomplishments with foreign policy in 2025 alone have not surpassed those of these recipients, they are at least on par with them.\n\nEven the 2024 recipient, the Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo, received the peace prize for “its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.\" Trump's calculated strike on Iran in June, which the administration said \"obliterated\" that country's nuclear arsenal, accomplished that.\n\nThe first phase of Trump's Hamas plan called for the release of Israeli hostages within 72 hours of an agreement being reached in exchange for Palestinians jailed in Israel. There are 48 remaining hostages in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.\n\nThe world is safer, countries are at peace and families may finally begin to heal. Trump should eventually win the Nobel Peace Prize, but if he doesn't, the peace he brokered between Israel and Hamas ‒ if it lasts ‒ will be legacy enough.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY.

CNN is seeing a different story 03:06\n\nBeijing Winter Olympics\n\nThe Games proved to be a resounding success for China’s zero-Covid strategy.\n\nIn its tightly sealed, meticulously managed Olympic bubble, the ubiquitous face masks, endless spraying of disinfectant and rigorous daily testing paid-off. Any infected visitors arriving in the country were swiftly identified and their cases contained, allowing the Winter Olympics to run largely free of Covid even as the Omicron variant raged around the world.\n\nThe success added to the party’s narrative that its political system is superior to those of Western democracies in handling the pandemic – a message Xi had repeatedly driven home as he prepared for a third term in power.\n\nIt also boosted China’s confidence that its well-honed zero-Covid playbook of lockdowns, quarantines, mass testing and contact tracing could build an effective defense against highly transmissible Omicron and contain its spread. In the lead-up to the Games, these measures worked in January to tame the country’s first Omicron outbreak in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.\n\nBeijing kept the Winter Olympcis largely free of Covid inside a strictly managed bubble. Thomas Peter/reuters\n\nShanghai lockdown\n\nBut it didn’t take long for Omicron to seep through the cracks of zero-Covid. By mid-March, China was battling its worst Covid outbreak since the initial wave of the pandemic, reporting thousands of new cases a day, from northern Jilin province to Guangdong in the south.\n\nThe financial hub of Shanghai soon became the epicenter. Local officials initially denied a citywide lockdown was necessary, but then imposed one after the city reported 3,500 daily infections.\n\nThe two-month lockdown became a glaring symbol of the economic and social costs of zero-Covid. In the country’s wealthiest and most glamorous city, residents were subject to widespread food shortages, lack of emergency medical care, spartan makeshift isolation facilities and forced disinfection of their homes. The draconian measures triggered wave after wave of outcry, severely eroding public trust in the Shanghai government.\n\nThe lockdown also wracked havoc on the economy. China’s GDP shrunk by 2.6% in the three months ending in June, while youth unemployment hit a record high of nearly 20%.\n\nBut the costly lockdown did not prod China to shift away from its zero-tolerance approach. Rather, officials hailed it as a victory in the war against Covid. Other local governments came away with the lesson that they must curb infections at all cost, before outbreaks spiraled out of control.\n\nCovid workers disinfect a residential community under lockdown in Shanghai in April.

He couldn’t afford to move away from it, the potential surge of infections and deaths posing too great a risk to his authority before he secured his norm-shattering third term at the congress.\n\nAnd so instead of vaccinating the elderly and bolstering ICU capacity, authorities wasted the next crucial months building larger quarantine facilities, rolling out more frequent mass testing, and imposing wider lockdowns that at one point affected more than 300 million people.\n\nBut even the most stringent measures failed to tame Omicron’s spread. By October, China was reporting thousands of daily infections again. Amid mounting public frustration, the People’s Daily, the party’s main mouthpiece, insisted zero-Covid is “sustainable” and the country’s “best choice.”\n\nAt the opening of the congress, Xi gave a sweeping endorsement of his Covid policy, saying it had “prioritized the people and their lives above all else.” He scored a big political victory, securing a third term and stacking the party’s top ranks with staunch allies – including those who had loyally carried out his Covid policies.\n\nOfficials took the hint and became ever more zealous in enforcing zero-Covid, dashing hopes that the country could open up after the congress.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping emerges from the 20th Party Congress with more power than ever.

A 3-year-old boy died of gas poisoning in lockdown after he was blocked from being taken promptly to a hospital. A 4-month-old girl died in hotel quarantine after a 12-hour delay in medical care.\n\nThen, in late November, a deadly apartment fire in the western city of Urumqi finally ignited public anger that had been simmering for months. Many believed lockdown measures had hampered rescue efforts, despite official denials.\n\nProtests erupted across the country, on a scale unseen in decades. On university campuses and the streets of major cities, crowds gathered to call for an end to incessant Covid tests and lockdowns, with some decrying censorship and demanding greater political freedoms.\n\nIn Shanghai, protesters even demanded that Xi step down – an unimaginable act of political defiance toward the country’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades.\n\nThe nationwide demonstrations posed an unprecedented challenge to Xi. By then, Omicron had seemingly spun out of control, with the country logging a daily record of more than 40,000 infections, and the economic strain becoming too severe, with local governments running out of cash to pay huge lockdown bills.\n\nProtesters march down the streets of Beijing to call for an end to zero-Covid on November 28.

But it does nothing to ...", "text": "Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nThe world has failed to reach an agreement to phase out fossil fuels after marathon UN climate talks were “stonewalled” by a number of oil-producing nations.\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries at the COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt took the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030.\n\nThe recent devastating floods across Pakistan are just one example of the suffering caused or made worse by the climate crisis. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe agreement also reaffirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nHowever, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.\n\n“It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.\n\nAddressing the summit early on Sunday morning, the European Union’s Climate Chief Frans Timmermans said the EU was “disappointed” with the final outcome of the summit.\n\n“What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet … we should have done much more,” Timmermans said.\n\nVictory for climate crisis victims\n\nThe agreement to help the world’s most vulnerable countries deal with loss and damage represents a breakthrough, however, in what has been a contentious negotiation process.\n\nIt marks the first time countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the United States and the EU, have agreed to establish a fund for nations vulnerable to climate disasters made worse by pollution disproportionately produced by wealthy, industrialized nations.\n\nNegotiators and non-governmental organizations observing the talks praised the deal as a significant achievement, after developing nations and small island countries banded together to amplify pressure.\n\n“The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world,” Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a statement. “We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve.”\n\nThe creation of the fund also became one of the key demands of activists attending the summit. Unlike in previous years, when huge protests and loud calls for action become part of the event, demonstrations were muted this year.\n\nProtests are rare and mostly illegal in Egypt and the Egyptian government put strict limits on protesters attending the conference.\n\nStill, the biggest protest of the summit saw hundreds of activists marching through the venue last weekend, demanding climate payments. On Friday, 10-year-old Ghanian activist Nakeeyat Dramani received a standing ovation in the plenary after calling on the delegates to “have a heart and do the math.”\n\nClimate activists staged a number of protests during the conference, demanding end of fossil fuels and climate finance. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe fund will focus on what can be done to support loss and damage resources, but it does not include liability or compensation provisions, a senior Biden administration official told CNN.\n\nReaching the agreement was not easy. The summit was originally scheduled to end on Friday, but went well into overtime with negotiators still trying to hammer out the details as the conference venue was being dismantled around them.\n\nThe US and other developed nations have long sought to avoid such provisions that could open them up to legal liability and lawsuits from other countries. And in previous public remarks, US Climate Envoy John Kerry had said loss and damage was not the same thing as climate reparations.\n\n“‘Reparations’ is not a word or a term that has been used in this context,” Kerry said on a recent call with reporters earlier this month. He added: “We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”\n\nDetails on how the fund would operate remain murky. The text leaves a lot of questions on when it will be finalized and become operational, and how exactly it would be funded. The text also mentions a transitional committee that will help nail down those details, but doesn’t set specific future deadlines.\n\nAnd while climate experts celebrated the win, they also noted the uncertainty going forward.\n\n“This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes,” World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said. “At the same time, developing countries are leaving Egypt without clear assurances about how the loss and damage fund will be overseen.”\n\nAn outcome on a fund came this year in large part because the G77 bloc of developing nations stayed unified, exerting increased leverage on loss and damage than in past years, climate experts said.\n\n“They needed to be together to force the conversation we’re having now,” Nisha Krishnan, resilience director for World Resources Institute Africa told reporters. “The coalition has held because of this conviction that we did need to stay together to deliver this – and to push the conversation.”\n\nFor many, the fund represents a hard-fought years-long victory, pushed over the finish line by the global attention given to climate disasters such as Pakistan’s devastating flooding this summer.\n\n“It was like a big buildup,” former US climate envoy Todd Stern told CNN. “This has been around for quite a while and it’s getting all the more aggravating to vulnerable countries because there’s still not a lot of money getting put into it. As we can see the actual disaster impacts of climate change are getting more and more intense.”\n\nThe EU's Frans Timmermans speaks to reporters during the summit. Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty Images\n\nText on 1.5 degrees remains\n\nGlobal scientists have for decades warned that warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels – a threshold that is fast-approaching as the planet’s average temperature has already climbed to around 1.1 degrees.\n\nBeyond 1.5 degrees, the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages will increase dramatically, scientists said in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\n\nBut while summit delegates affirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, climate experts expressed dismay about a lack of mention of fossil fuels, or the need to phase them down to keep global temperatures from rising. As it did last year at the Glasgow summit, the text calls for a phasedown of unabated coal power, and “phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” but does not go further to call for a phase-out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas.\n\n“The influence of the fossil fuel industry was found across the board,” Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation, said in a statement. “The Egyptian Presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petro-states and the fossil fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the United Arab Emirates next year.”\n\nIt took some dramatic action to even hold onto the 1.5-degree number struck in Glasgow last year.\n\nOn Saturday, EU officials threatened to walk out of the meeting if the final agreement failed to endorse the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In a carefully choreographed news conference, Timmermans, flanked by a full line-up of ministers and other top officials from EU member states, said that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”\n\n“We do not want 1.5 Celsius to die here and today. That to us is completely unacceptable,” he said.\n\nThe talks were further complicated by the fact that Kerry, who was leading the US delegation, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. He continued to communicate with his team and his foreign counterparts by phone, but his physical absence was noticeable during the crunch time at the summit.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry gestures toward his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the COP27 summit. Nariman El-Mofty/AP\n\nThe US and China resume climate talks\n\nAside from the final agreement, the summit brought several other significant developments including the resumption of formal climate talks between the US and China – the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters.\n\nAfter China froze climate negotiations between the two countries this summer, US President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping agreed to reestablish US-China communications when they met last week at the G20 summit in Bali, paving the way for Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua to meet again formally.\n\n“Without China, even if the US is … moving towards a 1.5-degree program, … if we don’t have China, nobody else can make … that goal,” Kerry told CNN last week.\n\nThe two sides met throughout the second week of COP, trying to pick up where they left off before China suspended the talks, according to a source familiar with the discussions. They were focused on specific action points, such as enhancing China’s plan to reduce emissions of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and their overall emissions target, the source said.\n\nUnlike last year, there was no big, joint climate announcement from the two countries. But the resumption of formal communication was seen as an encouraging sign.\n\nLi Shuo, a Beijing-based global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia said this COP “saw extensive exchanges between the two sides, led by Kerry and Xie.”\n\n“The challenge is they should do more than talk, [and] also need to lead,” Shuo said, adding the restarted formal dialogue “helps to prevent the worst outcome.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Ella Nilsen Rachel Ramirez", "Ivana Kottasová", "Ella Nilsen", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/weather/hurricane-tropical-storm-fiona-monday", "title": "Hurricane Fiona: 2 dead, 1,000 rescued as storm cripples Puerto ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: In the storm’s path?

The Guanajibo River in Hormigueros surpassed its previous record height set during Maria.\n\nMeanwhile, southern Puerto Rico can expect another 4 to 8 inches of rain or more early this week – meaning Fiona will leave the island deluged with 12 to 30 inches of rain, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.\n\n“These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides across Puerto Rico,” the center said.\n\nAt least one death was reported in the heavily-damaged city of Basse-Terre, the capitol of the French territory of Guadeloupe, the vice president of the territory’s environmental agency said.\n\nFiona could become a major hurricane by Wednesday, with winds reaching 111 mph. That would make Fiona the first major hurricane of the year in the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nMassive power outages cripple Puerto Rico\n\nA house is deluged Sunday in Cayey, Puerto Rico. Three people inside the home were reportedly rescued. Stephanie Rojas/AP\n\nJust 115,000 out of 1.4 million customers on the island currently have power, Pierluisi said Monday evening. The entire island was in the dark early Monday, PowerOutage.us reported.\n\nAnd it could be days before power is restored, the main power utility in Puerto Rico said Sunday, as daily high temperatures after Monday are forecast to reach the mid-80s to 90s.\n\nSeveral transmission line outages contributing to the blackout, LUMA Energy said. Power will be restored “gradually,” Pierluisi said in a Facebook post.\n\nOnly 35% of customers are getting water services because water filtration plants are being impacted by the river flooding and excess rain, the governor said.\n\nHurricane evacuees take refuge at a public school in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico. Ricardo Arduengo/Reuters\n\nBy late Monday morning, a bit of good news from island’s capital: The power system came back up for hospitals in San Juan’s medical complex, Puerto Rico Health Secretary Dr. Carlos Mellado López said. The complex is the island’s most important and stretches across 227 acres, according to the Health Administration of Puerto Rico.\n\n“The power system at all the hospitals in the Medical Center Complex has been restored,” Mellado tweeted Sunday night. “Our patients are safe and receiving the medical care they need.”\n\nFiona’s latest path\n\nIntense rainfall will continue producing mudslides, landslides and catastrophic flooding across Puerto Rico through Monday night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFiona could intensify as it moves across the Atlantic Ocean. cnnweather\n\nThe hurricane slammed the Dominican Republic community of Boca de Yuma early Monday, whipping maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm knocked 59 aqueducts out of service, leaving more than 1 million people in the Dominican Republic without running water, according to Jose Luis German Mejia, an emergency management official. At least 54 homes have been reported damaged so far, said Juan Manuel Mendez, the country’s emergency management director of operations.\n\nEmergency officials have transported 789 people to safety, Mendez said at a storm briefing Monday. More than 500 people are housed in 29 shelters, he said.\n\nTen electric circuits are offline currently, but officials did not have an exact number of how many customers were without power.\n\n“This is still an emergency event,” and the storm is still affecting the country, said Mejia.\n\nLife-threatening flash flooding and urban flooding is forecast for eastern portions of the Dominican Republic through early Tuesday, the hurricane center said.\n\nFiona could also dump 10 inches of rain in the eastern and northern parts of the country, according to the center.\n\nGET LIVE UPDATES\n\nAs Fiona moves away from the Dominican Republic’s northern coast, it’s expected to intensify as it moves north over warm water.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected in the southeastern Bahamas by late Monday or early Tuesday, and Fiona is expected to impact the eastern Turks and Caicos on Tuesday morning.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said Monday evening.\n\n“Fiona will continue turning northward and then northeastward this week, nearing Bermuda on Friday as a major hurricane,” CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nYet another widespread calamity\n\nPower outages have become a familiar crisis for many who live in Puerto Rico. Just five months ago, residents suffered another islandwide blackout after a fire broke out in a power plant.\n\nSome parts of the island still bear the scars of Maria, which inflicted catastrophic infrastructure damage; it took almost a year for power to be restored across the island.\n\nSamuel Rivera and his mother Lourdes Rodriguez lived without power for about a year after Maria, Rivera told CNN. On Sunday morning, they lost power once again, conjuring up similar fears to those they had five years ago.\n\nThey were also concerned a nearby river might overflow and trees surrounding their home could be felled by the powerful winds, they said.\n\nRushing waters easily wiped away a bridge, carrying its structure downstream, one video of the dangerous flooding shows. Elsewhere in the city of Arecibo, quickly moving waters overtook large construction vehicles and entire trees as rain fell in sheets, another video by Samuel De Jesús shows.\n\nMany rivers on the eastern side of the island were at moderate to major flood stages Sunday afternoon, including one southeastern river which rose over 12 feet in less than seven hours.\n\nUS President Joe Biden early Sunday approved an emergency declaration to provide federal assistance to disaster relief efforts.\n\nMore than 300 FEMA emergency workers were on the ground to respond to the crisis, said Anne Bink, FEMA’s associate administrator for Response and Recovery.\n\n“Our heart goes out to the residents that again are going through another catastrophic event five years later,” Bink said, nodding to Maria. This time, she said, FEMA plans to implement lessons learned from the 2017 crisis.\n\n“We were much more prepared. We have four warehouses now strategically located throughout the island, which includes commodities, exponentially larger supplies than in the past,” Bink said.\n\n“We’re proactively there – and well ahead of any storm hitting – to make sure that we are coordinating. And all of the planning efforts we undertake during those blue skies days can be brought to bear when the rain falls.”\n\nBiden told Gov. Pierluisi in a Tuesday call that he would “ensure that the Federal team remains on the job to get it done, especially given that Puerto Rico is still recovering from the damage of Hurricane Maria five years ago this week,” a readout of the call said.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe Holly Yan Melissa Alonso", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Holly Yan", "Melissa Alonso"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/americas/viktor-bout-profile-prisoner-swap-intl", "title": "Viktor Bout: The Russian arms dealer swapped for Brittney Griner ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrittney Griner’s freedom ultimately hinged on the release of a convicted Russian arms dealer whose life story inspired a Hollywood film.\n\nThe US basketball star was released on Thursday from Russian detention in a prisoner swap for Viktor Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death” by his accusers.\n\nBout, a former Soviet military officer, was serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Bout has maintained he is innocent.\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly called for Bout’s release, slamming his sentencing in 2012 as “baseless and biased.”\n\nRussia’s foreign ministry said Thursday that Bout was returned to Russia after the exchange at Abu Dhabi Airport. Footage shared by Russian state television later showed Bout walking on a tarmac in Abu Dhabi, then boarding and sitting down inside a plane, which later landed in Moscow.\n\n“For a long time, the Russian Federation has been negotiating with the United States on the release of V. A. Bout,” the ministry said in a statement. “Washington categorically refused dialogue on the inclusion of the Russian [citizen] in the exchange scheme. Nevertheless, the Russian Federation continued to actively work to rescue our compatriot.”\n\nIt added that as a result of Russia’s negotiations with the US, Bout had been “returned to his homeland.”\n\nBout’s US lawyer, Steve Zissou, said that Bout was with his wife and daughter. “We are grateful that after 15 long years, Viktor has finally been reunited with his family,” he added.\n\nGriner – who had for years played in the off-season for a Russian women’s basketball team – was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region in February. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in Mordovia in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\nThe swap, which US President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan. Whelan was arrested on alleged espionage charges in 2018 and sentenced to 16-years in prison in a trial that US officials have called unfair.\n\nGriner and Whelan’s families had urged the White House to secure their release, including via prisoner exchange if necessary.\n\nAt the center of their bid was Bout, a man who eluded international arrest warrants and asset freezes for years.\n\nThe Russian businessman, who speaks six languages, was arrested in a sting operation in 2008 led by US drug enforcement agents in Thailand posing as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by the acronym FARC. He was eventually extradited to the US in 2010 after a protracted court proceeding.\n\n“Viktor Bout has been international arms trafficking enemy number one for many years, arming some of the most violent conflicts around the globe,” said Preet Bharara, the US attorney in Manhattan when Bout was sentenced in New York in 2012.\n\n“He was finally brought to justice in an American court for agreeing to provide a staggering number of military-grade weapons to an avowed terrorist organization committed to killing Americans.”\n\nThe trial honed in on Bout’s role in supplying weapons to FARC, a guerrilla group that waged an insurgency in Colombia until 2016. The US said the weapons were intended to kill US citizens.\n\nBut Bout’s history in the arms trade extended much further afield. He has been accused of assembling a fleet of cargo planes to traffic military-grade weapons to conflict zones around the world since the 1990s, fueling bloody conflicts from Liberia to Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Allegations of trafficking activities in Liberia prompted US authorities to freeze his American assets in 2004 and blocked any US transactions.\n\nBout has repeatedly maintained that he operated legitimate businesses and acted as a mere logistics provider. He is believed to be in his 50s, with his age in dispute because of different passports and documents.\n\nViktor Bout is pictured in a temporary cell ahead of a hearing at a court in Bangkok in August 2010. Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“His early days are a mystery,” Douglas Farah, a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center who co-authored a book on Bout, told CNN in 2010.\n\nFarah told Mother Jones magazine in 2007 that according to his multiple passports, Bout was born in 1967 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, the son of a bookkeeper and an auto mechanic. He said that Bout graduated from the Military Institute on Foreign Languages, a well-known feeder school for Russian military intelligence.\n\n“He was a Soviet officer, most likely a lieutenant, who simply saw the opportunities presented by three factors that came with the collapse of the USSR and the state sponsorship that entailed: abandoned aircraft on the runways from Moscow to Kiev, no longer able to fly because of the lack of money for fuel or maintenance; huge stores of surplus weapons that were guarded by guards suddenly receiving little or no salary; and the booming demand for those weapons from traditional Soviet clients and newly emerging armed groups from Africa to the Philippines,” Farah told the magazine.\n\nBout has said that he worked as a military officer in Mozambique. Others have said it was actually Angola, where Russia had a large military presence at the time, Farah told CNN. He first became known when the United Nations began investigating him in the early-to-mid 1990s and the United States began to get involved.\n\nBout – who reportedly has used names including “Victor Anatoliyevich Bout,” “Victor But,” “Viktor Butt,” “Viktor Bulakin” and “Vadim Markovich Aminov” – is thought to have been the inspiration for the arms-dealer character played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 movie “Lord of War.”\n\nIn 2002, CNN’s Jill Dougherty met with Bout in Moscow. She asked him about allegations against him – did he sell arms to the Taliban? To al Qaeda? Did he supply rebels in Africa and get paid in blood diamonds? – and he denied each claim.\n\n“It’s a false allegation and it’s a lie,” he said. “I’ve never touched diamonds in my life and I’m not a diamond guy and I don’t want that business.”\n\n“I’m not afraid,” he told Dougherty. “I didn’t do anything in my life I should be afraid of.”", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/china/china-protest-crackdown-intl-hnk", "title": "China's security apparatus swings into action to smother Covid ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChina’s vast security apparatus has moved swiftly to smother mass protests that swept the country, with police patrolling streets, checking cell phones and even calling some demonstrators to warn them against a repeat.\n\nIn major cities on Monday and Tuesday, police flooded the sites of protests that took place over the weekend, when thousands gathered to vent their anger over the country’s tough zero-Covid policy – some calling for greater democracy and freedom in an extraordinary show of dissent against Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nThe heavy police presence has discouraged protesters from gathering since, while authorities in some cities have adopted surveillance tactics used in the far western region of Xinjiang to intimidate those who demonstrated at the weekend.\n\nIn what appears to be the first official response – albeit veiled – to the protests, China’s domestic security chief vowed at a meeting Tuesday to “effectively maintain overall social stability.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN's Beijing reporter breaks down latest police moves to suppress protests 03:10 • Source: CNN CNN's Beijing reporter breaks down latest police moves to suppress protests 03:10\n\nWithout mentioning the demonstrations, Chen Wenqing urged law enforcement officials to “resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as illegal and criminal acts that disrupt social order,” the state-run news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nThe tough language may signal a heavy-handed crackdown ahead. While protests over local grievances do occur in China, the current wave of demonstrations is the most widespread since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement of 1989. The political defiance is also unprecedented, with some protesters openly calling for Xi, the country’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades, to step down.\n\nSome of the boldest protests took place in Shanghai, where crowds called for Xi’s removal two nights in a row. The sidewalks of Urumqi Road – the main protest site – have been completely blocked by tall barricades, making it virtually impossible for crowds to congregate.\n\nPolice cars patrol Shanghai's Urumqi Road, which has been completely blocked off by tall barricades after a weekend of protests.

Police also waited inside a subway station there, closing off all but one exit, according to a protester at the scene.\n\nCNN is not naming any of the protesters in this story to protect them from reprisals.\n\nThe protester said he saw police checking the cell phones of passersby, and asking them if they had installed virtual private networks (VPNs) that can be used to circumvent China’s internet firewall, or apps such as Twitter and Telegram, which though banned in the country have been used by protesters.\n\n“There were also police dogs. The whole atmosphere was chilling,” the protester said.\n\nProtesters later decided to move their planned demonstration to another location, but by the time they arrived, the security presence had already been stepped up there, the protester said.\n\n“There were too many police and we had to cancel,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a widely circulated video appears to show police officers checking passengers’ mobile phones on a Shanghai subway train.\n\nAnother Shanghai protester told CNN they were among “around 80 to 110” people detained by police on Saturday night, adding they were released 24 hours later.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the number of protesters detained and it is unclear how many people, if any, remain in custody.\n\nThe protester said the detainees had their phones confiscated on board a bus that took them to a police station, where officers collected their fingerprints and retina patterns.\n\nAccording to the protester, police told those detained they had been used by “ill-intentioned people who want to start a color revolution,” pointing to nationwide protests breaking out on the same day as evidence of that.\n\nThe protester said police returned their phone and camera upon their release, but officers had deleted the photo album and removed the WeChat social media app.\n\nCalls from police\n\nIn Beijing, police vehicles, many parked with their lights flashing, lined eerily quiet streets on Monday morning throughout parts of the capital, including near Liangmaqiao in the city’s central Chaoyang district, where a large crowd of protesters had gathered Sunday night.\n\nThe demonstration, which saw hundreds marching down the city’s Third Ring Road, ended peacefully in the early hours of Monday under the close watch of lines of police officers.\n\nBut some protesters have since received phone calls from the police inquiring about their participation.\n\nOne demonstrator said she received a phone call from a man who identified himself as a local police officer, asking her whether she was at the protest and what she saw there. She was also told that if she had any discontent with authorities, she should complain to the police, instead of taking part in “illegal activities” such as the protest.\n\n“That night, the police mostly adopted a calm approach when dealing with us. But the Communist Party is very good at meting out punishment afterward,” the demonstrator told CNN.\n\nShe said she did not wear a face mask during the demonstration. “I don’t think Omicron is that scary,” she said. But her friends who wore masks to the protest also received calls from the police – some as late as 1 a.m., she added.\n\nStill, the protester remained defiant. “It is our legitimate right (to protest), because the constitution stipulates that we have freedom of speech and freedom of congregation,” she said.\n\nAnother protester, who has not heard from the police, told CNN that concern she could be the next to be called upon weighs heavily on her mind.\n\n“I can only seek consolation by telling myself that there were so many of us who took part in the protest, they can’t put a thousand people in jail,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, some universities in Beijing have arranged transportation for students to return home early for winter break and take classes online, citing an effort to reduce Covid risks for students taking public transportation.\n\nBut the arrangement also conveniently discourages students from gathering, following demonstrations on a series of campuses over the weekend, including the prestigious Tsinghua University where hundreds of students shouted for “Democracy and rule of law! Freedom of expression!”\n\nGiven the long history of student-led movements in modern China, authorities are particularly concerned about political rallies on university campuses.\n\nBeijing’s universities have been the source of demonstrations which kicked off the May Fourth Movement in 1919, to which the Chinese Communist Party traces its roots, as well as the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, which were brutally crushed by the Chinese military.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan Philip Wang", "Nectar Gan", "Philip Wang"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/china/china-xi-g20-summit-day-1-intl-hnk", "title": "G20 summit: Xi Jingping starts first day with a whirlwind of meetings ...", "text": "Bali, Indonesia CNN —\n\nAfter a near three-year absence from the world stage, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has embarked on a whirlwind of face-to-face meetings with Western leaders at the Group of 20 summit in Bali, as he looks to reassert China’s global influence.\n\nFollowing a three-hour meeting on Monday with US President Joe Biden in an attempt to prevent their rivalry from spilling into open conflict, Xi on Tuesday held talks with the leaders of four US allies – Australia, France, the Netherlands and South Korea.\n\nChina’s relations with US allies have deteriorated to varying degrees in recent years, due to rising geopolitical tensions, disputes over trade and the origins of Covid-19 pandemic, as well as Beijing’s growing partnership with Moscow – despite Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nWhile the flurry of in-person meetings are unlikely to completely reset relations, they could serve as a positive first step in restoring open communication channels – in some ways similar to the meeting between Xi and Biden.\n\nFor the majority of the pandemic, Xi limited his diplomatic activities to virtual summits and video conferences, hunkering down inside of China’s borders during a period of rising tensions with the West.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has sought to work closer with allies and partners to counter Beijing’s growing influence, framing the rivalry with China as part of the global clash between democracy and autocracy.\n\nOn Monday, Xi pushed back at that narrative. In a Chinese readout of the meeting, Xi described his country’s system of governance as “Chinese-style democracy,” in an apparent signal to US allies that ideological differences are not a barrier to relations with Beijing.\n\nStabilizing relations\n\nThe most anticipated in-person diplomacy by Xi on Tuesday was perhaps his meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, partly because ties between Beijing and Canberra have frayed significantly over the past years.\n\nIn a statement, Albanese called the meeting an “important step towards the stabilization of the Australia-China relationship.”\n\nAt the meeting, Xi told Albanese that good relations between Beijing and Canberra were in the “fundamental interests of both our peoples” and “conducive to peaceful development in the Asia-Pacific region.”\n\n“Mr. Prime Minister – you have said on multiple occasions that you will handle our countries’ bilateral relations in a more balanced approach, for which I highly value,” Xi told Albanese.\n\nThe two countries have been locked in a bruising trade dispute and diplomatic freeze since early 2020, when China slapped tariffs on Australia following its call for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus.\n\nGeopolitics is also a sore point between the two nations. Canberra is alarmed by Beijing’s growing influence in the Pacific islands, while China is angered by Australia’s new military alliance with the US and the UK, intended to provide Australia with nuclear powered submarines and other advance weaponry.\n\nLeaders of the two countries last met when Albanese’s predecessor, Scott Morrison, had brief informal discussions with Xi at the G20 in Japan in 2019. But it has been six years since leaders from the two sides have held a formal bilateral meeting, after then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s sit-down with Xi at the G20 in the Chinese city of Hangzhou in 2016.\n\n“We are always going to be better off when we talk to each other, calmly and directly,” Albanese said in his statement. “We will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, and engage in our national interest.”\n\nAs the case with the meeting between Xi and Biden, few in Australia believe the meeting between Xi and Albanese can completely reset the two countries’ strained relations.\n\n“Much has happened in the last six years when the leaders of the two countries last met and the geopolitical dynamics of the region have changed too much for a ‘reset,’” said Jennifer Hsu, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Australia.\n\n“Furthermore, a certain and influential segment of Australia’s foreign policy and national security institutions have fundamentally reshaped how China is viewed and that is difficult to undo,” Hsu added.\n\nJohn Lee, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington and former national security adviser to the Australian government, said core Chinese objectives – such as its South China Sea, Taiwan and South Pacific policies – are “fundamentally at odds with Australia’s core interests.”\n\n“It may be a diplomatic reset of some sorts but not one in substance where both sides begin to genuinely approach each other in good faith and a preparedness to compromise,” Lee added.\n\nBusy schedule\n\nIn a sign of Xi’s busy schedule, the Chinese leader and French President Emmanuel Macron squeezed in a meeting early on Tuesday, before both leaders showed up at the opening of the G20 summit.\n\nThe talks, which lasted for 43 minutes according to the French Presidency, saw Xi reiterate his support for a ceasefire and peace talks to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Xi stressed China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent, advocating a ceasefire, a stop to war and peace talks,” a readout of the bilat from Chinese state media CCTV said.\n\nA readout from the French Presidency said the two leaders “reaffirmed their firm position on preventing the use of nuclear weapons” in the war in Ukraine – a line that was not included in the Chinese readout.\n\nFrance, like other European countries, has hardened its position on China in recent years, increasingly viewing the country as a competitor and security concern.\n\nXi also met South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Senegalese President Macky Sall, and is expected to meet a few more world leaders later on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}]}

Groves was captured following a standoff at a residence in southwest Atlanta, officials said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry celebrated Groves' capture in post on X, thanking the federal, state and local law enforcement officials \"who worked tirelessly to put each of these men back where they belong: BEHIND BARS.\"\n\n“Let me be very clear: when someone escapes our custody, we will not stop until they are found,” Sheriff Susan Hutson said in a statement.\n\n“For nearly five months, law enforcement across multiple states worked tirelessly to bring Groves back into custody. I want to thank the Atlanta Police Department, the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office, the U.S. Marshals Service, and our own OPSO Fugitive Apprehension Team for their relentless pursuit and commitment to public safety,” Hutson said.\n\nGroves was one of 10 men who escaped from the jail in the early hours of May 16, breaching a cell wall and using a blind spot to flee undetected. The jailbreak was one of the largest and most brazen in recent U.S. history, prompting a massive manhunt that spanned multiple states and sparked immediate scrutiny over the prison's security vulnerabilities.\n\nThree men were recaptured within hours, and six more were caught in the weeks after the escape, including two who were found more than 300 miles away in Huntsville, Texas. The men, who initially faced criminal charges including murder, aggravated assault and domestic abuse, were charged with simple escape in July. An attorney for Groves was present at the hearing but did not enter a plea on his behalf, according to The Times-Picayune/NOLA.com.\n\nGroves will now face extradition proceedings to return to New Orleans, according to the sheriff's office.\n\n\"We will pursue every available legal avenue to ensure that Derrick Groves answers for every crime he has committed and every consequence he has sought to avoid,\" District Attorney Jason Williams said in a statement.\n\nWho is Derrick Groves?\n\nGroves, 28, was convicted of two charges of second-degree murder and two charges of attempted second-degree murder in 2024 in connection with a shooting during Mardi Gras in 2018, according to a statement from the district attorney’s office. Groves allegedly “brazenly boasted about the violence” and took credit for the killings on social media, the news release said.\n\nThe shooting sparked a yearslong legal drama, officials said. Groves was initially convicted in 2019 alongside a codefendant, but he had to be retried in January 2023 after the passage of a state law on jury verdicts. The retrial ended in a mistrial after a juror read media accounts of the case, and a second retrial in June 2023 ended in a deadlocked jury, according to the district attorney.\n\nGroves has also been awaiting sentencing on a manslaughter charge since October 2024, according to a news release from the governor’s office. He also faces a charge of battery against a correctional facility employee, The Associated Press previously reported, citing court records.\n\nHow did the inmates escape?\n\nThe inmates escaped by ripping away a toilet and sink unit and climbing through the hole in the wall, according to authorities. They fled from the building through a loading dock door.\n\nThe group then moved along a secure perimeter road between the jail and a building under construction, authorities said. After scaling a barbed wire fence, surveillance footage captured the men running across Interstate 10 and disappearing into a nearby neighborhood, where investigators later found discarded prison clothing.\n\nThe escape went unnoticed for more than seven hours after authorities discovered the men were missing from a morning headcount. Authorities found several taunting phrases and doodles scrawled on the wall above the hole, including \"To easy lol\" and \"Catch us when you can.\"\n\nGroves' girlfriend among more than a dozen arrested for aiding escapees\n\nSince the jailbreak, at least 16 people have been arrested for aiding the escapees. Most of the alleged accomplices are related to the escapees, according to authorities, but jail maintenance worker Sterling Williams, 33, was also arrested and charged with being a principal to simple escape and malfeasance in office.\n\nAttorney General Liz Murrill previously said Williams admitted that he complied with a demand from one of the inmates to shut off the water to a cell, which allowed the escapees to remove the toilet and sink unit. His lawyer said he did so because of a clogged toilet, not to aid in the escape.\n\nDarriana Burton, a former Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office's employee who is believed to be Groves' girlfriend, was also arrested for allegedly aiding in his escape.\n\nHow police caught the last New Orleans escapee\n\nOfficials offered up to $50,000 for information leading to the capture of Groves and Antoine Massey, who was recaptured in June.\n\nDeputy U.S. Marshal Brian Fair told The Associated Press an anonymous tip submitted to Crimestoppers that originated out of New Orleans led law enforcement to Groves.\n\n“He was hiding in a crawl space,” Fair told the outlet. “It appears he was the only one in this house and he was hidden pretty well.”\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/23/new-orleans-jailbreak-inmates-charges/85348493007/", "title": "9 New Orleans inmates who broke out of jail in May plead not guilty ...", "text": "Nine of the 10 inmates accused of breaking out of a New Orleans city jail by climbing through a hole behind a toilet earlier this year have pleaded not guilty to charges related to the escape on July 23, the Louisiana Attorney General's Office said.\n\nTen men escaped from the Orleans Parish Prison in the early hours of May 16, breaching a cell wall and using a blind spot to flee undetected.

Lester Duhé, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Attorney General’s Office, confirmed to USA TODAY that the nine men pleaded not guilty to escape charges.\n\nAn attorney for Groves was present at the hearing but did not enter a plea on his behalf, according to The Times-Picayune/NOLA.com.\n\nAll 10 inmates are charged with simple escape, which carries a sentence of two to five years in prison, authorities said. The inmates initially faced other criminal charges, including murder, aggravated assault, and domestic abuse.\n\n\"Everyone is entitled to due process. But there’s a video of these detainees running out of the jail in the middle of the night. They were not heading to court hearings,\" Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement on social media after the hearing. \"We will continue to hold everyone accountable for the escape.\"\n\nHow did the inmates escape?\n\nThe inmates escaped by going through a hole in a cell wall after ripping away a toilet and sink unit, according to authorities. They fled from the building by passing through a loading dock door.\n\nThe group then moved along a secure perimeter road between the jail and a building under construction, authorities said. After scaling a barbed wire fence, surveillance footage captured the men running across Interstate 10 and disappearing into a nearby neighborhood, where investigators later found discarded prison clothing.\n\nThe escape went unnoticed for more than seven hours after authorities discovered the men were missing from a morning headcount. Authorities found several taunting phrases and doodles scrawled on the wall above the hole, including \"To [sic] easy lol\" and \"Catch us when you can.\"\n\nAuthorities have said they suspected that other people had either helped the inmates escape from the prison or helped them evade capture. Since the jailbreak, at least 16 people have been arrested for aiding the escapees.\n\nMost of the alleged accomplices are family members of the escapees, according to authorities. Jail maintenance worker Sterling Williams, 33, was arrested and charged with being a principal to simple escape and malfeasance in office.\n\nMurrill previously said Williams admitted that he complied with a demand from one of the inmates to shut off the water to a cell, which allowed the escapees to remove the toilet and sink unit. His lawyer said he did so because of a clogged toilet, not to aid in the escape.\n\nNew Orleans jail escape: Maps and videos show how it happened\n\n10th inmate still on the lam\n\nGroves, 27, is the only inmate who remains at large. New Orleans Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick has urged Groves to turn himself in, saying that either way, \"you will be taken into custody.\"\n\nHe was convicted of two charges of second-degree murder and two charges of attempted second-degree murder in October in connection with a shooting during Mardi Gras in 2018. Groves also has been awaiting sentencing on a manslaughter charge since October.\n\nOn June 27, authorities arrested Antoine Massey, 33, at a residence in New Orleans, according to the Louisiana State Police. He was initially in jail on charges of domestic abuse involving strangulation and theft of a motor vehicle.\n\nMassey made national headlines last month after two videos posted on social media showed a man purporting to be the escapee and claiming to be innocent. State and local authorities had said they were aware of the videos and were reviewing them.\n\nContributing: Chris Kenning and Jeanine Santucci", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/27/fugitive-nola-jail-break-captured-massey/84392496007/", "title": "Fugitive in NOLA jail break captured after six weeks on the lam", "text": "Authorities in Louisiana have captured one of the last two remaining fugitives still on the loose after a brazen jailbreak in New Orleans nearly six weeks ago.\n\nAntoine Massey, 33, was arrested June 27 at a home in New Orleans, according to the Louisiana State Police.\n\nHe was among 10 inmates being held at the New Orleans Justice Center who broke out of jail on May 16, an escape that wasn’t noticed until more than seven hours later. It prompted a manhunt that spanned multiple states.\n\nEight of the 10 were captured earlier, most in New Orleans and two in Texas. Earlier this month, Massey posted a social media video proclaiming his innocence.\n\nMassey, who stood out for his face tattoos of chess pieces, was in jail on charges of domestic abuse involving strangulation and theft of a motor vehicle. Officials said new charges were forthcoming.\n\nHis arrest means that only one escapee, Derrick Groves, remains on the lam. Groves, 27, was convicted of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder in connection with a shooting during Mardi Gras in 2018.\n\n\"Great work by all our law enforcement partners who have been working so hard for this outcome. 1 more to go!” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said on social media.\n\nNew Orleans Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick urged Groves to turn himself in. Either way, she said, “you will be taken into custody.”\n\nThe escapes, which sent several prosecutors and victims fleeing for safety, raised questions about the jail’s operations and highlighted a facility that the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office said was overcrowded and in need of security upgrades.\n\nSheriff Susan Hutson, whose department operates the jail and has faced intense scrutiny over the escapes, personally received the tip June 27 that led to the arrest.\n\n\"This is a major step forward in our efforts to restore order and accountability after this serious incident,\" she said at a news conference in New Orleans.\n\nAuthorities had offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the fugitives’ arrests.\n\nMassey had been hiding in a home in a New Orleans neighborhood that is less than 2 miles from the jail. He peacefully gave up when police surrounded it around 3:30 p.m. June 27, authorities said. Police are still examining who might have helped him.\n\nThe captures come as Louisiana authorities continue to investigate how the men were able to create a hole in a cell wall by ripping out a toilet and to escape without being noticed by guards in the early hours of May 16. Their absences were not discovered until the next morning.\n\nHutson has said the escapees appeared to have gotten help from the inside. One maintenance worker was arrested. In addition, she said the jail suffered from underfunding and a shortage of staff. Her critics have blamed mismanagement.\n\nOn June 27, she noted that the jail was already working to secure locks and add razor wire and other security measures as part of a larger effort to improve the facility.\n\nLouisiana State Police said Massey would be transported to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, the state’s oldest and only maximum-security prison.\n\n(This story has been updated to correct a misspelling/typo.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/16/new-orleans-jailbreak-manhunt-push-fixes/83996315007/", "title": "New Orleans jailbreak, a manhunt and push to fix a city's broken jail", "text": "On May 16, 10 men escaped from the Orleans Justice Center, the main jail in New Orleans.\n\nThe manhunt to catch the escapees has cost the city of New Orleans alone $500,000.\n\nThe state legislature in Louisiana has approved $1.8 million for expenses.\n\nThe escape was one of America's largest and most brazen in recent memory and set off a fresh round of soul-searching over New Orleans’ troubled history of incarceration.\n\nOn June 27, the ninth escapee was captured.\n\nOn Oct. 8, the last escapee was captured in Atlanta.\n\nNEW ORLEANS – They waited until after midnight to make their move.\n\nAs nearly 1,400 inmates at the sprawling New Orleans jail slept, 10 men slipped quietly from their metal bunks. A worker monitoring their tier by surveillance camera went on break.\n\nBy 12:22 a.m., several inmates in orange and white prison clothing were forcing open the door of an empty cell.\n\nAn audacious escape plan was unfolding.\n\nBut to reach freedom on this muggy Louisiana night, everything would have to go right.\n\nThey would have to wrench a toilet from the wall to open a passage. Get past steel bars. Climb a wall tipped with barbed wire.\n\nAll without being spotted in a jail that bristled with 900 surveillance cameras.\n\nAbout an hour later, the men — some facing charges for violent crimes including second-degree murder — were scrambling across an interstate highway before disappearing into the city just a few miles from Bourbon Street.\n\nAll that was left was a drawing of a face, its tongue sticking out, above the misspelled but taunting phrase, “To Easy LoL,” scrawled above a rectangular hole in the cell wall.\n\nThe May 16 jailbreak at the Orleans Justice Center marked one of America’s largest and most brazen escapes in recent memory – one seemingly straight out of Hollywood.\n\nIt prompted a costly manhunt that gripped the city. It sent prosecutors and victims fleeing for safety. It fueled political fallout. And it would highlight dangerous conditions in the city’s jail, setting off a fresh round of soul-searching over New Orleans’ troubled history of incarceration.\n\nHow, many in the city wondered, could they have broken out of a jail that was nine years old? How would police catch 10 scattered fugitives? And would the debacle bring change to a jail that had seemingly failed to turn the page on the city’s long-struggling lockups?\n\nBut those answers would all come later.\n\nAs the sun rose on the Big Easy that morning, no one at the jail – at least not jail leaders – had any idea the prisoners were missing.\n\nDelayed discovery fuels fear\n\nOrleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams' phone started pinging the next morning at his office, which has windows looking toward the nearby jail.\n\n“Is it true that there was some sort of jailbreak?” a reporter's text message asked.\n\nNot far away, New Orleans Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick was in a meeting around 10:30 a.m. when she heard. “We quickly kind of looked at each other and said, ‘Let’s verify this,’” she said.\n\nThe news set off a scramble to learn what had happened.\n\nA routine morning headcount had been conducted by the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which runs the Orleans Justice Center jail. Not long after 8:30 a.m., jail staff realized that at least several inmates were missing.\n\nThe facility went on lockdown. A frantic internal search began. Guards checked passageways, crawlspaces and housing units. Not long after, the sheriff’s office notified the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nAmid reviews of surveillance footage, it ultimately became apparent that 10 men had escaped.\n\nBy the time the first absences were discovered, the men had more than a 7-hour head start, which would fuel sharp criticism and anger across the city.\n\n“Do not engage or approach these subjects,” Sheriff Susan Hutson said at a news conference on the steps of the jail later that morning.\n\nMost of the fugitives were awaiting court proceedings or trials, like most other inmates. The youngest was 19. The oldest was 42.\n\nThere was Antoine Massey, 33, who stood out for his face tattoos of chess pieces and was in jail on charges of domestic abuse involving strangulation and theft of a motor vehicle. He was called a “Houdini” in a local report because of past instances of slipping out of ankle monitors and other Louisiana lockups.\n\nThere was Leo Tate Sr., 31, facing charges including burglary and drug possession, and Jermaine Donald, 42, facing charges including second-degree murder. Lenton Vanburen, 26, was arrested on charges of second-degree murder and armed robbery.\n\nAnd there was Derrick Groves, 27, convicted of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder in connection with a shooting during Mardi Gras in 2018. It was a difficult case that had to be tried twice and included witness intimidation, the DA said.\n\nGroves also had a link to the city’s dark history of police corruption: In 1996, a corrupt patrol officer who led a drug ring was convicted of ordering the killing of his grandmother, Kim Groves, after she filed a police brutality report, local media reported.\n\nFearing retaliation, two prosecutors who had worked on Groves’ case prepared to leave town with their families. Some witnesses and victims' families were also relocated with the help of prosecutors. A relative of 21-year-old Byron Jackson, killed in the shooting, went to stay with his girlfriend in another part of town, saying he feared for his safety.\n\nThe city suddenly seemed way too small.\n\n“There's one degree of separation in New Orleans,” Williams said. “And so if there's someone you're looking for to cause them harm, you're going to see them.”\n\nAs news spread, one group of conventioneers contacted city tourism officials. They were connected with local police, who were beefing up their presence in the city.\n\nSome residents cited New Orleans’ resilience during tough times – think Hurricane Katrina or after 14 were killed this year after a man drove a speeding truck into New Year’s Day revelers on Bourbon Street – and took it in stride.\n\n“There’s some concern for our safety because they are dangerous criminals. But it’s not like we’re going to stop living our lives,” said Tess Gonzales, manager of Daisy Mae’s Southern Fried Chicken & Breakfast.\n\nIt wasn’t long before some were selling T-shirts emblazoned with the phrase, “To Easy LoL\" as it took off across social media.\n\nOthers who live close to the jail were downright frightened.\n\nIn a New Orleans neighborhood about a mile from the jail, an area dotted with wood-frame homes on stilts with peeling paint, corner stores and small churches, Lakisha Catchings, a mother of eight, said the dangers were keeping her family indoors.\n\n“It's scary,” said the 44-year-old, who grew increasingly angry that the escape put her family in harm's way.\n\n“How did they let this happen?” Catchings asked as she stood near her front door, a welcome sign hanging to one side.\n\n‘Shawshank Redemption on a much bigger scale’\n\nFor law enforcement, the clock was running.\n\nIn Baton Rouge, 80 miles to the west, the Louisiana State Police quickly mustered a 200-member multi-agency task force to search for the fugitives. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill launched an investigation.\n\nNew Orleans police also jumped into action, aiding the search while posting patrol cars at schools and safeguarding victims, witnesses and judges connected to the criminal cases of the inmates.\n\nAuthorities hoped it wouldn’t take long. The escape was already a black eye for the jail, generating national headlines as one of the largest in recent memory. And some in the local criminal justice community worried about the fallout from an extended search.\n\nFuture witnesses or victims critical to criminal cases “may have second thoughts about cooperating with law enforcement if they believe that the system isn't capable of preventing people that they may be identifying from escaping,” said Rafael Goyeneche, the head of the city’s Metropolitan Crime Commission.\n\nThe men had fled the jail with no money, phones, food, transportation or changes of clothing. So there was a good chance some would turn to people they knew for help.\n\nInvestigators raced to check jail phone logs to see who might have known ahead of time. They searched out relatives and friends who might know their whereabouts. Police turned to a private network of facial recognition cameras whose use had been under review.\n\nRewards for tips leading to their capture were announced. They would eventually grow to $50,000 each.\n\n“We understand that some of you might be reporting a friend, a loved one, a relative and albeit not easy, it is critical to your safety and the safety of the public that you report them,” Jonathan Tapp, head of the FBI office in New Orleans, said at a news conference.\n\nBut getting some residents to cooperate was complicated by distrust linked to the city’s past history of police abuses – including corruption and unconstitutional arrests that led to years of federal oversight. On top of that, the city’s lockups had historically been places known for violence.\n\nSome residents, as a result, might be “reluctant to participate in an investigation like this,” said Stella Cziment, a former defense attorney who is now an independent police monitor.\n\nOfficials expressed confidence. And experts said that typically more than 90% of the nation’s roughly 2,000 inmates who escape each year are recaptured.\n\nBut Goyeneche said such escapes are most common during a work or medical release, rather than busting through jail walls and taking time to scrawl a mocking message.\n\n“It was too easy,” he said. “This was ‘Shawshank Redemption’ on a much bigger scale.”\n\nEscapees seek aid and cover\n\nOn the morning of the escape, two of the men were seen walking in black hoodies and jeans near Hustler Hollywood on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, a popular destination for tourists.\n\nSuch clues led investigators to believe many were still in town in the days after the breakout.\n\nAnthony Cangelosi, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former U.S. Marshal and Secret Service agent, said that those with a larger network of resources were likely to last the longest.\n\nFor some, that included friends or family members.\n\nVanburen allegedly got help from one person in driving him to a relative’s home and helping him contact family, while another person offered him a hiding place in a vacant apartment, the Associated Press reported.\n\nOthers turned to people they knew for money and rides. Some covered their tracks including by using internet phone service.\n\nWithin 24 hours of the escape, however, police had zeroed in on several fugitives.\n\nAfter a foot chase in the French Quarter, police recaptured Kendell Myles after finding him hiding under a car parked near the swanky Hotel Monteleone, which boasts a seafood restaurant and a heated rooftop pool.\n\nDkanen Dennis was detained while staying in a house in an eastern city neighborhood.\n\nAnd by that evening, a tip led authorities just down the street where Catchings and her family were hunkered down and some residents were afraid to talk to reporters for fear of retaliation.\n\nRon Wicker, who lives with his father in the home they’ve owned and lived in since the 1940s, watched as a flood of unmarked police cars descended on the house next door around 7:30 p.m. as the sun set on his threadbare street.\n\nHe saw escapee Robert Moody, 21, wearing camouflage pants, hauled back into custody, where he had been held on drug and weapon charges. It was both a relief and a reminder more could be hiding nearby.\n\n“I couldn’t believe he was next door,” Wicker said.\n\nOthers, however, would prove more difficult to find.\n\nDetails of the escape emerge\n\nFour days after the escape, Hutson wore a white uniform shirt with a gold sheriff's star as she sat in a New Orleans city council hearing room filled with TV news cameras.\n\nWith the city on edge, intense scrutiny had fallen on the sheriff, who had suspended her reelection campaign to seek a second term but not heeded calls to resign.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry had already said the jailbreak demonstrated a systemic failure. Jean-Paul Morrell, a city council member, said people were “terrified, upset and angry.” Now the council wanted to hear how inmates had pulled off the escape.\n\nHutson and her top staffers said there were procedural failures and apparent “wrongdoing” by some inside the jail, and was compounded by security gaps stemming from poor infrastructure, overcrowding and inadequate staffing.\n\nShe took full responsibility, calling the escape “deeply troubling,\" and vowed to correct lapses.\n\nAt the time of the escape, no deputy was assigned to the pod. A civilian worker stationed at a module where cameras can be viewed had briefly stepped away for food. At times, short staffing meant there was no one to cover for such breaks.\n\nGoyeneche said staff are supposed to do physical checks and that lights in observation booths should indicate if cells are locked.\n\nHutson's office said that by 12:43 a.m., multiple inmates entered the cell door they’d jarred open earlier.\n\nBefore they could pull off the sink-toilet unit affixed to the wall, they needed the water turned off to avoid flooding. Jail maintenance worker Sterling Williams was arrested, accused of aiding the escape by turning off the water. His lawyer said he did so because of a clogged toilet, not to aid in the escape.\n\nIn addition, three employees were suspended pending an investigation, Hutson's office said, without detailing why.\n\nBehind the sink, at least one steel bar appeared to have been cut using a tool. Orleans Parish Chief of Corrections Jeworski Mallett said breaching the wall near the toilets would not have been possible without outside assistance.\n\nBy around 1 a.m., the inmates had climbed through the hole, one by one, and had passed through a loading dock door. They hustled down a secure perimeter road toward a part of the facility that's under construction. The jail is building a mental health annex next door.\n\nBy 1:19 a.m., they scaled a fence with barbed wire, using blankets to avoid injury. A traffic camera then captured the inmates dashing across Interstate 10 into a neighborhood where investigators later found discarded prison clothing.\n\nHow much help the escapees got from the inside was still under investigation. But Hutson said the escape showed that underfunding had left the jail vulnerable.\n\nThe jail needed $13 million for security and infrastructure upgrades, she said. Her office cited inadequate equipment such as aging cameras, faulty locks and jail infrastructure that has faced heavy damage from a growing population of inmates.\n\nThen there were the staffing shortages. Staff could safely manage 800 inmates but instead were supervising 1,400, many charged with violent crimes.\n\n“We need to harden this facility right now, not next month,” Hutson said.\n\nSome on the council pushed back, questioning whether the city's nearly $65 million in annual funding for the jail was being mismanaged.\n\nOutside of the council chambers, critics saw it as a simple failure to ensure jail staff were doing what they should.\n\n“That wasn't a spontaneous escape. That was something that was planned. And they were able to plan it because they recognized that there were flaws in the Sheriff's Office not following their own protocols,” Goyeneche said.\n\nEscape resurfaces historic jail problems\n\nWith the manhunt still in full swing and jail problems in the public spotlight, New Orleans resident Ricky Peterson knew some of the problems were nothing new.\n\nWhen he was briefly locked up shortly after the jail opened nearly a decade ago, he said, inmates had already figured out a way to jam up the locks with tissue.\n\n“It’s not hard to do,” he said.\n\nThe Orleans Justice Center, designed with rows of reflective glass, was opened in 2015. Many hoped it would turn the page on the notorious conditions at the former Orleans Parish Prison, known for years as an overcrowded and dangerous jail.\n\nIn 2009 – a few years after Hurricane Katrina swamped the city’s complex of crumbling lockups — a Justice Department report found inadequate staffing, supervision, mental and medical health services and sanitation.\n\nIt cited an inability to keep inmates safe and instances of “calculated abuse” by deputies who would beat prisoners.\n\nThree years later, a Southern Poverty Law Center lawsuit alleged that “rapes, sexual assaults, and beatings are commonplace.” It alleged that people with mental health struggles were going untreated.\n\n“As hellholes go, there are few worse places in America than the Orleans Parish Prison,” Mother Jones wrote in 2012 in a story about the suit.\n\nVideo footage around that time showed inmates, with no apparent supervision, using drugs, drinking, gambling with cash and even holding a gun.\n\nThe conditions led to federal court oversight and efforts to overhaul policies and reduce violence, with the Justice Department citing “physical and sexual assaults, inadequate medical care, and risks of suicide and mental health decompensation.”\n\nAfter spending roughly $150 million to build what was considered state-of-the-art at the time, problems didn’t evaporate. In recent years, federal monitors have cited “extremely inadequate” staffing levels and lax supervision.\n\nIn October 2024, the monitors found night shift guards performed only 7% of the security checks indicated on their logs. Assigned staff left units unattended for meal breaks. Deputies faced inmate harassment.\n\nInmate violence was at an \"all-time high” with prisoners making weapons, including by prying metal sheeting from windows or sinks in the janitor closets. Some inmates roamed freely, refused to follow staff orders and extorted fellow prisoners.\n\nA lack of effective random searches led to the presence of pills and narcotics. Inmates were often observed smoking illegal substances.\n\nIn 2024, the mother of inmate Terry Carter, who struggled with mental illness, filed a lawsuit after her son died from a drug overdose in the facility in 2023. The suit alleged he had previously overdosed while incarcerated and accused the jail of “failure to stop or even reduce the flow of contraband.”\n\nTwo weeks before the May 16 escape, two other inmates allegedly tried to escape through the ceiling of the same pod, local media reported.\n\n“Too often the failure to follow policy is blamed on the lack of staff or training,” the monitors wrote in one report. “Neither is an acceptable excuse.”\n\nDespite the jail’s troubles, Peterson said he believes the 10-man escape would have been extremely difficult to pull off without some help.\n\n“I immediately thought, inside job,” he said.\n\nCaptures grow including outside accomplices\n\nIn a flat stretch of east Texas on May 26, a white SUV sped down a two-lane road more than 300 miles from New Orleans.\n\nMore than a dozen police cars, sirens wailing, were on its tail.\n\nThe vehicle made quick turns, hoping to shake the pursuing line of cruisers.\n\nState police finally stopped the car on a rural road outside of Huntsville, north of Houston. Officers with weapons raised surrounded the SUV and demanded the passengers get out.\n\n\"I'm not opening, are you kidding me?\" one passenger said before officers got him out of the vehicle and put him into handcuffs, according to police video footage.\n\nIt marked the capture of Leo Tate Sr. and Jermaine Donald. Tate, wearing orange prison clothing and cuffs, was flown back to Louisiana on a state police aircraft.\n\nBy that time, police had arrested eight escapees and sent most to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.\n\nGary Price had been captured after neighbors said had been hiding at a vacant home in east New Orleans.\n\nLenton Vanburen Jr. got picked up while sitting on a bench in a Baton Rouge shopping center.\n\nCorey Boyd was captured while hiding in an apartment by a SWAT team. Later, Corvanntay Baptiste, 38, was accused of hiding Boyd and feeding him while he was in hiding.\n\nShe was among a growing number of arrests of people who aided them, many held on bonds $1 million or higher, with some facing charges of accessory after the fact.\n\nAuthorities reportedly staked out and searched the New Orleans home of Massey’s sister but didn’t locate him. The alleged victim of Massey’s abuse was also arrested and charged with acting as a principal to an aggravated escape and obstructing justice.\n\nAs May drew closer to its end, there were just two inmates left to capture.\n\n“Antoine and Derrick — you are NEXT!” Landry, who announced an independent investigation into the escape, wrote on social media.\n\nBut they needed more tips, especially from friends and family. On May 29, authorities increased the tip reward to $50,000.\n\n“Soon as we get one lead, they relocate to somewhere else, whether that’s a home or businesses,” Louisiana State Police Superintendent Col. Robert Hodges said.\n\nHe didn’t believe the fugitives had the resources to cross international borders.\n\nInvestigators also knew their support was likely centered in or around New Orleans.\n\n\"They're tired,” Hodges said. “They're looking over their shoulder.”\n\nEscape fuels political fights, calls for change\n\nNearly three weeks later, the escapes were proving a wake-up call for change.\n\nSeveral state agencies were conducting audits expected to result in recommended changes in jail policy, staffing and facility upgrades.\n\nAnd the jail was working on new measures – including more security checks, a second perimeter fence, lock improvements and reducing crowding with transfers.\n\n“The only good that can come from anything like this is to figure out what went wrong and make the changes that reduce the potential for this happening again,” Goyeneche said.\n\nBut the search for longer-term solutions also came amid growing political fallout.\n\nLandry, the Republican governor, blamed jail crowding on progressive elected officials in New Orleans. Hutson accused the district attorney of “personal animus and political campaigning” in light of his support for a rival candidate in the upcoming sheriff’s race.\n\nSome city leaders clashed with the sheriff’s office, blaming mismanagement rather than a lack of funding.\n\nMorrell, the city council member, said former jail employees told him there were thousands of languishing work orders and that jail keys weren’t always collected from former employees. The sheriff’s office called the allegation “misinformation.”\n\n“Maybe you don’t need to have the 'Shawshank Redemption' digging a hole to escape,\" Morrell said in a social media video. \"Maybe he didn’t need to hire or scare a maintenance worker into doing it when any employee could walk out with the keys.\"\n\nMurrill, Louisiana’s attorney general, suggested funding to “keep up with the wear and tear on this building.” Others called for pay increases for new deputies who make about $18 an hour.\n\nSome residents such as Caliegh Flynn noted the city already spends a significant portion of the city’s budget on public safety amid competing needs of schools and city infrastructure.\n\nSarah Omojola, director of the Vera Institute of Justice in New Orleans, hoped a desire to reduce the cost of incarceration would lead the state to rethink a pullback last year of money-saving 2017 criminal justice reforms such as shortening sentences and expanding parole.\n\nWhile Louisiana’s legislature toughened penalties after crime rose during the pandemic, crime is now down in New Orleans, police said.\n\nFreddie King III, a city council member, said it was important to delve into root causes, noting that some escapees had previously been in the juvenile system.\n\n“Are we doing enough as a society, as a city, to ensure that our young, specifically Black men, don’t end up in jail?” he said. “We’re not spending enough money where it truly belongs.”\n\nA potential break, a receding threat\n\nThe man with his face tattooed with chess pieces sat on a stool in front of a nondescript kitchen, looking directly at a camera and proclaiming his innocence.\n\nIt was early June, and Massey – still on the run – took to social media to deny he was the mastermind behind the jail break.\n\n\"I didn’t break out. I was let out,” he said.\n\nAsking for help from a litany of celebrities, including President Donald Trump, he said he fled because he was innocent of his charges of domestic abuse involving strangulation.\n\nA day after the video was posted, police raided a house where the video might have been filmed. It was just three miles from jail, NOLA.com reported. He wasn’t there.\n\n“Turn yourself in and you’ll be able to have your day in court,” Landry said at a news conference.\n\nMassey’s grandfather, Lee Taylor, told CBS that he was worried for his grandson, who is a father to a 17-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son.\n\n\"I haven't slept,” he said. “I haven't been eating, and I've lost 15 pounds.”\n\nBy that point, the effort to recapture had cost $500,000 for the city government alone. The Louisiana legislature set aside $1.8 million for expenses related to the manhunt, according to news reports.\n\nAnother potential break came on June 9, when U.S. Marshals Service arrested Darriana Burton, 28, and accused her of aiding in Groves' escape. She was believed to be Groves' girlfriend, the attorney general's office said in a statement, and had formerly worked at the jail.\n\nMurrill said in a television interview that while the threat to the public has been reduced with the captures, the two remaining escapees were still “dangerous ” to witnesses in their cases and the community in general.\n\nAs the days in June started ticking by, the escapees who remained on the lam were not putting a noticeable dent in tourism or scheduled conventions, local officials said. The escapees fell out of the daily news headlines.\n\nKirkpatrick, the New Orleans police chief, said at least one of the escapees may still be in the New Orleans metro area.\n\nAnd she was right.\n\nOn June 27, six weeks after the escape, Hutson personally got a tip about Massey's whereabouts. Authorities were soon surrounding a home in a New Orleans neighborhood, one about two miles from the jail.\n\nMassey came out and gave up peacefully.\n\nHutson and Kirkpatrick \"had a moment\" together as they talked on the phone to plan a news conference. The relief was palpable, Hutson recalled.\n\nBut there was still one left.\n\nOver the next several months, as summer turned into fall, headlines about the hunt faded.

The release stemmed from a case of mistaken identity after authorities confused Bryan with another inmate with the same last name, the sheriff's office said in a statement on July 31.\n\nFollowing a nearly monthlong search, Bryan was found more than 370 miles away at a residence in Cypress, a suburb of Houston, on the morning of Aug. 20, according to the Harris County Precinct 5 Constable's Office. He was arrested in a joint operation between the constable's office and the U.S. Marshals Gulf Coast Violent Offenders Task Force.\n\nWhen authorities arrived at the residence, the constable's office said in a statement that Bryan had unsuccessfully attempted to flee out of a window. He was then treated for minor injuries and booked into the Harris County Jail. Two other people at the home were also arrested on unrelated warrants, the constable's office added.\n\nAuthorities were able to locate Bryan after Crimestoppers of Greater New Orleans said it received an anonymous tip on where he was residing in Texas, which was then sent to the U.S. Marshals Gulf Coast Violent Offenders Task Force. Crimestoppers had been offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\nBefore his release, Bryan was being held on charges including possession of stolen property, possession of drug paraphernalia, and resisting an officer, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said at a news conference on July 25. He also had an active warrant for aggravated assault with a firearm, domestic abuse, child endangerment, and home invasion.\n\nBryan will be transported back to New Orleans to face pending charges, according to the sheriff's office.\n\n\"We are grateful to the community member who stepped forward through Crimestoppers to provide the information that ultimately led to Mr. Bryan's arrest,\" Hutson said in a statement after the arrest. \"While this erroneous release happened due to human failure, we have held those responsible accountable, and we have taken responsibility and put safeguards in place. Today, we can say that Khalil Bryan is back in custody where he belongs.\"\n\nNew Orleans jail escape: Maps and videos show how it happened\n\nNew Orleans authorities say release was due to 'breakdown' in ID process\n\nBryan had been released from a housing unit at 1:17 a.m. local time on July 25, and authorities later discovered the error at 11:10 a.m., the sheriff's office said. The public was then notified of Bryan's release at 3:45 p.m., and the inmate who shared the same last name was properly released at 10:45 p.m.\n\nThe mistaken release was a result of a \"breakdown\" in identity verification procedures during the jail's overnight release process, according to the sheriff's office. The agency noted that the incident was not a system failure but a \"human error compounded by inadequate protocol adherence.\"\n\nSince it was not a security breach or an escape, and Bryan was not considered an immediate threat to the public, the sheriff's office said public notification was held off so that authorities could begin apprehension efforts \"to avoid startling Mr. Bryan and jeopardizing the search.\" The sheriff's office added that Bryan was primarily in custody for non-violent charges and had already bonded out on his previous violent offenses.\n\nThe sheriff's office subsequently launched an investigation and review of protocols, which led to the firings of two deputies and suspensions of five other staff members. The agency said it now requires a supervisor to verify and approve all releases, and all staff will undergo additional training in the release process.\n\nThe sheriff's office said it is also revising inmate release protocols and conducting a personnel audit.\n\n'How did they let this happen?': A jailbreak, a massive manhunt and a push to fix New Orleans’ broken lockup\n\n1 of 10 inmates still at large in New Orleans jailbreak\n\nThe error comes as the jail and the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office are still reeling from the escape of 10 inmates in the early morning hours of May 16, when authorities say the inmates breached a cell wall and used a blind spot to flee undetected. One of the inmates, convicted killer Derrick Groves, remains at large.\n\nGroves was convicted of two charges of second-degree murder and two charges of attempted second-degree murder in October in connection with a shooting during Mardi Gras in 2018. Groves also has been awaiting sentencing on a manslaughter charge since October.\n\nThree men were recaptured by the end of the same day, and five more were caught weeks after the escape. The most recent inmate was captured in late June — nearly six weeks after the high-profile escape.\n\nThe nine inmates who have been recaptured all pleaded not guilty to charges related to the escape on July 23, the Louisiana Attorney General's Office said. And at least 16 other people have been arrested and accused of helping the inmates break out or stay on the run, including family members and at least one jail employee.\n\nThe jailbreak was one of the largest and most brazen in recent U.S. history, prompting a massive manhunt that spanned multiple states and sparked immediate scrutiny over the prison's security vulnerabilities.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/20"}]}

Jason Jarrett of the Gallatin County Sheriff’s Department in Bozeman.\n\nBecause they are frequent travelers, Yvonne and Mark Haas have insurance that covers rescues. But they didn’t need it in Gallatin County.\n\n“We don’t charge for search and rescue,” Jarrett said. “Very, very few places charge for search and rescue.\n\n“In 1982, the good citizens of Gallatin County voted overwhelmingly to tax themselves and support SAR. The program also gets money from use fees such as ATV licenses and boat licenses … and people donate to us.”\n\nThe county includes world-class recreation areas including the Bridger Range, and Jarrett supervises SAR posts at Big Sky and West Yellowstone.\n\n“We have a lot of great country that attracts a lot of outdoor recreation,” he said.\n\nThe county handled 134 SAR calls in 2016. “Some of the calls we get are handled by on-duty deputies at virtually no extra cost while the occasional one might range to $20,000,” he said.\n\n“It averages to about $400 a call. That’s it. That’s the story. It’s all volunteer except for the deputies.”\n\nCritics might find this strange, but some outdoors enthusiasts are generous with their skills when it comes to saving a life.\n\n“This is a very outdoor recreation-oriented community,” Jarrett said from his office in Bozeman. “That community and the area draws world-class outdoor athletes from climbers to divers, not to mention our group of Ham radio operators who are world-class in their field and world-champion Morse Code senders. We have climbers listed among the top 10 in the world.\n\n“And they’re all willing to volunteer to support that outdoor recreation lifestyle.”\n\nLove and Loss on Mount Jefferson\n\nIn the 32 years Jarrett has been involved with SAR, he said there have been a few other people who have been repeat rescuees. “Yes, we’ve come to know the Haas family, and they are very nice people,” Jarrett said.\n\n“After their rescue last year, (Mark Haas) wrote an eloquent piece about the experience for a Washington State Troopers publication. It moved us.”\n\nIn that piece, Haas wrote about the series of events spawned by a sudden intense thunderstorm that led to three rescues that night, including theirs.\n\nHe also praised the two SAR volunteers who hiked up with clothes, built a fire and kept them alive until the helicopter could fly in the next morning.\n\n“We apologized repeatedly for calling them, but they smiled and said they were exactly where they wanted to be,” Haas wrote. “Taylor pointed out shooting stars and commented on the beauty of this place as Jeff told us he had to be rescued one time on an Alaskan adventure so not to be embarrassed. These gentlemen will always be heroes in our minds.”\n\n“The Haas family and about 98 percent of our callers are people out doing what we want people to do,” Jarrett said.\n\n“They’re healthy and physically active outside instead of being in their basements eating Twinkies and playing video games.\n\n“That percentage of people who need SAR assistance are good people who just happen to have a bad day.\n\n“When you’re in the backcountry and you fracture an ankle or blow out a knee, you can’t just hobble to a car and drive to the urgent care.”\n\nAbout 150 names are on the Gallatin County SAR list under 11 specialized categories such as alpine, dogs, radio, dive, horse, snowmobile and Civil Air Patrol.\n\n“I’m the luckiest SAR commander on the planet,” Jarrett said.\n\nTechnology is making outdoor recreationists more self-sufficient and helping reduce the number of SAR calls.\n\n“People don’t get lost like they used to because they have hand radios, GPS that tracks them and their partners and cell phones so they can get up to a ridge and communicate.”\n\nIf Spokane critics of the Haas family rescue are still grumbling, perhaps this will calm them down — Yvonne Haas posted on Facebook, assuring her well-wishers that she was recovering from her leg injury and that the next Haas family adventure will be … in Disney World.\n\nBut even in the Magic Kingdom, there’s a response team on call to respond to emergencies from heart attacks to tumbles off the Matterhorn bobsled ride.\n\nThe cost is built into the price we pay for a thrill.\n\nDeputies rescue siblings from foggy Three Fingered Jack rock face\n\nHiker rescued from Marion Lake trail\n\nSearchers working to rescue climber on Mt.

The floodwaters, rising to about one and a half feet, swept through a campsite on the Reservation, affecting over 100 tourists.\n\nHundreds of tourists evacuated due to 2018 floods\n\nIn July 2018, around 200 tourists were evacuated from the Havasupai Falls area by helicopter due to severe flooding.\n\nHelicopter evacuations were necessary to ensure the safety of all hikers, tourists, and tribal members in the region.\n\nAccording to Republic reports, the evacuees witnessed floodwaters rise to about seven feet before nightfall on July 11, 2018.\n\nFlooding in 2001 swept away a child and their family\n\nIn Aug. 2001, a 2-year-old boy and his parents were swept away in a flash flood in Havasu Canyon while hiking into the famous Havasupai Village, according to Republic reports.\n\nHeaviest flooding in nearly a century hit Havasupai in 1990\n\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, the early 1990s marked the beginning of the worst flooding in the Havasupai Falls area since 1910. The most severe flooding occurred in September 1990, when intense thunderstorms swelled Havasu Creek.\n\nThe agency reported that the 1990s floods led to the destruction of hundreds of Ash trees, wiped out riparian vegetation, and caused significant erosion to the waterfalls.\n\nFlooding has been frequent over the past 30 years.\n\nFlash floods caused evacuations for the Havasupai Tribe in 1997, 2008, 2010 and 2012, according to reports from ABC15.\n\nIn 1997, heavy floods forced evacuations of Havasupai Tribal members after about four inches of rain flooded the area, according to the LA Times.\n\nIn 2008, over six inches of rainwater surged through Havasu Creek, dramatically reshaping the landscape of the iconic Grand Canyon destination. According to ABC News, the floodwaters carved a new stream bed, uprooted trees, and toppled boulders.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey posted videos depicting damage from the flood waters.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-weather/2025/06/04/havasupai-falls-arizona-flooding/84017659007/", "title": "All tourists accounted for after flash flooding hits Havasupai Falls area", "text": "AI-assisted summary Heavy rainfall in the Havasu Canyon area of the Grand Canyon prompted flood warnings and watches through June 4.\n\nThe Havasupai Tribe confirmed the trail and campground remain open, urging visitors to exercise caution.\n\nWhile significant rainfall occurred, the flooding did not necessitate the large-scale rescue efforts seen in August 2024.\n\nWeather forecasters said a flood watch would remain in effect through the evening of June 4 for parts of northwest Arizona, including the village of Supai and a nearby campground on the Havasupai reservation in the Havasu Canyon portion of the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe National Weather Service on June 3 issued a flood warning for the remote area, which is widely known for its blue-green waterfalls and the rugged hike to get there, just before 5 p.m. Law enforcement reported that hikers had been stranded near Havasu Creek, according to the weather service. Havasu Creek is a Colorado River tributary that runs through the Havasupai reservation.\n\nAbbie Fink, a spokesperson for the Havasupai Tribe, said there had been flooding on June 3 and that all tourists and tribe members were accounted for and all right. Fink said campers were advised to move to higher ground because of the flooding.\n\nFink said that the trail into Havasu Canyon is passable, and the campground is open, with no plans to close either. The tribe's tourism office continues to monitor the situation, Fink said. Visitors should proceed with caution and follow all park ranger instructions.\n\nThe weather service kept a flood watch in place after previously extending a flash flood warning. The watch means flash flooding is possible in areas including creeks and normally dry washes, as well as low-water crossings and side and narrow slot canyons. Other Arizona cities covered by the watch include Sedona, Tuba City, Flagstaff and Prescott.\n\nOne to two inches of rain had fallen near Supai on June 3, with an additional two to four inches of rainfall hitting the upper Havasu Creek basin, according to the weather service.\n\nHigh water moved down Cataract Creek and into Havasu Creek from heavy rainfall overnight, the weather service said. The weather service had advised campers to head to higher ground and avoid footbridges that could be washed out.\n\nWhile the extent of any damage from the flooding was not immediately clear, the floodwaters did not appear to prompt a public safety response on the scale of the year prior. Flooding in the remote canyon in August 2024 killed a hiker and prompted the rescue of about 100 tourists and tribe members.\n\nTwo agencies that helped lead that response — the Coconino County Sheriff's Office and Arizona National Guard — confirmed June 3 that they had not been called in to assist after the more recent rainfall.\n\n(This article was updated to add new information and a photo gallery.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/04"}]}

Hundreds ...", "text": "It has been a rough stretch for large pharmacy chains.\n\nCVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are all in the midst of mass closures, and Rite Aid recently filed for bankruptcy for the second time in as many years.\n\nMass closures extend beyond the retail pharmacy space, however, as other companies such as Forever 21, Joann, Macy's, Denny's, Bahama Breeze and more have announced locations would shutter this year.\n\nHere's the latest on pharmacy chains CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid, including how many stores each company is planning to close.\n\nHow many Rite Aid stores are closing?\n\nRite Aid announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again on May 5, the second time since October 2023. Bankruptcy filings have identified 316 store locations Rite Aid has tapped for closure.\n\nOn May 15, Rite Aid said it \"successfully entered into a series of sale agreements and pharmacy services transition agreements,\" which would include transitioning pharmacy assets from locations across the U.S. to CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, Albertsons, Kroger, Giant Eagle and other operators. Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs stores in some states will also be operated by CVS Pharmacy as part of the sale agreements, which were approved on May 21 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of New Jersey, according to Rite Aid's bankruptcy docket.\n\nDuring the transition of prescription files, Rite Aid said its stores will remain open and customers can continue to access their pharmacy services, including prescription refills and immunizations. Before the bankruptcy filing, Rite Aid operated 1,240 stores across 15 states.\n\n“A key priority for Rite Aid is to ensure that as many of our loyal customers as possible continue to receive the pharmacy services and care they require without interruption,\" Matt Schroeder, CEO of Rite Aid, said in a statement. \"These agreements ensure our pharmacy customers will experience a smooth transition while preserving jobs for some of our valued team members.”\n\nRite Aid has buyers for customer files at 810 of its stores, but did not find a buyer for files at 200 other locations, according to Reuters. While the deadline to enter bids for Rite Aid's pharmacy assets (May 13) has passed, the deadline to enter bids for the chain's remaining assets, including the Thrifty Ice Cream business, is June 13, with an auction date set for June 20.\n\nHow many Walgreens stores are closing?\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance announced in October 2024 its plans to close approximately 1,200 stores across the United States as the pharmacy chain struggles with slumping consumer spending.\n\nAt the time, the chain said the closures would occur within three years, starting with about 500 stores being shuttered in fiscal year 2025, which ends in August.\n\nThe move is part of a multi-year cost-cutting program under CEO Tim Wentworth, who took on the job in 2023. In a statement in October 2024, Wentworth reiterated the company's commitment to focusing on improving its core business: retail pharmacy.\n\n\"This turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term,\" Wentworth said in the statement.\n\n“We continue to execute our previously announced turnaround plan aimed at stabilizing retail pharmacy, including our footprint optimization program controlling operating costs, improving cash flow and continuing to address reimbursement models,\" Walgreens said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY on May 30. \"We are on track for our three-year store closures plan.\"\n\nThe company closed 70 stores in its first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended Nov. 30, 2024, Wentworth said in a January 2025 analyst conference call. Walgreens planned to close about another 450 stores through the end of 2025 he said.\n\nIn March 2025, Walgreens entered an agreement to be taken private by Sycamore Partners for $10 billion, closing out nearly a century of trading on public markets for the U.S. pharmacy giant. Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm that specializes in retail and consumer investments, has a track record of acquiring distressed retailers for profit: among them were brands such as Staples, Talbots and Nine West, according to Reuters.\n\nThe deal is not yet final, but Walgreens said in a news release in March it is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nHow many CVS stores are closing?\n\nCVS first announced in November 2021 its plan to close stores as part of an effort to \"optimize our existing stores and pharmacies.\"\n\nThe chain closed 900 stores between 2022 and 2024 and aims to close an additional 270 stores in 2025, company spokesperson Amy Thibault confirmed to USA TODAY on May 29.\n\nThe spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the company is closing locations \"strategically to better meet consumers' health, wellness and pharmacy care needs\" and not in reaction to \"industry pressures.\"\n\nAdditionally, even while it closes certain locations, Thibault said CVS is also opening stores and pharmacies in \"areas where there's a need.\" The company has opened 100 stores between 2022 and 2024, and has plans to open nearly 30 locations, including locations inside Target stores, in 2025.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, Jonathan Limehouse, Mary Walrath-Holdridge, James Powel and Mike Snider, USA TODAY\n\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

The company said earlier this week that 16 locations, including Muncie stores on Tillotson Avenue and McGalliard Road, would close within 60 days unless a buyer is found. But a Marsh spokesman told The Star Press that while the WARN notice specified those 16 stores' closings, closings are likely for all 44 stores without a buyer.\n\n\"Marsh is still working to find a buyer or new investor to keep the stores open,\" Tom Mulligan, representing Marsh in public announcements, told The Star Press Thursday morning.\n\nCalling the bankruptcy filing \"extremely difficult,\" O'Boyle said in a statement, \"After reviewing every alternative, we concluded that Chapter 11 clearly provides the most effective means to ensure the best recovery for the company's stakeholders.\"\n\nMarsh said that under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, stores will operate, customer programs will continue and employees will receive pay and benefits.\n\nAt some stores, like the Hoyt Avenue location in Muncie and others previously announced for closing near the end of the month, store closing sales will continue.\n\nThe 86-year-old company, under Marsh family control until its 2006 sale to Florida investment firm Sun Capital, has struggled with increasing costs and competition from Kroger, Wal-Mart, Meijer and Target in recent years.\n\nFor regional chains, competing against national grocery sellers is hard because national chains can get much better prices from suppliers, Phil Howard, associate professor in community sustainability at Michigan State University, told The Star Press this week.\n\nAccording to Marsh's Thursday statement, because of the bankruptcy filing, the company has to get approval from the Delaware court to pay for goods and services ordered before the bankruptcy filing.\n\nMarsh will use available cash to operate, the company said, and \"expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations throughout the sale process.\"\n\nCiting Marsh's history, from its Muncie founding in 1931 through its status as the first supermarket chain to use electronic scanners and wireless coupons, the company's announcement Thursday noted, \"Marsh is hoping to find the right buyer so that we can continue to serve families across Indiana and Ohio.\"\n\nMarsh has so far this year closed 21 unprofitable stores and its in-store pharmacy business, the latter sold to CVS Pharmacy, sparking a discounted liquor sale.\n\nMarsh has hired the Peter J. Solomon Company to market its assets.\n\nIn its bankruptcy filing, Marsh says its property needs immediate action because \"it includes perishable goods or assets that could quickly deteriorate or lose value without attention,\" including meat, dairy and produce.\n\nThe company estimated it has up to 49 creditors, estimated assets of up to $50,000 — the smallest amount that could be checked on the bankruptcy filing — and liabilities of $50 million to $100 million.\n\nThe filing includes a list of debtors to be consolidated under the bankruptcy filing and it includes names from Marsh's past, including LoBill Foods, as well as companies that it bought out, including former Muncie grocer A.L.

Corporate-owned pharmacies are not eligible for the program, Owens said.\n\nThe larger chain pharmacies are eligible for the vaccine payments, however.\n\nOwens said OHA doesn’t have data yet on how many pharmacies have applied for the supplemental payments.\n\nHe said the pharmacy staffing shortages have been exacerbated by the closure of more than 35 Bi-Mart pharmacies earlier this month. (The Bi-Mart stores themselves remain open.)\n\nThe bigger culprit in the pharmacy crisis is the limited reimbursements that pharmacies receive from what are known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), said Brian Mayo, executive director of the Oregon State Pharmacy Association.\n\nIf those reimbursements were “fair,” pharmacies would be able to hire more employees and lines would be shorter, Mayo said.\n\nCustomers have recently had to wait two or three hours, in some cases, to pick up their prescriptions.\n\nThose delays are not acceptable, Mayo said.\n\n“Many community pharmacies across Oregon are 5 to 14 days behind filling prescriptions because they can’t keep up with the demand,” he said. “When somebody needs a medication they can’t wait two weeks. Patient safety is a huge issue at this point.”\n\nMayo said the Oregon State Pharmacy Association has been warning for years that low reimbursements to pharmacies by PBMs are a problem.\n\n“The harms we have warned of have now come true,” he said.\n\nThe Pharmacy Association is urging elected officials to take immediate action on reforming the PBM system.\n\nThe organization also is asking Oregon to exempt prescription drugs from the state’s Corporate Activities Tax, which the Legislature approved in 2019 and which took effect Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nThe Pharmacy Association has some high-level backing in its effort to reform the PBM system.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., recently sent a letter to Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency, citing both PBM reimbursements and the fees charged by PBMs and by Medicare Part D prescription plans as contributing to pharmacy closures.\n\n“I am deeply concerned that the rise of these fees has contributed to the permanent closure of 2,200 pharmacies nationwide between December 2017 and December 2020,” Wyden wrote in his letter to Brooks-LaSure.\n\nWyden is calling on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to review pharmacy closures in the U.S. over the past five years, including the nature and effect of PBM payment practices, and to use the agency’s authority to regulate their fees.\n\nMayo said the current situation, with lines of customers snaking through some stores, is frustrating for pharmacy employees.\n\n“The pharmacists, technicians and interns are working as fast as they can,” Mayo said. “In many cases, they are being forced to continue working without required breaks and voluntarily working longer unrecorded hours so they can provide care to their customers. They want to help the patients. That’s why they chose this profession, but it feels like things are getting out of control.\n\n“We must improve working conditions in pharmacies for the sake of patient safety and pharmacy staff member well-being,” Mayo said.\n\nIn a written statement to the Baker City Herald, Jill McGinnis, director of communications and public affairs for the corporation that owns both Safeway and Albertsons stores, wrote: “The nation is currently facing a technician shortage and, undoubtedly, all pharmacies have been impacted. Fortunately, we’ve been able to stay open throughout staffing shortages and sickness. We have accepted patients from pharmacies who could no longer stay open, so that we could continue to serve the Baker community and keep prescriptions local.\n\n“We hope that the our customers will continue to be patient with us as we strive to fill open job positions in a tough employment climate, fill their needed prescriptions, and continue to ensure our community is vaccinated.”\n\nHe said Oregon Gov. Kate Brown’s mandate that health care workers, including pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, be vaccinated or receive a medical or religious exception, has had a “minimal” effect on the current staffing shortages.\n\nHe said most pharmacy employees are vaccinated.\n\nAccording to the OHA, as of Nov. 1, 88% of Oregon pharmacists were vaccinated, and 83% of pharmacy technicians.\n\nThe OHA report does not break down the vaccination rate by county, nor does it list how many pharmacy employees have received exceptions.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/retail/2025/05/05/rite-aid-chapter-11-bankruptcy/83467189007/", "title": "Rite Aid begins Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.

Many of the groceries, formerly Albertsons or Safeways, had just been converted to Haggen-branded stores in May and June.\n\nThe latest closures also will take place over 60 days, during which employees will continue to be paid, the company said. The company's five remaining Arizona stores are two in Scottsdale, one more in Tucson and one each in Prescott and Lake Havasu City.\n\nHaggen files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nOn Thursday, Haggen said it was asking the Federal Trade Commission to allow its employees to take jobs with Albertsons as it seeks to wind down most of its operations.\n\n“This has been a priority for Haggen management to ensure its employees can take advantage of every opportunity available to them,” the company said in a statement.\n\nA spokeswoman for the company could not be reached for further comment.\n\nThe quick surrender in Arizona and elsewhere stems from the disastrous December purchase of stores shed by Albertsons and Safeway after Albertsons LLC bought out Safeway in March 2014.\n\nIn the process, Haggen expanded from 18 stores with 16 pharmacies and 2,000 employees in the Pacific Northwest to 164 stores and 106 pharmacies employing more than 10,000 people in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nThe company quickly discovered that its newfound size didn’t translate into sales success in the highly competitive metro Phoenix market. The Valley already has established chains that include Fry's, Walmart, Bashas', WinCo Foods, Whole Foods, Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, Target and other Safeway/Albertsons stores.\n\nLast month, Haggen officials said they were shuttering half the company’s Arizona stores and suggested it was a move that would stabilize the business.\n\nHaggen files $1 billion lawsuit against Albertsons\n\n“Haggen’s goal going forward is to ensure a stable, healthy company that will benefit our customers, associates, vendors, creditors, stakeholders as well as the communities we serve,” Bill Shaner, CEO of Haggen’s Pacific Southwest division, said at the time.\n\n“By making the tough choice to close and sell some stores, we will be able to invest in stores that have the potential to thrive under the Haggen banner.”\n\nShaner has since left the company.\n\nEarlier this month, Haggen sued Albertsons for $1 billion, claiming its rival took “malicious and unfair actions” that “strained Haggen’s resources.”\n\nA week later, the company filed for bankruptcy protection as it sought to reorganize around a profitable core.

Federal, state and local authorities across the region pushed further into the mountain suburbs, including those surrounding Asheville, clearing roads as food, water and other aid was airdropped to residents in need.\n\nCitizen-led volunteer groups in the mountains of western North Carolina have supplemented officials' disaster relief operations, delivering aid to stranded communities on-foot and by helicopter and mule trains.\n\nAt 226 confirmed fatalities as of Friday, Helene is the fourth-deadliest hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. mainland since 1950. The deadliest is Katrina, which killed 1,392 people in 2005, followed by Audrey in 1957 at a death toll of 416. Third on the list is Hurricane Camille in 1969, a Category 5 storm that made landfall along the Mississippi Coast and claimed 256 lives.\n\nThe Asheville Police Department said Friday that 270 of 300 people reported missing have been found alive and well. Police are working on 75 active missing persons cases in the city, with assistance from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHelene's death toll surpassed the milestone of 200 on Thursday, according to a USA TODAY analysis. At least seventy-two fatalities were reported in Buncombe County alone, which encompasses Asheville and many surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nMeanwhile, residents throughout the Southeast were grappling with the storm's immense damage.\n\nDena Banks, 41, lingered near the steps of her home in Barnardsville, North Carolina, and tried to imagine what it might look like to rebuild.\n\n“We lost everything,\" Banks said, standing beside her mud-caked belongings that were scattered across the porch and grassless yard. \"The house has got to be knocked down because it was waist deep.”\n\nFlyovers and satellite images: North Carolina, Florida before and after Hurricane Helene\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ North Carolina officials updated the state's death toll to 115. South Carolina reported 46 deaths. Thirty-three fatalities have been reported in Georgia, 19 in Florida, 11 in Tennessee and 2 in Virginia.\n\n∎ Federal climate records are safe from Helene's aftermath, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Friday. NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, headquartered in Asheville, N.C., has confirmed that all of its staff has been accounted for, and its data holdings – including its paper and film records – are safe.\n\n∎ More than 720,000 homes and businesses across the Southeast remained without power Friday evening, mostly in Georgia and the Carolinas. Outages from Helene peaked at more than 4.5 million reports last week, according to the USA TODAY outage tracker.\n\n∎ Despite the destruction wrought by Helene in parts of Western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is open with limited closures.\n\n∎ Dolly Parton's vast charity has arrived to aid Americans impacted by Hurricane Helene. On Friday, the Sevierville, Tennessee, native announced a partnership with Walmart to assist with relief efforts after the storm. Parton announced a $1 million donation to the Mountain Ways Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to providing immediate assistance to Hurricane Helene flood victims.\n\nYellow jackets, mosquitoes add to the misery\n\nOne overlooked impact of Helene's destruction in Western North Carolina stings more than others - literally.\n\nBecause of the high winds and catastrophic flooding brought by Helene to the region, hundreds of thousands of yellow jackets find themselves in the same predicament as many of western North Carolina's human residents. The insects' homes have been destroyed.\n\nMatt Bertone, an entomologist at North Carolina State University, explained that yellow jackets are social insects that nest in the ground. If they don't have a home, they're going to be agitated and aimlessly flying around.\n\n\"So, basically, if their nest is destroyed, then they have nowhere to go back to,\" Bertone said. \"If they've escaped, if they haven't drowned, they're gonna be out and about, not knowing what to do.\"\n\nIn addition to the yellow jackets, Bertone said there's a good chance for an increase in mosquitoes due to the standing water left in Helene's wake.\n\n\"The water is where they breed, and anytime you have lots of standing water you're gonna have breeding sites for mosquitoes, so there certainly are more puddles and water just in containers and places that have been flooded,\" he said.\n\n– Iris Seaton, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nHelene damage estimates heading north of $30 billion\n\nStaggering estimates of economic losses are emerging amid Helene’s wake across the Southeast.\n\nEarly wind and storm surge losses are estimated between $30.5 billion and $47.5 billion, stated CoreLogic, a California-based provider of financial and consumer analytics.\n\nThat includes wind loss, insured and uninsured storm surge, and inland flood loss for residential and commercial properties across 16 states, the company said Friday. Insured losses are estimated at between $10.5 billion to $17.5 billion.\n\nDamage to homes without flood insurance is to be expected during infrequent intense flood events, said Jon Schneyer, CoreLogic’s director of catastrophe response. Much of Helene’s damage was outside designated special flood hazard areas, so it’s going to be “challenging to realize the full extent of impact to uninsured homeowners.”\n\nIn hard-hit Buncombe County, North Carolina, where there were 140,000 housing units before the storm, only 941 flood insurance policies were active in August, said Swiss Re, a global provider of insurance and reinsurance.\n\nVery little of the flood damage caused by Hurricane Helene in the South will be covered by insurance, said Monica Ningen, CEO of U.S. Property & Casualty Reinsurance at Swiss Re. That will “make the task of rebuilding the communities impacted all the more difficult.”\n\nWhile the number of people and housing units in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina has increased by 10–15% over the past 10 years, Swiss Re said, the number of national flood insurance policies has decreased.\n\n– Dinah Voyles, Pulver, USA TODAY\n\nForecasters eye system in Gulf, also monitoring Kirk and Leslie\n\nForecasters continue to monitor several tropical systems in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn the Gulf, a developing storm promises to bring heavy, potentially flooding rain to Florida starting Sunday and lasting into much of next week. Meteorologists still aren't sure yet if the system will become a named tropical storm, or even potentially a low-end hurricane.\n\nOut in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Kirk and Tropical Storm Leslie continue to spin far from land.\n\nLarge swells from Kirk could bring life-threatening surf to the East Coast of the U.S. by Sunday, the hurricane center said, also potentially threatening oceanfront homes in North Carolina.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Newport/Morehead City, North Carolina, said \"next week, long period swell from distant Hurricane Kirk could bring a threat for an elevated rip current risk, high surf, and ocean overwash to vulnerable areas and where dune structures have been compromised across oceanside portions of the Outer Banks.\"\n\nAnother system, Tropical Storm Leslie, is expected to reach hurricane strength by Saturday, but is no threat to any land areas as of Friday morning, the hurricane center said.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nBarnardsville residents forge ahead as best they can\n\nStanding on her porch, Tammy Hensley spoke on the phone with an accountant, trying to navigate the tangle of federal aid available to her and her neighbors after Helene tore through the region, bringing devastation to the small, Buncombe County community of Barnardsville.\n\n\"We're making it, but it's hard,\" she said.\n\nHensley, 58, has lived in Barnardsville her entire life, and never had she imagined the water could get so high. Her 1970s one-story brick house was destroyed. Some mobile homes had jumped their foundations. Stray porches splintered across her front yard. She said everything inside was coated in layers of mud.\n\n\"None of these trailers are livable,\" she said. Of the property's 14 trailers, all residents had gotten out safely, but two were still living there, despite the wreckage. There's \"nowhere else to go,\" Hensley said.\n\n'Just trying to survive:' Barnardsville residents look toward rebuilding after Helene\n\n– Sarah Honosky, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nBaby storms into the world as Helene ravages North Carolina\n\nBaby Phoenix made an unforgettable debut. It was 1:51 a.m. Sept. 27 and Helene was starting to tear across western North Carolina as Jewelia Crowe, 28, gave birth to her son.\n\nTen weeks premature, Phoenix weighed just 2 pounds 10 ounces. Crowe told the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network, he cried until he settled into her arms.\n\nJust two minutes later, he was taken away and rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit. Almost immediately, according to Crowe and her fiancé Samuel Dillard, a transformer exploded outside, and a nurse let out what Dillard called \"a God-awful scream.\"\n\n“You could see the whole NICU light up,” he said.\n\nBut Phoenix was safe. The generators inside Asheville’s Mission Hospital had kicked in. The power stayed on, and despite the unfolding disaster and the pressure it put on the hospital and its staff in the days that followed, Phoenix has thrived.\n\nRead the full story here: Baby storms into the world as Helene rips Western North Carolina\n\nHelene's wrath renders most homes in North Carolina town uninhabitable\n\nBeacon Village was built in the 1920s for workers employed by the now-defunct Beacon Blanket Company, once one of the largest blanket manufacturers in the world.\n\nBefore Helene, 77 bungalows still dotted town east of Asheville. After the storm, only 11 are habitable.\n\nOn Thursday, homes and cars were caked with mud as people cleared pathways to their homes to salvage what was left.\n\nDerek Hughes, a longtime resident, said his neighbors used canoes and kayaks to rescue people. In one home, a hole could be seen in the roof where rescuers punched through to save people stuck in the attic. “Water was coming in both directions,” Hughes said. “It hit us like a freight train and then it was gone.”\n\nJoi McPherson, who was clearing mud-covered belongings from her home on Thursday, said the residents were not able to get any evacuation warnings because they didn’t have cell service. By the time they received some warning, it was too late.\n\n“It started at 7 (a.m. Friday) and by 11 we were afraid we were gonna die,” she said.\n\n– Kelly Puente, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\n'Catastrophic damage' hinders utility repairs in NC\n\nParts of western North Carolina ravaged by Helene will need to wait longer for power restoration as the widespread damage has hampered crews working in the mountainous region, officials said.\n\nDuke Energy crews have repaired 1.2 million outages in North Carolina since the storm struck the state late last week, said Bill Norton, a spokesperson for the utility company. As of Thursday, 170,000 homes and businesses in the North Carolina mountain region remain without power, including 78,000 in Buncombe County.\n\nAbout 105,000 customers without power live in areas where Helene inflicted “catastrophic damage,” Norton said, adding that it will take more time to get power restored in communities where grid infrastructure was washed away and roads collapsed.\n\nNorton added that heavy damage to transmission infrastructure is causing restoration delays. A substation that serves the leafy Asheville enclave of Biltmore Village, for example, was almost completely submerged in floodwater. “That substation alone is going to take 3-4 months to repair,” he said. In the meantime, the company brought in a 200,000-pound mobile substation from Garner, North Carolina, to power homes and businesses in the area.\n\n“This has been a storm like we have never seen in our history,\" Norton said.\n\nVice President Harris to travel to North Carolina\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Saturday will travel to North Carolina to areas damaged by Helene and receive an on-the-ground briefing about the recovery efforts.\n\nHarris – who visited Augusta, Georgia, earlier in the week – is expected to provide updates on federal actions being taken to support emergency response and recovery efforts in North Carolina and other southeastern states.\n\nPresident Joe Biden visited North and South Carolina on Wednesday and toured sites impacted by the storm in Florida and Georgia on Thursday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Monday visited the Georgia city of Valdosta.\n\nNorth Carolina and Georgia are both key battleground states in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nHelping Helene survivors: Here's how to donate\n\nNC hospital director describes hectic, heroic work for Helene victims\n\nDr. Matt Riester and his wife were about to head out of town to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary when Helene's record-setting rains began to wallop Asheville.\n\nFlood waters were raging and Riester's house went dark. The medical director of the emergency department at Asheville's Mission Hospital scrapped his plans and rushed to work, maneuvering past uprooted trees and downed power lines.\n\nWhen he walked into the hospital, it was a hectic sight. Patients poured in through the emergency room entrance, some with make-shift bandages and slings. One person had caution tape wrapped around an injury as a tourniquet. The hospital, which treats 275 patients on a typical day, attended to 600 and many of them were very ill, the doctor said.\n\nFor days, the hospital has remained filled with patients as staff and volunteers work dayslong shifts, taking to mats and air mattresses for a few hours of sleep.\n\n\"A lot of the emergency room staff, nurses, the doctors, respiratory therapists and techs, everybody, we're all in the same boat,\" Riester said. \"We all have families. We all have houses. Many people had damage to their houses and a lot of people who were here when it initially hit, they didn't leave the hospital for days.\n\n– Beth Warren and Jacob Biba, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDayslong search stretches on after 'wall of water' tore a couple apart\n\nFive days after Tropical Storm Helene ravaged Western North Carolina, Anthony Vanoy sat along Buck Creek in rural McDowell County and watched as a search and rescue team combed through a towering pile of debris searching for his friend, Julie le Roux.\n\nBefore the search and rescue team arrived, Vanoy and a friend spent hours searching for le Roux themselves. Found among the debris, Vanoy said, was one of le Roux's paintings – it was of flowers.\n\nOn the morning of Sept. 27, a “wall of water and rocks and tree debris” barreled through a neighbor’s home where le Roux and her fiancé John Norwood were sheltering. The couple was swept downstream, where Norwood was found pinned among debris, nearly a four-minute walk from his home.\n\n“I crawled around screaming, looking for her, and I just couldn’t find her,” Norwood told ABC News earlier this week. As of Wednesday, le Roux still hadn't been found.\n\nVanoy and Norwood are among hundreds of people searching for loved ones in the aftermath of Helene. Earlier in the week, officials said they've received some 600 missing person reports – a number that's since come down as rescue teams push further into isolated communities and communications are restored.\n\n– Jacob Biba, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nInside the race to alert residents ahead of Helene\n\nAs Helene gathered strength in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, officials with the National Weather Service and authorities in western North Carolina tracked the storm's path and intensity.\n\nThe situation looked so dire that by Wednesday, Sept. 26, officials in Buncombe County declared a local state of emergency for low-lying areas. While urgent warnings were posted on the county's Facebook page, no evacuations were ordered. Meanwhile, the nearby National Weather Service office held daily conferences with local officials, warning of the flood danger posed by the storm.\n\nOn Sept. 26, Buncombe County officials held a virtual news conference, warning residents of the forecast of “catastrophic” and “historic” flooding and suggested, for the first time, that residents in flood-prone areas should evacuate. “We cannot stress enough the seriousness of this situation,” County manager Avril Pinder said. “If you live in a flood prone area … you should take action now – right now.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, Sept. 27, as reports of flooding were becoming widespread, Buncombe County issued a mandatory evacuation order that beeped into phones via the Integrated Public Alert & Warning System, or IPAWS, FEMA’s system for local emergencies.\n\nBut at that point, it was too late to get out, said Clay Chaney, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Weather Forecast Office in Greer, South Carolina. “By the time you get a flash flood emergency, it’s way too late to evacuate,” he said. “At that point, your only option is to go to higher ground.”\n\nRead the full story here: Inside the race to alert residents of Helene's wrath\n\n– Rick Jervis, Chris Kenning and Daniel Dassow, USA TODAY\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; Marcus K.

Kennedy, making potentially tens of thousands of pages of unredacted records available to the public for the first time.\n\nThe release of the files comes after Trump signed a day one executive order in January aimed at fully releasing government documents related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother and presidential candidate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe contents of the documents, and whether any previously unreleased information is in them, wasn't immediately clear. Historians quickly said they would need time to assess the flood of files to understand if they were significantly different from previous releases.\n\nSo far, nothing in the documents has changed the long-held findings that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963 while the then-president rode in a motorcade in Dallas.\n\nRead the JFK files\n\nLooking to read the JFK files yourself? You can find them on the National Archives' website here.\n\nMost of the files are scans of documents, and some are blurred or have become faint or difficult to read in the decades since Kennedy's assassination. There are also photographs and sounds recordings, mostly from the 1960s.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nReport from Russia: Oswald was a lousy shot\n\nOne document dated Nov. 20, 1991 appears to be a teletype of U.S. intelligence reporting on Lee Harvey Oswald, his time in the Soviet Union, his stormy relationship with his Soviet wife – and his apparently poor marksmanship.\n\nThe document says that a KGB official named Nikonov reviewed files from the feared Soviet security service, the KGB, to determine if Oswald “had been a KGB agent.”\n\nReuters reported that the document cited a report from an American professor named E.B. Smith who reported he had talked in Moscow about Oswald with KGB official “Slava” Nikonov, who said he had reviewed five thick files about the assassin to determine if he had been a KGB agent.\n\n“Nikonov is now confident that Oswald was at no time an agent controlled by the KGB,” the document says.\n\nFrom the description of Oswald in the files, Nikonov “doubted that anyone could control Oswald, but noted that the KBG (sic) watched him closely and constantly while he was in the USSR.”\n\nNikonov also commented that Oswald had “a stormy relationship with his Soviet wife, who rode him incessantly/”\n\nThe KGB files “also reflected that Oswald was a poor shot when he tried target firing in the USSR,” the document said.\n\nSome conspiracy theorists have latched onto bits and pieces of the CIA’s files on Oswald, including those about his erratic behavior, as proof he either didn’t act alone – or didn’t actually have anything to do with Kennedy’s assassination.\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nIs that really true?! Sign up for USA TODAY's Checking the Facts newsletter for all answers.\n\nDocuments touch on Lee Harvey Oswald theories\n\nSome of the documents also include references to various conspiracy theories suggesting that Oswald left the Soviet Union in 1962 intent on assassinating the popular young president.\n\nDepartment of Defense documents from 1963 covered the Cold War of the early 1960s and the U.S. involvement in Latin America, trying to thwart Cuban leader Fidel Castro's support of communist forces in other countries.\n\nThe documents suggest that Castro would not go so far as to provoke a war with the United States or escalate to the point \"that would seriously and immediately endanger the Castro regime.\"\n\n\"It appears more likely that Castro might intensify his support of subversive forces in Latin America,\" the document reads.\n\n– Reuters\n\nWhat did experts initially say about the JFK files?\n\nJames Johnston, author of \"Murder, Inc.: The CIA under John F. Kennedy\" told USA TODAY that he wasn’t expecting any bombshells, given that virtually all of the relevant agencies – including the CIA – had promised to turn over everything they had years ago to the National Archives in 1988.\n\n“If it was going to embarrass the agency or tell a different story, they wouldn't have turned them over to the National Archives in the first place,” said Johnston, who was a staff member of the congressional Church Committee that investigated the CIA in 1975. “And if they were withholding them before, I’m guessing they would continue to withhold them.”\n\nJohnston cited one particular document that he knows exists but that he says hasn’t been turned over to the National Archives – the first one-on-one conversation between President Lyndon Johnson and CIA Director John McCone right after Johnson took office after Kennedy’s assassination.\n\nMcCone was long suspected of withholding information from the Warren Commission, the panel Johnson created to investigate Kennedy’s murder, according to Philip Shenon, author of “A Cruel and Shocking Act: The Secret History of the Kennedy Assassination.”\n\nMcCone was kept on as CIA director by Johnson and pledged full cooperation with the commission, which was led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, Shenon wrote in a 2015 Politico article about his book’s findings. He testified that the CIA had no evidence to suggest that Oswald was part of any conspiracy, foreign or domestic, but rather a former Marine and self-proclaimed Marxist who acted as a delusional lone wolf.\n\nThat depiction of Oswald was ultimately adopted by the Warren Commission in its final report. But years later, Shenon said, the CIA itself acknowledged that McCone had withheld information from commission investigators.\n\nWhat is the Warren Commission?\n\nSeveral of the documents released Tuesday are tied to the Warren Commission: But what is it?\n\nAfter Kennedy was shot in 1963, his successor Lyndon B. Johnson created a commission to investigate the assassination. The Warren Commission determined that Oswald, who was arrested and later shot by a nightclub owner on live television, acted alone.\n\nStill, the assassination has fueled intense debate and a myriad of theories challenging the conclusion of the Warren Commission. Polls have shown that many Americans believe Kennedy’s death was part of a wider conspiracy.\n\n– Christopher Cann\n\nPart of Trump’s promise of ‘maximum transparency’ at the nation’s intelligence agencies\n\nTrump himself did not immediately post about the document release. But Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s director of National Intelligence, hailed their release, saying it was part of Trump’s promise for “maximum transparency and a commitment to rebuild the trust of the American people in the Intelligence Community (IC) and federal agencies.”\n\nCritics have long accused the intelligence community, and CIA in particular, of withholding potentially revelatory information about the case. Still, intelligence officials over the years have insisted that they have released everything important and that what’s left was withheld only to protect highly classified sources and methods of gathering intelligence and protecting sources.\n\nIn a statement, Gabbard said that she immediately sent out a directive across the intelligence community after Trump’s Monday announcement ordering everyone to provide all unredacted records within the collection of documents about Kennedy's assassination the national archives for immediate release.\n\nJFK file experts said those documents almost certainly have all been made public and viewed already, but with mostly minor redactions.\n\nNot all documents posted online Tuesday night\n\nThe documents were released just before 7 p.m.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration, the keeper of the documents, posted them with this statement:\n\n“In accordance with President Donald Trump’s directive of March 17, 2025, all records previously withheld for classification that are part of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection are released.”\n\nThe National Archives said it partnered with agencies across the federal government to comply with the President’s directive in support of Executive Order 14176. It said the records are available to access either online or in person, via hard copy or on analog media formats, at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland.\n\n“As the records continue to be digitized, they will be posted to this page,” the National Archives said, suggesting that not all of the documents were being released on Tuesday in digital form.\n\nThe National Archives also said some information might still be withheld under court seal or for grand jury secrecy, and because some tax return information is subject to Internal Revenue Code prohibitions.\n\n'People have been waiting for decades for this'\n\nThe digital document dump came one day after Trump announced the files would be released during a visit to the John F. Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts, which he's taken over as board chairman.\n\n\"People have been waiting for decades for this,\" Trump told reporters.\n\n\"We have a tremendous amount of paper. You've got a lot of reading,” Trump added. “I don't believe we're going to redact anything.”\n\nThe CIA and Federal Bureau of Investigation, which were involved in JFK assassination investigations and in the document release, had no immediate comment.\n\n'An encouraging start'\n\nJFK assassination scholar Jefferson Morley said in a statement late Tuesday night that the release of the first tranche of documents “is an encouraging start.”\n\n“We now have complete versions of approximately a third of the redacted JFK documents held by the National Archives,” or 1,124 of approximately 3,500 documents, said Morley, vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a non-profit that promotes access to historical government documents\n\nHe is also author of the JFK Facts newsletter and three books on the CIA that portray the agency’s involvement in the events leading up to the assassination.\n\n“Seven of ten JFK files held by the Archives and sought by JFK researchers are now in the public record,” Morley said. “These long-secret records shed new light on JFK’s mistrust of the CIA, the Castro assassination plots, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and CIA propaganda operations involving Oswald.”\n\nBut the release does not include two thirds of the promised files, or any of 500-plus IRS records or 2,400 recently discovered FBI files, Morley said.\n\n“Nonetheless,” he said, “this is most positive news on the declassification of JFK files since the 1990s.\"\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nA mad Justice Department scramble to meet Trump’s deadline\n\nTrump’s order reportedly set off a scramble within the Justice Department’s National Security Division to meet Trump's deadline, according to ABC News and Reuters.\n\nIn an email just before 5 p.m. ET Monday, a senior official within DOJ's Office of Intelligence said that even though the FBI had already conducted \"an initial declassification review\" of the documents, \"all\" of the attorneys in the operations section now had to provide \"a second set of eyes\" to help with this \"urgent NSD-wide project.,” ABC News reported Tuesday.\n\nThe process of releasing the files was set in motion on Trump’s first day in office on Jan. 20, when he signed an executive order aimed at fully releasing all government documents related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother and presidential candidate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nA new FBI tranche of 2,400 JFK records\n\nLast month, the FBI said it found some 2,400 new records linked to Kennedy's assassination as well.\n\nThe agency said it was in the process of passing the documents to the National Archives and Records Administration. It's unclear what revelations, if any, are contained in the newly discovered files.\n\nKennedy’s assassination has long been the subject of conspiracies after Oswald, the Marine veteran identified as Kennedy's assassin, was shot and killed days later.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's Health and Human Services secretary, has called for release of the files to see if any U.S. officials were involved in the assassination or potential coverup. Several U.S. investigations had found no such evidence.\n\nWhile millions of government records related to the Kennedy assassination have been previously released, some information remains classified and redacted. Trump said he instructed his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, to oversee the release of the remaining files.\n\nA federal law passed in 1992 required the Kennedy assassination records to be fully released by Oct. 26, 2017 unless the president at the time determined their release would cause \"identifiable harm\" to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations of such gravity that it \"outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\"\n\nTrump was president when the 2017 deadline arrived. He ordered the release of nearly 2,900 records, but kept others secret because of concerns by the CIA and FBI that their release could hurt national security.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden acted in 2021, 2022 and 2023 to give agencies more time to review the records.\n\nThe documents released in 2017 included details on the FBI and CIA investigations into Oswald and information on covert Cold War operations.\n\nJosh Meyer is USA TODAY's Domestic Security Correspondent.

In addition to the immigrant who was arrested, two protesters were arrested as police used pepper spray at one point, Detroit Police Chief Todd Bettison told the Free Press in a statement.\n\nOn the morning of June 30, the chaotic scenes near the corner of Joy and Livernois on Detroit's west side were seen in videos by activists posted on Instagram and described by law enforcement officials. Protesters showed up as federal agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and assisting officers surrounded a house, their rifles drawn, led by an agent with a shield. ICE accused the immigrant, Marcos Fabian Arita Bautista, of fleeing from them earlier.\n\nAgents then apprehended Bautista, described by ICE officials in a statement to the Free Press as an illegal alien from Honduras who had been removed twice from the U.S. Other agencies that helped with his arrest were: Border Patrol, which is part of U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and U.S. Marshals, an ICE spokesman said. Detroit police and ICE both said in statements they will not tolerate people who try to disrupt immigration enforcement.\n\n“Arita has been removed from this country twice and fled from law enforcement officers to try and escape a situation of his own making,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Detroit acting Field Office Director Kevin Raycraft said. “If you have a final order of removal and there is no legal pathway for you to remain in the United States, ICE must lawfully carry out that removal.”\n\nA spokesman for ICE added that \"Arita fled from ICE officers earlier (Monday) morning. Officers observed him enter a residence and received an urgent search warrant signed by a judge to search that residence for Arita. Arita was then taken into ICE custody.\"\n\nProtesters expressed concern about Detroit police assisting the arrest of an immigrant, part of an ongoing debate over whether local law enforcement should cooperate with federal immigration agents as President Donald Trump vows to carry out a record number of deportations. Other areas in the country, such as metro Los Angeles in California, have recently seen an increasing number of raids that have alarmed immigrant advocates, who worry such actions are coming to Detroit.\n\nProtesters showed up at the house where the man was arrested after someone had called a hotline called \"Migra (police) Watch\" set up by People's Movement Assembly, Detroit, a group that fights for immigrant rights, to alert them that ICE agents were surrounding a home, according to People's Movement Assembly.\n\n\"Immediately, our Migra Watch members went to the scene, calling for other community members to join!\" People's Movement Assembly said in a June 30 post on Instagram.\n\nDuring the arrest, the protesters could be heard shouting, but were initially not blocking the police, videos show. Some yelled at the agents: \"Get out of my community,\" \"Leave,\" \"You all terrorize our community,\" and \"You should be ashamed of yourself.\" Others repeatedly chanted: \"Let him go,\" referring to Arita, the immigrant being detained.\n\nAs law enforcement started to leave after the arrest of Arita, a black law enforcement truck with lights flashing started to pull away from the scene, videos show. It's unclear if the vehicle contained Arita or was an assisting scout car.\n\nThe black vehicle drove onto an empty lawn across from the house as a silver truck down the street, which appeared to be steered by a protester, drove alongside him in an apparent attempt to block his access. The silver truck then abruptly turned left and stopped in front of the black law enforcement vehicle in a T-bone alignment as other protesters and police chased after them. A man could be seen running away from the silver vehicle as police chased after him.\n\nHere's how Bettison described what happened:\n\n\"A federal agency requested the Detroit police presence to keep the peace as they were executing a federal search warrant for a wanted individual,\" the police chief said. \"Officers were standing by when a subject interfered with the federal investigation by attempting to block authorities with his vehicle. Officers approached that subject who then ran from their vehicle. Officers pursued the subject and took them into custody. Another subject was arrested for Malicious Destruction of Property of a separate federal vehicle.\"\n\nIn addition, \"an officer also deployed pepper spray after protestors entered the street and approached a scout car that was attempting to drive away,\" Bettison said.\n\nBrian Silverstein, an organizer with Detroit Will Breathe, which sometimes helps People's Assembly, told the Free Press that \"two (protesters) were arrested, charges are pending for both. One was initially arrested by (the Detroit Police Department) then released and re-arrested by CBP (Customs and Border Protection). Another was arrested by DPD and is being held still. That's in addition to the person ICE was targeting in their raid.\"\n\nSilverstein said \"a big question I have is why was there so much DPD presence there in the first place? Bettison keeps saying DPD doesn't work with ICE and yet here they are assisting, protecting and doing clean-up.\"\n\nBettison said in response: \"The Detroit Police Department does not engage in immigration enforcement. Our mission is public safety for both law enforcement and the public. We support peaceful protesting but will not tolerate any action that puts officers or anyone else in danger.\"\n\nDetroit police told the Free Press in February: \"Enforcing federal law, including immigration law, is not the job of a municipal police agency. When interacting with the public, Detroit police officers do not inquire about an individual’s immigration status.\"\n\nAn ICE spokesman echoed Bettinson's views about the June 30 arrests, saying: \"It is a crime to obstruct or otherwise interfere with an ICE arrest and anyone involved may be subject to prosecution under federal law. In addition, encouraging others to interfere or attempt to obstruct an arrest is extremely reckless and places all parties in jeopardy.\"\n\nAccording to ICE, Arita entered the U.S. two times without authorization.\n\nHe \"illegally entered the United States near Falfurrias, Texas, in September 2015,\" ICE said. \"He was apprehended by Border Patrol, served with an expedited removal order and deported to Honduras. He entered illegally again in February 2018 near Hidalgo, Texas. Border Patrol apprehended him again, reinstated his final order of removal and deported him to Honduras.\"\n\nIn 2022, Arita pleaded guilty to driving an unregistered vehicle, operating without required financial responsibility and assigning improper title in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. In June 2025, ICE received information that Arita was residing in metro Detroit.\n\nContact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com, X @nwarikoo or Facebook @nwarikoo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/crime/958891/why-have-the-jfk-assassination-files-been-kept-secret-for-so-long", "title": "Why have the JFK assassination files been kept secret for so long ...", "text": "Thousands of classified documents relating to the assassination of John F.

Of primary concern is that still-living intelligence and law-enforcement informants from the 1960s and 1970s could be at risk of intimidation or even violence if they were publicly identified.\n\nSo will they be released in full and on time?\n\nLast year Biden ordered a review into the remaining files, issuing a memo delaying the documents’ release until this month unless federal agencies persuaded him to give them even more time.\n\nHis administration “is now facing a federal lawsuit from a New York-based lawyer who discovered that the CIA, FBI, DEA and other agencies are hell-bent on keeping the files secret”, said the Daily Mail, “lending more credence to the incredulity of conspiracy theorists with each passing year”.\n\nIf Biden makes the documents public on 15 December, as promised, “he would have broad bipartisan and bicoastal support”, said NBC News.\n\nAccording to a survey of 2,000 US voters conducted by the Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi, seven out of ten want the president to honour his commitment made last year and release the final trove of JFK assassination records in full.\n\nHalf of voters believe the assassination involved multiple conspirators while 38% said Oswald was the lone gunman, the poll showed.\n\n“There’s not a lot that unites a lot of American voters these days, but one of the few things that does is to see President Biden release the long-overdue JFK files as he promised,” said Amandi.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/09/trump-mar-a-lago-search-live-updates/10274512002/", "title": "Trump huddles with House Republicans after FBI search; McConnell ...", "text": "The FBI search of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home drew wide reaction in Washington from Trump allies claiming the Justice Department overreached to lawmakers backing up the agencies unprecedented action.\n\nHere's the latest on what we know:\n\nWhy did they search his home?: Two people familiar with the search told USA TODAY the action was connected to Trump's alleged removal of documents from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago property when his term in office was over.\n\nTwo people familiar with the search told USA TODAY the action was connected to Trump's alleged removal of documents from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago property when his term in office was over.

Jim Banks, R-Indiana, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, tweeted out a photo of Trump and his guests with their thumbs up. Banks said that \"House conservatives are united in standing with President Trump. We will Make America Great Again!\"\n\nBanks later told Fox News that he had never seen Trump \"as fired up as what he was tonight,\" and that members encouraged him to again seek the presidency. \"Everyone in the room encouraged him to run for president again, and the sooner that he gets out and starts campaigning, the better,\" he said.\n\nTrump hosted the dinner at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nThe meeting was planned long before the FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, but guests said the topic of investigations did surface during the meeting.\n\nMembers of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservatives, have often spoken with Trump about plans for the 2022 congressional elections – and perhaps 2024 as well.\n\nAnother of Trump's guests, Rep.

Mar-a-Lago document inquiry is one of many.\n\nMcConnell says country deserves explanation after Mar-a-Lago search\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has found himself on the receiving end of Trump’s ire multiple times, finally broke his silence late Tuesday evening about the Mar-a-Lago search that happened a day earlier.\n\n“The country deserves a thorough and immediate explanation of what led to the events of Monday,” he said in a statement. “Attorney General Garland and the Department of Justice should already have provided answers to the American people and must do so immediately.”\n\nMcConnell's response comes as Republican leaders in the House and other GOP senators have called for an investigation into the FBI, Department of Justice and Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called for Garland to be impeached and for FBI Director Christopher Wray to be removed.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nReport: Rep. Scott Perry’s phone confiscated by FBI\n\nCongressman Scott Perry, R-Pa., told Fox News the FBI confiscated his cell phone Tuesday.\n\nPerry said he was traveling with family when three FBI agents showed him a warrant and asked him to turn over his phone.\n\nThough the incident comes a day after the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, it’s unclear if the incidents are related. Perry has been linked to Trump’s efforts to overturn election results in Georgia and also asked for a presidential pardon, according to testimony during the Jan. 6 hearings.\n\nPerry in his statement to Fox said the agents did not contact his lawyer, who would have “made arrangement for them to have my phone if that was their wish.”\n\n“I’m outraged — though not surprised — that the FBI under the direction of Merrick Garland’s DOJ would seize the phone of a sitting Member of Congress,” Perry said. “My phone contains info about my legislative and political activities, and personal/private discussions with my wife, family, constituents, and friends. None of this is the government’s business.”\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nEx-Trump administration official criticizes Republican leaders for defending former president over Mar-a-Lago search\n\nOne former senior Trump administration official criticized Republican leaders Tuesday, saying their defense of the former president over the Mar-a-Lago search is hurting America’s standing on the global stage.\n\n“Happy to see the FBI doing its job. No one is above the law,” said Lisa Curtis, who served as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for South and Central Asia on the National Security Council from 2017 to 2021.\n\nCurtis told USA TODAY that is “very disappointed with most Republican leaders who won't stand up for democracy in the United States and admit that January 6th has been enormously harmful to our country and its ability to influence global developments.”\n\n“The United States is no longer seen as an example of democracy for other countries to emulate,” said Curtis, who has more than 20 years of service in the U.S. government, including at the NSC, CIA, State Department, and Capitol Hill. “It's painful for me as I have spent the last 30 years of my career trying to promote our democratic ideals and practices overseas in places that desperately need democratic champions.”\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nConstitutional and criminal law scholar calls on Trump to release the details of the search warrant\n\nConstitutional and criminal law scholar Neal Katyal, the former acting U.S. solicitor general, challenged Trump on Tuesday to disclose the contents of the court-approved search warrant so that the public can decide if the Justice Department has engaged in an abuse of power.\n\nKatyal, the Paul Saunders Professor at Georgetown University, said Trump could easily share the details of the warrant, since he was given a copy of it by the federal agents who executed the search, per U.S. policy.\n\n“Search of Trump abusive? Law enforcement leaves a copy of the search warrant, which itemizes what they are looking for and what laws were violated,” Katyal said in a tweet. “If Trump/RNC think this search signed off on by a fed judge is abusive & they have nothing to hide, release the warrant to the public.”\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nMonmouth poll: 41% of Americans favor charging Trump in Jan. 6\n\nMore than four-in-10 Americans believe former President Donald Trump should be charged with crimes related to his involvement in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, according to a new poll published Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the Monmouth University poll, 41% of Americans say they favor charging Trump. Of that number, 73% identify as Democrats, 43% are Independent and just 3% were Republican.\n\nHowever, 34% said they oppose charging Trump, with 66% being Republican, 37% independent and 3% Democrat. A quarter of respondents said they are not sure whether Trump should be charged.\n\nA House committee has been investigating the Jan. 6 attack and held a series of eight televised hearings in June and July.\n\nMonmouth poll: 40% would support Trump in 2024\n\nAlso from the Monmouth poll, a combined 40% of Americans said they definitely or probably would vote for Trump if he ran for president again in 2024. But nearly half, 48%, of Americans said they definitely would not vote for Trump and 8% said they probably wouldn’t support the former president.\n\nThe poll was published a day after the FBI searched Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. It was conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute from July 28 to Aug. 1, with 808 adults age 18 and older surveyed. There is a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump seeks political donations over FBI search of his home\n\nDonald Trump is looking to capitalize on the FBI search of his Florida home – through political fundraising.\n\nIn an email solicitation, Trump tells potential donors that \"these are dark times for our Nation,\" and the political establishment is \"trying to stop the Republican Party and me once more.\"\n\n\"As long as I have your support, I will continue to fight for the Great American People,\" says the Trump email. \"I need every single red-blooded American Patriot to step up during this time.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMike Pence expresses 'deep concern' about search of Trump's house\n\nMany Republicans are rallying around Donald Trump after the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate – some more aggressively than others.\n\nWhile House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans vowed to investigate the Department of Justice over the search, Vice President Mike Pence issued a tweet expressing his \"concern\" over the incident.\n\n\"I share the deep concern of millions of Americans over the unprecedented search of the personal residence of President Trump,\" Pence tweeted.\n\nPence, who like Trump is considering a 2024 presidential run, also said: \"No former President of the United States has ever been subject to a search of their personal residence in American history.\"\n\nOther Republicans, including Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, had not commented at all as of Tuesday morning.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nAndrew Cuomo calls on DOJ to explain search\n\nFormer New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, on Tuesday urged the Justice Department to explain the nature of its search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home so that it would not become political fodder for Republicans.\n\n“It must be more than a search for inconsequential archives or it will be viewed as a political tactic and undermine any future credible investigation & legitimacy of January 6 investigations,” Cuomo said in a tweet.\n\nIn a second tweet, he added that the “bona fide nature” of the search could be used to discredit the House Jan. 6 committee’s investigation of the Capitol attack, which he said would be a “terrible disservice” to their work.\n\nCuomo resigned as governor after a New York Attorney General's Office report found he sexually harassed 11 women.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nEx-AG Gonzales: Mar-a-Lago search recalls 2006 search of congressman’s office\n\nFormer Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said the Mar-a-Lago search recalled his 2006 decision to greenlight the FBI’s search of then-Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., Capitol Hill office, in the midst of a federal bribery investigation, the first time federal authorities searched a lawmaker’s congressional office.\n\n“Because of the historic nature of it, I wanted to be sure,” Gonzales said, describing how top officials, including then-FBI Director Robert Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty gathered to consider the action and its potential implications.\n\nThe reaction, as expected, unleashed a political firestorm.\n\nFacing the prospect that the White House might order the return of documents seized in the unprecedented search, Gonzales said that he and Mueller were prepared to resign. No such order was issues, but a federal appeals court ultimately ruled that the search to be unconstitutional.\n\n“There is a lot at stake here,” Gonzales said.\n\n- Kevin Johnson\n\nMaloney among Dems defending FBI search of Trump's home\n\nAs Donald Trump and Republicans blast the FBI for its search of his Mar-a-Lago home, Democrats defended the search as an appropriate law enforcement action.\n\n“Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America’s national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,\" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.\n\nMaloney, whose committee is also investigating Trump's handling of classified information, said \"it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump’s potentially grave mishandling of classified information.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nFormer AG Gonzales: Search likely had approval from ‘the highest level’\n\nAlberto Gonzales, a former attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, believed that a law enforcement action of such magnitude would almost certainly have involved the sign-off of Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\n“Unless there was a serious breakdown, I have to think that this was approved at the highest level,” Gonzales said.\n\nIn order to proceed with the action, Gonzales said Justice Department officials would have to be “convinced that there was no other way” to obtain the information.\n\n“It raises a number of questions that have to be considered: Why do you need to take the action? Why now? What has been done to obtain the information short of a search? Was there some kind of concern that documents would have been destroyed?”\n\n- Kevin Johnson\n\nPelosi weighs in on Mar-a-Lago search\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NBC's \"Today\" on Tuesday that \"no one is above the law,\" regarding FBI's search of former President Donald Trump's home.\n\n\"We believe in the rule of law. That's what our country is about,\" Pelosi said. \"And no person is above the law. Not even the president of the United States. Not even a former president of the United States.\"\n\nOn House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's comments about the Mar-a-Lago search and \"immediate oversight\" of the Justice Department if Republicans win the House, Pelosi said, \"whatever the leader is saying is probably idle.\"\n\n– Merdie Nzanga\n\nFBI agents organization: Agents work with 'integrity and professionalism'\n\nThe organization that represents FBI agents on Tuesday defended the agency's work as former President Donald Trump and his allies derided the search of his Mar-a-Lago home as politically motivated.\n\n“FBI Special Agents perform their investigative duties with integrity and professionalism, and remain focused on complying with the law and the Constitution,” said Brian O’Hare, president of the FBI Agents Association, in a prepared statement.\n\nO'Hare pointed out that all search warrants are issued by federal district court or magistrate judges and have to comply with detailed procedural rules. Agents also work with Justice Department attorneys on its search warrants, he said.\n\nUnder the law, any search would need to be authorized by a federal judge after finding probable cause that a crime had been committed and that evidence of the crime exists in the location to be searched.\n\nAgents executed a search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday in what two people familiar with the search told USA TODAY was an action related to Trump's alleged removal of documents from the White House when his term ended in 2021.\n\nTrump called the search a \"weaponization of the Justice System\" meant to hurt him politically, a refrain echoed by his Republican allies in the hours after the search became public.\n\n\"It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don’t want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections,\" Trump said in a prepared statement.\n\n- Rick Rouan\n\nKevin McCarthy gives warning to DOJ, AG Merrick Garland\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Monday said the Justice Department had \"reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,\" and promised new investigations into the department if Republicans retake control of the House in the midterm election.\n\n\"Attorney General (Merrick) Garland, preserve your documents and clear your calendar,\" McCarthy tweeted.\n\nRep.

In each of the last six months, the number of background checks has risen steadily, according to FBI records, ending with December's record with more than a half-million over the previous monthly high posted in the aftermath of the 2012 Newtown, Conn., school massacre.\n\nAfter San Bernardino attacks, concealed gun requests skyrocket in area\n\nSince before Thanksgiving weekend, all annual leave for the more than 400 employees of the bureau’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System has been canceled. That Black Friday, the system was swamped with 185,345 background check requests on new firearm sales, a new single-day record. Morris said temporary background check examiners also are being pulled from internal construction projects and bureau divisions that oversee the gathering of crime statistics across the nation.\n\nThe near-constant frenzy of activity within the FBI’s sprawling complex, four hours away from the nation’s capital, may represent the most compelling argument in favor of at least part of President Obama’s recent executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence: the addition of 230 examiners to the NICS operation and 200 more agents for nation's chief gun enforcement agency, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms.\n\nMillions of firearms records languish at National Tracing Center\n\nThe new positions are desperately needed, authorities said, to support the seriously stressed NICS system and to prepare for an even heavier workload as a consequence of the central provision of the administration's executive actions. That directive would require an increasing number of private firearms dealers to be licensed, subjecting their customers to scrutiny under the federal background check system.\n\nSome of the administration's most vocal opponents on gun policy, including those who offered initial skepticism or outright opposition when the executive actions were unveiled earlier this month, now appear open to potentially adding the hundreds of requested positions that would require congressional approval.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, acknowledged in a written statement to USA TODAY that more NICS examiners “might be necessary.’’\n\nObama announces gun actions in emotional plea for congressional action\n\nEven the National Rifle Association, which assailed the administration's overall gun plan as \"political exploitation,'' said that they would \"have no objection'' to proposals that would both bolster the ranks of the ATF and the NICS system.\n\nThe group, however, remained critical of the plan's call for private gun sellers to obtain federal licenses so that buyers would go through background checks.\n\n\"If the addition of these agents are used to apprehend criminals — not to harass law-abiding gun owners — and (the examiners are used) to improve the broken NICS system, we would have no objection,'' NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told USA TODAY.\n\n'Delay queue is growing'\n\nBurrowed in the rolling hills of the West Virginia countryside, the idyllic setting for the NICS operation masks the fraught, politically charged debate that has engulfed national gun policy.\n\nThe NICS system, mandated by Congress as part of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, has for nearly 20 years been a centerpiece of the government's effort to block criminals from obtaining firearms. Yet the operation has largely struggled to keep pace with a steadily increasing number of firearm transfers, while maintaining databases of criminal and mental health records that rely solely on voluntary contributions from state and local authorities. Those records are crucial to determining whether prospective gun buyers are eligible to purchase firearms.\n\n\"We live off those records,'' Morris said. \"That is our bread and butter. ...The misnomer is that FBI has everything that exists on criminal history records in some big repository, and that's simply not true. A lot of data sits out in state and local systems. Being able to reach out and get that information can be very, very challenging.''\n\nMorris said it is impossible to estimate how many records could be missing from the system.\n\n\"You don't know what you don't know, right?''\n\nEarlier this month, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in letters to the nation's governors as part of the administration's executive actions, urged states to provide additional information, saying the existing NICS databases were \"far from complete.'' The letters also contained subtle warnings that the FBI intended to publish each state's contribution in the coming months.\n\n\"The NICS is a critical tool in keeping firearms out of the hands of prohibited persons,'' Lynch wrote, \"but it is only as effective as the information entered into the databases upon which it relies.''\n\nWhile slightly more than 70% of firearms transactions are allowed to proceed within minutes after buyers appear at the counters of licensed dealers, according to the FBI, the records are especially key to quickly reconciling the remaining transfers that require deeper reviews of state and local data before decisions can be issued on whether guns can be sold.\n\nGun license applicants get priority over federal compliance inspections\n\nDepending on the volume of gun sales, at any one time the queue of pending cases — which by law must be resolved within three business days — generally ranges in the several thousand. Recently, those numbers have ballooned as high as 13,000. If the cases, some of which depend on local law enforcement agencies finding paper records to satisfy an examiner's search, cannot be resolved within the three-day period, gun dealers are generally free to complete the sales.\n\n\"Some (cases) aren't being looked at until the third day,'' Morris said, referring to the increasing volume and limited staffing.\n\n\"That delay queue has grown ... that meter is running.''\n\nMorris said that he would like to limit examiners' caseloads to two reviews per hour to ensure accuracy. But that number has nearly doubled to nearly four cases per hour.\n\nRoof serves as cautionary tale\n\nThe enormous stakes are not always apparent, until the first reports of a new mass shooting echo across social media or cable television.\n\nNo one recent case underscores the sobering nature of the work here more, officials said, more than an April transaction in South Carolina, reviewed by a veteran examiner at the West Virginia facility.\n\nIn that case, which could not be resolved within the three-day period, Dylann Roof was mistakenly allowed to walk away with the .45-caliber handgun allegedly used two months later to kill nine people during an evening Bible study session at the iconic Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston.\n\nDuring the background check, Roof's March arrest on felony drug charges was mistakenly attributed to the Lexington County, S.C., Sheriff's Department, not the Columbia, S.C., Police Department, which actually made the arrest. The sheriff's department operates the jail where Roof had been detained.\n\nThe Columbia police report included information that Roof admitted to drug possession, which would have triggered an immediate denial by NICS, according to bureau guidelines. But that information was never seen by the reviewer because the FBI's database did not include Columbia police contacts in its list of agency contacts for Lexington County purchase reviews. The reviewer did attempt to reach the Lexington County prosecutor's office, which was handling the drug case at the time, but received no response.\n\n\"We are all sick about what happened,'' FBI Director James Comey said during a July briefing when the error was disclosed.\n\nMorris said the Roof case continually \"humanizes the process,'' which mostly churns on far outside the public spotlight.\n\n\"These are people who are making life-and-death decisions,'' Morris said, adding that analyst in the Roof case remains on the job working new cases every day. Given the information available at the time, authorities have said the examiner did everything possible to appropriately vet the purchase.\n\n\"She's a great examiner, too.

In 2017, the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.\n\nBut when US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details, they found numerous red flags. The pagoda, they noted, would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection, multiple sources familiar with the episode told CNN.\n\nAlso alarming was that Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches, which US Customs officials are barred from examining, the sources said.\n\nFederal officials quietly killed the project before construction was underway. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the security concerns in 2018.\n\nThe canceled garden is part of a frenzy of counterintelligence activity by the FBI and other federal agencies focused on what career US security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade.\n\nSince at least 2017, federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, shut down a high-profile regional consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies and stonewalled what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.\n\nAmong the most alarming things the FBI uncovered pertains to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications, including those used by US Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile broad concerns about Huawei equipment near US military installations have been well known, the existence of this investigation and its findings have never been reported. Its origins stretch back to at least the Obama administration. It was described to CNN by more than a dozen sources, including current and former national security officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nF.E. Warren Air Force Base, a strategic missile base, is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, an area near a host of cell towers using Huawei equipment. From F.E. Warren Air Force Base/Facebook\n\nIt’s unclear if the intelligence community determined whether any data was actually intercepted and sent back to Beijing from these towers. Sources familiar with the issue say that from a technical standpoint, it’s incredibly difficult to prove a given package of data was stolen and sent overseas.\n\nThe Chinese government strongly denies any efforts to spy on the US. Huawei in a statement to CNN also denied that its equipment is capable of operating in any communications spectrum allocated to the Defense Department.\n\nBut multiple sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that there’s no question the Huawei equipment has the ability to intercept not only commercial cell traffic but also the highly restricted airwaves used by the military and disrupt critical US Strategic Command communications, giving the Chinese government a potential window into America’s nuclear arsenal.\n\n“This gets into some of the most sensitive things we do,” said one former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation. “It would impact our ability for essentially command and control with the nuclear triad. “That goes into the ‘BFD’ category.”\n\n“If it is possible for that to be disrupted, then that is a very bad day,” this person added.\n\nTurning doves into hawks\n\nFormer officials described the probe’s findings as a watershed moment. The investigation was so secret that some senior policymakers in the White House and elsewhere in government weren’t briefed on its existence until 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThat fall, the Federal Communications Commission initiated a rule that effectively banned small telecoms from using Huawei and a few other brands of Chinese made-equipment. “The existence of the investigation at the highest levels turned some doves into hawks,” said one former US official.\n\nIn 2020, Congress approved $1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE cellular technology across wide swaths of rural America.\n\nBut two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made communications equipment—but according to a July 15 update from the commission, it is more than $3 billion short of the money it needs to reimburse all eligible companies.\n\nAbsent more money from Congress, the FCC says it plans to begin reimbursing approved companies for about 40 percent of the costs of removing Huawei equipment. The FCC did not specify a timeframe on when the money will be disbursed.\n\nIn late 2020, the Justice Department referred its national security concerns about Huawei equipment to the Commerce Department, and provided information on where the equipment was in place in the US, a former senior US law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAfter the Biden administration took office in 2021, the Commerce Department then opened its own probe into Huawei to determine if more urgent action was needed to expunge the Chinese technology provider from US telecom networks, the former law enforcement official and a current senior US official said.\n\nThat probe has proceeded slowly and is ongoing, the current US official said. Among the concerns that national security officials noted was that external communication from the Huawei equipment that occurs when software is updated, for example, could be exploited by the Chinese government.\n\nDepending on what the Commerce Department finds, US telecom carriers could be forced to quickly remove Huawei equipment or face fines or other penalties.\n\nReuters first reported the existence of the Commerce Department probe.\n\n“We cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations, but we are committed to securing our information and communications technology and services supply chain. Protecting US persons safety and security against malign information collection is vital to protecting our economy and national security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside Huawei's connection to rural America 02:55 • Source: CNN Inside Huawei's connection to rural America 02:55\n\nUS counterintelligence officials have recently made a priority of publicizing threats from China. This month, the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to American businesses and local and state governments about what it says are disguised efforts by China to manipulate them to influence US policy.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray just traveled to London for a joint meeting with top British law enforcement officials to call attention to the Chinese threats.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Wray said the FBI opens a new China counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours. “That’s probably about 2,000 or so investigations,” said Wray. “And that’s not even talking about their cyber theft, where they have a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined, and have stolen more of Americans’ personal and corporate data than every nation combined.”\n\nAsked why after years of national security concerns raised over Huawei, the equipment is still largely in place atop cell towers near US military bases, Wray said that, “We’re concerned about allowing any company that is beholden to a nation state that doesn’t adhere to and share our values, giving that company the ability to burrow into our telecommunications infrastructure.”\n\nHe noted that in 2020, the DOJ indicted Huawei with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\n“And I think that’s probably about all I can say on the topic,” said Wray.\n\nCritics see xenophobic overreach\n\nDespite its tough talk, the US government’s refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei tech poses a risk to US national security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. The lack of a smoking gun also raises questions of whether US officials can separate legitimate Chinese investment from espionage.\n\n“All of our products imported to the US have been tested and certified by the FCC before being deployed there,” Huawei said in its statement to CNN. “Our equipment only operates on the spectrum allocated by the FCC for commercial use. This means it cannot access any spectrum allocated to the DOD.”\n\n“For more than 30 years, Huawei has maintained a proven track record in cyber security and we have never been involved in any malicious cyber security incidents,” the statement said.\n\nIn its zeal to sniff out evidence of Chinese spying, critics argue the feds have cast too wide a net — in particular as it relates to academic institutions. In one recent high-profile case, a federal judge acquitted a former University of Tennessee engineering professor whom the Justice Department had prosecuted under its so-called China Initiative that targets Chinese spying, arguing “there was no evidence presented that [the professor] ever collaborated with a Chinese university in conducting NASA-funded research.”\n\nAnd on Jan. 20, the Justice Department dropped a separate case against an MIT professor accused of hiding his ties to China, saying it could no longer prove its case. In February, the Biden administration shut down the China Initiative entirely.\n\nThe federal government’s reticence across multiple administrations to detail what it knows has led some critics to accuse the government of chasing ghosts.\n\n“It really comes down to: do you treat China as a neutral actor — because if you treat China as a neutral actor, then yeah, this seems crazy, that there’s some plot behind every tree,” said Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “However, China has shown us through its policies and actions it is not a neutral actor.”\n\nChinese tech in the American heartland\n\nAs early as the Obama administration, FBI agents were monitoring a disturbing pattern along stretches of Interstate 25 in Colorado and Montana, and on arteries into Nebraska. The heavily trafficked corridor connects some of the most secretive military installations in the US, including an archipelago of nuclear missile silos.\n\nFor years, small, rural telecom providers had been installing cheaper, Chinese-made routers and other technology atop cell towers up and down I-25 and elsewhere in the region. Across much of these sparsely populated swaths of the west, these smaller carriers are the only option for cell coverage. And many of them turned to Huawei for cheaper, reliable equipment.\n\nBeginning in late 2011, Viaero, the largest regional provider in the area, inked a contract with Huawei to provide the equipment for its upgrade to 3G. A decade later, it has Huawei tech installed across its entire fleet of towers, roughly 1,000 spread over five western states.\n\nAs Huawei equipment began to proliferate near US military bases, federal investigators started taking notice, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Of particular concern was that Huawei was routinely selling cheap equipment to rural providers in cases that appeared to be unprofitable for Huawei — but which placed its equipment near military assets.\n\nFederal investigators initially began “examining [Huawei] less from a technical lens and more from a business/financial view,” explained John Lenkart, a former senior FBI agent focused on counterintelligence issues related to China. Officials studied where Huawei sales efforts were most concentrated and looked for deals that “made no sense from a return-on-investment perspective,” Lenkart said.\n\n“A lot of [counterintelligence] concerns were uncovered based on” those searches, Lenkart said.\n\nBy examining the Huawei equipment themselves, FBI investigators determined it could recognize and disrupt DOD-spectrum communications — even though it had been certified by the FCC, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\n“It’s not technically hard to make a device that complies with the FCC that listens to nonpublic bands but then is quietly waiting for some activation trigger to listen to other bands,” said Eduardo Rojas, who leads the radio spectrum lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. “Technically, it’s feasible.”\n\nTo prove a device had clandestine capabilities, Rojas said, would require technical experts to strip down a device “to the semi-conductor level” and “reverse engineer the design.” But, he said, it can be done.\n\nAnd there was another big concern along I-25, sources familiar with the investigation said.\n\nWeather camera worries\n\nAround 2014, Viaero started mounting high-definition surveillance cameras on its towers to live-stream weather and traffic, a public service it shared with local news organizations. With dozens of cameras posted up and down I-25, the cameras provided a 24-7 bird’s eye view of traffic and incoming weather, even providing advance warning of tornadoes.\n\nBut they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of US military equipment and personnel, giving Beijing — or anyone for that matter — the ability to track the pattern of activity between a series of closely guarded military facilities.\n\nThe intelligence community determined the publicly posted live-streams were being viewed and likely captured from China, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Two sources briefed on the investigation at the time said officials believed that it was possible for Beijing’s intelligence service to “task” the cameras — hack into the network and control where they pointed. At least some of the cameras in question were running on Huawei networks.\n\nViaero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him the cameras could be a national security risk.\n\n“There’s a lot of missile silos in areas we cover. There is some military presence,” DiRico said in an interview from his Colorado office. But, he said, “I was never told to remove the equipment or to make any changes.”\n\nIn fact, DiRico first learned of government concerns about Huawei equipment from newspaper articles — not the FBI — and says he has never been briefed on the matter.\n\nDiRico doesn’t question the government’s insistence that he needs to remove Huawei equipment, but he is skeptical that China’s intelligence services can exploit either the Huawei hardware itself or the camera equipment.\n\n“We monitor our network pretty good,” DiRico said, adding that Viaero took over the support and maintenance for its own networks from Huawei shortly after installation. “We feel we’ve got a pretty good idea if there’s anything going on that’s inappropriate.”\n\nScouring the country for Chinese investments\n\nBy the time the I-25 investigation was briefed to the White House in 2019, counterintelligence officials begin looking for other places Chinese companies might be buying land or offering to develop a piece of municipal property, like a park or an old factory, sometimes as part of a “sister city” arrangement.\n\nIn one instance, officials shut down what they believed was a risky commercial deal near highly sensitive military testing installations in Utah sometime after the beginning of the I-25 investigation, according to one former US official. The military has a test and training range for hypersonic weapons in Utah, among other things. Sources declined to provide more details.\n\nFederal officials were also alarmed by what sources described as a host of espionage and influence activities in Houston and, in 2020, shut down the Chinese consulate there.\n\nUS Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard P. Donoghue announcing indictments against China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, several of its subsidiaries and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on January 28, 2019. Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nBill Evanina, who until early last year ran the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told CNN that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate between a legitimate business opportunity and espionage — in part because both might be happening at the same time.\n\n“What we’ve seen is legitimate companies that are three times removed from Beijing buy [a given] facility for obvious logical reasons, unaware of what the [Chinese] intelligence apparatus wants in that parcel [of land],” Evanina said. “What we’ve seen recently — it’s been what’s underneath the land.”\n\n“The hard part is, that’s legitimate business, and what city or town is not going to want to take that money for that land when it’s just sitting there doing nothing?” he added.\n\nA complicated problem\n\nAfter the results of the I-25 investigation were briefed to the Trump White House in 2019, the FCC ordered that telecom companies who receive federal subsidies to provide cell service to remote areas — companies like Viaero — must “rip and replace” their Huawei and ZTE equipment.\n\nThe FCC has since said that the cost could be more than double the $1.9 billion appropriated in 2020 and absent an additional appropriation from Congress, the agency is only planning to reimburse companies for a fraction of their costs.\n\nGiven the staggering strategic risk, Lenkart said, “rip and replace is a very blunt and inefficient remediation.”\n\nDiRico, the CEO of Viaero, said the cost of “rip and replace” is astronomical and that he doesn’t expect the reimbursement money to be enough to pay for the change. According to the FCC, Viaero is expected to receive less than half of the funding it is actually due. Still, he expects to start removing the equipment within the next year.\n\n“It’s difficult and it’s a lot of money,” DiRico said.\n\nSome former counterintelligence officials expressed frustration that the US government isn’t providing more granular detail about what it knows to companies — or to cities and states considering a Chinese investment proposal. They believe that not only would that kind of detail help private industry and state and local governments understand the seriousness of the threat as they see it, but also help combat the criticism that the US government is targeting Chinese companies and people, rather than Chinese state-run espionage.\n\n“This government has to do a better job of letting everyone know this is a Communist Party issue, it’s not a Chinese people issue,” Evanina said. “And I’ll be the first to say that the government has to do better with respect to understanding the Communist Party’s intentions are not the same intentions of the Chinese people.”\n\nA current FBI official said the bureau is giving more defensive briefings to US businesses, academic institutions and state and local governments that include far more detail than in the past, but officials are still fighting an uphill battle.\n\n“Sometimes I feel like we’re a lifeguard going out to a drowning person, and they don’t want our help,” said the current FBI official. But, this person said, “I think sometimes we [the FBI] say ‘China threat,’ and we take for granted what all that means in our head. And it means something else to the people that we’re delivering it to.”\n\n“I think we just need to be more careful about how we speak about it and educate folks on why we’re doing what we’re doing.”\n\nIn the meantime, the “rip and replace” program has remained fiercely controversial.\n\n“It’s not going to be easy,” DiRico said. “I’m going to be up nights worrying about it, but we’ll do what we’re told to do.”\n\nThis story has been updated to reference Wall Street Journal reporting.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/30/trump-100-days-executive-orders-tests-presidential-power/83262621007/", "title": "How Trump's litany of executive orders test 250 years of American ...", "text": "Trump appears to be 'testing the bounds of the law,' according to one legal expert.\n\nThe immigration disputes on issues that haven't been challenged for more than 100 years could make the eventual court rulings the 'most important era of immigration law' in history, an expert said.\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's first 100 days have led to a record number of legal fights that are headed to the U.S. Supreme Court and where the justices will be asked to address questions that define the 250-year old relationship between the three branches of federal government.\n\nThese are battles of Trump's own making: The second term president has been signing executive orders at a record pace, with 139 through April 24, that each test the boundaries of presidential power in areas such as government spending and immigration enforcement. More than 200 federal lawsuits have challenged Trump's new policies, with multiple judges temporarily blocking his priorities.\n\nTrump has already filed 11 emergency requests with the Supreme Court − more than during the combined 16 years of the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Legal experts say those cases' eventual resolutions could bring profound changes to the relationships between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government and on Trump's chances of success in advancing his agenda.\n\n“It certainly appears like this administration is testing the bounds of the law and trying to see how much they can get away with not following the requirements that Congress and the Constitution have established for the way the executive does their work,” Tobias Wolff, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told USA TODAY. “That is a very alarming fact.”\n\nImmigration cases 'most important' in history of country: expert\n\nThe immigration issues are momentous because some of the disputed questions have long been seen as settled.\n\nConsider the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows for swifter removal of noncitizens and was never really tested in court outside a wartime context, according to Daniel Kanstroom, a law professor at Boston College who is director of the International Human Rights Program.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 1898 also upheld birthright citizenship, which Trump ordered changed during an Oval Office ceremony hours after his inauguration. Whether U.S. law can reach into an El Salvador prison is a fundamental question about the separation of powers between the president and courts.\n\n“I think this is possibly the most important era of immigration law litigation that we’ve seen since the beginning of the country,” Kanstroom told USA TODAY. “I don’t think you can overstate the importance of all of the cases taken as a group that are before the court.”\n\nImmigration cases among first to reach Supreme Court\n\nOne of the first executive orders Trump signed after returning to the White House aimed to end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants without authorization to be in the country. The legal dispute over the order will be the first to get a full-blown hearing at the Supreme Court on May 15 − weeks after the term's end of regularly scheduled hearings.\n\nThe 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868, says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” But Trump contends it was only meant to cover former slaves and not the modern influx of immigrants.\n\nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour in Seattle called Trump's order \"blatantly unconstitutional,” one of at least four judges who blocked the policy.\n\nUrgent appeals reach Supreme Court quickly\n\nThe cases are hurtling through the courts so quickly some justices complain there is no time to collect evidence.\n\nTrump had invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act for the first time outside of a war against another country to hasten the deportation of members of the gangs Tren de Aragua and MS-13. But after hundreds of alleged gang members were sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador on March 15, Venezuelan migrants fought in court for hearings to deny belonging to the gangs.\n\nThe Supreme Court on April 19 temporarily blocked the removal of Venezuelans accused of being gang members of Tren de Aragua. The high court said in an unsigned opinion that detainees were “entitled to ‘judicial review’ as to ‘questions of interpretation of constitutionality’ of the statute.\n\nJustices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas opposed the order as \"unprecedented and legally questionable\" before lower courts had weighed evidence in the case.\n\nTrump said even the Supreme Court, with a 6-3 majority appointed by Republicans, stymied him. \"The Courts are intimidated by the Radical Left who are, 'playing the Ref,'\" Trump wrote on social media on April 21.\n\nCongress sets spending priorities but Trump treats them as ceilings\n\nBesides toughening immigration enforcement, two other broad areas of legal dispute focus on cutting the size of government by firing federal workers and dismantling agencies, as well as banning diversity initiatives.\n\nFederal unions, workers and advocacy groups have fought Trump’s moves to dismantle agencies and lay off tens of thousands of federal workers, under recommendations from billionaire adviser Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe Constitution designates Congress as holding the authority over spending by saying: \"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by law.” But Trump and his aides contend the president can spend less than lawmakers appropriate.\n\nFirings played out in fits and starts. For example, Trump tried to fire tens of thousands of probationary workers but a court ordered them rehired and an appeals court refused to halt that decision.\n\n\"It is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie,\" wrote U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco, who ruled the agencies had to fire the workers rather than the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nThe Supreme Court on April 8 paused Alsup’s order to reinstate more than 16,000 workers fired by six agencies while the litigation continues. Alsup halted layoffs again April 18 and the administration asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on April 23 to overturn his injunction.\n\nThe day after the Supreme Court’s order in the Alsup case, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals paused a similar order from U.S. District Judge James Bredar in Maryland to reinstate probationary workers at 20 agencies in 19 states. It’s not clear when either case could reach the high court for full arguments.\n\nTrump asks Supreme Court to allow military ban of transgender troops\n\nTwo judges have blocked a Defense Department policy to ban transgender servicemembers and the issue is another that has already reached the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth contend transgender troops hurt readiness and lethality of the military. But lawyers for decorated servicemembers argued there was no evidence transgender troops hurt the military during four years of serving openly during the Biden administration.\n\nAfter U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle in San Francisco and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals paused the ban, Solicitor General John Sauer asked the Supreme Court on April 24 to allow the Defense Department to enforce its prohibition. Sauer contends the judge improperly second-guessed the Pentagon’s policy, which he argued deserves “substantial deference” from the courts.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has a decision pending in a similar case.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan asked the transgender troops to reply by May 1 in the West Coast case. But that decision would likely focus on whether the ban is paused while the case is argued, so it’s not clear how soon the high court could hear full arguments.\n\nTrump opposes individual hearings for immigrants in changes of broad policies\n\nOther lawsuits have also sought to stop the Department of Homeland Security from ending overlapping programs that provide hundreds of thousands of immigrants temporary protection from deportation because of unsafe conditions in their home countries.\n\nOne program called Temporary Protected Status has covered Venezuelans. Another program covered migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela (CHNV).\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani temporarily extended the CHNV program by ruling each participant deserved a hearing on whether their permission to work and live in the U.S. would be terminated.\n\nThe government said April 18 it would appeal to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nTrump, who argued that he won the 2024 election on a policy of common sense, complained it would take 100 years for courts to hear the cases of 530,000 immigrants in the CHNV case.\n\n“What is going on with our Courts? They are totally OUT OF CONTROL,” Trump wrote on social media on April 16. “They seem to hate ‘TRUMP’ so much, that anything goes!”\n\nTrump accuses judges of partisanship, failing to heed election results\n\nTrump has railed against judges ruling against his policies, which stokes concerns among Democrats and some legal experts that he could eventually defy court orders in a move that leads to a constitutional crisis.\n\nThe president has called for the impeachment of judges who rule against him, which led to a rare rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump was particularly irate about multiple cases where a judge in one of the country's 94 federal judicial districts temporarily blocked policies nationwide while the cases are litigated.\n\n\"These people are Lunatics, who do not care, even a little bit, about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect Decisions and Rulings,\" Trump wrote on social media on March 20, after winning the 2024 election with 77 million votes. \"These Judges want to assume the Powers of the Presidency, without having to attain 80 Million Votes.\"\n\nThe House voted April 9 to prohibit individual judges from issuing nationwide injunctions. But it is unclear whether the Senate will approve the bill.\n\n“We are obviously complying with the court’s order,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters April 22 after the Supreme Court paused the deportation of alleged gang members.\n\n\"We’re confident the Supreme Court will rule on the side of law and recognize the president absolutely has the executive authority to deport foreign terrorists from our nation’s interior under the Alien Enemies Act,\" Leavitt added. \"We’re confident the courts will side with the president’s executive authority.\"\n\nFBI charges state judge with allegedly helping immigrant avoid ICE\n\nTrump’s clash with judges escalated April 18 with the FBI's arrest in Wisconsin of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan and continued to test the limits of executive power.\n\nShe was charged with interference for allegedly misdirecting Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, who were trying to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican citizen previously removed from the U.S.\n\n\"What happened was terrible. That that could happen with a judge is so ashamed,” Trump told reporters April 27. “We can't let these people stay, and the courts are allowing them to stay. We're just not going to allow it so, hopefully, the Supreme Court will come to the rescue of our country.\"\n\nSen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, criticized immigration officials for interfering with the criminal justice system.\n\n“The Trump Administration continues to test the limits of our Constitution – this time by arresting a sitting judge for allegedly obstructing an immigration operation at the courthouse,” Durbin said in a statement.\n\nWhat happens if Trump disobeys courts?\n\nTwo federal judges are investigating whether the Trump administration has defied their orders, another path to a constitutional crisis if the judges order an independent prosecutor to pursue criminal contempt charges. But legal experts said a criminal contempt finding would be a serious step to be avoided.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, who was first to pause deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, ruled April 16 the government demonstrated a “willful disregard” for his order for not turning around the flights or ordering their return from El Salvador. “None of their responses has been satisfactory,” he wrote.\n\nA divided D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals paused his inquiry on April 18 and called for written arguments about whether to stop the inquiry.\n\nJosh Blackman, a law professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston, called it a \"line that maybe shouldn't be crossed.\" Blackman said the Supreme Court could intervene is Boasberg finds contempt.\n\nAnother option would be that Trump could pardon anyone charged with contempt.\n\n\"One hopes that we don't have to get to that brink in this case,\" Kanstroom said.\n\nIn another case, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland has demanded updates about returning Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador after what administration officials acknowledged was his mistaken removal. The Supreme Court backed her up ambiguously, saying the government should “facilitate” his return.\n\nBut Bondi said during an Oval Office meeting April 14 it was up to El Salvador to return Garcia. Xinis postponed a demand for the government to share evidence in the case until April 30.\n\n“I hope we don’t find ourselves in that situation,” Wolff, the law professor, said of potential contempt proceedings. “Certainly, I think the popular response to this administration saying ‘we can operate outside the boundaries of the courts’ would not be a favorable one.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/10/08/fatal-limo-crash-kills-20-people-upstate-new-york/1563293002/", "title": "Here's the latest: Fatal limo crash kills 20 people in upstate NY", "text": "ALBANY - State Police and federal authorities were continuing their investigation Monday into a limousine crash 35 miles outside Albany that killed 20 people Saturday afternoon, the worst transportation accident in the U.S in nine years.\n\nThe limousine had failed inspection last month and the driver didn't have the appropriate license to operate the vehicle, Gov. Andrew Cuomo revealed Monday.\n\nCuomo said the 2001 Ford Excursion limousine was owned by Prestige Limousine in the Albany area, but didn't have the necessary federal certification to operate and failed a state inspection just last month.\n\n\"The driver of the vehicle – the quote-unquote limousine – did not have the appropriate driver’s license to be operating that vehicle,\" Cuomo told reporters in Manhattan.\n\n\"Second, that vehicle was inspected by the New York state Department of Transportation last month and failed inspection.\"\n\nHere's the latest on the crash:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nState Police First Superintendent Christopher Fiore told reporters Sunday the limousine failed to stop at the intersection at about 1:55 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe limousine then slammed into a parked, unoccupied 2015 Toyota Highlander.\n\nWitnesses said the limousine crashed into an embankment behind the parking lot of the Apple Barrel Country Store.\n\nThe crash \"sounded like an explosion,\" Linda Riley, of nearby Schenectady, described to The Associated Press.\n\nThe store manager, Jessica Kirby, told The New York Times the limousine was coming down a hill at \"probably over 60 mph.\"\n\nPolice said the speed limit was 50 mph.\n\nThe T-shaped intersection has long been a trouble spot, and Kirby told the The Associated Press that repeatedly tractor trailers were unable to stop at the intersection and crashed near the store.\n\nThe store was organizing a vigil for the victims Wednesday, and a vigil was planned Monday night in Amsterdam, a blue-collar manufacturing town along the Mohawk River where most of the victims were from.\n\n\"It’s a very small city and there are generations of families who know each other,\" said Assemblyman Angelo Santabarbara, D-Rotterdam, Schenectady County.\n\n\"Almost everybody I’ve talked to had a personal connection to someone in the accident.\"\n\nAbout the deceased\n\nPolice didn't release the list of the deceased Sunday, but family members described their loved ones who died.\n\nThe 17 young adults in the limousine were headed to Cooperstown to celebrate the 30th birthday of Amy Steenburg, according to reports.\n\nShe was killed along with her husband Axel; Axel's brother Rich; Amy's three sisters and one of her brothers-in-law, Erin's uncle Anthony Vertucci told the Times Union in Albany.\n\nTwo of the couples were newlyweds, the paper said.\n\n\"They were wonderful girls,\" the sisters' aunt, Barbara Douglas, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"They'd do anything for you and they were very close to each other and they loved their family.\"\n\nDouglas said three of the sisters were with their husbands.\n\n\"They did the responsible thing getting a limo so they wouldn't have to drive anywhere,\" she said, telling the paper that several of the couples had young children.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nPolice said they would reconstruct the accident scene and conduct autopsies to help their investigation. They declined to provide any details about what may have caused the crash.\n\nIt was the most deadly transportation accident in the country since February 2009, said National Transportation Safety Board chairman Robert Sumwalt.\n\n\"Twenty fatalities is just horrific,\" he said.\n\nHe added the investigation is focused to find \"not only what happened, but why it happened so we can keep things like this from happening in the future.\"\n\nSumwalt said it was the most deadly U.S. transportation accident since the Colgan Air Flight 3407 plane crash on Feb. 12, 2009, near Buffalo that killed 50 people.\n\nThe accident also raises new questions about limousine safety.\n\nThree years ago, four women were killed in a limousine on Long Island as they toured wineries when the vehicle was hit by a truck.\n\nA driver and the front-seat passenger are required to wear seat belts inside stretch limousines, but not the back-seat passengers, police said Sunday.\n\nAfter the Long Island crash, Sen. Chuck Schumer said he urged the NTSB to better investigate limousine accidents in the country, saying Sunday, \"because we desperately need more data to prevent them and minimize their toll.\"\n\nSchumer added, \"I commend the NTSB’s immediate aid on scene and am very confident that we will have concrete answers soon.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/24/trumps-mar-lago-storage-violated-national-archives-records-rules/7833216001/", "title": "Trump's Mar-a-Lago storage violated National Archive's records rules", "text": "WASHINGTON – By the end of George W.

West Virginia is taking soda out of food stamp programs and outlawing chemical dyes. Utah is removing fluoride from water. Arizona has banned ultra-processed food in public school cafeterias.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Make America Healthy Again movement, which focuses on ending what President Donald Trump's health secretary calls the “chronic disease epidemic,” is finding success in state capitals as lawmakers and governors take up or oppose health-related measures ranging from vaccine \"advisories\" to food safety.\n\nBut Kennedy's supporters aren't following a simple partisan formula. They are opposing a Republican-backed bill in Tennessee that would limit the liability of pesticide companies, for example, while backing California Democrats on measures involving improved food quality for incarcerated people and limiting use of glyphosate, a herbicide linked to cancer.\n\nAt the federal level, Kennedy in his opening months on the job announced a plan to phase out artificial dyes from the U.S. food supply and directed his department to conduct studies aimed at identifying \"environmental toxins\" behind the rising rates of autism. His critics have hammered him over his views on vaccines and for making major staffing cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nOutside of Washington, D.C., Kennedy's followers appear to be scrambling the country's stubborn red-blue divide.\n\nShifting from kind of 'woo-woo' to 'kind of trendy'\n\n“It’s considered less 'woo-woo' now,” said Emily Stembridge, a 39-year-old mother of three from Lehi, Utah, who recruited like-minded moms to lobby her Republican-dominated state to ban artificial food dyes from school lunches. “Now it's kind of trendy, and so, it was the time to strike.”\n\nStembridge, a Republican who grew up in a health-conscious family, says she was intrigued by Kennedy’s 2024 presidential run, which ended last August when he dropped out and endorsed Trump before landing a job in the new president's Cabinet. The way Kennedy talked about health during that White House campaign, with an emphasis on “moms and families,” spoke to her.\n\n“I’d never seen anyone in his position putting these issues in the forefront,” she said. “These are things a lot of us were recognizing in our day-to-day that no one else seemed to want to pay attention to.”\n\nStembridge, who calls herself a MAHA Mom, contacted Utah state Rep. Kristen Chevrier and urged the Republican to introduce a bill banning artificial dyes in public schools. The freshman lawmaker did not need much convincing. As a mother of three children with autoimmune issues, Chevrier said she is forced to shop at specialty stores or make everything from scratch.\n\n“The whole mindset of our nation has shifted,” Chevrier said of her legislation, which Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed into law in March.\n\n'Dynamic change, state by state'\n\nKennedy's momentum at the state level has not surprised Del Bigtree, CEO of the MAHA Alliance Super PAC and of MAHA Action, a nonprofit which tracks legislation throughout the country.\n\n“What you're seeing is what government does when the people are watching,” he said. “And now you are gonna see dynamic change, state by state, I believe, because Robert Kennedy Jr. is championing these issues.”\n\nThe other reason politicians are paying attention, Bigtree says, is they see MAHA Moms as a “powerful voting block.”“Moms are the most vocal voting block,” he said.\n\nKennedy this spring toured states that had passed MAHA-aligned bills and executive orders including West Virginia, Utah and Arizona. He visited Indianapolis for the launch of Gov. Mike Braun’s “Make Indiana Healthy Again Initiative,\" where the Republican signed nine executive orders that called for the examination of the health impacts of artificial dyes and additives and increasing residents’ access to local foods.\n\nAt the Indiana meeting, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV doctor whom Trump appointed to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was also present with Kennedy to put a MAHA stamp of approval on the governor's efforts.\n\nDuring last year's presidential campaign Trump described Kennedy as a longtime friend and called his endorsement a great honor.\n\n“I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines,” Trump said, at a rally at New York's Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27, less than 10 days before he won the presidential election.\n\nNew laws in five states\n\nOthers have followed Trump and Kennedy's lead. Governors in at least five states have signed MAHA-aligned laws and more than 30 more bills have been introduced around the country.\n\nIn March, West Virginia became the first state to enact a sweeping ban on artificial food dyes and Utah led the nation in banning supplemental fluoride in the water supply. Florida lawmakers followed suit in a bill that passed last week that is now awaiting a signature from Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. In April, Arizona banned ultra-processed foods in public school meals and purchases of soda using food stamps. The same month, Idaho banned soda and candy purchases using food stamps.\n\n\"Idaho welcomes the MAHA movement,\" said Republican Gov. Brad Little, adding that Kennedy had called it an act of patriotism. \"Idaho couldn’t agree more.\"\n\nWhite House Spokesman Kush Desai said the states' embrace of the MAHA agenda proved that \"everyday Americans support President Trump’s commonsense initiative.”\n\nWhile at least 11 Republican-controlled states are taking the lead on introducing MAHA-aligned bills, the advocacy group \"MAHA Action\" is also supporting Democrat-led bills in blue states. For instance, the group is backing California's Farm to School Program to improve student nutrition and a proposed bill in New Jersey banning the sale and application of the insecticide chlorpyrifos. People close to Kennedy, many of whom are former Democrats, say they see party lines blurring when it comes to health.\n\nCalifornia, led by two-term Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, was the first state to ban some artificial dyes last year. The state's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment found a potential link between these dyes and hyperactivity.\n\nMAHA: An 'awakening for the Republicans'?\n\nWill Cole, a functional medicine practitioner, has known Kennedy for almost a decade. A former Democrat who is now an independent, Cole said there’s a “realignment playing out in real time.”\n\n“I feel like it's an awakening for the Republicans,” he said, adding that the GOP has been “abysmal” when it comes to these topics.\n\nBefore the MAHA fever took hold, he would have been described as a \"crunchy leftist\" in certain Republican circles, said Cole, whom the actress and wellness mogul Gwyneth Paltrow credits with helping her on her health journey.\n\nBigtree, who grew up in Boulder, Colorado, favoring outdoor sports, natural food stores and a “very liberal” mindset, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"The entire idea of natural health and natural living and getting chemicals out of food used to be completely a liberal perspective,\" he said. \"And now, suddenly in one of the most amazing shifts we've ever seen, we're seeing dyes being removed by a Republican administration.\"\n\nBoth Bigtree and Cole talked about how after years of chasm, health care policy might finally be the unifying element between the two parties.\n\nDemocrats tried for decades to pass comprehensive healthcare legislation before finally succeeding without any GOP support in 2010 under President Barack Obama. That effort cost Obama's party control of the U.S. House of Representatives, while Republicans failed in their own bids to repeal the law. Kennedy's supporters say one crucial way in which their work differs is in its intense focus on prevention and understanding the root causes of chronic diseases along with making healthcare more affordable.\n\nThe policy team at MAHA Action is primarily focused on health-oriented bills at the state level because that's where most U.S. health policy is made, said Bigtree.\n\nHe said the \"incredible success\" of the MAHA movement at the state level is applying \"immense pressure\" on the U.S. Congress to follow suit. The organization is currently working with members of both parties in Congress to co-sponsor future bills, Bigtree said while declining to identify what legislation or which Democrats the organization was working with.\n\n\"Too soon,\" he said.\n\nCalley Means, an entrepreneur who serves as an advisor to Kennedy as a \"special government employee\" said MAHA is about transparency. Kennedy has accused Big Pharma and Big Food of keeping Americans sick for profit.\n\n\"It's about making sure the incentives of our health care and food systems are prioritized to American health,\" he said, adding that Kennedy would use \"his levers of power to spur transparency with the American people.\"\n\nCole said he believes the most important thing holding together the diverse coalition of people within the MAHA movement is \"freedom of speech and diversity of thought\" around health and medicine.\n\nKennedy’s Instagram account was taken down by its parent company Facebook in 2021, for sharing “debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.” Cole said the way speech around health was handled online by major technology companies became a “bonding cause” among classic liberals, moderates, libertarians and conservatives.\n\n“We are not gonna agree on everything. Many of us are gonna be socially liberal people,” he said. “So it'd be interesting to see how we can continue to work together.”\n\nCritics worry about RFK Jr. and MAHA movement's sway on public health\n\nPaul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said he agrees with Kennedy's encouragement of bans on soda and candy from the food stamp program. But he said Kennedy's views on most other things are \"dangerous\" to children.\n\n\"He's an anti-vaccine activist. He's a science denialist, which is why I don't trust him with the science of food either because he's so willing to deny the science of vaccines,\" Offit said. \"Why is he suddenly going to be much more reasonable about science regarding anything else?\"\n\nTaking fluoride out of the drinking water, which Kennedy has encouraged states to do, will only increase cavities in that state, Offit said.\n\nTennessee state Rep. Dr. Brock Martin, a Republican, said seeing Kennedy assume the position of health secretary was one of the coolest things he’d seen in the new Trump administration. Back in his home state, Martin said one of his priorities will be to propose a bill that would help increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables in areas considered to be food deserts.\n\n“As a legislator, that's exciting because I know it's gonna drive cost down on health care,” he said.\n\nAt the same time, MAHA Action is opposing a GOP bill in Tennessee that would limit the liability of pesticide companies if they were not labeled as harmful by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “That is a tricky one for me because I'm in farmland where all my farmers who put food on the table are reliant upon that product,” Martin said. “I was kind of torn on that one. I didn't know honestly where I was gonna vote on it once it got there.”\n\nThe bill, which passed the state Senate, was held up in the House and has been tabled for now, he said.\n\nStembridge, the mother who pushed for the ban on artificial food dyes in Utah, met Kennedy when he visited her state to celebrate the passage of the bill.\n\n\"It was exciting because he's actually addressing the giant elephant in the room of humanity,\" she said. \"Like, America is sick and someone's finally pointing that out, and then saying, 'And what are we gonna do about it?'\"\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House Correspondent for USA TODAY.

It's Republican overreach | Opinion", "text": "It seems clear, based on my years of listening to conservatives holler about liberty, that Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a nanny-state liberal who wants to tell Americans what they can and can’t eat.\n\nIn a recent statement, Kennedy said: “I urge every governor to champion legislation that bans ultra-processed foods and dyes in public schools, and submit a waiver to the USDA to remove soda from SNAP.”\n\nDo you want government officials to control the ultra-processed and dye-delicious foods I want my kids to eat? Sounds like the “K” in “RFK Jr.” stands for “Karl Marx.”\n\nRFK Jr. goes full nanny state on America's school-lunch programs\n\nA recent Kennedy opinion column published right here at USA TODAY, co-written with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, discussed childhood obesity and concluded this: “As the leaders put in charge of overseeing our nation’s food supply and human services, we have a duty to fix this.”\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nTo make sure I was responding properly to what I assume is communism, I looked back on how my conservative friends responded to health and food-safety initiatives that came up while Barack Obama was president.\n\nI'm sure conservatives are mad at RFK Jr. like they were at Michelle Obama\n\nIn 2010, as part of first lady Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” campaign, President Obama established a childhood obesity task force, prompting Fox News host Sean Hannity to say: “We now, in our government, have a government obesity task force, all right? An Obama government obesity task force. Does every American family need a dietician appointed by the government to tell them that this food is going to make you fat and this food is not?”\n\nThe task force issued voluntary recommendations, but Fox News went with “the first lady's task force is cutting into our diets and our rights.”\n\nSuggesting our kids eat healthier is the same as communism\n\nThey should get a load of the left-wing-extremist rhetoric Kennedy and Rollins put forth in their April 8 column, sounding just like government officials who want to control what we feed our kids:\n\n“First, we are advancing buy American policies that will get food grown by American farmers into the hands of children and families through our nutritious food programs. ...\n\n\"Second, our two agencies are pursuing reform to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). We will encourage taxpayer dollars to go toward wholesome foods, such as whole milk, fruits, vegetables and meats.”\n\nSo I guess I, a taxpaying American parent, no longer have a say in what my kid eats.\n\nMaybe I don’t want my taxpayer dollars going toward fruits and vegetables. Maybe my deeply held personal belief is that Oreos and artificial cheese products are the best thing for my child’s bone development.\n\n'Get your damn hands off my fries, lady'\n\nIt reminds me of Michelle Obama’s speech to the National Restaurant Association in September 2010, when she said: “I'm not asking any of you to make drastic changes to every single one of your recipes or to totally change the way you do business. But what I am asking is that you consider reformulating your menu in pragmatic and incremental ways to create healthier versions of the foods that we all love.”\n\nThe then-first lady added, monstrously, “It could mean serving 1% or skim milk. Or you could make healthy sides like apple slices or carrots the default choice in a menu and make fries something customers have to request.”\n\nTo that, then-Fox News host Glenn Beck said: “When I heard this, I thought, get your damn hands off my fries, lady. If I want to be a fat, fat, fatty and shovel french fries all day long, that is my choice. But, oh, no, not so fast anymore, because now, we have the new fact, whether you like it or not, we have government health care now.”\n\nOne would think such a reasoned response that was apparently appropriate then would be equally appropriate now that Kennedy and Co. are the Big Government Food Police.\n\nIs RFK Jr. trying to starve Americans? Probably.\n\nFormer Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin at the time called the Obamas’ healthy eating initiatives the “nanny state run amok.”\n\nBeck alleged a food-safety bill was an attempt to turn everyone vegetarian: “This is about control, and in the end starvation.”\n\nOh my God. Kennedy is trying to starve us. Or maybe just our children.\n\nI’m not quite sure.\n\nBut I do know everything Kennedy is trying to do with his insidious Make America Healthy Again program is the worst form of government control over our lives imaginable.\n\nNow, Kennedy is going to tread on my right to eat garbage\n\nIf I want to suck down a tube of Red No. 3 dye while my kid totes a sack of Twinkies to school for lunch, that’s my right as an American!\n\nI’m sure my conservative friends who raised hell during the Obama administration will join me in bipartisan fashion to protest this unfolding attack on liberty.\n\nI’ll await their response.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Bluesky at @rexhuppke.bsky.social and on Facebook at facebook.com/RexIsAJerk", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/06/27/rfk-jr-joins-landry-in-louisiana-to-approve-maha-legislation/84390109007/", "title": "RFK Jr. joins Landry in Louisiana to approve 'MAHA' legislation", "text": "Greg LaRose and Piper Hutchinson\n\nLouisiana Illuminator\n\nLouisiana Governor Jeff Landry signed a bill banning certain dyes, artificial sweeteners, and other ingredients from public school meals.\n\nU.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. supported the bill and anticipates other states will follow Louisiana's lead.\n\nProtests occurred outside the research center where the signing took place, with concerns raised about Kennedy's health policies and research funding cuts.\n\nGov. Jeff Landry endorsed legislation Friday to “Make American Healthy Again” with the nation’s controversial top health official at his side for the bill signing ceremony.\n\nU.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended a bill signing ceremony at Pennington Biomedical Research Center after helping craft legislation the Louisiana Legislature approved unanimously to regulate what ingredients can be in the food served in public school lunches.\n\nKennedy said he anticipates other states will follow Louisiana’s lead, resulting in food manufacturers proactively making changes to improve the contents of their products and reduce the amount of ultra-processed food they generate.\n\n“We’re seeing the companies coming to the table … because they don’t want what you’re doing here in Louisiana,” Kennedy told the audience.\n\nThe key bill Landry signed was Senate Bill 14 by Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, which bans several dyes, artificial sweeteners and other ingredients from school meals. In its original state, the proposal also sought to restrict what people could purchase with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, but those provisions were stripped out during the legislative process.\n\n“It’s about transparency for restaurants and food manufacturers to disclose the types of foods they’re serving us and the impacts on our bodies,” McMath said during his introduction of Kennedy and the governor.\n\nLandry announced Friday he would seek a waiver from the Trump administration to prohibit the purchase of some unhealthy foods with SNAP benefits and seek permission to let people buy certain prepared foods, such as rotisserie chicken.\n\nMcMath’s bill is part of a nationwide backlash against “ultra-processed foods,” food dyes, seed oils and certain chemical additives Kennedy has targeted for elimination. Such products are typically high in calories, sugar, salt and unhealthy fats.\n\nKennedy, who worked with McMath on the bill, said most of America’s chronic health issues can be linked to the foods they consume.\n\nAlso signed was Senate Bill 19 by Sen. Mike Fesi, R-Houma, which allows pharmacists to provide ivermectin without a doctor’s prescription. Its proponents say ivermectin can be successfully used to treat a variety of ailments, including COVID-19, though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved its use for intestinal parasites in pill form and to treat head lice and rosacea as a topical cream.\n\nThough Kennedy praised the bills Landry signed into law, he also called for Congress to approve comparable federal measures.\n\n“We need national laws, and we’re going to do it on our own,” Kennedy said.\n\nThe bill signing ceremony took place at a conference center on the Pennington campus, where the audience included supporters and their children wearing green “MAHA Louisiana” hats. They took to the stage to provide a backdrop for Landry and Kennedy.\n\nApproximately a dozen conservative legislators were also in attendance. Earlier this month, the state Legislature approved $2 million for Pennington in the state budget to fill in the gaps of Kennedy’s cuts.\n\nThe LSU Board of Supervisors recessed its bi-monthly meeting so its members could take part in the event.\n\nKennedy previously came to Baton Rouge in 2021 to testify before state lawmakers against a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for K-12 students. It was Landry, who was then the state’s attorney general, who invited him to appear before the legislative committee.\n\nKennedy’s appearance at Pennington Biomedical Research Center comes as the future of some employees at the facility and their work are in question as the Trump administration proposes drastic reductions in health and scientific research.\n\nMost recently, Kennedy has removed the members of a vaccine advisory panel for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and replaced them with vaccine skeptics.\n\nPennington has so far lost $4.1 million in federal research funding from agencies Kennedy oversees, which does not include the tens of millions more they are slated to lose if Kennedy’s proposed slashing of “indirect cost rates” goes into effect.\n\nWhen the Illuminator approached Kennedy after the event to ask about these cuts, a staff member quickly whisked him away, saying “he’s not taking questions.”\n\nDozens of people lined Perkins Road outside the research center to protest Kennedy’s visit.\n\nThe people gathered included Jeanne George of Baton Rouge, whose granddaughters accompanied her and held protest signs by the roadside waiting for Kennedy to arrive.\n\n“I grew up in the 1950s, and I had classmates who had braces because of polio,” George said. “So I’ve seen the benefits of vaccinations from the 1950s on, and I just feel so strongly about the importance of not not rolling us back. We need to continue to have the children being vaccinated. We need to have the flu vaccines. We need to have scientists making decisions about vaccinations and about health.”\n\nGayle Choojitarom, a retired cardiopulmonary health care professional, came to the protest from Watson. She worked the latter stretch of her career in New Orleans and took issue with the governor choosing a research institute for a “Make America Healthy Again” event.\n\n“If legislation is put forth to Make America healthy again, it should be led by science and by facts and not by vibes and opinions,” Choojitarom said.\n\nShe recalled treating someone in the late 1980s who contracted polio and relied on an iron lung, a respiratory device that helps someone breathe when they have trouble doing so on their own. The eradication of polio through vaccines in the U.S. in 1979 all but eliminated the need for such equipment, but Choojitarom said she fears Kennedy’s policy on vaccine approval and research will erase such progress.\n\n“We’re going to see more people die,” she said.” We’re going to see children die.

Kennedy Jr., has a say, the days of his artificially dyed technicolor candy would be numbered.\n\nBut Trump needn't fret. Yet.\n\nMars Wrigley, the manufacturer of M&Ms, Starburst and Skittles, has resisted Kennedy's artificial-food-dye-eschewing Make America Healthy Again agenda. But the company told USA TODAY it’s “exploring” alternatives.\n\nTo the chagrin of food advocates and Kennedy's Department of Health and Human Services, though, it's not making any promises with timelines, as other major food companies have in recent months.\n\nA Mars Wrigley spokesperson told USA TODAY the conglomerate had not yet identified \"fully effective solutions\" and believes it is \"premature to make commitments\" until it is certain they can be fulfilled. The spokesperson said the company expects to be able to offer consumers more artificial-dye-free choices in the \"near future.” An internal study by the company five years ago also found that consumers across the globe – except Europe – did not mind artificial dyes in their candy.\n\nKennedy's boss may be one of them.\n\nDuring a Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day event organized by the White House in May, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told children of reporters that Trump eats a \"good amount\" of candy and said he likes pink Starbursts and Tootsie Rolls.\n\nThe president also has used candy as a tool of diplomacy. He reportedly tossed two Starburst candies at former German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G7 summit in 2018, saying, \"Don't say I never give you anything.\"\n\nBanning artificial dyes from the nation's food supply\n\nKennedy, who has long blamed America’s chronic health problems, including obesity and heart disease, on the food industry, announced in April that eight artificial dyes will be phased out from medications and the nation's food supply by the end of 2026, including dyes found in candy, ice cream, soft drinks and jams.\n\nA study by the California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 linked consumption of synthetic food dyes to hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral problems in some children. Similar studies also led the European Union to restrict food coloring. Last year, California banned six dyes from use in public schools. This year, West Virginia followed suit, and other states, like Virginia and Utah, ban them in public school lunches.\n\nIn case you missed: RFK Jr.'s MAHA movement is coming to a state near you\n\nThough no formal agreement or legislation has been passed to ban the dyes, the HHS and the Food and Drug Administration have a \"mutual understanding\" with the food industry that the colorings will be removed, Kennedy said.\n\nAt the time, a statement from the watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest called the agreement's voluntary nature \"disappointing.\"\n\nKennedy has generally received support across party lines when it comes to blaming the food industry for the nation's chronic health problems, including obesity and heart disease, according to the results of an NBC News Decision Desk Poll in June. At the same time, opponents have hammered him over his controversial views and policy moves regarding vaccines.\n\nSince Kennedy's appointment, several food companies such as Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Nestle, Tyson Foods and Mars rival Hershey’s have committed to removing all artificial food dyes from their food within the next couple of years.\n\nAnother target: Ultra-processed food\n\nGetting ultra-processed food off menus is an uphill battle.\n\nEarlier in July, Kennedy praised an Oklahoma-based company that delivers $7-a-pop meals to Medicaid and Medicare enrollees for offering meals without \"additives.\"\n\nBut an Associated Press review of Mom’s Meals menu, including the ingredients and nutrition labels, showed the company’s offerings are \"the type of heat-and-eat, ultra-processed foods that Kennedy routinely criticizes for making people sick,\" the newswire reported.\n\nAnd it's not just a battle with companies that Kennedy has to wage; it's also consumer behavior. Just ask his boss.\n\nTrump's love for Big Macs is well-known. A book by two former aides described Trump’s go-to McDonald’s dinner as two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and a chocolate malted milkshake.\n\nEven Kennedy was pictured holding what looked like a Big Mac while seated at a table with Trump and his inner circle on his private plane last November, right after Trump's reelection. It drew a great deal of public attention given Kennedy's war on ultra-processed food.\n\nMars takes a second look at artificial food dyes in its candies\n\nChristopher Gindlesperger, senior vice president for public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, a trade group for the U.S. confectionary industry, told USA TODAY some of the challenges for the industry include a long reformulation process and significant costs associated with sourcing natural colors.\n\n“The companies that make natural colors simply don’t make enough to meet demand,” Gindlesperger said.\n\nIn 2016, Mars announced it would voluntarily remove all artificial colors from its “human food portfolio globally.”\n\nBut after an internal team dived into developing new ingredients, securing regulatory approvals, addressing manufacturing readiness and figuring out \"the needs and expectations of our consumers,” it shifted gears in 2020.\n\nThe company found that consumer expectations about colors in food differed widely across markets and categories. For dinnertime meals, they preferred natural ingredients, but when it came to candy, it was not a concern.\n\n“For that reason, we will continue to prioritize our efforts to remove artificial colors in Europe – where consumers have expressed this preference – but will not be removing all artificial colors from our Mars Snacking portfolio in other markets,” it said in a statement now on its website. The statement dates back to 2020, the company confirmed.\n\nKennedy and many food advocates have repeatedly bemoaned the disproportionally large list of additives in the United States compared to Europe.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 food additives are approved for use in the United States versus 411 in the European Union, according to the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation at Harvard Law School.\n\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesman for the HHS, said it is “disappointing that this company will prioritize removing artificial dyes in Europe but will not do the same in America.”\n\nVani Hari, a food advocate who has aligned herself with Kennedy’s MAHA agenda, said she was not sure what the company’s business strategy was, given that states such as West Virginia have begun banning the dyes. Texas is implementing new warning label requirements for foods and beverages containing certain artificial dyes and additives.\n\n“I find it hard to see Mars being the only major candy company that will be left on the shelf with artificial dyes after Hershey declared the removal of them,” she said. “What’s their long-term plan? Stop selling in West Virginia and other states banning dyes? Put warning labels on their products just in Texas?”\n\nKennedy and his associates have said states, rather than lengthy federal regulations, may hold the key to forcing companies to change their ways.\n\nAs for consumer sentiment on artificial dyes, Mars' 5-year old data may no longer reflect the reality, Hari said.\n\nThe self-described \"MAHA mom\" said Kennedy's leadership on educating Americans has changed things.\n\n“More moms than ever are becoming aware of the dangers of artificial dyes,” she said.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine activist, was selected by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States' top health agency.\n\nIn a social media post, Kennedy vowed to work to end chronic disease, clean up corruption and provide Americans with the data they need to make informed decisions, vowing to Trump that he would work to \"Make America Healthy Again.\"\n\nKennedy ran for president in this year's election as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump in exchange for a role in the Republican administration.\n\nThe following are some of the main policy positions RFK Jr. has taken in recent months in editorials, tweets and interviews, according to Reuters.\n\nVaccines\n\nKennedy has criticized vaccines, including making false medical claims that vaccines are linked to autism. He opposed state and federal COVID-19 restrictions. However, he rejects the idea that he is \"anti-vaccine\" and told Reuters every American who wants a vaccine for themselves or their children will have access to it.\n\nProcessed foods\n\nKennedy calls for banning hundreds of food additives and chemicals, such as food dyes. He has called for getting ultra-processed foods out of school lunches as part of a goal to reduce the incidence of diet-related chronic diseases.\n\nNutrition guidelines\n\nHe said the nutrition department at the Food and Drug Administration, which is in charge of nutrition labels on food, has \"to go. They're not doing their job. They're not protecting our kids.\"\n\nWeight loss drugs\n\nKennedy has criticized the popular Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO drug Ozempic, which is often prescribed for weight loss, saying it focused on symptoms of the obesity crisis rather than fixing the food system, and that the drugs \"gladden the wallets\" of pharmaceutical executives.\n\nDrug Research\n\nKennedy has said half of the research budgets from the National Institutes of Health should be directed toward preventive, alternative and holistic approaches to health. He's also said he wants to fire 600 employees at the NIH.\n\nRaw Milk\n\nKennedy wants to end the \"FDA's war on public health,\" including what he called \"aggressive suppression\" of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, and more.\n\nHe has advocated for holistic health practices, like drinking raw milk, a practice that has been associated with outbreaks of illnesses.\n\nFluoride\n\nHe has called for removing fluoride from public water.\n\nThe day after Trump's victory, Kennedy told MSNBC in an interview that \"fluoride will disappear.\" He also repeated the false claim that fluoride \"lowers IQ in our children.\"\n\nMedical schools\n\nHe has said classes in nutrition at federally funded medical schools should be required.\n\nFarms\n\nHe has called for revisiting pesticide and other chemical-use standards, as well as reforming crop subsidies.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services oversees drug regulation, public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and health insurance for more than 140 million people, including the poor, those aged 65 and older, and the disabled through Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nHHS had a $3.09 trillion budget for fiscal year 2024, representing 22.8% of the U.S. federal budget.\n\nReuters contributed to the reporting of this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/jacob-stewart/2025/08/14/make-indiana-healthy-again-fix-food-supply-opinion/85629792007/", "title": "We can't make Indiana healthy again until we fix our food supply ...", "text": "Unhealthy food is addictive, cheap and takes up the majority of our grocery stores.

Kennedy Jr. blames ultra-processed foods, environmental chemicals, lack of physical activity, chronic stress and “overmedicalization” for driving chronic diseases in U.S. children, according to a commission report published May 22.\n\nThe 69-page report, titled “Making Our Children Healthy Again,” also says these drivers are partly propelled by corporate influence and government lobbying.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to \"Make America Healthy Again\" during Kennedy's swearing in ceremony Feb. 13, and tasked it with investigating chronic illness and delivering an action plan to fight childhood diseases, starting with a report due within 100 days – which it hit just under the deadline.\n\nTrump, Kennedy and other administration officials touted the report during an afternoon event in the White House East Room. The president declared it marks \"a historic milestone on our mission to make America healthy again.”\n\nTrump recounted his political alliance with Kennedy, a former Democrat and the nephew of Democratic President John F. Kennedy, who dropped his longshot independent campaign for president and endorsed the GOP candidate.\n\n\"He came on board and we got very lucky,\" Trump said, telling Kennedy: \"You really helped, and I want to thank you very much.\" In return, Trump put Kennedy in charge of the nation's health agencies, giving him license to turn his MAHA movement into government policy, despite criticism from the medical community about his views on vaccines and other issues.\n\nThe MAHA Commission report marks Kennedy's broadest effort yet to put his stamp on federal health policy.\n\n“At it’s core this report is a call to action for common sense,\" Kennedy said. \"We’ve relied too much on conflicted research, ignored common sense, or what some would call ‘mother’s intuition.’”\n\nMAHA commission members responsible for the report attended the event. They include Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya.\n\nIn a call with reporters earlier in the day, Kennedy said the commission will work over the next 80 days to issue policy recommendations for the White House based on the report's findings.\n\n\"This report is really … a diagnosis. The prescription comes in 100 days,” he said.\n\nRFK MAHA report targets ultra-processed foods, food dyes, sweeteners\n\nThe report takes a close look at the American diet and flags ultra-processed grains, sugars, fats and food additives as problems fueling chronic diseases.\n\nAuthors say ultra-processed foods, or UPFs, replace healthier foods and encourage people to eat more. UPFs include foods like chips, cheeseburgers, French fries, soda, cake, candy and cookies.\n\nResearch shows they may be linked to a number of health issues like childhood obesity, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease and depression in women. They've also been associated with cognitive decline and cancer.\n\nThe report also targets food additives such as artificial dyes, titanium dioxide, propylparaben, butylated hydroxytoluene and artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, sucralose and saccharin. The World Health Organization concluded in a 2023 report that the “occasional consumption” of aspartame − typically found in sugar-free drinks like Diet Coke − is generally safe.\n\nKennedy has already begun his campaign against food dyes, announcing in a April 22 news conference that the administration plans to eliminate eight dyes from medications and food by the end of 2026.\n\nThe dyes that will be phased out in less than two years are FD&C Blue Nos. 1 and 2, FD&C Green No. 3, FD&C Red No. 40, FD&C Yellow Nos 5 and 6. In the coming months, the process will begin to revoke authorization of Orange B and Citrus Red No. 2, according to the HHS.\n\nWhat RFK report details about ingesting pesticides, environmental chemicals\n\nReport authors also flag environmental toxins and call for more research to study the health effects of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, microplastics, fluoride, electromagnetic radiation, phthalates, bisphenols and pesticides.\n\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS or “forever chemicals,” consist of more than 12,000 man-made chemical compounds used in consumer products such as non-stick, greaseproof and waterproof coatings and surfaces.\n\nPFAS don’t easily decompose in nature and because of this, they build up in human bodies and might contribute to certain cancers and other serious health complications.\n\nKennedy’s push against fluoride – a naturally occurring mineral found in water, soil, air and various foods – has led to health regulators to remove ingestible fluoride supplements from the market. Fluoride has been added to the public water supplies for decades and dental products, such as toothpaste, as a dental cavities prevention measure.\n\nSo far, Utah and Florida are the only states that have banned fluoride from drinking water. Several other states like Kentucky, Louisiana and South Carolina have anti-fluoride bills on the table.\n\nThe report calls out two herbicides – glyphosate and atrazine – and says an updated assessment on these common substances will be coming out in 2026. The primary exposure to glyphosate, which is used in weed killers like Roundup, occurs through food.\n\nAhead of the report's publication, American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall expressed concern the report’s findings could erode the public’s trust in the U.S. food supply, “limit farming practices based on unproven theories,” and risk “reducing access to affordable and nutritious foods,” according to a statement published May 20.\n\nAgency heads assured on a call about the commission report that the nation's food supply is safe.\n\n\"Farmers need the tools in the toolbox to continue to feed the world, but it doesn't mean we can't do better,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said.\n\nKids are on 'too much medicine,' MAHA report says\n\nIn the report, authors argue that “American children are on too much medicine” and criticize the childhood immunization schedule for encompassing more vaccines than Europe.\n\nThe commission encourages larger clinical trials to look into the safety of childhood vaccines and potential links to chronic diseases. However, experts have said decades of evidence demonstrate the safety and benefits of these shots.\n\nBabies are supposed to receive vaccines that protect against about 15 different infectious diseases. Most require more than one dose, which amounts to nearly 30 jabs by age 2.\n\nReport authors also said that less time spent outside in nature, and more time spent on screens and social media is contributing to the rise of negative physical and mental health outcomes in U.S. children. The commission said these outcomes are exacerbated by \"overmedicalization,\" calling out medications that treat anxiety, depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, are commonly used medications that were called out in the report. SSRIs are approved by the FDA to treat a range of conditions such as anxiety, depression, bulimia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and are used off-label to treat several others.\n\nOn a call with reporters, NIH Director Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya criticized the medical literature supporting certain treatments and how to use them in children, calling it a \"replication crisis.\"\n\n\"We have a crisis that requires rethinking almost every aspect of how we think about disease and the prevention of disease,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson, Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, USA TODAY; Reuters.\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/22"}]}

As a popular MAGA influencer and spokesperson for XtremeRipt male muscle supplement, I’m here today to lay out why you should be furiously angry about Taylor Swift’s new album “Life of a Showgirl.”\n\nIn 2024, our Xtreme President Donald Trump wrote “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” on Truth Social. And in August, he called Swift a “Woke singer” and wrote: “Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT. The tide has seriously turned ‒ Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.”\n\nFor those reasons alone, it’s incumbent on all MAGA faithful to despise and be deeply offended by Swift’s new album, which dropped Oct. 3 and will undoubtedly bomb. Go woke, go broke, amirite?!?\n\nAllow me to nurture your outrage over new Taylor Swift album\n\nYou all know that I, like my fellow MAGA influencers and my friends over at Fox News, am always here to guide your outrage and deliver reasons why the latest thing that happened is the worst thing that has ever happened and is entirely the fault of liberals. Some of my more influential pieces include “Boycott That New Disney Movie Before It Turns Your Dog Gay” and “Do Starbucks ‘Holiday’ Cups Contain Satanic Messaging? Yes They Do.”\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nSo allow me to explain why Swift’s latest album, which I have not listened to because I’m wokeness-intolerant, is deeply anti-American and something you should feel enraged about for at least the next 10 weeks.\n\nFirst off, President Trump has already decreed that Swift is “NO LONGER HOT” and he hates her. How dare she continue to make music! Entertainers serve at the pleasure of the president. That’s in the Constitution, and I strongly encourage you to share that FACT with all the pro-Taylor-Swift family members who no longer talk to you.\n\nHow dare Taylor Swift suggest I spend time being unbothered\n\nNext, we already know the lyrics on what I’m calling “Life of a WOKE Girl” album will be anti-MAGA. Check out this one that was released before the album came out: “Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not.”\n\nWRONG! As a tireless supporter of President Trump, I am bothered CONSTANTLY! My outrage never ceases, and when I’m not busy being mad about something or promoting amazing XtremeRipt products, I’m dutifully looking for the next thing to tell you to be outraged about.\n\n'Life of a Showgirl' song titles are clearly code for an anti-MAGA statement\n\nTo show you how deep the rot runs in Swift’s so-called music, I took the list of song titles from her new album and typed the following prompt into ChatGPT:\n\n“Use the letters in these words to write a sentence critical of Donald Trump: 'The Life of a Showgirl Cancelled The Fate of Ophelia Elizabeth Taylor Opalite Father Figure Eldest Daughter Ruin the Friendship Actually Romantic Wish List Wood Honey.”\n\nAnd do you want to know what ChatGPT, which I trust because I believe in AI and crypto, sent back to me? It sent back this: “Donald Trump ran a cruel, corrupt regime and tarnished the promise of genuine American decency.”\n\nNICE TRY, SWIFT! It doesn’t take a genius to take what you’re doing and prove it’s a vast left-wing conspiracy directly targeting our duly elected and Xtremely amazing president!\n\nNever stop being mad about Taylor Swift. It's the MAGA way!\n\nI hope you all will join me in being apoplectically furious about and victimized by this transparent slight. It’s yet another attempt by radical leftists to make us think that enjoyable pop music from a woman who hasn’t technically done anything controversial isn’t trying to poison our minds with catchy songs about love and life.\n\nWithout Trump’s support, I’m sure Swift’s album will be a MASSIVE FLOP anyway, but just in case, make sure you stay engaged and outraged. Man the Facebook comment cannons and plaster social media sites with your anger.\n\nAnd don’t forget to type in my name to get 20% off your next order of XtremeRipt male muscle supplements.

It's the color of your eyes, sweetie,\" Travis replies. \"It's why we match so well.\"\n\n\"We're about to do a f***ing podcast,\" she says smiling.\n\nEarlier this morning, Taylor Nation, her in-house marketing team, posted like a canary in a coal mine, alerting the fandom to a 12th chapter. \"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era…' ❤️‍🔥,\" the account posted with a carousel of 12 photos included fellow singer Sabrina Carpenter.\n\nThe \"New Heights\" podcast shared a photo of Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce next to a silhouette of Swift. The glittery background orange is the same background seen on a countdown clock on her website three hours before the announcement and also on her letter to fans announcing the ownership of her masters.\n\n'See you next era'\n\nKnown for planting Easter eggs in everything from lyrics to fashion to concert graphics, Swift started teasing the new project in April 2024 when she debuted \"The Tortured Poets Department\" at her Paris concert. Eagle-eyed Swifties noticed her countdown turned orange before the opening sequence and her \"Karma\" door at the close of the show was orange. She debuted a fiery bodysuit seen on the first page of her official Eras Tour book next to a letter that read: \"See you next era...\"\n\nHer team placed the book in a glass case at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. Each year, the display inside the Taylor Swift Education Center gets a refresh. In April, curators cracked the book open to its first page — a seemingly deliberate choice, as the exhibit’s theme this year is \"Fearless.\" Many expected a page from that era, considering the display features her Roberto Cavalli \"silver noodle\" dress, Christian Louboutin boots and the Swarovski-crystal guitar her family bedazzled. In her letter, Swift writes: \"There’s nothing I hate more than doing what I’ve always done.\"\n\nFor the past four years, Swift has followed a steady formula: two rerecordings one year, one original album the next. Now, fans suspect the next chapter is about to break that cycle.\n\nTracing the evidence\n\nHits Daily Double, a music insider publication that reports on industry rumors, got the Swiftie fandom buzzing when they published an article about Justin Bieber's album \"Swag.\"\n\nThe original text said: \"Justin’s new giant adds another rocket to the Lipmans' global arsenal, which already features monsters Drake, Morgan, Post and the left-field phenomenon KPop Demon Hunters at the top of the streaming charts. What's more, seismic rumblings of a new Taylor set keep the Republic team as aggressive as ever.\"\n\nThe article was quickly updated with the last line rephrased as: \"And there's always Taylor.\"\n\nFans, like Tiktok influencer Jake Deyton, took to social media to express their excitement. Deyton pointed out that Swift's usual cycle for an album announcement is a single in August or September, followed by an album release in October or November.\n\nA Swedish DJ may have sounded the alarm prematurely in April about an upcoming Swift project.\n\nThe Swedish branch of Swift's label Universal Music Group posted a quickly deleted clip of Jacob Criborn, part of the DJ team Nause, talking about the inspiration behind his \"Canelloni Macaroni\" remix. Criborn talked about working with Erik Arvinder, a Swedish composer and violinist.\n\n\"He did a string arrangement of 25. He got some brass guys playing trumpet, saxophone, trombone,\" he said in remarks translated from Swedish through Google Translate. \"And they were like, 'We're just going to finish Taylor Swift's record and then we'll jump on 'Canelloni.' No, but we really kind of pushed for this song because it deserves it.\"\n\nMore breadcrumbs to \"TS12\" include her Instagram tease in Miami for the Eras Tour, when she held her cat Meredith in Hard Rock Stadium's A12 section. In March, she praised Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco's new album, using 12 d's in a caption on her Instagram story: \"oh my godddddddddddd.\" In the letter announcing the ownership of her masters, she had 12 i's in \"thiiiiiiiiiiiis.\" The single numbers in the letter of 4, 6 and 2 add up to 12. The letterhead included a new \"TS\" diamond logo that would make Elizabeth Taylor proud.\n\nThe announcement also comes in perfect time for Kelce's 13th year playing football.\n\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\n\nFollow Taylor Swift reporter Bryan West on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/10/03/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-kids-parents-explicit-guide/86499674007/", "title": "Is Taylor Swift's new album appropriate for kids? A parents' guide.", "text": "Parents may want to press pause before blaring Taylor Swift’s new album around young listeners.\n\nEight out of the twelve songs on \"The Life of a Showgirl\" are labeled explicit, marking the most Swift has sworn on one album in her career.\n\nSongs marked explicit mean their lyrics include swear words or other vulgarities. Generally, even if the original version of a song is explicit, artists will create a \"clean\" version without profanities so that it can be played on the radio.\n\nSwift, whose fans span children and adults alike, excluded swear words on most of her early albums. She first cursed on \"Reputation\" in 2017, with later albums like \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore\" including more explicit songs.\n\nHowever, Swift's explicitness pales in comparison to the amount of profanity across the music industry, research shows. According to a 2020 study in the International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research, the number of profanities in songs on the Billboard Top 100 charts rose from less than 200 per year in 2009 to more than 700 per year in 2018.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

Here's which ones they are:\n\n\"Father Figure\"\n\n\"Eldest Daughter\"\n\n\"Actually Romantic\"\n\n\"Wi$h Li$t\"\n\n\"Wood\"\n\n\"CANCELLED!\"\n\n\"Honey\"\n\n\"The Life of a Showgirl\"\n\nThe following songs from \"The Life of a Showgirl\" do not contain swear words and are therefore not marked explicit:\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\"\n\n\"Elizabeth Taylor\"\n\n\"Opalite\"\n\n\"Ruin the Friendship\"\n\nSome 'Life of a Showgirl' songs have sexual innuendos, too\n\nAside from swear words, some songs on \"The Life of a Showgirl\" contain sexual innuendos that are present even in the \"clean\" version.\n\nOn \"Wood,\" the clean version replaces the lyric \"his love was the key that opened my thighs\" to \"his love was the key that opened my skies.\"\n\nHowever, the clean track still mentions being \"bare naked\" and \"dancing in the dark.\"\n\nAnd on \"Actually Romantic,\" the clean version swaps \"making me wet\" for \"making me sweat,\" but it still mentions \"talking dirty.\"\n\nWhat is \"Wood\" about? Why Taylor Swift's new song about Travis Kelce may make you blush\n\nHow to find the explicit and clean versions of 'The Life of a Showgirl'\n\nAlthough the main versions of some songs contain swear words, Swift released a version of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" with no cursing.\n\nThe difference between an explicit and clean version of a song is that the former contains expletives or vulgarities, while the latter does not. To identify the difference, explicit songs are marked with an \"E\" next to the track name.\n\nClean versions of the album are available on streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nFor Spotify users: On Spotify, users can filter all explicit content across the platform by toggling on or off the \"explicit content\" option in account settings. To find specific clean songs on Spotify mobile, search a song title to find any versions without explicit tags. On desktop, scroll down to the bottom of the album listing and find more releases of the same album at the bottom right.\n\nFor Apple Music users: Users can similarly find the clean version on Apple Music by scrolling to the bottom of the album page and finding \"other versions.\" To implement explicit content settings, turn on or off parental controls in device settings.\n\nTaylor Swift's website has previous physical CD albums for sale with clean or non-explicit options, but as of Oct. 3 does not list similar options for \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

Do you know what I mean? It was a lot of physical therapy and it was a lot of being in a state of perpetual physical discomfort, kind of like when you're in season,\" she said to Travis and Jason.\n\nSwift went on a world tour from 2023-2024 where she went to 52 cities and 21 countries, including a three night tour stop at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Indianapolis was the last U.S. stop on her world tour.\n\n\"I miss it because I miss the fans and I miss that connection, but at the same time it was the most formative time of my life,\" Swift said. \"I learned so much about how far I can push myself and if I set a goal... It's really just prioritizing fan's experience before anything else.\"\n\nTaylor Swift announces new album 'The Life of a Showgirl'\n\nSwift also announced a brand new album titled \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" which she wrote while on the road for The Eras Tour, she shared on the podcast.\n\n\"This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,\" Swift said.\n\nUnlike her previous album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" that was initially 16 tracks that was a surprise double album with 15 additional songs, Swift says \"The Life of a Showgirl\" will be 12 tracks total, with no surprise songs.\n\nThe album is set to release on Friday, Oct. 3, 2025.\n\nHow did Taylor Swift buy her masters?\n\nSwift has had a long history of trying to obtain the master recordings of her first six albums in her career and she announced earlier this year that her dream of owning all her life's work finally came true in May.\n\nOn \"New Heights,\" she shared the story of how it finally happened.\n\nAfter The Eras Tour her team decided it might be worth approaching the owners of her masters, Shamrock Capital, again to see if they would be willing to sell.\n\n\"Rather than send lawyers or management like in a big crew, I sent my mom and my brother, who I work with, to L.A. and they sat down with Shamrock Capital and they told them what this meant for me...\"\n\nSwift's mom and brother left the meeting saying that they weren't sure what they would decide to do.\n\nSwift later got the call from her mom saying Shamrock Capital agreed to sell to her, which resulted in tears of joy for Swift.\n\nWatch Taylor Swift on 'New Heights'\n\nKatie Wiseman covers trending news for IndyStar and Midwest Connect.

Swift's marketing team, Taylor Nation, had posted a time card of the singer's schedule for the rollout with a hole punched at 7 p.m. Saturday. All it said was, \"Standby.\"\n\nSwift's website ticked down to four limited CD releases with images from her \"The Fate of Ophelia\" music video. The $8 hard copies included acoustic versions of \"Showgirl\" songs.\n\nSome fans online are calling out the new variants on the account run by Swift's team:\n\n@likedavie said, \"I am a longtime fan and I love Taylor but 4 vinyls each with different songs feels like a cashgrab especially after all the previous versions.\"\n\n@faith.steele said \"Can we just get them all on one cd?

She had four initial vinyls of \"Tortured Poets\" and one exclusive vinyl with Target, six vinyls of \"Midnights\" (all had the same 13 tracks), five of \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" (one of these albums had the bonus track \"Sweeter Than Fiction\") and 10 of \"Folklore\" (all had the same 17 tracks).\n\nDoyle Davis, co-owner of Grimey's New & Preloved Music in East Nashville, told The Tennessean in 2024 that each version purchased counts toward physical music sales.\n\n\"The thing about record collecting, and it seems to be the case with a lot of the Swifties, is they want all the versions,\" he says. \"If you buy four versions, you're buying four records.\"\n\nLove it or not, Swift's formula for sales is still the industry's gold standard. In a Sept. 30 tweet, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) congratulated Swift on \"becoming the first and only female artist in history to surpass 100 million RIAA Certified Album Units.\"\n\nWith her 12th album, Swift is in sixth place overall in sales:\n\nThe Beatles: 183 million units\n\n183 million units Garth Brooks: 162 million units\n\n162 million units Elvis Presley: 146 million units\n\n146 million units Eagles: 120 million units\n\n120 million units Led Zeppelin: 112 million units\n\n112 million units Taylor Swift: 105 million units\n\nSeparate from the physical releases, Swift’s 12th era is setting streaming records.\n\nApple Music named \"The Life of a Showgirl\" the platform's biggest album of 2025 by first-day streams worldwide, while lead single \"The Fate of Ophelia\" broke the record for most first-day streams of any song.

I’ve been dying just from trying to seem cool,” she sings over piano chords in “Eldest Daughter.”\n\nOf course Swift’s legion of devotees would scoff at the notion that their heroine was anything but a pop goddess, their very own Glinda the Good Witch sent to comfort with lyrical poetry and aid crumpled hearts.\n\nOn “The Life of a Showgirl,” out Oct. 3, Swift does not abandon the relatable big sister vibes that propelled her into rarified billionaire air. But she’s also a 35-year-old woman in love who proudly flaunts the physical and emotional attributes of her man, Travis Kelce.\n\nFor her 12th album, Swift shakes off the melancholy of 2024’s “The Tortured Poets Department” for a dozen brisk songs infused with the playfulness of “1989” and the velvet-sheathed-knife lyrics of “Reputation.”\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nBut even though she’s still tossing out delicious snark such as, “Like a toy Chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse, that’s how much it hurts” (“Actually Romantic,” a bullseye smackdown that will incite internet sleuths), Swift is floating more than she’s punching.\n\nShe’s returned to the polished imprint of producers Max Martin and Shellback, her first album with the Swedish pop maestros since 2017. And not since “1989” has Swift crafted an album where every song is a potential smash.\n\nTaylor Swift is both dreamy and defiant on new album\n\nShe recorded “Showgirl” in 2024, in the midst of the European leg of her records-shattering Eras Tour, as she revealed in her candid appearance with Kelce on his New Heights podcast. Swift’s 149-show, five-continent expedition encapsulated a tsunami of emotions not just among her fans, but her own journey through a very public breakup, a fling and, as indicated by her engagement to Kelce, knee-buckling love.\n\nThough the song order is Easter egg intentional – as with everything Swift – it’s bookended by a declaration of romantic salvation and a narrative from the perspective of a weary, yet defiant showgirl.\n\n“No longer drowning and deceived,” Swift whispers in between the soaring swirls of album opener “The Fate of Ophelia,” embracing her predilection for all things literature. Swift named the song after the character in Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” who is driven to madness and death, an implication of Swift’s state of mind before Kelce arrived as her knight in a shining helmet (or, as she references him, “Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes”).\n\nWhich Taylor Swift songs are about Travis Kelce?\n\nThe theme of emotional rescue is threaded throughout “Showgirl.”\n\nIn “Honey,” which lopes with a clip-clop beat, piano and a dusting of flute, Swift explains, “When anyone called me lovely, they were finding ways not to praise me/you say it like you’re in awe of me.” She also dreams of idyllic suburban life in “Wi$h Li$t.” As the song progresses over chiming synths, she reaches into her upper register to sing, “I thought I had it right once, twice, but I did not. You caught me off my guard.”\n\nOne of the standout tracks, “Wood,” is clearly directed at the groom-to-be with the giveaway lyric “New Heights of manhood.” Swift bakes sly innuendo into the song, which glistens like a ‘70s mirror ball and grooves with her funkiest guitar riff ever as she friskily tosses out lines such as, “Redwood tree it ain’t hard to see/his love was the key that opened my thighs.”\n\nMusically, Swift stitches the organic sounds (banjo, pedal steel guitar) of her earliest records with the staccato catchiness of programmed keyboards. The results swerve from the ridiculously infectious “Opalite” with its ’60s girl group DNA to the majestic sweep of “Father Figure,” a cinematic mobster tale of loyalty and ambition that lightly interpolates George Michael’s sultry 1987 hit of the same name (he receives a posthumous writing credit).\n\nUnsurprisingly, she aces both.\n\nTaylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter offer a poignant duet\n\nOnly two of the songs on the efficient album clock in at slightly more than four minutes. “Eldest Daughter” spotlights Swift at her most introspective as she sings quietly over piano, while the title track captivates because of her deft touch with vivid imagery. Trading verses and sharing perfectly balanced harmonizing with Sabrina Carpenter, who is experiencing her own escalation into pop royalty, Swift unwraps the ballad of Kitty, “who made her money being pretty and witty.”\n\nThe song pushes with a deliberate boom clap and acoustic guitar before veering into one of Swift’s patented bridges, a rapid burst of strings as she and Carpenter recite the inner monologue of Kitty, a showgirl used to people taking a “skate on the ice inside my veins.”\n\nThe story-within-a-story wraps with an appropriate zinger (“Hey Kitty, now I make my money being pretty and witty”) before concert audio of Swift and Carpenter saying goodnight to a screaming crowd from the Eras Tour reverberates as the song fades out.\n\nIt’s a fitting final bow and another triumph for the ultimate showgirl.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/08/12/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-album-release-date-new-heights-podcast-where-to-watch/85622141007/", "title": "When does Taylor Swift's new album drop?

However, Swift's website says that the vinyls for the album will ship before Oct. 13.\n\nWhat is TS12?\n\nTS12 was a working title, given by fans, for Swift's 12th studio album.\n\nHow many albums does Taylor Swift have?\n\nSwift currently has 11 albums, with \"The Tortured Poets Department\" being her latest release. \"The Life of a Showgirl\" would be the pop star's 12th album.\n\nWhen does the 'New Heights' podcast drop?\n\nThe \"New Heights\" podcast episode featuring Swift will drop on Wednesday, Aug. 13.\n\nThe 13th is apropos for an announcement as it is Swift's favorite number. The announcement also comes in perfect time for Kelce's 13th year playing football.\n\nWhat time does the 'New Heights podcast come out?\n\nFans can tune in Aug. 13 for a 7 p.m. ET drop.\n\nWhere to watch 'New Heights' podcast\n\nNew episodes drop on the podcast's YouTube channel, and can be listened to through Spotify and Apple Podcasts.\n\nEaster eggs that led Swifties to TS12 speculation\n\nTaylor Nation, the singer's in-house marketing and public relations team, created a 12-photo carousel on Instagram on Monday morning. That number is important to note, as 13 is famously known to be Swift's favorite number. So, why stop short? It could be because her next album would signal her 12th era.\n\n\"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era…'\" the caption said alongside an array of orange Eras Tour looks. The post ended with a burning heart emoji.\n\nThe post erupted. In less than 10 minutes, the Instagram post had been shared more than 10,000 times with fans screaming, shouting and throwing up in the comments. Even Republic Records, the record label repping Swift, commented a burning heart emoji.\n\nSpeculation of a new album also rose because Taylor Nation solely posted photos of the pop star's orange Eras Tour outfits. Why does this matter? Fans have long theorized Swift had an album called \"Karma\" that was scrapped and that orange was the album's accompanying color.\n\nUp until 2016, Swift had released an album every two years, so fans believed \"Karma\" would be the next album in her discography after \"1989,\" but she took a hiatus and didn't release an album until \"Reputation\" in 2017. The \"Karma\" theory still existed, but wasn't fully revived until the release of \"Midnights,\" which featured a song called \"Karma.\"\n\nIt could all be pure coincidence, but Swifites know better than that. With Swift, everything is calculated. She is the \"Mastermind,\" after all.\n\nAdditionally, Swift's boyfriend, University of Cincinnati alum Travis Kelce, also added fuel to the speculation fire.\n\n\"New Heights,\" Travis and Jason Kelce's podcast, revealed its releasing a show early for a \"special episode with a VERY special guest.\" Travis Kelce also shared the image on his Instagram.\n\nSome fans have speculated Swift will be joining the brothers' podcast after eagle-eyed Swifties caught that Jason Kelce was sporting Eras Tour merch, and because Travis was smiling ear-to-ear in the episode's promo image.\n\n\"92%ers, we're coming back early for a special episode with a VERY special guest,\" the accounts said. The photo includes a black silhouette and a bedazzled orange background. Jason Kelce is donning what looks like an Eras Tour midnight blue sweater.\n\nThere has been a wide range of other Easter eggs that have led Swifties to believe TS12 is nearly upon us.
