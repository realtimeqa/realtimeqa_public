Since then, the private company, valued at about $10 billion, according to Bloomberg, has expanded its plans to include the de-extinction of the Australian thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) and the dodo.\n\nLast month, Colossal revealed it had genetically engineered the Woolly Mouse, which shared some coat characteristics with a woolly mammoth, including longer, lighter-colored hair with a rough, woolly texture. \"This is a very, very big step for us because it proves that all of the work we've been doing for the last three years on the woolly mammoth is exactly what we predicted,\" Lamm said at the time.\n\nWe've got today's trends: Sign up for USA TODAY's Everyone's Talking newsletter.\n\nWith the reveal of the dire wolf puppies, Colossal shows \"that our end-to-end (de-extinction) toolkit that we talked about with the mouse works, but now it's working with ancient DNA and it's been pretty incredible,\" Lamm told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat is a dire wolf?\n\nMany may have first heard of the dire wolf from HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" and George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels, on which the TV show is based. (The dire wolf was the sigil, or mascot, of House Stark.) Others may be familiar with the Grateful Dead song, \"Dire Wolf.\"\n\nDire wolves have also appeared in video games including Final Fantasy and World of Warcraft, tabletop game classic Dungeons & Dragons, and card game Magic the Gathering.\n\nBut the dire wolf is an actual real-world predator, which went extinct about 13,000 years ago after roaming North America for thousands of years before that, alongside saber tooth tigers and mastodons.\n\n“Many people view dire wolves as mythical creatures that only exist in a fantasy world, but in reality, they have a rich history of contributing to the American ecosystem,” said the author Martin, who is also an investor and cultural advisor to Colossal, in a statement. “I get the luxury to write about magic, but Ben and Colossal have created magic by bringing these majestic beasts back to our world.”\n\nAbout 25% larger than modern-day gray wolves, dire wolves had thicker, more muscular legs, more powerful shoulders, a wider head and snout with larger jaws and teeth. The dire wolf stood about 3½ feet tall and could be even longer than 6 feet and weigh up to 150 pounds.\n\nResearchers have long been intrigued by the dire wolf because it coexisted with the gray wolf – which did not go extinct – but there hasn't been enough dire wolf DNA found to analyze. Many dire wolf remains have been found in the La Brea tar pits, for example, but the tar pit damages the DNA, said Beth Shapiro, Colossal's chief science officer.\n\nShapiro and the researchers at Colossal contacted museums and laboratories with dire wolf specimens and got access to a tooth thought to be about 13,000 years old, found in Ohio, and a 72,000-year-old skull from Idaho. Inside the skull is the petrous, or inner ear bone, which is a good source of well-preserved DNA, Shapiro said.\n\nFrom those two specimens, Shapiro and the team at Colossal recovered enough DNA to create two dire wolf genomes to compare with other canid species including coyotes, jackals, dholes and, of course, other wolves, Shapiro said. Using the genetic data, researchers could confirm the gray wolf as the closest living relative of the dire wolf – they share 99.5% of their DNA code.\n\nNext, the Colossal researchers edited the gray wolf genome in 20 sites over 14 genes to express specific traits of dire wolves including a light-colored coat, hair length, coat patterning, along with body size and musculature.\n\nFertilized dire wolf eggs were implanted into and born by surrogate dog mothers. Two litters have led to a pair of male dire wolves, Romulus and Remus, now six months old, and a female, Khaleesi (named after the \"Game of Thrones\" character), born in January. These newcomers are not 100% exactly the same dire wolf that roamed the earth ages ago, but look as genetically close as cutting-edge technology could get.\n\n\"Their coat is just absolutely amazing. It's super thick,\" said Lamm, describing the wolves, which live on a 2,000-acre ecological preserve in the northern U.S. \"They are super friendly because we've raised them ... (chief animal officer) Matt (James) bottle fed them when they were just young pups. But they are starting to come into their own, where they're acting more and more like wolves.\"\n\nWhy bring back the dire wolf from extinction?\n\nWolves became a focus at Colossal after Lamm and James had a meeting with The MHA (Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara) Nation in central North Dakota. While talking with the tribal leaders about research on buffalo and bison conservation, \"they told us there's not enough going into wolf conservation,\" Lamm said, and began discussing the dire wolf and wolves' importance to generations of Native Americans.\n\nSoon after that, they met with officials in North Carolina about the state's Red Wolf Recovery Program, which seeks to increase the population of the one-time extinct animal through breeding in captivity and releasing wolves. At about the same time, investors including Peter Jackson and Tom Brady came on board who were \"super excited about this business,\" Lamm said.\n\nWith the dire wolf, Colossal thought \"we could do something that could bring awareness from pop culture to science … and we could build technologies to help wolves, which we did in this process, and do something that the indigenous people were really excited about,\" Lamm said. \"We kind of joke that we didn't pursue the dire wolf, in a weird way it pursued us.\"\n\nThe dire wolf is a symbol that \"carries the echoes of our ancestors, their wisdom, and their connection to the wild,” said MHA Nation Tribal Chairman Mark Fox in a statement. “Its presence would remind us of our responsibility as stewards of the Earth – to protect not just the wolf, but the delicate balance of life itself.\"\n\nDuring the project to de-extinct the dire wolf, the Colossal researchers developed a cloning shortcut using blood instead of tissue samples from wild coyote-Red Wolf mix wolves, which carry Red Wolf DNA, to birth two litters of Red Wolf puppies. \"So we're able to inject these new genetics into the recovery population in a way that can bolster their adaptive ability,\" James said.\n\nColossal plans to breed more dire wolves and study them and how they act in packs. As of now, there's no plan for the wolves to breed.\n\nThey hope North Carolina is interested in using the company's technology to bring more Red Wolves into nature, too. Wolves are \"critical to ecosystems, they're helpful to the planet and they're also an American icon,\" Lamm said.\n\nNews about the dire wolves hit on Monday with stories by outlets such as The New York Times, Time, and People. Colossal will soon publish a paper about the ancient DNA used to create the three dire wolves. And the company has kept experts in the field informed about their advances.\n\n\"I think for me the most exciting thing about this project is that shows how we can use cutting edge technologies in molecular biology to help protect and preserve populations of animals that are at risk of extinction today,\" said Elinor Karlsson, the director of vertebrate genomics at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and a geneticist who's a member of Colossal's advisory board.\n\n\"Colossal produced healthy puppies with genetic variants that haven't existed for over 10,000 years,\" she told USA TODAY. \"To do this, they innovated new methods for sampling, biobanking and cloning. Their work could will help us preserve genetic diversity that is on the brink of disappearing from earth today, which includes a number of Canidae species,\" which includes domestic dogs, foxes, wolves and other mammals.\"\n\n\"I also appreciate how careful Colossal was in the way they approached this work,\" she said. \"They prioritized the health and well-being of both the dog mothers and the wolf puppies.\"\n\nColossal constantly weighs the ethics of its technology in case readers are worried about something as happened in the movie \"Jurassic Park\" coming to fruition. \"We have spent a lot of time thinking about whether we should (bring back a species),\" Shapiro said. \"We weren't just focused on whether we could. We've now proven we can.\"\n\nThe ability to revive and sustain species is important, she said. \"We have to keep in mind and understand that there is an incredible risk in the decision not to use these technologies,\" Shapiro said. \"We know what the consequences of that decision are and it's an increased rate of extinction throughout the world.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nMike Snider is a reporter on USA TODAY’s Trending team.

Then, they edited the genome of the dire wolf's oldest surviving relative, the gray wolf, to express dire wolf traits. Surrogate dog mothers successfully gave birth to fertilized dire wolf eggs and now Colossal has three dire wolf puppies living on the company's expansive preserve.\n\nDire wolves brought back: See photos of Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi\n\nColossal also used the technology to give birth to four red wolves, an endangered species. The successful birth of the dire wolves buttresses Colossal's goals of helping \"de-extinct\" species and to sustain some endangered species.\n\n“Preserving, expanding, and testing genetic diversity should be done well before important endangered animal species like the red wolf are lost,\" said Harvard Medical School geneticist and cofounder of Colossal, George Church in a statement. \"The dire wolf is an early example of this, including the largest number of precise genomic edits in a healthy vertebrate so far. A capability that is growing exponentially.”\n\nHere's what other projects are underway at Colossal Biosciences.\n\nColossal's goal to bring back the woolly mammoth and how the woolly mouse fits into the plans\n\nChurch and Ben Lamm, a technology and software entrepreneur, cofounded Colossal Laboratories & Biosciences in 2021 to “rapidly advance the field of species de-extinction,” the company said at the time.\n\nTheir first announced project: a next-generation woolly mammoth. Using gene editing technology to update Asian elephant DNA, they set out to create a \"cold-resistant elephant with all of the core biological traits of the woolly mammoth,\" they said at the time. The mammoth could revitalize Arctic grasslands and result in “major climate change-combatting properties including carbon sequestering, methane suppression and light reflection,\" the company says on its website.\n\n\"It will walk like a woolly mammoth, look like one, sound like one, but most importantly it will be able to inhabit the same ecosystem previously abandoned by the Mammoth’s extinction,\" says Colossal, which hopes to have its first woolly mammoth calves by 2028.\n\nEarlier this year, Colossal offered a glimpse into its advances with the reveal of the \"Colossal Woolly Mouse,\" which was born in October 2024 and genetically engineered to have characteristics that could eventually be used in creating the next-generation woolly mammoth embryo to be born by a female elephant.\n\nMammoth DNA genes were identified and modifications were made in laboratory mice so they would have \"dramatically altered coat color, texture, and thickness reminiscent of the woolly mammoth’s core phenotypes\" or characteristics, the company said at the time.\n\n\"This is a very, very big step for us because it proves that all of the work we've been doing for the last three years on the woolly mammoth is exactly what we predicted,\" Lamm previously told USA TODAY.\n\nAdvances made on the Tazmanian tiger\n\nBack in 2022, Colossal said it was working with the University of Melbourne's Thylacine Integrated Genetic Restoration Research, or TIGRR, Lab, to bring back the Australian thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) and reestablish the Tasmanian tiger on the island of Tasmania off the southeast tip of Australia.\n\nHad the tiger not been killed off – a predator, it threatened sheep and livestock and was essentially hunted to extinction by 1936 – it could have helped prevent the spread of a facial tumor disease that is eliminating the Tasmanian devil population, researchers previously said.\n\nIn October 2024, Colossal said it had assembled the most complete Tasmanian tiger genome, a major step toward de-extincting the animal, thanks to genetic material harvested from a complete head of an adult thylacine that was skinned and preserved in ethanol.\n\n“The thylacine samples used for our new reference genome are among the best preserved ancient specimens my team has worked with,” Beth Shapiro, Colossal’s chief science officer, said at the time. “It’s rare to have a sample that allows you to push the envelope in ancient DNA methods to such an extent. We’ve delivered a record-breaking ancient genome that will accelerate our thylacine de-extinction project.”\n\nBringing back the dodo\n\nTwo years ago, Colossal added the dodo, which went extinct more than 300 years ago, to the list of animals it's seeking to bring back. The birds, which were larger than turkeys, were killed for food by Portuguese sailors who discovered them on the island of Mauritius, off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean. Pigs and other animals brought to the island also ate dodo eggs.\n\n\"The dodo is a prime example of a species that became extinct because we – people – made it impossible for them to survive in their native habitat,\" said Shapiro, who is on leave from the University of California-Santa Cruz where she led the Paleogenomics lab that sequenced the dodo genome and subsequently created a thylacine genome.\n\n\"I particularly look forward to furthering genetic rescue tools focused on birds and avian conservation,\" she said at the time.\n\nNot just dire wolves born at Colossal, red wolves, too\n\nThe genetics work done to bring back the dire wolf also led to cloning advances the Colossal researchers used to achieve the birth of four red wolves from surrogate mothers.\n\nAn endangered species, there are fewer than 20 red wolves remaining in North America, Colossal says. By adding red wolves born at Colossal, the red wolf population could be boosted – similar to how the gray wolf population in Yellowstone was increased.\n\nThe reveal of the dire wolves and accompanying news on red wolf advances lead to plenty of commotion and news coverage.\n\nThe Interior Secretary Doug Burgum chimed in on the news via social network X (formerly Twitter), saying: \"Since the dawn of our nation, it has been innovation – not regulation – that has spawned American greatness. The revival of the Dire Wolf heralds the advent of a thrilling new era of scientific wonder, showcasing how the concept of 'de-extinction' can serve as a bedrock for modern species conservation.\"\n\nColossal hopes to work with the U.S. government on repopulating the red wolf.\n\n\"The technologies developed on the path to the dire wolf are already opening up new opportunities to rescue critically endangered canids,\" said Matt James, Colossal’s chief animal officer and Colossal Foundation executive director. \"The creation of less-invasive sampling tools such as our EPC blood cloning platform allows for the conservation community to ramp up biobanking efforts of those species on the brink.\"\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta and Marina Pitofksy, USA TODAY.\n\nMike Snider is a reporter on USA TODAY’s Trending team.

There's certainly eerie similarities to “Jurassic Park” – the movie where dinosaurs came back to life.\n\n“We see no possible way this could go wrong,” wrote the social media account for the spin-off movie franchise Jurassic World, in tongue-in-cheek response to the news.\n\nDespite parallels between the movie and Colossal’s work, scientists and ethicists say a world where prehistoric animals are roaming city streets and gobbling up humans isn’t likely to become a reality anytime soon.\n\n“People say, remember Jurassic Park? And I say, remember Jurassic Park was fiction,” said Hank Greely, a Stanford University law professor who specializes in the ethical quandaries of biotechnologies. “Fiction needs to be dramatic. ... Utopias are not dramatic.”\n\nBut some conservationists are expressing wide-ranging concern about the unintended consequences that could arise as researchers continue to try to resurrect versions of extinct animals.\n\n“Everybody’s excited about the technology, and rightly so – it’s just amazing what they’ve done,” said Dave Strayer, a senior scientist emeritus at the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in New York. “But unless they’re only talking about raising these animals to be kept in a zoo or private collections, they’re going to be releasing them into the wild – and what happens then?”\n\nWhat’s the purpose?\n\nMost experts USA TODAY spoke with agreed that attempts to de-extinct animals, like the dire wolf, result in animals that are not the same as their ancestors and are actually hybrid animals. Scientists create these animals by engineering DNA that matches important traits of the extinct animal into a modern animal's DNA sequence.\n\nColossal's dire wolves are, in essence, gray wolves with about 20 handpicked genes from dire wolf DNA that re-create key characteristics of the species.\n\n“They’re a genetically engineered life form that hasn’t existed before that has some attributes of dire wolves,” Strayer said.\n\nBut ethicists and conservationists appear to be divided on attempts to bring back extinct species – and whether the efforts matter.\n\nColossal has no plans to release its dire wolves into the wild, said Beth Shapiro, the company's chief science officer. They live in an undisclosed location on a 2,000 acre protected ecological preserve where they are restricted from leaving and are monitored, she said. Researchers intend to watch how these animals interact with their ecosystem to derive insights for future projects, Shapiro said.\n\nBut Colossal is working on long-term projects to create genetically engineered versions of the woolly mammoth, dodo bird and Tasmanian tiger with the intention to help repopulate some of those species in the wild.\n\nSome conservationists believe certain species should eventually be placed in their natural habitats to help restore the ecosystems, while others have expressed unease about reintegrating them into the wild, saying the \"cool\" factor alone is enough reason to de-extinct animals.\n\n\"We do a lot of things because they're cool. Coolness is underrated as a reason to do things in academic discussions,\" Greely said. \"It would be really cool to see a woolly mammoth, and it would be really cool to see a giant ground sloth, and that's worth something.\"\n\nImpact on ecosystems\n\nBen Novak, the lead scientist at Revive and Restore, a biotech nonprofit in the de-extinction space, argued that the extinction of certain species can hurt other animals in an ecosystem through domino effects related to their food chains and habitats.\n\nA 2018 World Wildlife Foundation report found that humans have eradicated 60% of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles since 1970.\n\nBy thoughtfully reintroducing specific extinct or threatened species back into their ecosystem, the same way conservationists transplant living species, Novak said he believes they can help protect other animals in those areas. The nonprofit is working on reviving populations of the black-footed ferret and passenger pigeon, among other animals.\n\nBut because these genetically constructed animals aren’t identical to their ancestors, some worry that they won’t necessarily behave as their ancestors would when placed in their ancestral environment.\n\nStrayer said that introducing a species that has been long gone could be the equivalent of an invasive species, acting in ways difficult or impossible to predict.\n\nAlso, humans have gotten used to these animals being gone – and aren't always happy when they come back.\n\nIn the West, the reintroduction of gray wolves into areas they lived in just 100 years ago has generated enormous controversy. Ranchers complain about predation on their herds and city dwellers fear having wolves living too close for comfort.\n\n“We have centuries of history of deciding a species has a desirable attribute, deciding we know what will happen when we introduce it into a new place and then discovering we were wrong,” Strayer said.\n\n“What will we do if they don’t behave as we hope?” he said. “Who decides if they even should be released into the wild? What kind of plan is in place to deal with unintended consequences? And who pays for it?”\n\nAnimal welfare concerns\n\nExperts also raised concern about the treatment of de-extinct animals and those used to help create them.\n\nEfforts to re-create extinct animals require extensive testing – and potentially failed attempts. Animals that birth de-extinct species could experience miscarriage, stillbirth, early death and possible pain, suggested Jay Odenbaugh, a professor of philosophy at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.\n\n“It is morally wrong to cause a sentient being unnecessary suffering,” Odenbaugh wrote in a 2023 article published in the Cambridge University Press.\n\nThat doesn't appear to have been the case with the dire wolf constructs, said Shapiro, who told USA TODAY that none of the animals used in Colossal's dire wolf program suffered undue pain. Several of the pregnancies were resorbed early on and some of the pregnancies did not establish after the embryo transfer, she said. After the births, all of the surrogate dog mothers were given to the American Humane Society who adopted them to human families.\n\nOdenbaugh also noted the obligation to conserve and restore biodiversity can be outweighed by concern about animal welfare in some circumstances, but it requires active debate and consideration. However, he questioned the moral purpose of de-extincting animals if they aren't integrated into ecosystems.\n\n“There’s a sense in which we’re creating animals only to frustrate them,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nThe moral dilemma around conservation\n\nDe-extinction projects raise a moral quandary for many conservationists who fear that the technology could make people less concerned about humanity's impact on species they are driving to the brink.\n\nRonald Sandler said he's excited about what Colossal's dire wolf project means for science. But the risk, he said, is that it could create a distraction that dissuades people addressing the root causes of why species go extinct in the first place, such as habitat degradation, pollution, overfishing and climate change.\n\nHe views de-extinction as a new tool conservationists might be able to use to help ecosystems – not the end-all-be-all of the profession.\n\nGreely agreed.\n\n\"It's hard to save endangered species, but it's going to be a lot harder to de-extinct them,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/world/tasmanian-tiger-thylacine-deextinction-scn/index.html", "title": "Scientists plan the resurrection of an animal that's been extinct since ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAlmost 100 years after its extinction, the Tasmanian tiger may live once again. Scientists want to resurrect the striped carnivorous marsupial, officially known as a thylacine, which used to roam the Australian bush.\n\nThe ambitious project will harness advances in genetics, ancient DNA retrieval and artificial reproduction to bring back the animal.\n\n“We would strongly advocate that first and foremost we need to protect our biodiversity from further extinctions, but unfortunately we are not seeing a slowing down in species loss,” said Andrew Pask, a professor at the University of Melbourne and head of its Thylacine Integrated Genetic Restoration Research Lab, who is leading the initiative.\n\n“This technology offers a chance to correct this and could be applied in exceptional circumstances where cornerstone species have been lost,” he added.\n\nThe project is a collaboration with Colossal Biosciences, founded by tech entrepreneur Ben Lamm and Harvard Medical School geneticist George Church, who are working on an equally ambitious, if not bolder, $15 million project to bring back the woolly mammoth in an altered form.\n\nAbout the size of a coyote, the thylacine disappeared about 2,000 years ago virtually everywhere except the Australian island of Tasmania. As the only marsupial apex predator that lived in modern times, it played a key role in its ecosystem, but that also made it unpopular with humans.\n\nEuropean settlers on the island in the 1800s blamed thylacines for livestock losses (although, in most cases, feral dogs and human habitat mismanagement were actually the culprits), and they hunted the shy, seminocturnal Tasmanian tigers to the point of extinction.\n\nThe last thylacine living in captivity, named Benjamin, died from exposure in 1936 at the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart, Tasmania. This monumental loss occurred shortly after thylacines had been granted protected status, but it was too late to save the species.\n\nGenetic blueprint\n\nThe project involves several complicated steps that incorporate cutting-edge science and technology, such as gene editing and building artificial wombs.\n\nFirst, the team will construct a detailed genome of the extinct animal and compare it with that of its closest living relative – a mouse-size carnivorous marsupial called the fat-tailed dunnart – to identify the differences.\n\n“We then take living cells from our dunnart and edit their DNA every place where it differs from the thylacine. We are essentially engineering our dunnart cell to become a Tasmanian tiger cell,” Pask explained.\n\nOnce the team has successfully programmed a cell, Pask said stem cell and reproductive techniques involving dunnarts as surrogates would “turn that cell back into a living animal.”\n\n“Our ultimate goal with this technology is to restore these species to the wild, where they played absolutely essential roles in the ecosystem. So our ultimate hope is that you would be seeing them in the Tasmanian bushland again one day,” he said.\n\nThe fat-tailed dunnart is much smaller than an adult Tasmanian tiger, but Pask said that all marsupials give birth to tiny young, sometimes as small as a grain of rice. This means that even a mouse-size marsupial could serve as a surrogate mother for a much larger adult animal like the thylacine, at least in the early stages.\n\nReintroducing the thylacine to its former habit would have to be done very cautiously, Pask added.\n\n“Any release such as this requires studying the animal and its interaction in the ecosystem over many seasons and in large areas of enclosed land before you would consider a complete rewilding,” he said.\n\nThe team hasn’t set a time line for the project, but Lamm said he thought progress would be quicker than the efforts to bring back the woolly mammoth, noting that elephants take far longer to gestate than dunnarts.\n\nThe techniques could also help living marsupials, such as the Tasmanian devil, avoid the thylacine’s fate as they grapple with intensifying bushfires as a result of the climate crisis.\n\n“The technologies we are developing to de-extinct the thylacine all have immediate conservation benefits – right now – to protect marsupial species. Biobanks of frozen tissue from living marsupial populations have been collected to protect against extinction from fires,” Pask said via email.\n\n“However, we still lack the technology to take that tissue – create marsupial stem cells – and then turn those cells into a living animal. That is the technology we will develop as a part of this project.”\n\nHybrid animals\n\nThe path forward, however, is not cut-and-dried. Tom Gilbert, a professor at the University of Copenhagen’s GLOBE Institute, said there are significant limitations to de-extinction.\n\nRecreating the full genome of a lost animal from DNA contained in old thylacine skeletons is extremely challenging, and thus some genetic information will be missing, explained Gilbert, who is also director of the Danish National Research Foundation’s Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics. He has studied resurrecting the extinct Christmas Island rat, also known as the Maclear’s rat, but isn’t involved in the thylacine project. The team won’t be able to exactly recreate the thylacine but instead will end up creating a hybrid animal, an altered form of thylacine.\n\n“We are unlikely to get the full genome sequence of the extinct species, thus we will never be able to fully recreate the genome of the lost form. There will always be some parts that can’t be changed,” Gilbert said via email.\n\n“They will have to cherry pick what changes to make. And thus the result will be a hybrid.”\n\nIt’s possible, he said, that a genetically imperfect hybrid thylacine could have health problems and might not survive without a lot of help from humans. Other experts question the very concept of spending tens of millions of dollars on de-extinction attempts when so many living animals are on the brink of disappearing.\n\n“To me the real benefit of any de-extinction project such as this is the awesomeness of it. Doing it seems very justified to me simply because it will excite people about science, nature, conservation,” Gilbert said.\n\n“And we sure as hell need that in the wonderful citizens of our world if we are to survive into the future. But … do the stakeholders realize what they will get will not be the thylacine but some imperfect hybrid? What we don’t need is yet more people disappointed (or) feeling cheated by science.”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2022/09/07/extinct-species-resurrection-expert-urges-caution/7893394001/", "title": "'Fairytale science': Rather than reviving an extinct species, stop ...", "text": "I recently became interested in de-extinction science when I saw an article in USA TODAY about a big investment in Australia to bring back the extinct thylacine, often wrongly referred to as \"Tasmanian tigers.\" That led me to reach out to Flinders University's global ecology professor Corey Bradshaw, who has come out against de-extinction efforts.\n\nWhat started out as a lighthearted chat about an extinct tiger that's not really a tiger turned pretty dark, pretty quickly, as Bradshaw began explaining to me what his extinction research shows for the future of mankind and the planet.\n\nBut before you say to yourself, \"I can't hear this today,\" just wait.

Company takes 'big step' in bringing back woolly ...", "text": "Biotech company Colossal, which is attempting to bring back the woolly mammoth, has reached a milestone − and a very cute one at that: the woolly mouse.\n\nThe Colossal Woolly Mouse, born in October 2024, was genetically engineered to have characteristics that could eventually be used in creating a next-generation woolly mammoth embryo to be born by a female elephant. The goal of Colossal's biotech and genetic engineering teams is to recreate a mammoth capable of surviving in the Arctic and helping restore the region's ecosystem.\n\n\"But testing that hypothesis on an elephant isn't possible because elephants have a 22-month gestation period, so it would take a really long time, and it's also not particularly ethical,\" Beth Shapiro, chief science officer at Colossal, told USA TODAY.\n\nEnter the mouse, which has been a laboratory mainstay for more than a century. Mice and humans share about 80% of the same genes, according to the Understanding Animal Research website, and laboratory mice are also good scientific subjects because of their short lifespan (about 2 years) and gestation period (19-21 days).\n\nScientists at Colossal analyzed research linked to mice and cross-referenced specific genes with those found in mammoth DNA. They found seven genes, which were modified in the laboratory mice, to achieve mice with \"dramatically altered coat color, texture, and thickness reminiscent of the woolly mammoth’s core phenotypes\" or characteristics, the company said in a press release.\n\n\"What we found is in 23 days, versus 22 months, it worked,\" Ben Lamm, co-founder and CEO of Colossal, told USA TODAY. \"This is a very, very big step for us because it proves that all of the work we've been doing for the last three years on the woolly mammoth is exactly what we predicted.\"\n\n'Much cuter than we thought'\n\nThe genetically engineered mice had curled whiskers with wavy, lighter-colored hair that may grow as much as three times longer, and have a rough, woolly texture. The mice also may look more full-bodied because another altered gene leads to changes in body weight in mammoths.\n\nAn unintended consequence? \"They are much cuter than we thought they would be,\" Lamm said. \"We've been asked, 'are you going to sell them? Are you going to breed them?' And the answers are no. ...I am happy to report they are all very very healthy.\"\n\nThe next step: Seeing if the mice can handle cold better than standard mice. If so, those genes would be proven helpful in the woolly mammoth's return. Colossal is consulting with its ethics board and will follow The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols in future tests, Lamm said.\n\nScientists are interested, he said, in whether \"they behave better under cold tolerant temperatures? Are they faster, Are they slower? How does that change? Do they put on weight and fat?\"\n\nWhere did Colossal get mammoth DNA?\n\nLamm, a technology and software entrepreneur, and George Church, a biologist at Harvard Medical School, founded Colossal Laboratories & Biosciences in 2021 to “rapidly advance the field of species de-extinction,” the company said at the time.\n\nThe return of mammoths could revitalize Arctic grasslands, which could have “major climate change-combatting properties including carbon sequestering, methane suppression and light reflection,\" the company said.\n\nColossal scientists have done a computational analysis of the ancient genetic makeup of 59 woolly, Columbian, and steppe mammoths, ranging from 3,500 to over 1,200,000 years old. That work helped identify crucial genetic targets for creating a next-generation woolly mammoth – actually a \"cold-resistant elephant with all of the core biological traits of the woolly mammoth,\" the company says on its website.\n\n\"It will walk like a woolly mammoth, look like one, sound like one, but most importantly it will be able to inhabit the same ecosystem previously abandoned by the Mammoth’s extinction,\" Colossal says.\n\nColossal has said it hopes to have its first woolly mammoth calves by 2028.\n\nBringing back the woolly mammoth: Is it worth it?\n\nThe goal of de-extinction is not without its critics. \"We need to think about the harm that could occur as well: the suffering of elephant egg donors and surrogate mothers and cloned mammoths with anatomical defects,\" wrote Emma Marris, an author who writes about science, and Yasha Rohwer, assistant professor of philosophy at the Oregon Institute of Technology, on the Center for Humans and Nature website.\n\n\"Also we must consider the sufferings of the first mammoth, who, as a social animal, will most likely be pained to live in a world without other mammoths,\" they wrote.\n\nA healthy animal is not 100% guaranteed, agrees Christopher Preston, a professor of environmental philosophy at the University of Montana and author of \"Tenacious Beasts: Wildlife Recoveries that Change How We Think about Animals.\"\n\nBeyond that, the resulting animal will not truly be a woolly mammoth. \"So what we are going to bring back is an adapted relative, so an Asian elephant, basically, that has more hair or cold tolerance genes or something like that,\" Preston told USA TODAY.\n\n\"I really think highly of the scientists,\" he said. \"They are good people doing good work, but I think the story just needs to be a little less sensational and they need to be a little more upfront about what they are actually doing.\"\n\nColossal also working to bring back Tasmanian tigers, dodos\n\nBack in October 2024, Colossal said it had assembled the most complete Tasmanian tiger genome, a major step toward bringing back the Australian thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) from extinction. The team hopes to eventually reestablish the Tasmanian tiger on the island of Tasmania off the southeast tip of Australia.\n\nColossal is also making progress on another project, announced in 2023, to bring back the dodo. The company's Avian Genomics Group is close to achieving primordial germ cells in pigeons, which would allow genetic testing of dodo characteristics in pigeons – similar to the mouse-mammoth experiments.\n\nThe ability to provide \"genetic rescue\" to birds, could eventually allow for genetic engineering of bird flu-resistant chickens and other birds, Shapiro said.\n\nWhile Colossal is focused on the \"de-extinction\" of species, its research breakthroughs could help secure biodiversity, she said. \"We as a society should really be thinking about increasing the tools we have at our disposal to help species survive whatever is going to happen in their habitats,\" Shapiro said.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta and Marina Pitofsky\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Threads, Bluesky and X:mikegsnider & @mikegsnider.bsky.social & @mikesnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Today the Revive and Restore project is working to bring them back from the dead. They've also got their eyes on woolly mammoths. Other groups are pondering reviving everything from Tasmanian tigers to the dodo.\n\nThey're part of a growing movement among scientists, naturalists and visionaries working to bring back species that humans killed off over the past several thousands years. They call it de-extinctioning.\n\nEthicists, scientists, lawyers and biologists gathered at Stanford University Friday for a day-long conference to discuss a broader question: Even if we can, should we?\n\nThere are three ways scientists can bring back extinct species, said Beth Shapiro, who directs the paleogenomics lab at the University of California-Santa Cruz.\n\n• Back breeding. An example is efforts to recreate the auroch, a European cattle ancestor that died off in Poland in 1627. By choosing cattle with characteristics close to what aurochs looked like, the TaurOs Project in Holland is aiming to breed auroch-like cattle.\n\n• Cloning. DNA taken from the frozen cells of recently extinct animals is used to create embryos that are then brought to term in a surrogate mother. That was actually accomplished in 2009. Spanish scientists used preserved skin samples from the Pyrenean ibex, a wild mountain goat that went extinct in 2000, to create an embryo that was brought to term in a goat surrogate mother. Unfortunately, the newborn ibex kid only lived a few minutes before it died because of lung defects.\n\n• Genomic editing. This uses preserved pieces of ancient DNA to make an educated guess about the genome of an extinct species. For example DNA from a frozen wooly mammoth found in the arctic could be sequenced. It wouldn't be complete because of degradation over time but the missing pieces could be filled in with elephant DNA. The basic technology is already commonly used in synthetic biology labs.\n\nOne animal species that won't be de-extinctioned is dinosaurs. \"Jurassic Park will not happen,\" Shapiro said firmly. \"Fossils are too old, there's no DNA left.\"\n\nThe topic has become hot over the past year and a half. There was a conference on the passenger pigeon at Harvard in February 2012. The National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C., held a small meeting of relevant scientists, mostly conservation and molecular biologists, in October 2012.\n\nIn March, National Geographic held a much larger TEDx conference on de-extinctioning \"when it all went public\" said Stewart Brand, who is spearheading the Revive and Restore project to bring back the passenger pigeon. The Stanford conference, focused on the ethical and legal issues, is the fourth, said Hank Greely, director of the Stanford Center for Law and the Biosciences and its organizer.\n\nThe de-extinction process isn't benign, said Matthew Liebman, an attorney with the Animal Legal Defense Fund of Cotati, Calif. Animals must be hormonally altered to produce extra eggs, the pregnancies are dangerous for the surrogate mothers and the clones themselves often die very quickly, he said. In the case of the Spanish ibex, the kid \"lived for only 10 to 12 minutes before dying and the entirety of her existence outside the womb was in intense respiratory distress,\" he said.\n\nEven so, there aren't laws that would stop it, Shapiro said. Although state animal cruelty laws prohibit unjustifiable animal suffering, most exempt biomedical research, \"so I don't think it's likely we'll see criminal prosecution of de-extinction researchers.\"\n\nThe legal issues that will surround revived species are very unclear, said Andrew Torrance, a law professor at the University of Kansas and former biotech patent lawyer. But in general, he thinks \"there are no solid legal barriers yet to de-extinction.\"\n\nOne question raised by several audience members at the forum was why extinct species should be brought back at all. Brand spoke up. \"Because we don't want to be party to death that large. When something goes extinct, it hits us in the marrow.\"\n\nSome say a better use for all this money, time and expertise would be to use the same techniques and technologies towards creating greater genetic diversity through cloning and other programs. Species that are down to just a few individuals and need help include the Chinese giant salamander, the Javan rhino or the kakapo owl parrot of New Zealand, said Kate Jones, chair of ecology and biodiversity at the University College London.\n\nBiologists worry that de-extinctioning is dangerous because it could make people think extinction isn't forever, said Terry Root, a senior fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University. \"People are concerned that if the idea is out there that we can bring them back, we may not work so hard to preserve the species we have.\"\n\nThe prospect of reviving extinct species strikes fear in the heart of Jamie Rappaport Clark, president of the non-profit Defenders of Wildlife. After 20 years working for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, she's seen how little political will there is to protect endangered species. De-extinctioning could \"tip the balance to allowing habitat destruction while the economy is in trouble\" and let politicians say they'll bring any species that might die out back later when times are better, she said.\n\nEven so, she's convinced that it's too late to put this particular genie back in the bottle, she said. Already a group in Australia has revived the gastric-brooding frog, which died out in 1983. This year the Lazarus Project, a group working with Mike Archer at the University of New South Wales in Australia, announced that it had created embryos of the extinct frog using tissue collected in the 1970s.\n\nChuck Bonham, the director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife in Sacramento, is convinced it's going to happen, so \"we need to start figuring it out how to regulate it now.\" He spoke as an individual, not as a government employee, but asked the assembled scientists and visionaries to start talking to regulators now. \"We need to be careful. We need to make sure we get this right because if we get it wrong it could be very bad.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/28/tasmanian-tiger-extinct-rna/70979669007/", "title": "Extinct Tasmanian tiger's RNA recovered: Can it be resurrected?", "text": "Tasmanian tigers were hunted to extinction decades ago, but a recent scientific breakthrough has raised hope that the animal and potentially other long-lost species could one day be resurrected.\n\nScientists were recently able to recover and sequence RNA from a roughly 130-year-old Tasmanian tiger, also known as a thylacine, preserved at a museum in Stockholm. The feat marks the first time RNA molecules have been isolated and decoded from an extinct species, according to a new study published Tuesday in the journal Genome Research.\n\nIt may sound like a plot right out of a Jurassic Park movie, but the implications of the study are no mere fiction: Scientists are now one step closer to reviving not only the Tasmanian tiger, but perhaps other extinct species in the future.\n\nRecord-setting trip to space: Astronaut Frank Rubio spent a record 371 days in space.

The animals preyed upon kangaroos and other marsupials, as well as small rodents and birds.\n\nBut the predators were no match for humans, as European colonizers began hunting the species in the late 19th century to eventual extinction to prevent the animals from killing off livestock, according to the Australian Museum.\n\nA brief clip unearthed and digitized in 2020 shows what is believed to be the last remaining Tasmanian tiger living in captivity recorded in 1935. Released by Australia's National Film and Sound Archive, the footage shows a tiger named Benjamin roaming an enclosure in a now-closed zoo about a year before his death.\n\nThough eight sightings of the extinct marsupial have been reported to the Tasmanian government in recent years, none of them have been authenticated and verified.\n\nHow scientists hope to resurrect the long lost species\n\nThe concept of de-extinction isn't reserved solely for the realm of science fiction series like Jurassic Park.\n\nThough not the goal of the recent study, researchers said that a better understanding of the Tasmanian tiger's genetic makeup could pave the way to bring it back.\n\nThat's where ribonucleic acid (RNA) comes into play.\n\nStructurally similar to DNA, the genetic material is present in all living cells and is used to convey information from the genome to the rest of the cell about what it should do. In other words, the RNA molecules are responsible for turning DNA’s genetic instructions into cellular function.\n\nThe Tasmanian tiger specimen that researchers chose to examine had been preserved at room temperature at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. After taking three skeletal muscle samples and three skin tissue samples, the team successfully extracted millions of strands of RNA.\n\nBy studying the strands, researchers stand to learn more about the biology of the extinct species.\n\nWhat extinct species have scientists tried to bring back?\n\nThis is not the first time that scientists have expressed hope that the Tasmanian tiger and other species once thought lost forever could be resurrected.\n\nIn 2021, Colossal Laboratories and Biosciences launched with the express purpose of using gene editing to resurrect none other than the famed woolly mammoth. The research set out to reprogram elephant DNA with mammoth characteristics, like thick hair and layers of fat, to help the hybrid animals survive in the Siberian tundra.\n\nIt wasn't just for vanity that the Colossal team hoped to revive the ancient behemoth: Researchers believed that if the mammoths could be created, they could revitalize grasslands in the Arctic.\n\nSince then, the genetic engineering company has also revealed intentions to research ways to resurrect the dodo and yes, even the Tasmanian tiger. Using gene editing technology on a tiger genome to create an embryo, the team hopes to eventually reestablish the Tasmanian tiger on the island of Tasmania.\n\n“I now believe that in ten years’ time we could have our first living baby thylacine since they were hunted to extinction close to a century ago,\" Prof. Andrew Pask, who oversees the TIGRR Lab, said last year in a description of the project on the university's website.\n\nResearchers at the University of Copenhagen and Shantou University in China also revealed plans last year to resurrect a smaller mammal, the Christmas Island rat.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Its massive size, combined with the metabolic cost of maintaing a high body temperature, “may have contributed to the vulnerability of Otodus species to extinction”, the scientists from UCLA, UC Merced, and William Paterson University said in PNAS.\n\nThis information contrasts with a backdrop of an increasingly widespread social media myth that megalodon survives to this day.\n\nWhat is the megalodon?\n\nMegalodon is believed to be the biggest member of a giant shark species (Otodontidae) “as well as the largest fish that ever lived”, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Fossil remains, mainly of its teeth, have been found along the coastlines and shelf regions “of all continents except Antarctica”.\n\nMegalodons “were faster than any shark alive today and big enough to eat an orca in just five bites”, said CNN. They are believed to have resembled great white sharks, but up to an estimated 50 to 60 feet long.\n\nMegalodon dominated the food chain in the ancient seas from about 23 million years ago (the early Miocene Epoch), hunting massive whales, orcas and seals, until its sudden disappearance at the start of the Pliocene Epoch about 3.6 million years ago.\n\nWhy is everyone talking about it?\n\nIn June, a diver off the coast of Florida found a fully intact megalodon tooth measuring more than six inches long, “adding to the ongoing fascination surrounding this ancient marine giant”, said the Daily Mirror, and fuelling the “rampant…theories circulating on social media” about whether megalodon still exists.\n\nAlso this month, a necklace made of a megalodon tooth was found in the Titanic wreckage.\n\nA fascination with surviving massive species combined with the unexplored mystery of most oceans has led to a social media obsession.\n\nThe megalodon hashtag has more than 3.4 billion views on TikTok. In 2021, musician Alex Albrecht posted a video on the platform of a massive shark, probably a basking shark, circling a cruise ship in the Atlantic Ocean. It has attracted a gargantuan 70.5 million views, with many commentators asking, “Is that megalodon?”\n\nYouTube is also awash with videos speculating on how they might have survived, as well as explainers debunking the theories.\n\nCould megalodon have survived?\n\nThe resaon for the sudden disappearance of such a perfect predator had previously “confounded paleontologists”, said National Geographic. Although sustaining a gigantic body would require a vast amount of energy, prehistoric oceans teemed with prey.\n\nHowever, the megalodon’s warmer body temperature may provide the answer.\n\nWarm-bloodedness is rare in sharks, with just five out of 500 modern species boasting “regionally endothermic” capabilities, according to New Scientist, heating only certain parts of the body.\n\nMegalodon belonged to a group called mackerel sharks, which keep their body temperature “somewhat warmer than the water around them”, said The Daily Telegraph, “but megalodon is an extreme example”.\n\nThis trait allowed it to “swim faster and travel farther than other predators”, said National Geographic, “pursuing whales and other blubber-rich prey into cool waters where cold-blooded hunters couldn’t venture”, eventually causing it to reach its massive size.\n\nBut around the time megalodon disappeared, the oceans were changing. Sea levels rapidly fell during the Pliocene period, affecting coastal marine habitats – and depleting food sources for larger prey like baleen whales. A decrease in the giant shark’s prey, combined with the rise of competing smaller species like great white sharks, meant that megalodon “suddenly found itself backed into an evolutionary corner”.\n\n“Any suggestion that megalodon potentially still exists in unexplored ocean regions is complete nonsense based on not a shred of credible evidence,” doctoral student and megalodon specialist Jack Cooper, of Swansea University, told Live Science.\n\nNot only would microscopic deep sea life be insufficient to satisfy the hungry giant, but such an apex predator would have an enormous – and noticeable – impact on marine life, he said.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Becca Stanek", "Devika Rao", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/28"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/environment/956056/octoculture-world-first-octopus-farm-controversial", "title": "Octoculture: why is the world's first octopus farm so controversial ...", "text": "Octopus is eaten as a delicacy, mainly in the Mediterranean, the US and Asia.

In the Mediterranean, recent studies suggest that stocks are in a critical condition.\n\nBut now the Spanish company Nueva Pescanova is opening the world’s first commercial octopus farm at an inland site at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.

The main one is sustaining its delicate larvae, which only eat live food and need a carefully controlled environment. As a result, “octoculture” has hitherto mostly involved “ranching”: growing wild-caught octopuses to market size in aquatic pens.\n\nPhysically, they aren’t well suited to being kept in confined spaces. Their boneless, eight-legged bodies have no fixed shape: the largest species, the Giant Pacific, can reach an arm span of six metres and a weight of 100 pounds, but can fit through openings an inch wide. Some have been known to lift their aquarium tank lids to escape, in some cases travelling over dry floors to the nearest drain.\n\nNueva Pescanova now thinks it has won the race to overcome these problems – beating competitors in Australia, Mexico and Japan. However, the firm’s plans have met with fierce resistance from campaigners and scientists.\n\nWhat are the objections?\n\nMany cite long-standing criticisms of factory farming and aquaculture: the stress and monotony of confinement; the high disease and mortality rates; the excessive use of antibiotics and pesticides.\n\nHowever, many concerns focus specifically on the octopuses themselves – which are “particularly ill-suited to a life in captivity and mass-production, for reasons both ethical and ecological”, according to “The Case Against Octopus Farming”, a much-cited 2019 paper in the journal Issues in Science and Technology.\n\nThe creatures consume about three times their weight in food a day, and are fed on mussels, prawns, crab and fish which could less wastefully be eaten by humans. They are highly territorial and anti-social by nature: they live in solitary dens, eat rival octopuses, and even mate from a distance (males extend a single arm with a sperm packet towards females). But perhaps the biggest criticism of farming them centres on their unique brains.\n\nWhat’s unusual about their brains?\n\nThere is no clear distinction between the octopus’s brain and its body. They have half a billion neurons – about as many as a dog (humans have one hundred billion) – two-thirds of which are in their arms. Each arm can intelligently act on its own, is capable of taste and smell, and exhibits short-term memory. Even a surgically detached arm can reach and grasp, avoid painful stimuli and, like fully formed octopuses, change colour; yet the central brain retains executive control of the arms.\n\nLast year, a UK government-commissioned review by the London School of Economics concluded that octopuses and squid are fully sentient, like vertebrates – i.e. they have the capacity to have feelings, such as pleasure, pain, distress or harm. The new Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill reflects this. The review also suggested a pre-emptive ban on farming octopus.\n\nHow intelligent are octopuses?\n\nThey’re amazingly bright: in the lab, they’ve been shown to be able to navigate mazes and unscrew jars and child-proof bottles to get food. They can solve problems, learn, use tools, and even show a capacity for mimicry, deception and – possibly – humour.\n\nOne study showed that once they’ve solved a novel problem – unscrewing a jar, say – they can retain a memory of the solution for at least five months. Research has also shown they can recognise individual humans and will respond differently to different people, greeting some with a caress of the arms, and spraying others with ink through their siphons.\n\nWhat do advocates of farming say?\n\nThey point to soaring demand: between 2010 and 2019, the global trade rose in value from $1.30bn to $2.72bn – though landings only rose by 9% in that time. “If we want to continue consuming octopus we have to look for an alternative... because fisheries have already reached their limit,” said Eduardo Almansa of Spain’s Oceanography Institute, which developed technology used by Nueva Pescanova.\n\nAnd octopuses do have some characteristics that make them attractive for aquaculture: their lifespans are short (usually one or two years), and they grow quickly.\n\nWhat’s the likely upshot?\n\nPlans for the farm are going ahead, but activists are pushing hard against it. “These animals are amazing,” said Dr Elena Lara of Compassion in World Farming. “So to put them in barren tanks... it’s wrong for them.” Popular awareness of octopuses’ intelligence and curiosity has been raised thanks to documentaries such as My Octopus Teacher.\n\n“People have this weird love affair with octopuses,” says biologist Rich Ross at the California Academy of Sciences, in San Francisco, who suggests double standards are at work. “I know those who would never eat them but have no qualms about eating pigs, and there’s abundant evidence that pigs are highly intelligent.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/11"}]}

Some are strategic and could impact the future course of the war and so-far elusive hopes for a ceasefire. Others are political and relate to Biden’s standing at home, amid a torrent of Republican criticism, and internationally, as he seeks to keep the Western coalition together.\n\nThey include:\n\nDid the President’s comment dangerously escalate already high tensions in the worst confrontation between the West and Russia in decades?\n\nHas Biden shaken international confidence in his so-far strong leadership in bringing the NATO alliance together in a united front against Moscow? And will Putin be able to exploit disquiet over Biden’s comments in European capitals?\n\nWill the notion that Biden hopes to topple Putin – even if the US says it’s not true – harden the embattled Russian leader’s resolve against negotiations or cause him to further escalate an already merciless war against civilians?\n\nHas Biden’s now stinging rhetoric about Putin effectively ruled out any future direct diplomacy or meetings between the world’s top nuclear powers – and could it endanger global peace if they can’t communicate in a future crisis that threatens humanity?\n\nOr will Biden’s human reaction to spending time with Ukrainian refugees soon be overtaken by the daily unfolding horror of the war or come to be seen as a strong moral stand that changed the way the world views the Russian leader? After all, ex-President Ronald Reagan’s call for then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall” in Berlin was initially opposed by some of his own aides as too provocative.\n\nAnd finally, since Moscow already sees extraordinarily tough Western sanctions as economic warfare and given Putin’s deeply conspiratorial view of the West and its role in vanquishing the Soviet Union, can a few loose presidential words that rile up everyone in Washington really make things any worse?\n\nA quick clean-up effort\n\nIt was clear from the speed with which administration officials worked to clarify Biden’s remark that they knew it could be a big problem that could potentially make an already fraught European geopolitical showdown much worse.\n\nIn a jab not in his scripted remarks, Biden said, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power” in a reference to Putin. A White House official said Biden meant that “Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region” and said Biden wasn’t referring to regime change. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was even more categorical during a trip to Jerusalem on Sunday.\n\n“We do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia, or anywhere else for that matter,” Blinken said. “In this case, as it is in any case, it’s up to the people of the country in question. It is up to the Russian people.”\n\nThe clean-up language was hardly convincing given the clear context of the original quote. But a remark with such implications in a time of high tensions clearly needed walking back. And quickly.\n\nAny idea that the US saw the conflict as an attempt to unseat Putin would be dangerous since it would elevate the clash to a direct confrontation between the United States and Russia.\n\nBiden has scrupulously tried to avoid that scenario – notably blocking a Polish plan to send Soviet-made fighter jets to Ukraine to avoid the impression that NATO is taking a more direct role in the war. The situation is already on a knife-edge since huge Western shipments of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles are fueling Ukraine’s strong resistance and apparently causing heavy Russian casualties.\n\nA propaganda present for Putin\n\nThere’s no doubt that Biden handed Putin a propaganda gift that could undermine the US President’s own hard work in keeping the focus on Ukraine. Moscow’s information complex is certain to present the war to the Russian people as a hostile push by the West in order to further obscure the truth about the unprovoked attack on Ukraine. This could ease the political pressure the West hopes will be built by harsh sanctions designed to change Putin’s calculation.\n\nBut Biden’s initial efforts to avoid personalizing the conflict with Putin and characterizing the war as a direct US-Russia showdown have been undermined by his own hardening rhetoric toward the Russian leader in recent days. He made it known earlier this month that he believes that Putin is a war criminal after relentless attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians that triggered a massive refugee exodus.\n\nBiden’s comment about the Russian leader’s tenure on power was not the only striking rhetoric of his tour. After meeting refugees on Saturday, Biden called Putin a “butcher.” Previously, Biden had called him a “thug” and a “murderous dictator.” And the script from which he departed to make the now notorious remark was in itself hawkish, previewing what Biden said was a long struggle, which sounded a lot like a new Cold War.\n\nGiven that Biden is likely feeling the burden of world peace on his shoulders and acute empathy for those visited by unspeakable tragedy in Ukraine, his outbursts on his European trip may be understandable as a human reaction to great suffering.\n\n“He went to the National Stadium in Warsaw and literally met with hundreds of Ukrainians,” US ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“In the moment, I think that was a principled human reaction to the stories that he had heard that day,” Smith said, underscoring again that the US didn’t have a policy of regime change in Russia.\n\nBut a President’s words must also be carefully chosen. As Saturday’s drama showed, it takes just a moment to cause a dangerous diplomatic crisis.\n\nRepublicans plead with Biden to keep to the script\n\nBiden was largely successful in reversing his propensity for gaffes during his 2020 election bid, during a campaign robbed of spontaneous moments by the Covid-19 pandemic. It was unfortunate that his old habits of speaking his mind at inopportune moments resurfaced now.\n\nRepublicans seized on the President’s frank comments on Sunday, seeking to dent an impression that Biden has responded well to Putin’s provocations so far in the Ukraine crisis. Clearly, they didn’t just have national security in mind but also politics ahead of the midterm elections, which are being shaped by the President’s diminished approval ratings. And in some of the criticism there was a sense Republicans were playing into the conservative media trope that Biden is old, is not in full control and could blunder the US into a war. Such a position conveniently forgets the tolerance of right-wing opinion hosts towards ex-President Donald Trump’s volcanic rhetoric, but it has power in the GOP grassroots.\n\nSpeaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Idaho Sen Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, appeared both to be underlining the administration’s message about being opposed to regime change in Moscow while also finding a way to hammer Biden’s capacity to lead.\n\nWhile praising Biden’s speech in Poland, the Idaho Republican said, “There was a horrendous gaffe right at the end of it. I just wish he would stay on script.”\n\n“This administration has done everything they can to stop escalating,” Risch said. But he added: “There’s not a whole lot more you can do to escalate than to call for regime change.”\n\nOhio Republican Sen. Rob Portman was slightly more temperate but no less critical.\n\n“First, I think all of us believe the world would be a better place without Vladimir Putin. But second, that’s not the official US policy. And by saying that, that regime change is our strategy, effectively, it plays into the hands of the Russian propagandists and plays into the hands of Vladimir Putin,” Portman said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nBiden’s comments sent shockwaves through Europe as well as Washington. And they appeared to irritate French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been a key figure in trying, with little success, to get Putin to agree to a ceasefire.\n\n“I wouldn’t use terms like that because I’m still in talks with President Putin,” Macron told the France 3 television channel, when asked about Biden’s comment that the Russian leader was a “butcher.”\n\nAny future ceasefire deal Putin agrees to is unlikely to emerge from US diplomacy given the deep and mutual hostility between Moscow and Washington.\n\nBut any final agreement – and indeed the long-term goal of preventing dangerous escalations between the world’s top two nuclear powers – depends on them talking to one another. It was already hard to see how Biden could meet a Russian leader whom he has branded a war criminal. This weekend’s events made that even more difficult. And while the US goal in Moscow is not regime change, it’s hard to see any meaningful dialogue while Putin is still in charge.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/business/jamie-dimon-annual-letter-economy/index.html", "title": "Jamie Dimon: The war in Ukraine will slow the economy and it could ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nJamie Dimon is worried about the powerful shockwaves set off by the combination of high inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDimon, one of the world’s most influential business leaders, warned Monday in his annual shareholder letter that the conflict poses a significant threat to the economic recovery that began less than two years ago. And yet he called for the United States to crank up sanctions pressure on Russia.\n\n“The war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia, at a minimum, will slow the global economy — and it could easily get worse,” the JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO wrote in the letter.\n\nThe conflict has already set off severe turbulence in energy, agricultural and other commodity markets.\n\nJPMorgan, like other major banks, has downgraded its growth forecasts for the United States, Europe and, of course, Russia. Dimon recalled how the 1973 oil embargo sent oil prices skyrocketing, pushing the world into a recession.\n\n“Many more sanctions could be added — which could dramatically, and unpredictably, increase their effect,” he wrote.\n\nDimon said the stimulus-driven recovery from Covid-19, the need to rapidly raise interest rates to fight inflation and the war in Ukraine represent a unique set of challenges.\n\n“They present completely different circumstances than what we’ve experienced in the past — and their confluence may dramatically increase the risks ahead,” he said. “While it is possible, and hopeful, that all of these events will have peaceful resolutions, we should prepare for the potential negative outcomes.”\n\nUniting against ‘all forms of evil’\n\nThe war in Ukraine poses a test to the role of America on the world stage and western ideals, too.\n\n“America must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes,” Dimon said. “We should prepare for the worst and hope for the best. We must look at this as a wake-up call.”\n\nThe JPMorgan boss cheered the “coalescing” of the Western world, across Europe, NATO countries, Australia, Japan and Korea, in support of Ukraine and called for even closer ties.\n\n“We need to make this a permanent, long-lasting stand for democratic ideals against all forms of evil,” Dimon said.\n\nTo make that stand, Dimon urged the United States to “immediately” take several steps, including boosting its military budget and troop deployment on NATO’s borders, directing billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, helping Europe with the refugee crisis and adding new sanctions on Russia.\n\n“Turn up sanctions — there are many more that could be imposed — in whatever way national security experts recommend to maximize the right outcomes,” he wrote.\n\nAlthough Dimon didn’t back specific sanctions, he did stress that solutions must be bipartisan “because we know only bipartisan solutions stand on firm ground.” He suggested bipartisanship could begin by appointing a Republican to the Biden cabinet.\n\n“Our solutions should acknowledge that we are essentially, and unfortunately, reverting to some Cold War strategies,” Dimon said.\n\nThe Fed has to get it ‘just right’\n\nThe economic challenge is magnified by the fact that the war is adding pressure to stressed-out supply chains and driving up costs for food and energy at a time when inflation is already very high.\n\nTo fight inflation, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, perhaps rapidly. And that will make things tricky for both the economy and markets.\n\n“I do not envy the Fed for what it must do next: The stronger the recovery, the higher the rates that follow (I believe that this could be significantly higher than the markets expect),” Dimon said, adding that rates will need to go up “substantially” and this will be a “hard job.”\n\nYet the harder the Fed hits the brakes by raising rates, the greater the risk of an accident in the economy, markets — or both.\n\n‘Very volatile markets’ are coming\n\nDimon struck a cautious tone on whether the Fed can achieve a so-called soft landing: taming inflation without tanking the recovery. He said if the Fed gets it “just right,” the economy can enjoy years of growth and inflation will “eventually start to recede.”\n\nEither way, Dimon said, investors should buckle up.\n\n“In any event, this process will cause lots of consternation and very volatile markets,” he wrote.\n\nAlready, markets have experienced wild swings, highlighted by the Nasdaq recently plunging into a bear market.\n\nBut Dimon, the most powerful leader on Wall Street, urged the Fed not to overreact to what’s happening on markets.\n\n“The Fed should not worry about volatile markets unless they affect the actual economy,” he said. “A strong economy trumps market volatility.”\n\nIn other words, do what you think is right, even if that means a bear market in US stocks.\n\nDid Washington overdo stimulus?\n\nRecession concerns are somewhat surprising because the US economy is enjoying such a robust rebound from Covid.\n\nDimon hailed the “strong US economy, which, we hope, has Covid-19 in its rearview mirror.”\n\nThen again, if anything the concern is that the economy is so hot that it’s overheating. And Washington’s unprecedented response, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, to Covid-19 played a role in the strength of the recovery.\n\nDimon said the Fed and government “did the right thing” by resorting to bold actions in response to the pandemic, including the central bank’s purchasing of trillions of dollars of bonds through a program known as Quantitative Easing, or QE.\n\n“But also in hindsight, the medicine (fiscal spending and QE) was probably too much and lasted too long,” Dimon said, adding that it’s easy to second-guess complex decisions after the fact.\n\nA Marshall Plan for energy\n\nLooking ahead, Dimon reiterated his private call to President Joe Biden that the United States needs to come up with a “Marshall Plan” to promote energy security for America and European allies.\n\nDimon said that plan entails securing the necessary energy supplies now for the next few years, while still reducing emissions and fighting climate change.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, along with Covid-19, have exposed glaring weaknesses in the supply chains that underpin the world economy.\n\nDimon said there is “no question” supply chains need to be restructured, in part to make sure America’s enemies can’t take advantage of them in a crisis.\n\n“For any products or materials that are essential for national security (think rare earths, 5G and semiconductors), the US supply chain must either be domestic or open only to completely friendly allies,” Dimon wrote.\n\n“We cannot and should not ever be reliant on processes that can and will be used against us,” Dimon said, “especially when we are most vulnerable.”", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/06/trump-deportation-immigration/76088969007/", "title": "Mass deportations: What Trump has said he'll do in his 2nd term", "text": "Former President Donald Trump's comeback victory and potential control of Congress may put him in the position to deliver on a campaign pledge to conduct a \"mass deportation\" of millions of immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization.\n\nTrump's first term as president was punctuated by anti-immigrant rhetoric and legal maneuvers to crack down on immigration. A similar promise made in his first administration to deport people at a large scale didn't happen because of legal obstacles. Experts say this time could be different.\n\nTrump and the Republican Party in its platform said as president this time he would usher in the \"largest deportation program in American history.\"\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump and his surrogates amplified examples of undocumented immigrants accused of committing violent crimes, and promoted widely debunked claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating pets.\n\n\"We're going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country and we're going to start with Springfield and Aurora,\" Trump said at a news conference earlier this year. Many immigrants in Springfield have temporary legal status, but Trump has promised to revoke their permission to stay in the country.\n\nHere's what we know about the president-elect's deportation plans:\n\nWhat has Trump said about mass deportation?\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump did not release detailed plans on how he would deport the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. But he offered a glimpse into what he might do in campaign speeches and in comments made by his advisers.\n\n“President Trump will restore his effective immigration policies, implement brand new crackdowns that will send shockwaves to all the world’s criminal smugglers, and marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers in American history,” Trump's national campaign press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said.\n\nFormer administration officials have told USA TODAY that a mass deportation effort would need to include the help of the U.S. military, local governments and private companies that contract with the government.\n\nA USA TODAY review last month found options available to Trump may include emergency and executive powers to bypass existing protections for immigrants; activation of provisions once used to detain people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War II; the use of local and state police agencies to find and arrest undocumented immigrants; deployment of military and National Guard members; and the redirection of federal employees and resources.\n\n“If I thought things were getting out of control, I would have no problem using the military,” he said in an interview with TIME earlier this year.\n\nTrump's campaign website also said he would \"deport pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again.\"\n\nThough a scale-up of deportation actions would surely meet resistance in the courts from immigration and civil rights advocacy groups, Trump could face fewer legal obstacles than he did in his first term. He appointed hundreds of judges to courts that previously hindered his attempts.\n\nHow much could it cost?\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance has estimated Trump's actions could result in 1 million people being removed from the country each year, a pace the nonpartisan American Immigration Council estimated would cost about $88 billion annually. To deport all the people in the U.S. without authorization would take about a decade and cost nearly a trillion dollars, the council said.\n\nIt could be big business for private companies that contract with the government to help detain migrants. Private contracts already exist for nearly every step of the deportation process, including facilities housing people in detention, transportation – including private flights to deport someone to their home country – and security.\n\nCongress currently funds Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold 41,500 people in detention each day, a number that peaked at about 55,000 during Trump's first term. The American Immigration Council estimates that deporting 1 million people per year would require that capacity to increase by a factor of 24.\n\nBIG BUCKS IN DEPORTATION PLAN: A cost to taxpayers, billions for big business from Trump's deportation promises\n\nContributing: Nick Penzenstadler, Lauren Villagran, Bart Jansen and Aysha Bagchi, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/politics/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war/index.html", "title": "Biden's off-the-cuff remark on Putin sends shock waves on dramatic ...", "text": "Warsaw, Poland CNN —\n\nAt nearly the same moment President Joe Biden declared him a “butcher,” Vladimir Putin’s missiles began falling in Lviv, Ukraine.\n\nSending black smoke and flames billowing into the air, and injuring at least five people, the strikes on a fuel depot pierced what had been relative calm in the western hub city that had seen relatively little of the war that has engulfed the nation.\n\nThe target hardly seemed coincidental. Biden was 250 miles away, visiting Ukrainian refugees in bitter cold at Poland’s national stadium. He heard pleas from young mothers to pray for the men – husbands, fathers, brothers – they had left behind.\n\n“We Ukrainian mothers are ready to strangle (Putin) with our bare hands,” said a woman whose son remained to fight. Gathering up a small girl wearing a pink coat and pigtails, Biden told her he wanted to take her home.\n\nWhen he returned to his hotel, aides briefed Biden on the strikes in Lviv. A few hours later on Saturday, propelled by heartache and anger, Biden walked into the courtyard of an old Polish castle to declare the Russian President “cannot remain in power.”\n\nThe very final words Biden would utter on his last-minute swing through Europe ended up being the most consequential, reverberating widely as Air Force One departed for Washington. They surprised his aides, many of whom spent hours honing the text of a speech viewed by the White House as a significant moment for Biden’s presidency. The line Biden uttered wasn’t in what they wrote.\n\nGathered backstage at the castle, White House officials hastily issued a clarification – one of several on this trip alone – to say Biden wasn’t calling for regime change. But not before the Kremlin issued its own affronted response, saying Russia’s ruler is “not to be decided by Mr. Biden.”\n\nOn Sunday, Biden told reporters he was not calling for regime change in his remarks, responding, “No,” to a question shouted from a reporter as he was leaving church in Washington, DC.\n\nThe administration had continued to downplay the remarks earlier on Sunday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying from Israel, “I think the President, the White House, made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else.”\n\nThe series of events that unfolded here Saturday afternoon placed into sharp relief the highly unsettled atmosphere that pervades Europe as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its second month. A display of aggression from Putin in the borderlands of Ukraine was followed by an offhand yet forcefully delivered suggestion from Biden that Russians find another leader.\n\n“He went to the National Stadium in Warsaw and literally met with hundreds of Ukrainians. He heard their heroic stories as they were fleeing Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine. In the moment, I think that was a principled human reaction to the stories that he had heard that day,” Biden’s ambassador to NATO, Julianne Smith, said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\n\n\nBiden’s view of Putin had been growing increasingly dark over the past month, according to officials, and his language has sharpened in describing a “pure thug,” “murderous dictator,” “war criminal” and, after visiting refugees at the stadium, a “butcher.”\n\nHis aides have said Biden has been hoping to avoid the Cold War, Washington versus Moscow dynamic he believes Putin desires. Instead, he left Europe more directly at odds with the Russian leader than ever.\n\nWhether that was his intention seemed unclear. The clarification the White House issued was at least the third time on Biden’s trip a White House official felt obliged to clean up remarks the President made that appeared, on their own, startling.\n\nAs he was hailing the heroism of the Ukrainians, Biden told US troops “you’re going to see when you’re there” – even though he’s vowed American forces won’t be entering the conflict directly. Afterward, a spokesman said nothing had changed: “The President has been clear we are not sending US troops to Ukraine.”\n\nAnd after Biden said he would respond “in kind” to the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan assured reporters the United States has “no intention of using chemical weapons period, under any circumstance.”\n\nBiden has a well-established pattern of speaking out of hand, though perhaps never with stakes so high. White House officials said before Biden’s speech the President had been working intently behind the scenes to reinforce cooperation among his counterparts.\n\n“He sleeps way less on these kinds of trips than maybe other trips because he’s just going, going, going – like, wants to talk to the next leader; you know, take the next briefing,” Sullivan said Friday midway through Biden’s flight from Brussels to Rzeszów in southeastern Poland, where he was meeting with American soldiers.\n\nBiden heads back to Washington with some victories to tout at home\n\nComing exactly a month since Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden’s snap visit to Europe was meant as a show of American resolve as the continent faces its worst conflict since World War II. Aides said after months of telephone calls and video conferences from his basement Situation Room in Washington, Biden wanted to come here to meet leaders face-to-face at a critical juncture in the war.\n\nThe timing of the summits was abrupt, leaving some European officials doubtful anything could possibly come from talks without the usual time to prepare. Some Western officials worried Biden’s insistence on an in-person gathering was an attempt to force decisions on some of the remaining sticking points.\n\nOthers worried that instead of reinforcing unity among the allies – which officials say has come as a shock to Putin – the visit would instead expose the cracks that still do exist.\n\nStill, they set to work engaging with their US counterparts to arrange the so-called “deliverables” – those items leaders can announce afterward to show their various constituencies they are able to get things done.\n\nEven as Biden was flying to Europe on Wednesday, the talks continued. Aboard Air Force One, the President’s various policy experts streamed in and out of his cabin in the nose of the airplane, updating him on progress toward the myriad items he was hoping to accomplish.\n\nBiden’s top national security aide described the scene like “speed dating with the President on every topic under the sun” – albeit with stakes higher than perhaps any other moment in recent memory.\n\nAs it turns out, Biden’s visit to Brussels did yield breakthroughs, including the announcement of a joint task force with Europe to wean it from its dependence on Russian oil and gas. Yet afterward, even Biden acknowledged the extraordinary last-minute gathering was unlikely to cause Russia to ease its slaughter in Ukraine, at least in the near term.\n\n“The answer is no,” Biden said when asked directly whether anything that happened in Brussels would cause Putin to alter course. Instead, he said “the single-most important thing is for us to stay unified” for months to come, which he said would eventually erode Putin’s ability and will to carry on.\n\n“We have to demonstrate – the reason I asked for the meeting – we have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united,” he said.\n\nPresident steels the West for a long battle\n\nIt was the clearest sign yet that 30 days into Russia’s war, Biden and his team do not believe the bloody conflict in Ukraine is nearing an end.\n\n“This battle will not be won in days or months,” Biden said during his speech on Saturday afternoon. “We need to steel ourselves for a long fight ahead.”\n\nEven Russia’s claim Saturday to be narrowing its military objectives was privately met with skepticism from American officials, who said they’d look instead to what Putin does with his forces in the country before making an assessment.\n\nOne of Biden’s aims in visiting Europe was to inject a human dimension into his decision-making by meeting with refugees and those helping them, along with American soldiers he’d deployed along NATO’s eastern edge to act as a deterrent to Putin.\n\nBiden said he had hoped to see more, longing to visit Ukraine itself to bear witness to its suffering. As a senator and vice president, Biden was a regular visitor to American war zones, a fact he mentioned when meeting troops positioned about 60 miles from the border with Ukraine.\n\n“I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan about 40 times,” he recalled.\n\nYet slipping over the border into Ukraine was never seriously considered by Biden’s aides. Unlike a stop in Iraq or Afghanistan, where US bases and personnel can help secure the airspace, Ukraine is not an American war zone – a fact that loomed over Biden’s trip in ways both logistical and philosophical as he worked to define the next phase of the conflict.\n\nFor Ukrainians watching from their capital of Kyiv, this week’s summits proved frustratingly disappointing. NATO leaders remain roundly opposed to calls for a no-fly-zone from President Volodymyr Zelensky, who didn’t even bother asking again during virtual remarks to the NATO summit on Wednesday. Instead, he simply pointed out he’d never received a clear answer to his request.\n\n“We are very disappointed, in all honesty. We expect more bravery. Expected some bold decisions. The alliance has taken decisions as if there’s no war,” said Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, in a live interview with the Atlantic Council on Friday.\n\nEven Biden’s pledge Wednesday to response proportionally should Putin use chemical weapons in Ukraine was viewed as cold comfort by some Ukrainian officials.\n\n“What we heard is that it is OK for us to die of bullets, OK for us to die of missiles, OK for my people to die of hunger in the occupied cities. But if and when chemical weapons will be used, then there will be a change. You can imagine this was extremely painful, that this was extremely annoying,” said Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian member of Parliament, interviewed by CNN’s Hala Gorani.\n\n“If the whole world is so afraid of Putin, why is Biden saying we’ll change our mind if there’s a chemical attack? Do you understand how cruel this sounds?” Rudik asked.\n\nOthers in the region – at least those covered by NATO’s collective defense alliance – felt more assured.\n\n“We know what Russian imperialism stands for, and we know what it means to be attacked by Russian armed forces, because our grandfathers and great-grandfathers experienced that; sometimes even our parents experienced that,” Polish President Andrzej Duda told Biden as they met Friday.\n\n“So, thank you for your presence,” he said. “And thank you, first and foremost, for your incredible leadership.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/asia/tonga-volcano-tsunami-recovery-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Tonga faces 'unprecedented disaster' as New Zealand warns of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA massive volcanic eruption and tsunami near Tonga caused “an unprecedented disaster,” the Pacific nation’s leader said Tuesday, as New Zealand warned of further eruptions that may complicate the delivery of aid to remote islands where communications are down.\n\nIn its first official update since Saturday’s eruption of the underwater Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano, Tonga’s government on Tuesday confirmed the deaths of three people and several other injuries, and outlined the scale of destruction to communities.\n\nTongan Prime Minster Siaosi Sovaleni said all houses on the island of Mango, where 36 people live, were destroyed. Only two houses remain on Fonoifua island, and extensive damage was reported on Nomuka island, home to 239 people, he said.\n\n“An unprecedented disaster hit Tonga,” Sovaleni said, adding a “volcanic mushroom plume” extended to cover all of the country’s roughly 170 islands – of which 36 are inhabited – impacting the entire population of more than 100,000 people.\n\nLarge swaths of land in Tonga are covered in volcanic ash, in this photo taken January 17, 2022. New Zealand Defence Force/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAccording to experts, the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano was likely the biggest volcanic event recorded since Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991.\n\nOn Tuesday, New Zealand’s Foreign Ministry warned further eruptions of the volcano were likely, posing a tsunami risk.\n\nThe estimation was based on modeling by GNS Science, a New Zealand geological research institute, the ministry said. “The most likely scenario is for ongoing eruptions in the next several days to weeks, with ongoing tsunami risk to Tonga and New Zealand,” it said.\n\nThe eruption on Saturday generated tsunami waves up to 49 feet (15 meters) high that hit the west coast of Tonga’s main island, Tongatapu, and the ‘Eua and Ha’api islands.\n\nA United Nations spokesperson said an initial assessment by Tongan authorities found 100 houses were damaged and 50 destroyed on Tongatapu, the country’s main island, home to the majority of the population. No evacuation centers are open on the main island, and people who were displaced are mostly staying with extended families.\n\nOn ‘Eua, 89 people are in evacuation centers, the spokesperson said, adding that information from outer islands remains scarce.\n\nRace to deliver aid to Tonga\n\nThe first details of the devastation emerged on Tuesday after Tonga’s Pacific neighbors, Australia and New Zealand, made reconnaissance flights to the archipelago – a three- to five-hour journey.\n\nPhotos show entire island communities that were once lush and green, now blanketed by thick, gray ash. Many homes appear damaged or completely destroyed.\n\nWidespread stagnant pools of salt water, coupled with the volcanic ash, are polluting drinking water sources, according to the Red Cross.\n\nThe delivery of aid was hampered by ashfall covering Tonga’s Fua’amotu International Airport runway, forcing New Zealand to send two navy ships to assist with recovery – but they will not arrive until Friday.\n\nYutaro Setoya, the official in charge of the WHO liaison office for Tonga, said he believed the first aid flights could arrive on Thursday.\n\nHe also described the the conditions in the wake of the disaster.\n\n“After the eruption initially, there was a sound on the roof like rain, and it was not actually a rain. It was small pellets falling from the sky,” Setoya told CNN on Wednesday. The pellets were followed by very fine ash, which by the time Tonga woke up the next day resembled “gray snow like two centimeters everywhere.”\n\nWith cleanup efforts underway, rescue workers are racing to deliver safe drinking water to the island nation as it grapples with the shortages.\n\n“Securing access to safe drinking water is a critical immediate priority,” said Katie Greenwood, the Pacific Head of Delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, pointing to the mounting risk of diarrhea and diseases such as cholera.\n\nAn area of Nukuʻalofa is pictured under a layer of volcanic ash on Wednesday.

The country shut its borders to international travelers near the start of the pandemic, and has used this time to prepare its population and health care systems for an outbreak, he added.\n\n“We have lots of natural disasters in this part of the world and you don’t want to have to deal with multiple emergencies at the same time, if that can be avoided,” Casey said.\n\nWHO is still working to send supplies to Tonga, including telecommunication tools such as satellite phones, water sanitation equipment and materials to repair and build shelters.\n\n“Everybody in Tonga, every family in town is affected by this,” Casey said. “That’s always the case in the Pacific.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nAs Beijing welcomed 2022, residents in the Chinese capital noticed a subtle shift taking place in the city’s subway: on signs, the English word “station” has been replaced with “Zhan,” the pinyin, or romanized version, of the Chinese character.\n\nAnd in some cases, English station names such as Olympic Park and Terminal 2 of the Beijing airport have become “Aolinpike Gongyuan” and “2 Hao Hangzhanlou” – though the English translations are still displayed in brackets underneath.\n\nThe changes appear to be a work in progress that first started last month, and come just weeks ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February.\n\nThough there’s no suggestion the revamp is in any way linked to the Winter Games, some have contrasted it with Beijing’s efforts to improve English translations of street signs before welcoming the world for the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\nAnd the campaign has already caused a stir online, with many questioning the rationale behind such replacements, since foreign visitors who don’t speak any Chinese are unlikely to understand pinyin.\n\nBeijing Subway said in a statement last week that the changes are part of “the city’s ongoing efforts to unify translations of subway station names in accordance with relevant regulations.”\n\nBut that has failed to convince many on Chinese social media.\n\n“English translations are meant for foreigners to read. Why don’t you just have only Chinese then? This kind of translation is redundant,” a comment said on Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter.\n\nLast week, the state-run Guangming Daily also weighed in, questioning the practicality of the move and how much such new translations would actually help the target audience.\n\n“For Chinese people, the vast majority do not need the help of pinyin to read Chinese, and in fact more people may know Chinese characters than pinyin,” it said in a commentary, adding that some elderly and overseas Chinese might not understand pinyin, which was developed in the 1950s and taught in primary schools in mainland China.\n\n“For foreigners, the overwhelming majority probably don’t recognize pinyin…Therefore, this kind of translation may fall into an awkward situation: Chinese people don’t need it, foreigners don’t understand it.”\n\nOn a map inside the Beijing subway, Terminal 2 of the Beijing airport have become \"2 Hao Hangzhanlou\" -- though the English translations is still displayed in brackets underneath. Martha Zhou/CNN\n\nAlistair Baker-Brian, a British national who lives in Beijing and speaks Chinese, says the changes don’t affect him personally, as he can read most of the station names in Chinese.\n\n“I think in some ways, it could actually be better for non-Chinese speakers, and particularly for people who are maybe not very familiar with China,” said Baker-Brian, an editor at That’s Beijing, an English-language digital media platform serving China’s international community.\n\n“Perhaps when tourists eventually return and when they need to tell the taxi driver where to go, (the drivers) are more likely to understand Beixinqiao Zhan, rather than Beixinqiao station,” he said.\n\nBut to others, the move is accentuating fears that China’s ruling Communist Party is increasingly pushing back against English, amid its ongoing ideological war against Western influence.\n\n“They’re starting to get rid of English. The English-learning craze at the time of the 2008 Beijing Olympics Games seems like a lifetime ago,” a user lamented on Douban, a popular site for reviewing movies, books and music.\n\nWidely regarded as China’s “coming out party” on the world stage, the 2008 Olympics incentivized a generation of Beijing residents to learn English as they welcomed tens of thousands of foreign guests.\n\nIn the lead-up to the event, the Beijing government launched a campaign to correct wrong English translations on road signs and names of public venues. The effort was even branded as a “mass movement” to raise the public’s “Olympic awareness” and improve “the city’s English level and civilization level,” state broadcaster CCTV reported at the time.\n\nNew English names of subway stations have been plastered on a map inside a Beijing subway train. Martha Zhou/CNN\n\nBut things took a different turn under Xi Jinping, who since coming to power in 2013 has eagerly promoted “cultural self-confidence” and traditional Chinese culture. At the same time, Western books, movies, and other forms of perceived influence are viewed with increasing suspicion, and some government policies have prompted fears that English is next in the crosshairs.\n\nIn August, education authorities in Shanghai, widely considered to be China’s most international city, banned local primary schools from holding final exams about the English language. While the policy came amid broader government efforts to ease academic pressure on Chinese children, the move sent shock waves among the country’s middle-class parents, who worried their cities would soon follow suit.\n\nIn March, a government adviser suggested English should be downgraded in importance as a subject in schools – making it less important than Chinese and maths and no longer compulsory in college entrance exams.\n\nAnd in 2020, the Education Ministry announced a ban on foreign textbooks in all primary and junior high schools – a move widely regarded as an attempt to tighten ideological control of students across the country.\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that all these concerns have sprung to mind for some when they learn of the changes to English names at subway stations across Beijing.\n\nFor now, these new signs are unlikely to make any difference for the Winter Games, which will be held within a tightly sealed Covid-safe “bubble” – meaning all participants and attendees will be prohibited from freely entering the city anyway.\n\nBut when foreign visitors, including tourists, return to Beijing at some point in the future, after China finally re-opens its borders, they might face a subway system that is a little more confusing to navigate.\n\n“As a country that’s open to the outside world, it’s our duty to provide convenience (to foreign visitors),” said the commentary in the Guangming Daily. “We’re living in an era of irreversible globalization, and people-to-people exchanges have become a must. How to make facilities and signs more helpful, how to better unify standards, all require our consideration.”", "authors": ["Nectar Gan Steve George", "Nectar Gan", "Steve George"], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/01/23/costco-dei-shareholder-proposal-rejected/77907655007/", "title": "Costco shareholders reject anti-DEI proposal.

He and other board members had asked shareholders to reject the proposal involving the company's diversity, equity and inclusion policies ahead of Thursday's annual meeting.\n\n\"We owe our success to the more than 300,000 employees who serve our members every day. It is important that they all feel included and appreciated and that they transmit these values to our customers,\" James said.\n\nEthan Peck from the National Center for Public Policy Research – the right-leaning shareholder advocacy group that submitted the proposal – argued in a prerecorded message that DEI is \"illegal, immoral and detrimental to shareholder value\" and poses litigation risks for the company.\n\n\"By not hiring and promoting completely irrespective of race and sex ‒ in other words, by merit alone ‒ the company is not always hiring or promoting the best person for the job, and anything short of that is selling the success in the future of the company short, and therefore selling shareholders short,\" the message said.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe vote came just days after President Donald Trump used executive power to crack down on DEI.\n\nIncreasingly, companies are facing a DEI showdown at the shareholder ballot box.\n\nApple recently recommended investors vote against a shareholder proposal to eliminate the company’s DEI programs.\n\nRight-leaning groups like the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center say they bring shareholder proposals to counter liberal politics invading corporate boardrooms and advancing a “woke” ideological agenda that puts businesses at risk.\n\nSeizing on the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision striking down affirmative action in college admissions to challenge corporate diversity policies, these groups are bringing more DEI-related proposals before investors.\n\nWhile small, the number of anti-DEI shareholder proposals has more than tripled since 2020, according to the Conference Board. This proxy season, Walmart and Starbucks face similar proposals.\n\nPeck, deputy director of the National Center for Public Policy Research’s Free Enterprise Project, said his group plans 40 shareholder proposals this year, 12 focused on DEI.\n\n“Our shareholder proposal efforts are very much in tandem with the general pushback against DEI, in that both the general pushback and our proposals are about exposing how DEI is discriminatory and value-destroying,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nRight-leaning investors advance shareholder proposals – even those likely to get low-single-digit support – to make a point and get attention. Like Costco, corporate boards usually recommend shareholders vote against them. The measures typically get less than 2% of shareholder support.\n\nTrump's DEI executive orders increase business risks\n\nSpeaking to business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday, Trump called DEI programs \"absolute nonsense.\"\n\nHis latest executive order to end DEI in the federal government and affirmative action in federal contracting sent shockwaves through corporate America. Trump said his administration would investigate corporations that don’t fall in line. That warning could fuel more shareholder activism over the potential legal and financial fallout from diversity initiatives.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is one of the companies that may become a target.\n\nWhen asked about a potential challenge to its DEI practices, CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC’s Squawk Box: “Bring them on,” though he said he would listen to arguments about where JPMorgan Chase is getting it wrong “and make modifications.”\n\nFacing a rapidly shifting political environment and under fire from conservative foundations, think tanks and political operatives, a growing list of major corporations have dialed back diversity efforts.\n\nSome companies retreated from DEI commitments shortly before Trump took office. Among them was Facebook and Instagram owner Meta as CEO Mark Zuckerberg looked to align his social media company with the Trump administration.\n\nCostco, Apple and others reject anti-DEI shareholder proposals\n\nThose rollbacks have critics who say companies are making shortsighted decisions that could undermine their businesses.\n\nAmong them is the progressive shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, which issued a 2023 report showing a “statistically significant correlation” between diverse management and eight key financial metrics.\n\n“These are businesses that have existed longer than four years. We expect them to exist beyond this four-year window in front of us,” said Meredith Benton, principal founder of Whistle Stop Capital, which consults with As You Sow on DEI. “What we want to see is them making decisions that are in their business interests over the long term.”\n\nSome companies are standing by their DEI programs. None have defended those programs quite as vigorously as Costco.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research submitted the shareholder proposal, arguing that Costco’s DEI initiatives hold “litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.”\n\nCostco’s board of directors voted unanimously to recommend shareholders reject the measure, arguing that diverse employees and suppliers fuel innovation in the merchandise it stocks and the services it offers.\n\n“Our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,” the directors said. “The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.”\n\nCostco CEO Ron Vachris also defended those practices to a concerned shareholder, saying his company does not use hiring quotas but focuses on giving all workers the same opportunities.\n\n“If these are the policies you see as offensive, I must tell you I am not prepared to change,” Vachris wrote in the exchange viewed by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nStefan Padfield, director of the National Center for Public Policy Research’s Free Enterprise Project, said Costco’s “defiant” response to a “perfectly reasonable shareholder request” was out of line.\n\n“Simply asking shareholders to trust the status quo at Costco is insufficient,” Padfield told USA TODAY. “This is a rapidly changing landscape in terms of law, regulation, and market sentiment, and shareholders accordingly have good reason to ask for a review of practices, legal advice, and managerial information gathering and processing.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/11/13/what-is-doge-elon-musk/76255384007/", "title": "What is 'Doge'?

GameStop, AMC and other seemingly forgotten stocks rose around the same time Dogecoin gained steam.\n\nGameStop took Wall Street by storm in January 2021 after Roaring Kitty and other small-pocket investors on Reddit contributed to a historic short squeeze that drove stock prices high. Similarly to GameStop, Dogecoin's popularity stemmed from celebrity endorsements, memes and GIFs.\n\nSnoop Dogg, Mark Cuban and many others hopped on the Dogecoin bandwagon, but none of them compared to Musk's love for the cryptocurrency. Musk was even accused of insider trading by investors in June 2023 because of the series of stunts he pulled, including changing the logo of Twitter to Doge's logo and Tesla announcing that it would accept the currency as a means of payment for the company's merchandise, the Guardian previously reported.\n\nMusk and Tesla won the dismissal of the $258 billion federal lawsuit on this past August after the court deemed he did not defraud investors by hyping up Dogecoin or conduct insider trading, according to Reuters.\n\nDOGE, the newly formed 'Department of Government Efficiency'\n\nMusk is quoted in Trump's statement saying the Department of Government Efficiency will \"send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!\"\n\nAccording to Trump, DOGE will provide advice and guidance from outside of the government, and it will partner with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget to \"drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.\"\n\nAdditionally, Musk and Ramaswamy will be in charge of driving out what Trump's statement calls \"massive waste and fraud\" from government spending. The billionaires' work is expected to conclude no later than July 4, 2026, according to the president-elect.\n\nIt is unclear if DOGE will exist within the federal government or outside because an official government agency cannot be created without an act of Congress.

Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation found no noncitizens were voting in the state’s elections, lawmaker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}]}

Russian convoy nears Kyiv\n\nSatellite images are showing that a 40-mile Russian military convoy is advancing towards Kyiv. Other images have shown additional deployments and helicopter units in southern Belarus, around 20 miles north of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. At least nine people were killed and 37 injured in the city of Kharkiv on Monday after Russian forces launched multiple rocket strikes in civilian areas. The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague said he wants to investigate Russia for possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine.\n\nWhat next if Kyiv falls to Russian invasion?\n\n2. ‘Bleakest warning’ on climate\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has sounded a fresh alarm bell, warning that climate breakdown is accelerating rapidly, many of its impacts will be worse than predicted and there is only a slim window to avoid its worst effects. In a report described as the IPCC’s “bleakest warning yet”, the global authority on climate science said that human actions are causing dangerous and widespread disruption, threatening devastation to swathes of the natural world and rendering many areas uninhabitable, reported The Guardian.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sunak asked to delay NI rise\n\nBusiness leaders are putting fresh pressure on Rishi Sunak to delay a planned £12b rise in national insurance. Noting that the conflict in Ukraine is likely to send inflation ever higher, the trade body Make UK, which represents 20,000 firms of all sizes across the country, said the proposed increase “remains illogical and will be even more ill-timed given how circumstances have rapidly changed since it was announced”. Employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more per pound once national insurance rates rise next month.\n\nWhat the National Insurance increase means for you\n\n4. TfL warns of Tube strike today\n\nTransport bosses warned last night that there is a “high chance” of no services being run on the London Underground network today. Around 10,000 Tube workers are expected to strike over plans by Transport for London to cut up to 600 station posts, as well as concerns over pensions and working conditions. Walkouts are also expected this Thursday. In another blow for public transport, the highest train fare rises for nine years have come into force for rail travellers, with regulated fares in England and Wales increasing by up to 3.8%.\n\n5. Bodies pile up in Hong Kong\n\nHealth chiefs in Hong Kong have admitted that bodies are piling up in the city’s mortuaries as it faces its worst Covid outbreak since the pandemic began, reported The Daily Telegraph. Hospital and public mortuaries have reached maximum capacity after the city of 7.4 million people reported 34,466 new infections and 87 fatalities. Supermarket shelves across the city have emptied following hints that the government may introduce a Hong Kong-wide lockdown to stem the spread of the virus.\n\nWhy Hong Kong is in the middle of an Omicron ‘onslaught’\n\n6. Trumps appeal court ruling\n\nDonald Trump has appealed a court ruling that required him to answer questions under oath in New York state’s civil investigation into his business practices. Lawyers for the former president and his two eldest children filed papers arguing that ordering them to testify violates their constitutional rights because their answers could be used in a parallel criminal investigation. CNN said Trump’s legal team is “confronting trouble on a number of fronts” while the former president weighs a possible White House run in 2024.\n\nWhat is Donald Trump doing now?\n\n7. Teacher suspended over bin Laden image\n\nA Church of England school has suspended a teacher for using a picture of Osama bin Laden to portray the Prophet Mohammed during a Year 10 lesson. All Saints Academy in Bedfordshire issued a profuse apology over what it described as “totally inappropriate images” used in a religious education class last week. The Daily Telegraph said a “concerned” pupil raised the alarm about the presentation slide and the member of staff was suspended “immediately” pending a “detailed and swift investigation”.\n\n8. MPs reject police bill amendments\n\nMPs have rejected a proposal to make misogyny a hate crime in England and Wales as part of new public order laws going through Parliament. The amendment was part of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which returned to the House of Commons after suffering a series of defeats in the House of Lords. Other amendments to the bill were rejected by MPs, including one designed to crackdown on predatory “sex for rent”. The BBC said the bill is a “mammoth piece of legislation” which has proved controversial.\n\nWhat is in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill?\n\n9. Ultra-wealthy profit from pandemic\n\nMore than 51,000 people joined the ranks of the “ultra-wealthy” last year, according to a report by the property consultants Knight Frank. The number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals – classed as those with assets of more than $30m (£22.4m) – rose by a record 9.3% last year to 610,569. The Guardian said the very wealthy benefited from rising global stock markets and increased property prices during the Covid pandemic.\n\n10. Home Office criticised over Afghan family\n\nThe government sent an asylum-seeking family back to Afghanistan just days before the fall of Kabul, leaving them “in danger” and afraid to leave their home. Labour’s shadow Home Office minister, Holly Lynch, said the decision was “shameful”, adding that the family “felt they had no choice” other than agree to be sent back. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said the British government “must now do everything it can to grant safe passage to at-risk Afghans”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harold Maass", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/956123/chelsea-oligarch-ugly-face-of-the-beautiful-game", "title": "Chelsea's oligarch: the ugly face of the beautiful game | The Week", "text": "Chelsea’s home fixture against Newcastle United last Sunday certainly wasn’t a contest “to warm the hearts of the romantics”, said David Hytner in The Guardian. It pitted a club owned by a Russian oligarch with close ties to Vladimir Putin – and now effectively being run by the UK Government – against another that, since October, has been owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. So perhaps unsurprisingly, it proved an “edgy and uncomfortable” affair, with Chelsea “labouring for much of the afternoon” before a stunning strike from Kai Havertz in the final minutes broke the deadlock. There were “shades of Dennis Bergkamp” in the way the German cushioned Jorginho’s over-the-top pass and slotted the ball past Martin Dubravka. It was a reminder of the quality that exists in Thomas Tuchel’s squad – and it handed the Blues their “fifth Premier League win on the spin”.\n\nIt’s surprising, really, that Chelsea have been doing so well on the pitch, given the drama unfolding off it, said Alyson Rudd in The Times. The oligarch Roman Abramovich has been pouring money into the club since he bought it back in 2003; but days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he put it up for sale with a rumoured £3bn price tag. Then, on 10 March, the sale was suspended when the UK Government issued sanctions against him. Under a special licence, Chelsea have been allowed to continue competing, but have had to cease all revenue-raising activities, including selling new tickets for home matches and renegotiating players’ contracts. When faced with the prospect of his team’s upcoming trips to face Lille in the Champions League and Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, Tuchel joked that if his team could not get a plane “we go by train”, adding “if not by bus; if not I will drive a seven-seater”.\n\nTo allay some of the fears that these restrictions would force the club into administration, the Government issued a second licence this week, moderating some of the terms of its predecessor and allowing the club’s sale to be resumed, said Matt Law in The Daily Telegraph. Several parties are thought to be interested in a purchase, among them the British property tycoon Nick Candy, and a consortium headed by US businessman Todd Boehly. And so Abramovich’s 19-year relationship with Chelsea really does seem to be drawing to a close, said Jonathan Liew in the New Statesman. The “official narrative” of that relationship is that it was never based on money or self-interest: Abramovich claims he was drawn to Chelsea through “pure passion for the game and club”. Yet as bombs rain down on Ukraine, it seems possible to see – as if for the first time – why a man whose wealth depended on his links to the Kremlin might have wanted to sink billions into a football club. The truth is that Chelsea and Abramovich “locked each other into a kind of Faustian pact” – one that offered the club “trophies and clout”, while giving the Russian prestige and respectability, a “route into the British establishment”, and – perhaps most crucially – a “visibility that shielded him from the sort of political reprisals that were visited on so many of his fellow oligarchs”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Such is the “selective myopia” induced by their tribalism, however, that they were mostly unbowed. “Champions of Europe, we know what we are,” they crowed. “We feel bad for the Ukrainian people,” one fan said, “but why should we have to suffer when it’s nothing to do with us?” Nor were such objectionable sentiments merely confined to the Chelsea sections of the crowd. “Chelsea’s skint and the Mags are rich,” sang the Newcastle fans swarming the Fulham Road. Their team, lest we forget, is owned by a fund presided over by Mohammed bin Salman, whose regime is “inflicting untold devastation on neighbouring Yemen”, and which, last Saturday, “used the cover of slaughter in Ukraine to execute 81 people in a single day”. While the Government’s move against Abramovich is to be welcomed, there is “no sense that it can or even wants to do anything about Newcastle’s links to Bin Salman”. Such is the “nightmarishly tangled web” that English football finds itself in in 2022. Having spent decades “gleefully accepting tainted money, it now finds itself in a moral maze from which there is no way out”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Theunis Bates", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/17"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/957005/ukraine-war-descending-into-frozen-conflict", "title": "Is the Ukraine war descending into a 'frozen conflict'? | The Week", "text": "Russia launched its first air strikes on Kyiv in over a month, while heavy fighting continued in eastern Ukraine this week. The strikes on sites in Ukraine’s capital followed warnings from Moscow that it would step up attacks in retaliation for the supply of new US weapons to Ukraine.\n\nKyiv said its forces had recaptured a fifth of Severodonetsk, a Russian-occupied city in the eastern Luhansk province. After a visit to the front line, Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy warned that his forces were outnumbered in Severodonetsk and nearby Lysychansk, but said they had “every chance” of fighting back. Russia will control the whole of Luhansk if it takes the cities. The US announced that it would send a new rocket system, doubling Ukraine’s artillery range; the UK will send similar weapons. In remarks which angered Kyiv, France’s President Macron urged the West not to “humiliate” Russia, so that a diplomatic solution can be found “when the fighting stops”.\n\nWhat the editorials said\n\nWhat on earth is Macron thinking, asked The Times. Russian forces are launching “relentless attacks” on Severodonetsk and are killing up to 100 Ukrainian troops a day. Yet instead of focusing on getting weapons to Ukraine, the French president has made an “extraordinarily foolish” intervention in which he talked of finding an accommodation with Moscow. And he isn’t the only EU leader to suggest that Russia be offered a face-saving way out of the war: Germany’s Olaf Scholz has done so too, and recently repeatedly refused to say that he wants to see Russia defeated militarily.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Yet for all the talk of “intra-European squabbling”, said The Economist, the overall story of this conflict is one of impressive continental unity: witness the EU’s announcement of stiffer sanctions on Russia last week. However, that unity will no doubt be “further tested” in the months ahead – especially by the question of how to wean the continent off Russian gas.\n\n(Image credit: Scott Peterson/Getty Images)\n\nMuch has been made of Russia’s advances in recent weeks, said Max Boot in The Washington Post, but “the facts on the ground” suggest that Ukraine’s position is still pretty strong. True, Russian forces have made “incremental gains” in the east. But they haven’t come close to encircling Ukrainian troops, who are retaking parts of Severodonetsk, a city which had looked lost a week ago. Meanwhile, the West continues to bolster Kyiv’s arsenal. Russian forces, by contrast, are suffering from “incompetent leadership and low morale”, and have lost so much hardware that they’re using 60-year-old tanks. The West must now go for broke, said Anne Applebaum in The Atlantic. Far from offering Putin an “off-ramp”, it should aim for the “rapid defeat, or even, to borrow Macron’s phrase, humiliation” of Russia. Putin has shown no appetite for ending his war, and views destroying Ukraine as an “existential goal”. If we’re to prevent further aggression (by him), only Russia’s total defeat will suffice.\n\nAlas, that sort of talk belongs in the realm of “fantasy”, said Robert Colls in The New Statesman. Leaving aside the threat of nuclear escalation, do hawks in the West really think Russian forces will simply “crawl away” while Zelenskyy stages a “victory parade in Kyiv”? No, the “miserable truth” is that neither side can afford to lose this war. If it is to end, Putin “has got to be shown a way down” so that a diplomatic solution can be found – however unpalatable that sounds. For now, the war in Donbas is like a “bloody seesaw”, said Daniel DePetris in The Spectator. “The Russians spend a day acquiring one kilometre of ground, only for the Ukrainians to counter attack shortly thereafter.” Neither side looks likely to end the stalemate soon, and both appear to view diplomacy as “a chore best left to some later date”. The most likely scenario is therefore that the war descends into a “frozen conflict”, like the one in Donbas from 2014 until February. That’s by no means a good outcome – but right now, it’s “looking like the best of bad options”.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe foreign ministers of Russia and Turkey met in Ankara this week to discuss opening a corridor in the Black Sea for agricultural exports, following warnings that Russia’s naval blockade could trigger global food shortages. Kyiv says that 75 million tonnes of grain could be stuck in Ukraine by autumn unless exports resume.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nMore than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters who surrendered after the fall of Mariupol have been transferred to Russia for investigation, according to Russian state media.

Truss joins leadership race\n\nLiz Truss has entered the race to replace Boris Johnson. Launching her campaign in The Telegraph, the foreign secretary pledged to start cutting taxes “from day one” and claimed that “colleagues know I mean what I say and only make promises I can keep”. Fellow hopeful Rishi Sunak has denied links to the former No. 10 adviser Dominic Cummings after Nadine Dorries claimed the aide had been working with Sunak for “quite a long time”. Meanwhile, Nadhim Zahawi has promised to publish his tax returns if he wins the leadership contest and becomes prime minister.\n\nNext Tory leader odds and polls: who will replace Boris Johnson?\n\n2. ‘Uber files’ reveal corruption\n\nLeaked documents have revealed that Uber “flouted laws, duped police, exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments during its aggressive global expansion”, The Guardian reported. The so-called “Uber files” outline the extensive help Uber enjoyed from leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and former EU commissioner Neelie Kroes. Leaked messages show that one executive joked they had become “pirates” and another conceding: “We’re just fucking illegal.” Uber insists its past behaviour “wasn’t in line with present values” and it is a “different company” today.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Record UK temperatures expected\n\nThe Met Office has warned that Britain could experience its hottest day on record this week. Temperatures are forecast to hit 33C on Tuesday, while parts of the south-east, including London, could reach 35C over the coming weekend. The Telegraph said there is currently a 30% chance of Britain experiencing its warmest day ever on Sunday, meaning temperatures would pass the current record of 38.7C, which was recorded in Cambridge University Botanic Garden on 25 July 2019. The Daily Mirror added that the UK’s temperature record could be “obliterated” with sweltering highs of 43C predicted.\n\nSix tips to stay cool in the heatwave\n\n4. Church: ‘no definition of woman’\n\nThe Church of England has stated that there is “no official definition” of a woman. In a written reply to a question submitted to General Synod, a senior bishop said that although the definition of the word woman was previously “thought to be self-evident” there was now a need for “additional care” on the question. The Telegraph said that “liberal wings” of the Church have welcomed the stance, but gender-critical campaigners insisted that “whether your starting point is biology or the Bible”, the answer to the question of what is a woman remains the same.\n\nWhat are gender-critical beliefs?\n\n5. Women spiked at German chancellor’s party\n\nAt least nine women are believed to have been spiked with a date rape drug at the chancellor of Germany’s summer party. During last week’s gathering, which was hosted by Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrat party, the women fell ill after their food and drinks were spiked with so-called knockout drops, a slang phrase which covers various date rape substances, such as rohypnol and ketamine. Lars Klingbeil, the co-leader of the Social Democrats, said he was “furious that something like this could happen”. In February a restaurant in Bavaria served up champagne laced with ecstacy.\n\n6. 15 killed after Russian strike hits apartment block\n\nAt least 15 people were killed after a Russian strike hit an apartment block in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. The residential building in the town of Chasiv Yar was hit on Saturday evening as Moscow ramped up its assault on cities and towns in the east. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the attacks were deliberate. “After such strikes, they will not be able to say they did not know something or did not understand something,” he said in a video address, vowing that “punishment is inevitable for every Russian murderer”.\n\nPutin and Russia’s territorial ambitions\n\n7. Salt linked to early death\n\nAdding salt to meals can cut years off your life, according to a new study. Researchers found that always adding salt to food slashes more than two years off life expectancy for men and one-and-a-half years for women. “To my knowledge, our study is the first to assess the relation between adding salt to foods and premature death,” said Prof Lu Qi of Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, who led the research involving 500,000 middle-aged Britons.\n\n8. Covid wave hits hospitals\n\nThe Guardian has found that hospitals are “battling staff absences, exhaustion, persistent backlogs and problems discharging patients” amid the latest wave of Covid. An estimated 2.71m people in the UK had Covid in the last week of June, an 18% rise on the week before. Hospitalisations are also up, with 11,316 people in hospital with Covid in the UK at the last count, up from 8,350. Meanwhile, a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) expert has accused the government of risking new variants by “shutting its eyes and letting Covid rip”.\n\nWhat to expect from the new Covid wave\n\n9. Trump teases Biden over Saudis\n\nDonald Trump has mocked Joe Biden for deciding to visit Saudi Arabia despite previously pledging to make it a pariah. The Republican said Biden’s visit on Friday would show that the US was becoming a “beggar” for energy. President Biden is also facing an outcry from some Democrats for choosing to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after releasing an intelligence assessment that found the prince had approved the capture or killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Some White House staff have even considered resigning over the change of approach.\n\n10. Dairy boss warns of price surge\n\nBritain is “on the edge” of dairy shortages as a severe lack of workers forces farmers to slash production, an industry giant has said. Arla Foods, the country’s biggest milk and butter maker, also predicted that dairy prices will surge even higher. Milk and butter prices have already soared by more than 10% in the last 12 months.

US kills al-Qaeda leader\n\nThe CIA has killed the leader of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a drone strike in Afghanistan. US president Joe Biden said Zawahiri, who took over al-Qaeda after the death of Osama Bin Laden in 2011, had “carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens”. The US believes he and Bin Laden plotted the September 11 attacks together. The New York Post described the assassination as “the most significant US counter-terror operation since the 2019 slaying of Isis commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi”.\n\nWhere will be next target for global jihad - and is the West at risk?\n\n2. Tory leadership race tightens\n\nLiz Truss has received the backing by former leadership rival Penny Mordaunt. Writing for The Times, Mordaunt, who narrowly lost out to Truss in the final round of voting among MPs, said the foreign secretary has “grasped the mood of the country” and is the candidate most likely to win the next general election. However, a private poll for Truss’ campaign found that she was now only five points ahead of Sunak, in contrast to surveys at the end of the knockout stages that suggested she had a 24-point lead over her rival.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Pelosi ‘to visit Taiwan’ despite warning\n\nNancy Pelosi is expected to visit Taiwan today despite warnings from Beijing that it will “not sit idly by” if the trip goes ahead. Although the stop is not currently on Pelosi’s public itinerary, a Taiwanese official said that the US House speaker is expected to stay in Taiwan overnight. Commenting on relations between the US and China, CNN said that Pelosi’s trip, if it goes ahead, is “almost certain to create greater instability in the relationship that would make future conflict more likely”.\n\nWill China invade Taiwan?\n\n4. UN sounds nuclear alarm\n\nThe UN Secretary General has warned that the world is one misstep from devastating nuclear war. “We have been extraordinarily lucky so far,” said Antonio Guterres, adding that “humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation”. At the opening of a nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty conference in New York, Guterres said: “Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used.”\n\nCan anything stop a nuclear bomb?\n\n5. PM blames ‘2019ers’ for his exit\n\nBoris Johnson believes the 2019 intake of Conservative MPs contributed to his downfall by failing to back him as he was losing his grip on power, according to the i newspaper. According to friends of the outgoing PM, Johnson thinks the group spent too much time on Twitter, leaving them “flaky”, “neurotic” and “lacking robustness” when it came to rallying round him in recent months. Some MPs believe Johnson is “bitter” and “refusing to recognise his own part in his resignation,” said the paper.\n\nWill Boris Johnson stage a comeback?\n\n6. BA suspends short-haul sales\n\nBritish Airways has suspended the sale of short-haul flights from Heathrow for at least a week. The carrier acted to comply with Heathrow’s decision to cap passenger numbers at 100,000 a day as an attempt to reduce disruption over the school holidays. The Times said the “unprecedented move” will result in thousands of seats being removed from sale and will push already high prices up further across the industry. “BA will have hated having to do this at the peak of the summer season,” a senior aviation source told the paper.\n\nHow to avoid the airport chaos this summer\n\n7. ‘Unprincipled’ reform on dangerous inmates\n\nDangerous prisoners will be blocked from automatic release following an unprecedented rule change. The move will allow ministers to override judges’ “fixed term sentences”, which set automatic release dates at halfway or two-thirds through offenders’ jail terms. Dangerous prisoners will instead be referred to the parole board to require them to serve out their full prison sentences before they are released into the community. Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust and former prison governor, described it as an “unprincipled transfer of sentencing powers from the judiciary to the executive”.\n\nHow safe are UK prisons?\n\n8. Brits to stand trial in proxy court\n\nThree Britons accused of being mercenaries are to stand trial in a Russian proxy court in eastern Ukraine. According to Russian media, John Harding, Dylan Healy, and Andrew Hill will be tried in the Donetsk People’s Republic, a breakaway region of Ukraine. The court, which is not internationally recognised, sentenced two British men to death recently. The UK and Ukraine condemned the death sentences for violating international laws protecting prisoners of war.\n\nWhy two Britons were sentenced to death in Ukraine\n\n9. Nandy visits striking workers\n\nThe shadow levelling-up secretary Lisa Nandy has been photographed visiting striking workers days after one of her colleagues was sacked for comments made on a picket line. Shadow cabinet ministers have warned of a “breakdown in discipline” after Nandy was pictured in Wigan, where she is the local MP, by the North West regional secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Carl Webb. Last week, the shadow transport minister, Sam Tarry, was sacked for conducting multiple broadcast interviews from a rail workers’ picket.\n\nKeir Starmer vs. the unions\n\n10. ‘Smart water’ to target club pests\n\nRevellers at nightclubs who harass women will be sprayed with “smart water” in a bid to combat sexual assaults. Security guards will be issued with canisters of the forensic spray that they can use to tag suspects’ bodies and clothes, said The Telegraph, allowing police to later project ultraviolet light onto the suspect and their clothes to reveal the smart water’s signature. Officials claim it has had a deterrent effect because clubbers are told it is in use.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "David Faris", "The Week Us", "Harold Maass", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/economy/uk-strikes-inflation/index.html", "title": "Strikes sweep Britain as soaring inflation savages living standards ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nWorkers in the United Kingdom have had enough of falling living standards.\n\nRail workers, journalists, lawyers, and postal workers have gone on strike in recent weeks to demand higher pay as inflation soars to its highest level in decades.\n\nAt least 155,000 workers are currently on strike, including staff at the country’s postal service, and engineers and call center workers for telecom provider BT (BTGOF). Two rail unions on Wednesday announced further strike action by 14,000 of their members later this month.\n\nMore strikes could be on the way this fall, threatening unprecedented disruption across a range of industries. Teachers, doctors and nurses are set to vote on strike action in the coming weeks. Unions could even coordinate their walkouts. Unite and Unison — the country’s biggest unions with 2.7 million members in total — are calling for others to join them in synchronized action.\n\nIt is one of the most significant waves of industrial unrest the United Kingdom has seen since the “winter of discontent” in the late 1970s when rampant inflation pushed workers to stage mass walkouts. About 7.9 million working days were lost between November 1978 and February 1979, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nAbout 40,000 cleaners, signalers, maintenance workers and station staff walked off the job in June in Britain's biggest and most disruptive railway strike for 30 years. Matt Dunham/AP\n\nSoaring prices and years of stagnant wages are the backdrop to this year’s disputes. Consumer price inflation hit a 40-year high of 10.1% in July. Forecasters at Citigroup said last week that inflation could shoot past 18% at the start of next year, and Goldman Sachs thinks it could even hit 22% if gas prices don’t fall soon.\n\nWorkers are already feeling the strain. Average real wages, which account for inflation, fell by 3% between April and June, compared with the same period last year. That was the biggest hit to spending power in more than 20 years. Real wages barely increased in the decade to 2020.\n\nAnd average household energy bills — which have already risen 54% this year — are set to increase by another 80% to £3,549 ($4,124) in October. According to estimates by Auxilione, a research firm, average bills could hit £7,700 ($8,949) next April — equivalent to a £642 ($746) monthly bill.\n\nWorkers are mobilizing in response.\n\n‘Demoralizing’\n\nThe United Kingdom has “never seen [this] level of disruption across all sectors,” Chiara Benassi, an associate professor in comparative employment relations at King’s College London, told CNN Business.\n\nIn recent months, the cost-of-living crisis has acted as a “trigger” for widespread grievances that have been building up over a long period of time, she said.\n\n“These strikes affect not only [what] we would say [are] manual occupations or low-skilled jobs that more evidently would struggle with the cost-of-living crisis, but also highly-skilled jobs like junior doctors, British Telecom engineers, barristers, academics, teachers,” Benassi said.\n\nBT workers on strike over pay on August 30 in London, England. Guy Smallman/Getty Images\n\nDeepsha Agrawal, a junior doctor at Oxford University Hospital, told CNN Business that her colleagues are pushing for a bigger pay increase than the 2% the government agreed back in 2019.\n\n“It’s quite demoralizing, because the current inflation rate is expected to go very high next year,” she said.\n\nHer union, the British Medical Association, will soon ballot its members over whether to strike. Agrawal believes that they will. Many of her colleagues feel they cannot afford to buy houses or have children.\n\n“[Junior doctors] are as hardworking and as educated as other professionals. We are struggling and we are paying a price out of our pocket to do the work that we do,” she said.\n\n“With what happened during Covid, we should be rewarded for what we did, not punished for what we do every day,” Agrawal added.\n\nFewer union members\n\nThe current wave of industrial action cannot easily be compared to the 1970s and 1980s — if only because the government stopped tracking numbers of striking workers, and working days lost, during the Covid-19 pandemic. It recently started collecting data again, and will provide an update this month.\n\nRichard Hyman, a professor of industrial relations at the London School of Economics, told CNN Business that this years’ strikes would pale in comparison to those of earlier decades simply because union membership has fallen so dramatically.\n\n“Around about 1980, more than half the workforce was in a trade union. Today it’s less than a quarter, so there’s been a big decline,” Hyman said.\n\nStrikes used to be concentrated in sectors which have “more or less disappeared” like coal mining and steel, Hyman added. Now, union membership is more heavily skewed towards the public sector, or big utility companies that used to be owned by the government.\n\n“There’s been the rise in precarious work, so that a growing proportion of workers simply don’t have a proper job any more so are not in a position to go on strike,” Hyman added.\n\nBenassi said that during the 1980s, when UK manufacturing industry was shrinking rapidly, strikes were often about the survival of key sectors.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1985, thousands of coal miners went on strike after Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government threatened to close many of the country’s coal pits.\n\n“[Today] it’s a bit different, because we are talking only about pay. Of course, the disputes at the time were also about pay but it was also about, for example, not closing down the mines,” she said.\n\nMore restrictions coming?\n\nThis year’s strike wave is significant, though, for the breadth of industries affected and because of the hoops UK workers have to jump through to down tools legally.\n\n“Striking in the UK is very difficult. It’s way more difficult than anywhere in western Europe, especially after the Trade Union Bill in 2016,” she said.\n\nThe legislation, which came into force in 2017, made it much harder for unions to call a strike by requiring at least 50% of members to take part in the ballot, and at least 40% of the votes cast to be in favor of strike action. The law also increased the period of notice unions must give employers of their intention to strike from one week to two.\n\nIn comparison, Benassi said that neither a ballot nor a notice period are required in Germany.\n\nLiz Truss, UK foreign secretary and favorite to succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister next week, has said she would bring in even tougher limits on unions’ powers to call a strike.\n\nWaste overflows from bins during a strike by workers in Edinburgh, Scotland, on August 27. Russell Cheyne/Reuters\n\nShe has proposed raising the support threshold for strike action from 40% to 50% of votes cast, and extend the notice period to a month.\n\n“I will take a tough line on trade union action,” Truss told Sky News in July.\n\nLiz Truss’ leadership campaign declined to comment when contacted by CNN Business.\n\n“There’s quite an adversarial campaign from the side of the government to say well we’ll send agency workers to replace the workers on strike, or they should go back to work immediately, or there has already been a pay rise,” Manuela Galetto, associate professor of employment relations at the University of Warwick’s Business School, told CNN Business.\n\nDespite the obstacles, workers may feel more emboldened to strike at the moment, given the tight labor market, she said.\n\nUK unemployment was 3.8% between April and June this year, ONS data shows. That’s its lowest level in more than 50 years. There was also one unemployed person for every job vacancy — a record low.\n\n“It means that many workers are in work and they are in a good position to ask for [a pay] increase. They cannot be easily replaced [at a macro level],” Galetto said.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/middle-east/957526/how-dangerous-is-al-qaeda-in-2022", "title": "How dangerous is al-Qaeda now? | The Week", "text": "An American drone strike has killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, one of the masterminds behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks over two decades ago and leader of al-Qaeda.\n\nUS officials confirmed the 71-year-old had been killed in a drone strike while standing on the balcony of a safe house in the Afghan capital Kabul on Sunday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said that since taking over as leader of the terrorist group in 2011 after the killing of Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri had “coordinated al-Qaeda’s branches and all around the world, including setting priorities for providing operational guidance and calling for and inspired attacks against US targets”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Former CIA director and defence secretary Leon Panetta told CNN that the loss of al-Zawahiri means al-Qaeda no longer has the leadership structure to pose a threat to the US or its allies.\n\nIn an increasingly polarised America, his death “could offer a rare moment of unity”, said CNN. “Still, any satisfaction over the killing of al-Zawahiri is likely to be soon overtaken by a more multilayered and urgent US conundrum abroad – the possibility of a standoff over Taiwan that threatens to erupt even as the US wages an effective proxy war against Russia in Ukraine.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Justin Klawans", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/955053/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-5-december-2021", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 5 December 2021 | The Week", "text": "1. Pandemic progress ‘squandered’\n\nThe Omicron variant shows that the world is “closer to the start of the pandemic than the end” and progress in combatting Covid-19 since its emergence is “being squandered,” one of Britain’s most senior scientific figures has warned. Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, said wealthy nations had been taking “a very blinkered domestic focus, lulled into thinking that the worst of the pandemic was behind us”.\n\n2. Nations unite on Taliban killings\n\nWashington has led protests against the Taliban over the “summary killings” of former members of the Afghan security forces reported by rights groups. A statement by the US, EU, Australia, Britain, Japan and others said: “We are deeply concerned by reports of summary killings and enforced disappearances of former members of the Afghan security forces.” Human Rights Watch has documented the summary execution or enforced disappearance of 47 former members of the Afghan national security forces, other military personnel, police and intelligence agents.\n\n3. Prince Charles will speak to detectives\n\nThe Prince of Wales said he is willing to meet detectives from Scotland Yard to discuss evidence that his aide fixed an honour for a Saudi billionaire. Prince Charles claims he had no knowledge of the deal in which Michael Fawcett, his right-hand man, secured a CBE for Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, who had donated £1.5m to his flagship charity. However, said The Sunday Times, Charles could be a “key witness,” having held private meetings with Mahfouz at several venues.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Deaths as Indonesian volcano erupts\n\nA volcano on the Indonesian island of Java has erupted, killing at least 13 people and sending clouds of ash into the air. Mount Semeru in the Lumajang district of East Java spewed giant clouds of ash last night, causing widespread panic. Witnesses said the clouds had blacked out the sun in some places. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines, said Sky News.\n\n5. Covid pill launched by Xmas\n\nThe first at-home treatment for Covid is to be offered to patients within weeks, reported The Telegraph. Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, is preparing a national pilot of Lagevrio – the “game-changing” pill that Britain licensed last month. The NHS is expected to deliver courses to clinically vulnerable and immunosuppressed patients within 48 hours of them testing positive for Covid. The pill works by preventing the virus from multiplying, keeping levels low in the body and reducing the severity of the disease.\n\n6. Trust in MPs collapses under Johnson\n\nTrust in politicians to act in the national interest rather than for themselves has fallen dramatically since Boris Johnson became prime minister, reported The Observer. Polling data from YouGov for the Institute of Public Policy Research showed a particularly sharp fall in trust in the few weeks since the Owen Paterson scandal sparked a rash of Tory sleaze scandals. In 2014, 48% of voters believed politicians were “out merely for themselves”. By last week, this had increased to 63%.\n\n7. Deepfake videos ‘are sex crimes’\n\nPeople who make deepfake sex videos to embarrass others should be convicted of a sex crime and sign the offenders register, a Tory MP has argued. Former culture secretary Maria Miller told The Telegraph that “when victims talk about the impact it has on them, they liken it to sexual abuse in the offline world and the fact that the law doesn’t treat it that way shows there is a significant problem to be solved”. Software giant Adobe has launched a website where people can check if online photographs have been manipulated.\n\n8. Dogs could sniff out drugs in Commons\n\nSniffer dogs could be used in the parliamentary estate under plans for a drugs crackdown by the Commons authorities, reported The Sunday Times. Amid mounting evidence of cocaine and other illegal substances being used in parliament, the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has promised to call in the police. Tory MP Charles Walker said: “It may be that we now need to broaden the range of sniffer dogs . . . to include those which can detect drugs.”\n\n9. PM launches Arthur Labinjo-Hughes inquiry\n\nBoris Johnson has ordered an investigation into the murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. The probe will involve police, schools, social services and probation watchdogs, in the hope that authorities can “learn lessons” from the six-year-old’s death. Arthur’s stepmother was jailed for 29 years for murder and child cruelty on Friday. His father was sentenced to 21 years for manslaughter. It emerged during the trial that at least three warnings from family and teachers about Arthur’s plight had been ignored.\n\n10. Hamilton ‘nothing to do’ with Grenfell link\n\nSir Lewis Hamilton insisted he had “nothing to do” with the Mercedes F1 team’s partnership deal with Kingspan - an insulation firm linked to the Grenfell Tower tragedy. The company’s logo appeared on Sir Lewis’ car for the first time yesterday as the seven-time world champion completed a qualifying session for the Saudi Arabian grand prix.

Cops ‘scour’ park for Khalife\n\nPolice have said there have been no confirmed sightings of Daniel Abed Khalife in the 36 hours since he escaped from Wandsworth prison. The Met described Khalife, who is accused of trying to spy for an enemy state, understood to be Iran, and plotting a fake bomb hoax, as “very resourceful”. Officers were “scouring” Richmond Park this morning, said the Daily Mail, following suggestions the former soldier could be using his army training to hide out there.\n\nDaniel Abed Khalife: how did terror suspect escape from Wandsworth prison?\n\n2. Kim unveils nuclear sub\n\nKim Jong Un has revealed that North Korea has built a “tactical nuclear attack submarine”, a new weapon that is capable of both a “preemptive” and “retaliatory” strike. Named “Hero Kim Kun Ok”, the submarine is the first of its kind and would “perform its combat mission as one of the core underwater offensives means of the naval force”, said state newswire KCNA. It was unveiled as North Korea “gears up” to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the country’s founding tomorrow, The Telegraph reported.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Labour donations surge\n\nLabour has “raked in” a record £6.4 million in private donations in just three months as business chiefs “fill its coffers” ahead of the next election, said The Telegraph. After Keir Starmer set out on a corporate charm offensive dubbed the “smoked salmon and scrambled eggs offensive”, the party made more from individual benefactors between April and June this year than it did in the whole of 2022. However, Labour’s donations were still outflanked by the Tories, who attracted £2.4 million more in the latest quarter.\n\nWhat the Labour reshuffle tells us about Keir Starmer’s plans\n\n4. King praises ‘devoted’ mother\n\nKing Charles III has released a short tribute to Elizabeth II to mark the first anniversary of his mother’s death. The King said he recalled the late Queen’s “devoted service and all she meant to so many of us”, and he thanked the nation for the “love and support” shown to him and Queen Camilla during the past 12 months. The monarch will be spending the day “quietly and privately” at Balmoral, said the BBC, with prayers and reflections on the life of his mother.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II: stories from an extraordinary life\n\n5. Discarded vapes pile up\n\nA recycling campaign group said five million disposable vapes are thrown away each week in the UK. The figure represents a fourfold increase over the past year, said Material Focus. Disposable vapes, cheap plastic devices designed to give “a few hundred puffs of nicotine vapour before being thrown away”, are often “discarded in bins and on roadsides”, the BBC reported. The UK Vaping Industry Association said many independent vape shops now had recycling facilities in place.\n\nThe dramatic rise of vaping in the UK\n\n6. Police join new maternity probe\n\nDetectives will investigate claims of a far-reaching cover-up by hospital managers as part of a criminal inquiry into the largest NHS maternity scandal. A major review will explore cases involving more than 1,700 mothers or babies who have potentially suffered avoidable harm at Nottingham University Hospitals Trust over the past 10 years. Nottinghamshire police announced yesterday that they would work alongside that review. The news comes after failures at the Countess of Chester Hospital, which allowed the neonatal nurse Lucy Letby to continue murdering babies.\n\n7. ‘Monster’ hurricane intensifies\n\nHurricane Lee has strengthened from a Category 1 to a Category 5 storm, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 160mph as it approaches the Caribbean. Lee has been “intensifying with exceptional speed” in the “warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean”, said CNN, doubling its wind speeds in the last 24 hours. The storm will become a “monster”, said Insider Times.\n\nThe world’s most extreme weather events in 2023\n\n8. China move hits Apple hard\n\nMore than $200 billion (£160 billion) has been wiped off the value of Apple amid reports that Beijing has banned government officials from using the company’s smartphones. Apple’s share price dropped more than 3% yesterday, and the company’s share price has now fallen 7.3% since Tuesday. US Representative Mike Gallagher said Beijing was unfairly punishing Western businesses to try and boost local competitors. He told Reuters this is “textbook Chinese Communist Party behaviour”.\n\n9. BBC disinformation figure ‘lied on CV’\n\nThe BBC’s disinformation correspondent has been accused of lying about her experience on her CV. While applying for a previous job, Marianna Spring, who reports on the way social media has been used to promote false information, claimed she had worked alongside BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford on the “perception of Russia”. According to The New European, her would-be boss rebuked Spring after checking out the claim. Spring reportedly apologised for her “awful misjudgement”.\n\n10. Less fiction on sale at Foyles\n\nBookshop Foyles “appears to have cut back on its fiction” in order to prioritise non-literary products, to the “confusion of customers and upset of staff”, said The Times. A Foyles bookseller in London told the paper that the provision of fiction in the branch she worked in had decreased by more than 50% in three years, as gift products, such as calendars and book lights, became more prominent. She said it was “quite depressing” that the store had been turned into a “souvenir shop”. The chain said fiction remains “pivotal” to its success.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Harold Maass", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/middleeast/saudi-iran-media-protests-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Iran protests: London-based TV channel sparks Iranian leaders' ire ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi CNN —\n\nA top Iranian military official issued a warning to Saudi Arabia last week as his government continued to face off against protesters at home. “You are involved in this matter and know that you are vulnerable, it is better to be careful,” he said at the sidelines of a military drill.\n\nMajor General Hossein Salami, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was referring to what state news outlets called a “media war” that they say is being waged against “the Iranian youth and nation” by foreign conspirators seeking to create unrest in the country by supporting protesters there.\n\nThen, on Thursday Iran again warned Saudi Arabia, as well as the United States and the United Kingdom, to “stop interfering in the country’s internal affairs.”\n\nIran last week said it sanctioned a number of media outlets in the UK for “supporting terrorism” and “inciting violence”, reported Tasnim news agency The sanctioned entities include, among others, Volant Media, Global Media, and DMA Media, as well as the “anti-Iranian TV channels” that the companies support, such as Iran International, reported Tasnim agency.\n\nNow in their sixth week, protests have swept through the Islamic Republic following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died on September 16 after being detained by “morality police” and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.\n\nAs the protests rage, Iran is turning up the heat on its adversaries, mainly the United States and Israel. But last week, Saudi Arabia found itself in the line of fire, which risks further complicating attempts by the two regional rivals to mend ties.\n\nRiyadh hasn’t publicly commented on the protests. The kingdom’s foreign minister refused to give his view when asked to during an interview with Al Arabiya news channel on October 12.\n\n“Saudi Arabia has a fixed policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of states,” he said. “Surely, we are following [the situation] and we wish Iran and its people the best.”\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia severed ties in 2016 and both parties have backed opposite sides in proxy conflicts across the Middle East. Last year, they began direct talks in an attempt to improve relations. Baghdad has hosted five rounds of talks so far, the last of which was held in April.\n\nAt the heart of Iran’s most recent accusations against Saudi Arabia may be Iran International, a Persian-language news channel that broadcasts from London. The channel has become one of the go-to sources for many Persian speakers looking for news on the protests. It has been at the forefront of covering the demonstrations, getting breaking news and exclusive footage of the events on the ground. Its Twitter account has over a million followers.\n\nFounded in 2017, Iran International has previously come under scrutiny by the Iranian government. Some say it is due to their coverage of the protests at home, which in recent weeks have rocked the Islamic Republic.\n\nSalami didn’t name the channel in his warning, but government-backed Iranian media last week accused Saudi Arabia of funding it. Saudi Arabia has not addressed the allegations. Karim Sa djadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington DC, said on Twitter that Iran has demanded the shuttering of the channel in talks with Saudi Arabia, citing a senior Gulf official.\n\nIn 2018, Iran International released a statement denying connections to any government, including Saudi Arabia or Iran after The Guardian reported that it was funded by a firm whose director has ties to Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSaudi Arabia did not comment on the Guardian report. The Saudi government did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\n“We have heard these accusations before most often promoted by those in whose interests it is to deny a free press,” a spokesperson for Volant Media told CNN.\n\n“Iran International and its sister channel, Afghanistan International, are editorially independent television channels owned by Volant Media, a company based in London owned by a Saudi Arabian/British citizen; it has no state backing or affiliation,” added the spokesperson.\n\nAzadeh Moaveni, associate professor of journalism at New York University, described the channel as “one of the most pernicious and damaging forces to enter the Iranian media sphere,” calling it an arm of Saudi foreign policy. “I would not describe Iran International as pro-reform, or organically Iranian in any manner,” she told CNN.\n\nMohammad Marandi, a professor at the University of Tehran who was also an adviser to the Iranian nuclear talks negotiating team, said there’s “no doubt” that Iran International is funded by Saudi Arabia. A prominent figure on state-funded Iranian outlets, Marandi added that Iran International spreads rumors, ethnic and sectarian strife “and it tries to use misinformation to create fear, chaos and promote violence.”\n\nSaudi Research and Marketing Group, a media conglomerate with ties to the Saudi ruling family, has run the Persian language website of the UK’s Independent newspaper since 2018. Its account on Instagram, where many Iranians get their news, has over 600,000 followers.\n\nCNN’s parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which has a partnership with Saudi Research and Media Group, a Saudi joint stock company.\n\nSaudi Arabia has for years accused Iran of doing the same with its own Arabic-language news channels: targeting Arab audiences with propaganda. State-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting runs Al Alam TV, an Arabic news channel that has interviewed Saudi opposition figures and has been blocked by Arab states. Iran-backed Hezbollah’s Al Manar channel has also been blocked.\n\n“It’s about time Iran gets a taste of its own medicine,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst. “Iran has spent decades inciting and funding instability in the Arab world so having them pay the price of such behavior themselves is certainly a source of satisfaction to a lot of people,” he told CNN.\n\nThe channel “is making an impact on public behavior in Iran and they are nervous about their domestic situation,” added Shihabi.\n\nAnalysts say that Iran’s tight grip on domestic media outlets and its lack of freedom of expression have created “fertile ground” for anti-establishment platforms such as Iran International to flourish.\n\n“It is not so much the broadcasters themselves, but the situation in Iran has provided the possibility for broadcasters outside of Iran to gather a certain degree of popularity in the Iranian context,” said Gholam Khiabany, a reader in media and communications at Goldsmiths, University of London.\n\nHarun Najafizada, a former journalist at Iran International who is now a director at the sister Afghanistan International news channel, said the parent company Volant Media is privately funded but “I don’t care as long as they do not influence my editorial take,” adding that shareholders never interfere in decision making.\n\nIran International stood out from other Western-backed Persian language news outlets “by taking the side of the disenchanted, oppressed, voiceless people,” while competitor Persian channels in the West were focused on bringing balance by giving the Iranian government a voice, he told CNN.\n\n“They have a vision, of course – they don’t do it for God,” said Najafizada, referring to the shareholders. “That vision is democracy.”\n\nJust two days after Salami’s first warning, however, Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, was quoted saying that the two countries should reopen their embassies to facilitate a rapprochement, according to the semi-official Iranian news agency ISNA.\n\n“We are neighbors of Saudi Arabia and we must coexist,” he was cited as saying by ISNA. “The embassies of the two countries should reopen in order to solve our problems in a better way.”\n\nIran protests\n\nBusiness owners and factory workers in Iran’s Kurdish region went on strike over the weekend as anti-government protests continued.\n\nVideo shared with CNN by pro-reform activist outlet IranWire shows Sanandaj, the capital of the Kurdish region, quiet at the beginning of the work week as stores remain shut.\n\nThe Norway-based Iranian rights group Hengaw said shopkeepers were on strike in Bukan, Sanandaj and Saqez, as well as Marivan. Strikes and protests have become common in cities and towns across Iran as people unite against the regime.\n\nThe nationwide protests are now in their fifth week, triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died three days after being arrested by the country’s morality police and taken to a re-education center.\n\nHere’s the latest on this developing story:\n\nIran will file a lawsuit against the United States claiming the US had direct involvement in recent riots, Kazem Gharibabadi, the deputy head of the Iranian judiciary and secretary of the country’s High Council for Human Rights, said on Saturday, according to state news agency IRNA.\n\nThe Coordinating Council of Iranian Teachers’ Trade Associations (CCITTA) on Saturday called for a nationwide strike in protest at the recent deaths and detention of students in the country, according to a statement published on Telegram. The council also announced a period of public mourning for students who have died in recent weeks from Thursday through Saturday, and called for a sit-in on Sunday, October 23 and Monday, October 24.\n\nProtests took place in central Berlin on Saturday, with close to 80,000 people standing in solidarity with Iran, German state broadcaster RBB reported, citing police officials.\n\nThe digest\n\nIsrael and Lebanon could sign maritime border agreement on Thursday, Biden energy adviser says\n\nSenior US adviser for global energy security Amos Hochstein said on Sunday that Israel and Lebanon could sign their historic maritime borders agreement as early as Thursday.\n\nBackground: “We’re going to have a deal. We’re going to sign it hopefully this Thursday,” Hochstein said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “And I hope that this continues our commitment to stability in the region and prosperity for both countries,” he added.\n\nWhy it matters: The US-brokered agreement settles a years-long maritime border dispute involving major oil and gas fields in the Mediterranean. Still technically at war, Lebanon and Israel both have much to gain. Not only does the agreement cool down recent security tensions, it also allows Israel to begin drilling and exporting gas to Europe and offers potential economic relief to Lebanon.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says LGBTQ people subjected to arrest and mistreatment in Qatar ahead of World Cup\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused Qatar’s security forces of arbitrarily arresting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and subjecting them to ill-treatment in detention ahead of the FIFA World Cup.\n\nBackground: HRW said in a report issued Monday that it documented six cases of “severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022,” the most recent of which took place in September. Security forces arrested people in public places based solely on their gender expression and unlawfully searched their phones, the HRW report said, adding that as a requirement for their release, security forces mandated that transgender women detainees attend “conversion therapy sessions” at a government-sponsored “behavioral healthcare” center. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and punishable by imprisonment. A Qatari official told CNN that the HRW allegations “contain information that is categorically and unequivocally false.”\n\nWhy it matters: Ahead of the FIFA World Cup, which starts November 20, Qatar has said it would welcome LGBT visitors, after concerns were raised from the LGBT community over how safe they will be at the tournament.\n\nEgypt has ordered the release of prominent activist, presidential pardon committee member says\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Monday pardoned a prominent activist and former parliamentarian, Zyad el-Elaimy, according to a presidential pardon committee member.\n\nBackground: Jailed since 2019, el-Elaimy was one of the key participants in the 2011 uprisings that led to the downfall of former longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. His release is “in response to calls by political parties and forces,” presidential pardon committee member Tarek el-Khouly wrote on Facebook. Young members of political parties, politicians and the presidential pardon committee also coordinated to help secure his release, added el-Khouly. El-Elaimy was given a five-year sentence last year on charges of spreading false news.\n\nWhy it matters: The release comes two weeks ahead of November’s COP27 summit in Egypt. The country has come in for sharp criticism in recent months, with activists denouncing global leaders’ attendance in the light of Sisi’s questionable human rights record. Egypt has been promoting moves to improve its rights record, but activists and critics have described recent reforms as mostly cosmetic.\n\nWhat’s trending\n\nA view of a light and sound show during Deepotsav celebrations, on the eve of the Diwali, on October 23 in Ayodhya, India. Deepak Gupta/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nUnited Arab Emirates: #Diwali\n\nAlso known as Deepavali, the holiday is widely trending across social platforms in the United Arab Emirates, with many flooding Twitter with colorful photos of candles and wishing joy and prosperity to the world.\n\nSome are also posting photos of themselves in traditional celebratory garments.

Approximately 15% of the diaspora are in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, added the Indian embassy, while the rest are in six northern Emirates, including business hub Dubai.\n\nThe UAE also accounts for 33% of foreign remittances to India, at more than $20 billion a year.\n\nDiwali is also significant for Sikhs and Jains. It is celebrated in India, Nepal, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries with South Asian diasporas.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim Abbas Al Lawati", "Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}]}

Some deportations may also occur on commercial flights under the commercial air operations division.\n\nICE did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nWhich airlines operate deportation flights?\n\nMost chartered deportation flights are operated by companies that do not sell tickets commercially. The Associated Press reported that the deal between Avelo and DHS/ICE appears to be the only current contract for full aircraft deportation flights with a regular, scheduled commercial airline.\n\nThat said, some deportations can occur on commercial flights, and the deportee may fly accompanied or unaccompanied, depending on the details of the case.\n\nAre detainees handcuffed during the flights?\n\nAccording to ProPublica's reporting, migrants on chartered deportation flights are often shackled during deportation flights. ICE's description of ICE Air did not specify if migrants who are deported on commercial flights are treated similarly.\n\nDo detainees fly with other customers?\n\nSometimes. According to ICE, some deportations are carried out on commercial flights, but large-scale deportation efforts rely more heavily on chartered aircraft that do not simultaneously fly paying passengers.\n\nDo flight attendants run a regular service?\n\nAccording to ProPublica's report, flight attendants on chartered deportation flights were prohibited from providing refreshments to passengers other than the guards.\n\nWho pays the airline for these flights?\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement pays for deportation flights.\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter and writes the Cruising Altitude column for USA TODAY.

Mehta issued his brief order, which also applied to seven other defendants whose sentences were commuted Monday, following that visit.\n\nThe order states that all eight defendants need Mehta's permission to visit the Capitol in particular as well as Washington, D.C. in general.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department said in its motion that the commutation of Rhodes' sentence means he is no longer subject to the terms of probation or a supervised release from prison.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Quite a day': Devastated Pacific Palisades neighborhood abuzz ahead of Trump visit\n\nLOS ANGELES – Activity buzzed outside Fire Station No. 69 in the Pacific Palisades late Friday morning in anticipation of President Trump’s arrival to inspect the wildfire damage.\n\nThe throng gathered less than a block from burned-down neighborhoods included members of the Secret Service, Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Teddy’s Tacos.\n\n“It’s quite a day,’’ said Teddy Vasquez, 39, surveying the scene near his taco truck that has been serving free food outside the firehouse since less than 72 hours after the fires broke out Jan. 7. “Firefighters left their homes to be out here. The least I could do is come out here and feed them.’’\n\nWith Trump expected to arrive by helicopter at about 2:30 p.m. local time, law enforcement walked along nearby Fiske Street, a demolished block of homes that Trump is expected to survey after an aerial tour of the ruin.\n\nAlso, banquet tables have been set up inside the fire department for an emergency briefing that will include the president. Fire captain Jeff Brown, a key participant in the activities, declined comment. But Vasquez, the taco truck owner, was happy to chat about Trump’s impending arrival as his workers began to heat flour tortillas.\n\n“Hoping President Trump likes tacos,’’ said Vasquez, who lives in Long Beach. “I think he will after he tries Teddy’s.’’\n\n– Josh Peter\n\n“I want more babies,” Vance says in his first speech as vice president\n\nVice President JD Vance on Friday told anti-abortion activists at their annual March for Life rally in Washington that the country had failed its citizens.\n\n“We failed a generation not only by permitting a culture of abortion on demand, but also by neglecting to help young parents achieve the ingredients they need to lead a happy and meaningful life,” he said.\n\nHe said a “culture of radical individualism” had led to people viewing the “responsibilities and joys” of raising a family as obstacles.\n\n“Our society has failed to recognize the obligation that one generation has to another as a core part of living in a society,” he said. “So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America.”\n\nVance, a former senator from Ohio, has advocated boosting the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $5,000 per child to help with the cost of raising children.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\n‘Houses, trailers, bodies’ float past during Asheville flood: victim\n\nThomas Bright described for President Trump his harrowing escape from a home that had been in his family for 80 years and four generations before Hurricane Helene destroyed it.\n\nBright woke up at 5 a.m. to the sound of trees falling on the house in the Azalea Road area of East Asheville. He began moving five vehicles from around the house to a road about one-third of a mile away, as the floodwaters began to rise.\n\nWhen the water was ankle-deep inside the house, he retreated to a loft. When the water reached their hips, he made a makeshift ladder to climb onto the roof.\n\nHe spent four hours on the roof writing farewell notes on his cellphone to his two children and his two grandchildren as debris from the storm floated past. His garage floated away before the water crested at about 4 feet high on the roof.\n\n“We didn’t think we were going to make it at all,” Bright said. “We were watching houses, trailers, bodies coming by us.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n‘Horrific’: Fairview resident tells Trump of flood and bodies\n\nMona Nix-Roper, who lives in the Fairview area of North Carolina, told President Trump her home became like an island in September as floodwaters from Hurricane Helene rose around it.\n\nShe was home alone because her husband was staying with a 98-year-old neighbor to make sure she was alright. When Nix went out to check the road and bridge that provide access to her home, she found they were gone.\n\nFire Department officials urged her the next day to evacuate because of the risk of landslides. Her 21-year-old son Nathan hiked in five miles after roads became impassable to help her leave.\n\n“He said, ‘Mom, grab a bag, we’ve got to go,’” Nix said. “I said, ‘Son, there’s no way I can hike out of here.’ He said, ‘No, we’ve got to go.’”\n\nAs they walked out, they saw a neighbor’s body that had turned blue in the water.\n\n“Horrific is just all I can say,” Nix said. “There were people out everywhere looking for their loved ones. And there were dead bodies. My son’s like, ‘Mom, you’re going to see things you don’t want to see.’”\n\nNix’s home was without power for two months, so she lived in her church’s sound room. Others had lost everything, so she said she is embarrassed to ask for help.\n\n“We need help,” Nix said. “It’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nTrump appeared moved.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of bad things, but I’ve never seen anything like it,” Trump said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump thanks March for Life activists via video\n\nWhen Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, President Trump on Friday said a “historic wrong was set right” thanks to the “tireless work and devotion across five decades” of anti-abortion rights activists as he addressed March for Life rallygoers at the National Mall.\n\n“Three years ago, I was so proud to be a participant,” he said. “Six courageous justices of the Supreme Court of the United States returned the issue to the state legislatures and to the people where it belongs.”\n\nIn his second term, Trump said he would “stand proudly for families and for life.”\n\n“Under my leadership, the reformed Department of Justice will finally investigate the radical left attacks on churches and crisis pregnancy centers, and we will bring perpetrator to justice,” he said.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nPastor describes generosity of volunteers helping recovery\n\nPastor Ramona Nix told President Trump she had dedicated her Eagle Rock, North Carolina church a week before the storm arrived with Hurricane Helene in September.\n\nNix stayed in the church building for three months, sleeping on the floor for three weeks, because the community’s needs were so great. Her son ferried supplies in, Nix said.\n\n“Before the week was over, the church was so packed, we couldn’t even walk,” Nix said. “Even our sanctuary, it was up to the platform.”\n\nVolunteers arrived from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana and Oklahoma to help with the recovery. “They were coming in day and night,” Nix said.\n\nAt one point, Nix asked a woman who arrived if she could do anything special for her.\n\n“She said, ‘I don’t want to be selfish, but could I have a cup of coffee,’” Nix said. “I handed her that coffee and she stood there. Tears just poured. She said, ‘You don’t realize how important the little things.’ It’s not the big things in life that we have, but it’s the little things.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\n‘I didn’t think I was going to make it’: NC victim to Trump\n\nKim West described her harrowing escape from her home as it flooded from Hurricane Helene in September, as President Trump visited the storm-ravaged Swannanoa, North Carolina.\n\nAs the river waters rose near their house, Kim and her husband Chris West started moving vehicles to higher ground along the road. By then, water was ankle deep inside the house. Kim West grabbed her purse and pug dog, and Chris West put dog food in a trash bag.\n\n“By the time we got into the driveway, it was already waist deep,” West said. “I didn’t think I was going to make it.”\n\nThey were stuck on local roads for hours because of flooding. The waters finally receded about midnight, after they began evacuating at 5 a.m.\n\n“We just lost everything that we had,” West said. “Didn’t even have a brush for like three days.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nThune and Johnson address March for Life rallygoers\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday addressed the annual March for Life rally at the National Mall in Washington, saying the anti-abortion rights protesters were “not alone.”\n\n“You are part of a great movement united around the truth. That every life is precious,” he said. “I stand with you in this fight and so do many of my colleagues in Congress.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., talked about being a “product of an unplanned teen pregnancy\" born in 1972, one year before abortion was legalized when Roe v. Wade became the law of the land.\n\n“I am so eternally grateful that my mom and dad ignored all the people who told them to just take care of that problem,” he said. “They chose to embrace life and to have me the first of their four children.”\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump granted pardons to 23 anti-abortion rights activists.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump suggests abolishing FEMA\n\nPresident Trump ratcheted up his criticism with the suggestion he might abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency because of its response in North Carolina to lingering damage from Hurricane Helene in September.\n\n“I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe even getting rid of FEMA,” Trump said after a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina. “Frankly, FEMA’s not good.”\n\nTrump accused FEMA crews of being unfamiliar with areas when responding to disasters. FEMA also imposes rules and requirements on crews that aren’t as good as what local officials provide, Trump said. The federal government should instead send funding to governors to manage their own response to disasters, he said.\n\n“FEMA has turned out to be a disaster,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly – we pay a percentage to the state.”\n\nAfter speaking with flood victims in Swannanoa, North Carolina, Trump later added, “If it was up to me right now, I’d end it right now.\"\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nPolitics shadow Trump's visit to North Carolina\n\nGlimpses of the politics behind disaster aid were visible as President Trump visited North Carolina to review damage from Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump recalled a whistleblower reported that Federal Emergency Management Agency crews refused to help people with Trump's 2024 presidential campaign signs in their yards. “That’s not good,” the president said.\n\nTrump noted that North Carolina and adjoining Tennessee each supported him in the last election – the Volunteer State slightly more.\n\nThe president also called for California to adopt voter ID, to ensure the citizenship of voters, to receive disaster aid for its wildfires around Los Angeles.\n\nThroughout his comments at a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina, Trump cited problems with former President Joe Biden’s response to the disaster that left 104 people in North Carolina dead, 73,000 homes severely damaged or destroyed and Asheville without running water for two months.\n\n“It doesn’t matter at this point: Biden did a bad job,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTennessee governor thanks Trump for helping Appalachia\n\nTennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, whose state abuts North Carolina and was also damaged by Hurricane Helene, attended President Trump’s briefing on the disaster and thanked him.\n\n“The people in this region – including Tennessee, the people of Appalachia – are grateful that you are here and that you haven’t forgotten them,” Lee said. “There are other disasters. This was enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee.”\n\nTrump joked about which state gave him more votes. “I hate to tell you, North Carolina, it was Tennessee,\" the president said.\n\nLee said one of the counties hurt in the disaster supported Trump with 88% of the vote.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says Anthony Fauci can hire his own security\n\nPresident Trump said the federal security detail for Dr. Anthony Fauci, a former head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease, had been removed Thursday because it can’t last a lifetime and he could hire his own protection.\n\nFauci led the federal health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to harsh criticism from Republicans about studies of the origin of the disease and the lockdowns to combat it during the first year.\n\n“When you work for government, at some point your security detail comes off,” Trump told reporters while visiting storm-damaged North Carolina. “You can’t have them forever.”\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also lost their security details during the first week of his administration.\n\n“They all made a lot of money, they can hire their own security, too,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nNC Reps. Edwards, Foxx and Moore to help lead recovery\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, announced he would help guide recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene with three House Republicans from the region with the most damage.\n\nThe lawmakers are GOP Reps. Chuck Edwards, Virginia Foxx and Tim Moore.\n\nTrump announced that Whatley would lead the recovery effort with Democratic Gov. Josh Stein.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump wants voter ID in California for disaster aid\n\nPresident Trump said on Friday he would like to see two changes in California – the adoption of voter ID and the redirection of water from the northern part of the state to the south – in exchange for disaster aid for wildfires.\n\nTrump said he wanted voter identification to ensure the citizenship of voters. He also repeated his complaint that the state should divert funding from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Los Angeles to fight fires.\n\n“I want two things,” Trump told reporters upon his arrival in Asheville, North Carolina. “After that, I will be the greatest president California has ever seen.”\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says OPEC lowering oil prices is key to stopping war in Ukraine\n\nTrump said his proposal for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce the price of oil is key to stopping the war in Ukraine.\n\n“We want to see OPEC cut the price of oil and that will automatically stop the tragedy that’s taking place in Ukraine,” Trump said in Asheville, North Carolina. “It’s a butchering tragedy, for both sides, by the way.”\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said a key to stopping the war is for OPEC to cut its prices because “if you have it high, that war is not going to end so easily.”\n\n“OPEC ought to get on the ball and they ought to drop the price of oil and that war will stop right away,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump offers ‘a lot of money’ to NC, overhaul of FEMA\n\nPresident Trump told reporters in Asheville, North Carolina, that the federal government would supply “a lot of the money” to repair damage from floods and landslides after Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump also proposed to overhaul the FEMA so that states respond to their own disasters rather than the federal government.\n\n“We’re going to fix it as fast as we can,” Trump said. “It’s a massive amount of damage.”\n\nTrump said Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein would work on plans for demolition of damaged buildings and cleaning up debris. Trump said the federal government would probably provide 75% of the funding.\n\n“We’re going to supply the money, a lot of the money,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said he would review “the whole concept of FEMA” because states such as Florida with hurricanes and Oklahoma with tornadoes are better at responding to disasters.\n\n“I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,” Trump said. “I think you’re going to find it a lot less expensive – less than half – and you’re going to get a much quicker response.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff ‘glad’ Trump will see devastation from wildfires\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, a frequent critic of President Trump, said he’s glad Trump is visiting Los Angeles to tour the wildfire damage but that he and Sen. Alex Padilla have votes scheduled and couldn’t attend.\n\n“I’m glad that he’s going to see the devastation because I think, frankly, until you see it and the scope of it – whole neighborhoods gone block after block after block – it’s hard to wrap your head around,” Schiff told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”\n\nBut Schiff said he hoped Trump and congressional Republicans wouldn’t put conditions on funding for disaster aid.\n\n“We've never done that when it comes to our fellow citizens who are hurting,” Schiff said. “And California, frankly, has been the most generous state in terms of supporting our fellow citizens, whether they're in red states or blue when they face disaster.”\n\nSchiff said overhauling the Environmental Protection Agency and the FEMA, as Trump has suggested, are areas that could lead to bipartisan support.\n\n“All of that is ample ground to get together and make things happen,” Schiff said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he didn’t invite California Sen. Adam Schiff on trip\n\nPresident Trump said he didn’t invite Sen. Adam Schiff, a frequent Democratic critic, on the trip to areas of Los Angeles damaged by wildfires.\n\n“Is he going? I don't know. I mean, I really don't know,” Trump said. “You know, if he's going to be there it would be cheaper, but I didn't invite him. Somebody did.\"\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., has asked that disaster aid for California not come with strings attached, after Republicans suggested potential restrictions on the funding. Schiff is a former member of the U.S. House who previously led the first impeachment of Trump over his dealings with Ukraine and has questioned whether his nominees to become Cabinet secretaries will act independently from him.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he will watch ‘March for Life’\n\nPresident Trump said he would be watching the “March for Life” in Washington as he traveled to North Carolina and California to visit disaster areas. He said Vice President JD Vance would represent the administration “very well.”\n\n“I’m going to be watching it,” Trump said. “He’s going to be representing us very well.”\n\nTrump also noted that he pardoned 23 people who he said were \"unjustly\" charged for protesting outside abortion clinics.\n\n“It was disgraceful what happened,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump calls DOD nominee Pete Hegseth ‘a good man’\n\nPresident Trump praised his nominee to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, as a “good man” but didn’t predict what would happen with his Senate confirmation vote scheduled for late Friday.\n\n“He’s a good man. I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Trump said. “I hope he makes it.”\n\nGOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against limiting debate on the nomination. Trump also questioned whether Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would support Hegseth because Trump and McConnell have had disputes in the past.\n\n“I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: North Carolina was ‘allowed to fester’\n\nPresident Trump told reporters on Friday morning outside the White House that he’s going to North Carolina because the state has been treated badly since Hurricane Helene and to California where he said the wildfires should have been extinguished already.\n\n“North Carolina is a horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester. It should have been done months ago,” Trump said. “North Carolina has been treated very badly.”\n\nTrump will visit Los Angeles later in the day to hear about the wildfires.\n\n“We’re going to take a look at the fire if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's travel schedule ‒ minute by minute\n\nPresident Trump left the White House by helicopter at 9:16 a.m. for his tour of disaster areas in North Carolina and California on Friday.

Stein to meet Trump\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is planning to meet Trump on the tarmac of Asheville Regional Airport during Trump’s visit to Western North Carolina, according to The Citizen-Times, a USA TODAY Network partner.\n\nEarlier in the week, Stein, a Democrat, said Trump’s planned visit to western North Carolina, which was ravaged by Tropical Storm Helene nearly four months ago, was “very good news” for the region’s residents. The storm killed more than 100 people across the state and caused an estimated $60 billion in damage, according to the latest estimate from the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management.\n\n‒ Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nWhat is Trump’s schedule today?\n\nTrump's disaster-area tour begins around 10 a.m. EST on his first trip away from Washington.

Near the city's historic downtown, Biden and his team could see flattened buildings, gutted structures and knocked down trees. The tour also crossed over Biltmore village, the River Arts district and east Asheville as well as Swannanoa and Black Mountain.\n\n\"I'm here to say the United States – the nation – has your back.

For the latest news, view our story for Tuesday, Feb. 4.\n\nWASHINGTON – Salvage crews on Monday began removing wreckage from the Potomac River after the collision of an American Airlines passenger jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter killed 67 people in the deadliest air disaster in more than two decades.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is leading the removal effort, which will first focus on retrieving the mangled passenger plane before turning to the helicopter and its associated debris.\n\nCol. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers said at an afternoon news briefing that additional remains were found during recovery efforts Monday, noting that the team to committed to the \"dignified process\" of retrieving victims. So far, authorities have identified 55 people killed in the crash.\n\n\"I do want to emphasize that should any remains be located, we have done and will continue to do an automatic work stoppage until the proper coordination with the appropriate authorities can be conducted,\" Pera said.\n\nOfficials said they expect it will take three days to remove the passenger plane from the water near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. On Monday, several cranes could be seen lifting large pieces of debris. Pera confirmed at an afternoon news briefing that crews recovered the first of two engines, the fuselage and had started to retrieve a wing out of the water.\n\nMost of the recovered items are expected to sit on a barge overnight before they are transported to a hangar, where they will be assessed as part of a National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the cause of the collision.\n\nThe focus on Tuesday will shift to recovering the plane's cockpit, Pera said, noting that wind gusts and tidal conditions could affect salvage operations.\n\nStudents, Olympic skaters, families: A tribute to lives lost in the DC plane crash\n\nLarge section of the plane's fuselage lifted from the water\n\nRecovery crews pulled a massive, jagged piece of the airliner's fuselage from the Pataomic River on Monday afternoon, by far the largest section of the plane salvaged since it collided with an Army helicopter and plummeted into the waterway near Reagan National Airport.\n\nThe large, white metal sheet hung delicately from the crane's yellow clasps as crews moved it onto the barrage. Wires appeared to dangle off its broken edges. Three window holes and a combination of number and letters −N709PS − along with a small American flag were visible along the side.\n\nOfficials have said multiple bodies are believed to still be located within the fuselage of the plane, which is complicating the ongoing salvage effort.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWhat the day's news means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nPart of Potomac River closed to unauthorized boats\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard closed off a large portion of the Potomac River on Monday as multiple agencies coordinated in the removal of the remaining wreckage and bodies following the deadly collision.\n\nCapt. Patrick Burkett said in a news conference Sunday that the river north of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge is closed to all vessels that have not been vetted and authorized to enter the so-called \"safety zone.\" The bridge is located south of Washington and Reagan National Airport, and it connects Alexandria, Virginia, and Oxon Hill, Maryland.\n\nFour small boats are monitoring that area as well as two Coast Guard cutters \"to ensure only those authorized vessels\" gain entry, he said. The Coast Guard has deployed about 200 personnel to assist in the recovery effort.\n\nNTSB completes interviews with air traffic control tower staff\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board investigators have completed interviews with all five staffers who were in the Reagan airport air traffic control tower at the time of the collision, the agency said in a Monday update.\n\nThe NTSB has also obtained training and flight logs for both flight crews and said it is building \"several day histories\" of each worker, including \"daily activities.\"\n\nIn addition to personnel records, the agency said it has maintenance logs for the jet and helicopter. Investigators are also working to synchronize data from the black boxes, air traffic control communications and radar scope to piece together a detailed timeline. The Army helicopter's flight data recorder does not have timestamps so the agency said it will have to create them manually, which could take additional time to validate.\n\nThe NTSB said a preliminary report on its investigation is expected within 30 days of the collision. The final report, which will identify a probable cause of the crash and any contributing factors, will take one to two years.\n\nIn the Potomac River, recovery efforts appear slow and solemn\n\nThose driving past the airport Monday morning wouldn’t know by looking out their windows that recovery efforts were taking place.\n\nThe scene was quiet. A single black helicopter hovered back-and-forth over the salvage site. Police boats with blinking blue lights floated in the water. Every few minutes, commercial jets lifted off the runway heading southeast over the wreckage.\n\nCranes lifted debris material out of the water and on to a pair of U.S. Navy barges. A diver with scuba tanks could be seen standing on the back of a police boat, ready to jump into the frigid water.\n\nInside Reagan National Airport, the airport was bustling as travelers sitting by windows near Terminal 1 drank coffee, used their laptops and phones and awaited flights.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\n'Unspeakable loss': Dozens of victims had ties to figure skating\n\nNearly half of the passengers aboard the doomed airliner that collided with an Army helicopter last week were members of the figure skating community, Samuel Auxier, CEO of U.S. Figure Skating said in a statement.\n\n\"Those whom we lost dedicated their lives to perfecting the sport of figure skating, many with the goal of one day becoming Olympians. We will never forget them,\" Auxier said. \"May their passion and excellence inspire us and give us strength in the days ahead. For now, our hearts are heavy with sorrow, and we stand with their families and friends as we grieve this unspeakable loss. \"\n\nThe 28 members of the skating community were returning from a development camp for promising figure skaters held in Wichita, Kansas, after the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating national championships.\n\nIn a tribute video posted on social media, U.S. Figure Skating identified 11 skaters − all ages 11 to 16 − as being among the victims. Four coaches also died in the collision, including married couple Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, Olympians who won the 1994 pairs world championship with Russia.

Despite the competitive nature of the sport, Edmunds said the camp was an opportunity to foster friendships with fellow skaters.\n\n\"It's not the same as competition because they're not directly being pitted against each other,\" she said. \"They get to do it all together.\"\n\nEdmunds, who competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, said the news of their deaths has rocked the skating community. She has spent the last few days reveling in their young talents, watching videos of their prized choreography.\n\n\"I'm so happy that they were able to achieve what they did at such a young age already and be able to be a part of this elite skating community,\" Edmunds said. \"I'm so grateful that I was able to encounter them and their spirits throughout their journey.\"\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nWhat's next in the investigation into the plane-helicopter crash?\n\nThe NTSB has recovered the black boxes from both the passenger jet and the military helicopter. The recording devices are essential during crash-related probes as they provide investigators with crucial information, including internal communications and data on the aircraft's altitude, instrument readings and power settings.\n\nSo far, the agency has cited information recovered from the devices in its suggestion that the helicopter was above the 200-foot ceiling for the route it was flying over the Potomac River on Wednesday night.\n\nThe agency said it hope to have a complete transcription of the communications among the aircraft and traffic controllers, NTSB member Todd Inman said Saturday during a press briefing. A preliminary report on the incident is expected within 30 days, according to NTSB officials.\n\nPlane increased in pitch right before collision\n\nThe agency in recent days has shed light on the staffing at Reagan National Airport's control tower and the timeline of the collision.\n\nThe agency's lead investigator, Brice Banning, said seconds after the air traffic control tower directed the Black Hawk helicopter to pass behind the plane at about 8:47 p.m. ET, there was a \"verbal reaction\" from the plane crew and flight data showed the plane begin to increase in pitch just before sounds of impact.\n\nFive people were in the air traffic control tower at Reagan National Airport at the time of the crash, including an operations supervisor with oversight of the tower and an operations supervisor in training, Inman said.\n\nContributing: John Bacon and Mike Snider, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/investing/spirit-frontier-airlines-merger/index.html", "title": "Spirit and Frontier Airlines plan to merge | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSpirit and Frontier Airlines on Monday announced a $6.6 billion merger, a combination of low-fare carriers that would create America’s fifth-largest airline.\n\nThe companies have yet to say what brand they’ll fly under or who would lead management of the new airline. The combined company would offer more than 1,000 daily flights to over 145 destinations.\n\nThe merged carrier would leapfrog JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) in the number of miles flown by paying passengers, according to 2021 statistics, putting them behind the four major airlines that control about 80% of the nation’s air traffic – American, Delta (DAL), United (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n“This transaction is centered around creating an aggressive ultra-low fare competitor to serve our guests even better, expand career opportunities for our team members and increase competitive pressure, resulting in more consumer-friendly fares for the flying public,” said Spirit CEO Ted Christie.\n\nThere are only 519 routes currently served by both airlines, out of 2,832 combined routes, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. That’s equal to just 18% of their routes, suggesting a combination will have only limited impact on reducing competition for passengers.\n\nLike most of the US airline industry, Spirit and Frontier have been struggling with losses the last two years as air travel plunged during the pandemic. On Monday, Spirit reported a 2021 loss of $440.6 million, excluding special items, such as federal assistance that went to all US airlines. That was an improvement from the $719.6 million it lost on that basis in 2020. Frontier reported it lost $299 million on that basis in 2021, roughly the same as in 2020.\n\nBut the two airlines’ combined fourth quarter revenue was down only 2% from their combined revenue in the final three months of 2019. That’s much closer to pre-pandemic levels than at the four major airlines. Much of that is due to the fact they depend primarily on leisure travelers, not business passengers, who have been slower to return to flying.\n\nLow fares, low approval\n\nThe combination would bring together two airlines that have very low base fares, but charge passengers extra for most things, including carry-on bags. Although their passengers might like the low fares, many don’t like the experience of flying with them.\n\nSpirit had by far the highest number of passenger complaints, with 13.25 complaints per 100,000 passengers, according to stats from January through September 2021 kept by the US Department of Transportation. JetBlue had the second most complaints on that basis with 6.85, while Frontier had the third most in the industry with 5.76. Frontier had by far the worst rate of complaints in the same period of 2020, when it recorded 60.24 complaints per 100,000 customers.\n\nFrontier and Spirit also had the industry’s worst customer satisfaction ratings, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index.\n\nFrontier suffered some badly-timed service problems Monday morning, soon after it announced the planned merger. A technology issue temporarily resulted in all of its flights being grounded, the FAA disclosed. The statement from the airline said the problem was quickly fixed.\n\n“Earlier today, we experienced a technology issue which led to some flight delays and cancellations,” it said in a midday statement. “The issue was identified and has been resolved. We are working to restore our flight schedule for the balance of the day.”\n\nRegulatory hurdles\n\nWhether or not the merger will be approved by federal antitrust regulators remains uncertain. The Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive approach on antitrust issues. It recently blocked an alliance between American and JetBlue that fell short of a full merger. Increasing competition in the airline industry is one of the issues that the Biden administration has cited as a priority.\n\nExecutives involved in the proposed Spirit-Frontier deal say they believe the merger will bring more competition to the industry.\n\n“This is the type of transaction the administration should in fact support,” Bill Franke, chair of Frontier’s board and the managing partner of Indigo Partners, Frontier’s majority shareholder, said in an interview Monday on CNBC. “It’s beneficial to the consumers. It’s beneficial to the employees. It’s beneficial to the communities that the airlines serve. And at the end of the day, even in combination, these two airlines will control less than 10% of the market.”\n\nBut experts aren’t sure the regulatory approval will be as easy as the airlines hope.\n\n“In a normal environment we would not expect any regulatory hurdles given the relatively small market share of each airline. But given the Biden Administration’s ‘big is bad’ approach we would expect some objection,” said Savanthi Syth, airline analyst with Raymond James.\n\nThe US airline industry has been greatly reshaped by mergers in the last 25 years. The four largest airlines today were formed from a series of mergers of 10 airlines. This would be the United States’ first airline merger since Alaska Air purchased Virgin America in 2016.\n\nThe $6.6 billion value of the deal includes assumed debt, such as aircraft leases. The value of the stock and cash being exchanged would be $2.8 billion, based on Friday’s closing price.\n\nFrontier would be the purchasing airline in this deal, as Spirit (SAVE) shareholders would receive 1.9126 shares of Frontier plus $2.13 in cash for each of their shares. That would represent about a 20% premium based on Friday’s closing price. But Spirit (SAVE) shares are up only 13% in midday trading, while Frontier shares were little changed, suggesting investor uncertainty about the deal being completed.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/10/01/anderson-county-hurricane-helene-south-carolina-trees-roadways-powerlines-emergency-team/75454033007/", "title": "Anderson County continues Hurricane Helene cleanup, what to know", "text": "Anderson County remains in a state of emergency after Hurricane Helene passed through South Carolina last week.\n\nThe storm brought down power lines and numerous trees that blocked 600 county roadways.\n\nLocal authorities, state and federal partners, including the National Guard, Lexington and Horry County public work crews, and emergency response teams, are working tirelessly to clear debris-blocked roads, restore power to affected areas, and assist the injured.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Anderson County Emergency Team, an additional 20% of roads have opened as of Monday night, with approximately 130 still closed. Local authorities have advised residents to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel until all hazards are cleared.\n\nDrivers should be aware of eight impassable streets in Anderson County: Grady Hall, Gray Drive, Coachman Drive, Harbin Road, Old Bell Road, Simpson Road, Colorado Lane, and Pettigrew Road.\n\nAnderson County Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer Shale Remien emphasized the importance of being aware that even if there's a downed tree and a power line, their crews cannot clear the road until the power company has disconnected the line. Once this is done, they can remove the trees from the road.\n\nRemien also mentioned that people may notice many trees scattered across the county on the side of the road, but these will be the last things the crews will address.\n\nDonations in Anderson County\n\nThe Anderson Regional Airport is at Heli Plane Aviation, collecting donations for North Carolina Hurricane relief supply efforts. Multiple helicopters will be loaded later today to help those more severely affected by the storm. Please consider donating to help with this effort.\n\nSuggested items included Non-perishable food, Bottled water, First aid items, Clothes, Hygiene products, a Flashlight, Batteries, Candles, Solar chargers, and Small emergency radios.\n\nBurn Ban Upstate\n\nStarting Tuesday, October 1, the SC Forestry Commission issued a burn ban in Anderson County. Twenty counties impacted the most by the storm, including Anderson, are not allowed to burn remaining wood or debris in unincorporated areas.\n\nSCFC Fire Chief Darryl Jones said, \"We understand people may wonder why a burning ban is necessary when more than half of the state has received so much rain. However, we’re issuing the ban not because of elevated fire danger but rather because so many of our firefighting and emergency personnel and resources are committed to hurricane-related response.” He added, \"This does not include fire for food or outdoor fireplaces.\"\n\nTown of Pendleton roadway cleanup\n\nAccording to Pendleton, a town-wide roadway cleanup is in progress. Crews are removing debris from roads. The town reported that most debris will be cleared within the next few weeks. Residents should know that the town can only collect limbs no more than 6 feet long and 6 inches in diameter.\n\nThe town also reported that they will not pick up anything placed by contractors unless the removal is for elderly residents who need assistance and can not remove full trees. Despite the storm, sanitation services in the Town of Pendleton will run normally. Residents can continue to place their carts out as usual.\n\nHere is a list of roadways that have passage issues or debris.\n\n--Calhoun Street\n\n--Cherry Street at Lebanon Road & South Elm Street\n\n--Chester Circle\n\n--East Main Street at Lebanon Road\n\n--Giles Street\n\n--Hopkins Avenue\n\n--Jackson Street\n\n--Keese Street\n\n--Mechanic Street at Broad moving North\n\n--Morse Street West Side\n\n--Poplar Street at Woodland Circle\n\n--Shannon Drive TCTC side\n\n--Shirley Street\n\n--Stephen's Road\n\n--West Queen Street Streetscape to S Curves\n\n--Westinghouse Road\n\n--Westminster Street 400 block\n\n--Woodland Circle 500 Block.\n\nTown of Williamston debris disposal\n\nThe town of Williamston reported that on Monday, crews began removing storm debris from Hurricane Helene's impact.\n\nHere is the Town of Williamston ordinances for debris disposal:\n\nTree limbs up to 4 inches in diameter should be no longer than 6 feet. Tree limbs over 4 inches in diameter should be no longer than 2 feet. No pile of yard waste shall exceed 4 feet in height and 10 feet in width. If multiple piles are needed, please ensure at least 2 feet of space between each pile.\n\nLarger limbs will be placed in a staging area where folks will be offered the opportunity to cut them up to use as firewood. Keep larger limbs separate from smaller limbs and other yard waste. If you wish to transport your fallen limbs to the debris staging area, please contact Greg Paige at 864-958-6291 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. to coordinate.\n\nThe town of Williamston plans to pick up garbage on a regular schedule. This will continue as long as sanitation crews can access the landfill.\n\nTown of West Pelzer recovery efforts\n\nAccording to the town of West Pelzer, due to storm damage and the prolonged power outage, the West Pelzer Municipal Center and the O'Dell Community Center will be closed until power is restored. Staff members have limited access to email and phone calls/voicemails, but they continue to work on behalf of the Town and will respond as soon as they can access messages and contacts.\n\nThe town of West Pelzer also reported that Mayor Jim Riddle and Town Administrator Paula Payton have been in regular contact with all available area relief agencies to keep them aware of the storm's effects on West Pelzer and are receiving updates on the progress of the relief efforts for our citizens.\n\nWith these extenuating circumstances, Coffee with a Cop on October 2 and the Council Meeting on October 8 will be postponed. Residents can check the Town of West Pelzer website and Facebook page for an updated schedule.\n\nSCDOT and Duke Energy are working to restore power and clear the roadway and sidewalks for safe use on Main Street/Highway 8. Due to safety concerns for vendors and attendees, the Fall Mile Long Yard Sale scheduled for Saturday has been canceled.\n\nBelton-Honea Path lift boil water advisory\n\nFollowing Hurricane Helene, Belton-Honea Path Water instructed residents to consume boiled tap or bottled water to protect public safety. Consumption included drinking, brushing teeth, making ice, food preparation, washing fruit and vegetables, and preparing baby formula. Customers did not need to boil water before using it for showering or bathing.\n\nThis notice was necessary because flooding negatively affected the water quality entering the water treatment plant so much that they couldn't be 100% certain of its safety. Officials have lifted the boil water advisory for the City of Belton and the Town of Honea Path.\n\nBottled water remains available at Leeda Poore Park for impacted families, with one case per household. Residents can resume using tap water without boiling it first, marking an step towards normalcy as the community recovers.\n\nTown of Iva recovery efforts\n\nAccording to the town of Iva, most downed trees have been cleared from the local roads.

These outlets are available for phone charging during the day and night.\n\nCases of water are also available at the town hall for anyone without power who needs some. Garbage collection is scheduled for Monday and will be collected on Tuesday, October 1.\n\nCity of Clemson cleanup plan\n\nAccording to the City of Clemson, five crews, both city and contracted, began brush cleanup in affected community areas, following a plan to expedite the cleanup as efficiently as possible. Three additional crews will be brought in tomorrow and placed in every zone.\n\nThe crews are working as quickly as possible while ensuring safety. However, they cannot safely begin cutting trees in or on power lines until Duke Energy can ground them.\n\nThe city of Clemson also reported several groups and organizations have expressed interest in helping clean up neighborhoods. If you need and are interested in receiving help, don't hesitate to get in touch with Lindsey Newton at lnewton@cityofclemson.org\n\nAccording to the city of Anderson. All games/practices held at Nettles Park are canceled on Tuesday, October 1, due to power and water outages. Volleyball games are on as scheduled at Clemson Central Recreation Center. Away game updates will be communicated by team coaches\n\nThe City of Clemson reported that the recycling drop-off at the brush grinding facility on Old Central Road is closed due to the volume of brush and debris being hauled to the facility. Please take your recyclables to the Kite Hill Recycling Center until we reopen.\n\nThe City of Anderson's recovery efforts continue\n\nAccording to the City of Anderson, household garbage crews will finish Monday’s routes and begin Tuesday’s routes. Curbside debris crews are focusing only on vegetative debris pick-up. City crews and teams from SCDOT, Anderson County, Rock Hill, and Horry County are tackling the remaining street closures as utility lines are removed.\n\nThe city asks that residents remember that tree limbs placed at the curb less than 12” inches in diameter must be 5’ or less, and anything greater than 12” in diameter must be less than 2’ in length. Contractors cutting trees for residents are responsible for hauling away the debris they cut.\n\n73,000 people are still without electricity in Anderson\n\nSince Hurricane Helene passed through the Upstate area, many residents still lack electricity, and the lack of access to essential services is causing significant disruption in their daily lives. According to the Anderson County Emergency Team, crews have restored an additional 10% of the community's power, but around 73,000 people are still without electricity.\n\nRiley Morningstar, Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative Communications Manager, said two of the 13 substations that lost transmission service remained offline on Monday due to severe damage.\n\nA statement from Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative on Monday reported that Duke Energy made progress overnight on the remaining transmission lines. They could energize approximately 3,500 members serviced by the Cross Roads and Tygerville substations.\n\nSubstations serving the Bountyland, Corinth, Newry, Six Mile, Dacusville, Gap Hill, Enon, Landrum, Liberty, Marietta, and Pleasant Ridge communities are now online. However, more work must be done for all members to have power. Broken poles must be replaced, and lines must be hung to get power from these substations to homes.\n\nSenior Vice President of Engineering and Operations Mark Waters said, \"we are moving in the right direction. “This will be a slow process, but having service restored back to our substations is very important.”\n\nBlue Ridge Electric Cooperative reported that field workers have confirmed over 450 broken poles across their five-county service area, which spans 1,900 square miles.\n\nAccording to Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative, on average, it takes a four-man crew about three to four hours to replace one broken pole. Replacing three poles in a 12-hour shift is a full day’s work for a single crew. Replacing four is a feat in these circumstances. These are not simple repairs.\n\nDuke Energy's spokesman Ryan Mosier said, \"We are currently assessing damage and making repairs across the Upstate. However, the extensive damage means some customers will experience a multi-day outage.\"\n\n\"Anderson County customers should see their service restored as late as Friday night, but we will see most customers restored well before that,\" Mosier said.\n\nWhat to do if you are still without power?\n\nAs crews assess the situation for outages in the area, residents can receive updated estimated restoration times at duke-energy.com/outagemap . The website also has information on how Duke Energy restores power , generator safety , flooding, electrical safety, and more.\n\nResidents are urged to stay patient and utilize local shelters, charging, and cooling stations if needed.\n\nAnderson County offices and libraries\n\nAnderson County Offices will open on Tuesday, October 1.\n\nThe Powdersville Treasurer’s office will remain closed at this time.\n\nThe Anderson County Library will also be open on Tuesday, October 1, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Due to the continued power outage, all other library locations will remain closed.\n\nResidents are welcome to charge devices, connect to Wi-Fi, and enjoy library materials at Anderson Main, Iva, Pendleton, Piedmont, and Honea Path locations.\n\nAnderson County Schools remain closed on Tuesday and Wednesday\n\nSchools remain closed, adding to the community's challenges during this extensive power outage. Dylan McCullough, public information officer of Anderson County District Three, stated that all Anderson County districts will observe an eLearning Day on Monday, September 30, Tuesday, October 1, and Wednesday, October 2, due to continued widespread power outages.\n\n\"Our schools will be flexible in meeting eLearning Day requirements, as we understand many families still lack access to power or the Internet,\" McCullough said.\n\nThe community is rallying together, with neighbors helping each other and local organizations, churches, schools, and universities providing food, water, and access to essential services. Emergency shelters have been set up for those needing assistance to provide relief for those in need until full power can be restored.\n\nAnderson School District One will open Spearman Elementary School on Tuesday, October 1, for community members to charge their devices.

Anderson University Homecoming has been rescheduled for Saturday, November 9. However, that date is subject to change. Details are being worked out, and more information will be announced as it becomes available.\n\nAn official announcement will be made when campus electricity is fully restored.\n\nWhat to do with debris or lingering trash?\n\nDebris and lingering trash can be found throughout Anderson County. Neighbors and community members have come together to clear the affected areas.\n\nRemien said \"it really does take a community because, unfortunately, first responders can't be everywhere at the same time when that storm hits.\"\n\nSuppose you need to remove debris or lingering trash from the storm. In that case, these Anderson County Convenience Centers are now open at King David, White Street, Parker Bowie, Starr Landfill, and Anderson Regional MRF. The remaining convenience centers will open as power is restored.\n\nResidents are encouraged to utilize these facilities to help with the cleanup efforts and ensure the community returns to normalcy as quickly as possible.\n\nHurricane Helene damage cleanup\n\nAccording to the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, if you need help with damage cleanup following Hurricane Helene, call Crisis Cleanup at 844-965-1386.\n\nIf there is property damage from Hurricane Helene, report it using the Damage Assessment tool in the SC Emergency Manager app to notify authorities.

The calculation is based on only 80 people on a removal flight, though charters generally carry 120 to 125 migrants.\n\nLawmakers have condemned the higher cost of President Donald Trump’s military deportations.\n\n“It is an abuse of taxpayer resources; it is a violation of the public trust,” U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, said. “It's a betrayal of the taxpayer because there is a cheaper alternative.”\n\nThere have been 10 military deportation flights since Jan. 24, with five landing in Guatemala as of Feb. 4. An estimated 727 people were removed on those flights that departed El Paso, Harlingen, Texas and Tucson, Arizona.\n\nThe deportation flights have returned migrants who illegally crossed the U.S. border to Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras, Peru, and India.\n\nThese five countries agreed to accept the military deportation flights after Trump threatened that they would “pay a high economic price” if they refused them.\n\n\"For the first time in history, we are locating and loading illegal aliens into military aircraft and flying them back to the places from which they came,\" Trump said from his Doral golf club on Jan. 27.\n\nThe Department of Defense did not immediately respond to requests for more information about military deportation flights.\n\nICE deportations increased late in Biden term\n\nDeportation charters arranged by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency — commonly known as ICE Air — have been common for decades.\n\nThe flights are chartered on commercial airlines that crisscross the United States, moving immigrants to six hubs along the U.S. border region in El Paso and other parts of Texas, Arizona and Louisiana. The flights then fly migrants home to Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Ecuador, Colombia and other countries.\n\nThese chartered flights have continued daily as the Trump administration carries out the highly visible deportations on military aircraft. There have been around 30 commercial deportation charters since Jan. 24, according to the detailed work compiled by Tom Cartwright with the immigration advocacy group Witness at the Border.\n\nThe Biden administration carried out 5,518 deportation flights over four years. There were 1,564 deportation flights in the final year of the Biden administration, according to Cartwright.\n\nICE removed 271,484 non-citizens in fiscal year 2024, a 90% increase over the previous year.\n\n“Every administration has engaged in deportation efforts,” Escobar said, “that's never stopped.”\n\nThe chartered flights are facilitated by CSI Aviation, which holds a federal contract to repatriate migrants to their home countries. The Killeen, Texas-based charter company was awarded a contract valued at about $359 million from the Department of Homeland Security in April 2024.\n\nThe Miami, Florida-based Global Crossings Airlines, or GlobalX, has taken up a large portion of the deportation flights as a subcontractor for CSI Aviation. The company utilizes Airbus planes, including the A320 and A321, according to the company's website.\n\nGlobalX became the primary charter subcontractor in 2024 after the company iAero (previously Swiftair) went out of business after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2024.\n\nGlobalX performed 74% of deportation flights in 2024, according to data collected by Cartwright. Other charter and cargo companies like Eastern Air Express and World Atlantic Airlines occasionally carry out ICE chartered deportations.\n\nGlobalX and CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMilitary aircraft complicate ICE deportation tracking\n\nThe University of Washington’s Human Rights Center has researched the ICE Air removal flights since 2018, providing data on the contracts and companies.\n\nHowever, it has become increasingly difficult in recent years to obtain information on the deportation charters.\n\n“We should have access to detailed data about the number of passengers and exactly where they're going,” said Phil Neff, a research coordinator with the University of Washington’s Human Rights Center. “That information was previously released in our FOIA request, but they're making it more difficult to acquire now.”\n\nJeff Abbott covers the border for the El Paso Times and can be reached at:jdabbott@gannett.com;@palabrasdeabajo on Twitter or @palabrasdeabajo.bsky.social on Bluesky.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/06"}]}

We have no information on what days/times he will be at Hooters this week.\n\nWhat other restaurants are near the Masters?\n\nThere are several restaurants within less than two miles of the Augusta National.

Last year's winner Scottie Scheffler and three-time champ Phil Mickelson are also among the stars in the field, which includes both PGA Tour and LIV golfers.\n\nFollow along for the latest action, leaderboard updates, highlights and more.\n\nTEE TIMES: Pairings for Thursday's first round\n\nHow did Tiger Woods do today at the Masters?\n\nPlaying in his first competitive round since mid-February, Tiger Woods posted an uneven first round at Augusta National. Through his first seven holes, Woods recorded four pars and three bogeys, before he recorded his first birdie at No. 8.\n\nWoods had played well off the tee with his drives mostly finding the fairways. His approach irons and putter was where he was let down, often leaving himself longer putts; he averaged 1.78 putts per hole in the first round.\n\nOn the back nine, Woods bogeyed No. 11, before posting three consecutive pars. He then came on late, notching back-to-back birdies on Nos. 15 and 16. He bogeyed the final hole of the round to finish 2-over par (74). That has him — as of 4 p.m. ET — tied for 54th and hovering around the cut line, which will see the top 50 players (including ties) after the second round moving on.\n\nNotable Round 2 tee times\n\nTiger Woods will return to Augusta National for Round 2 at 12:54 p.m. ET. He'll be featured in Group 27 with co-leader Viktor Hovland, who shot 7-under (65).\n\nCo-leader Jon Rahm will tee off shortly after in Group 29 at 1:18 p.m. ET, while fellow co-leader Brooks Koepka will get started earlier in the day at 8:18 a.m. ET in Group 5.\n\nA full list of Round 2 tee times here.\n\nMASTERS:Tee times, TV, streaming info for Friday's second round at Augusta National\n\nJordan Spieth wraps up Round 1 with clutch putt to save par\n\nSpieth preserved his 3-under (69) with a clutch putt on No. 18. He finished his first round with a par putt after finding the fairway bunker on his first stroke. That’s good enough for 14th place, where he’s tied with three other golfers. It could’ve been worse after he shot a double bogey on hole No. 13. He also had 2 bogeys and seven birdies on the day.\n\nScottie Scheffler tied for sixth after one round; rookie Sam Bennett hangs with him\n\nDefending champion Scottie Scheffler got off to a good start on No. 18, hitting a 295-drive up the middle of the fairway. But a missed putt squandered a birdie. He finished No. 18 with a par, ending the first round 4-under (68). He’s one of seven players tied for sixth place.\n\nAmerican amateur Sam Bennett, who was in the same feature group as Scheffler, matched the defending champion at 4-under (68) and is also tied for sixth place. Not bad for the 23-year-old's first-ever Masters appearance.\n\nJordan Spieth and Tony Finau miss eagles on No. 15\n\nJordan Spieth and Tony Finau had a chance to make up some ground on No. 15, but they both missed an eagle opportunity by the slimmest of margins. Finau's putt came up just short and Spieth veered slightly to the right. They both finished with a birdie.\n\nFinau had a similar hiccup on No. 16. He putted for birdie, but the ball rolled right over the hole. He finished at par, keeping him at 3-under par.\n\nJason Day seals clean round with key par putt on 18; Scottie Scheffler hanging around\n\nJason Day, over his last three rounds at the Masters, had shot a combined 15-over par. Thursday, in his first round at the 87th Masters, Day played bogey-free golf and notched five birdies to finish the day 5-under (67). He's one of two players tied for fourth.\n\nMeanwhile, defending champion Scottie Scheffler hasn't had the most efficient round, needing to scramble at times to save par. Scheffler, however, is staying well within striking distance, currently at 4-under par (and tied for sixth) after birdies on Nos. 13 and 15.\n\nScheffler's tee shot on the gettable par-3 16th, though, fell long of the pin and left him some considerable work for another birdie.\n\nJordan Spieth, unraveling, finds the water ... twice in Amen Corner\n\nJordan Spieth, who raced out to a score of 4-under par through 10 holes, has started to unravel a bit on Amen Corner. Spieth bogeyed No. 11, which was actually a favorable outcome because he found the water and scrambled to keep the damage minimal.\n\nBut on No. 13, on his approach shot from the pine straw, Spieth chose an aggressive play and tried to make the green. His shot didn't get enough loft and bounced short of the green, eventually finding the creek. He had to work to set up a shorter bogey putt, which he misread, forcing a tap-in for double-bogey.\n\nAfter dropping three strokes in as many holes, Spieth now sits at 1-under par, in a tie for 27th.\n\nLIV Golf's Koepka takes co-lead spot with birdie on 18\n\nJoining a pair of European players in Viktor Hovland and John Rahm atop the leaderboard, Brooks Koepka concluded his first round in a co-lead with them at 7-under par (65). Koepka, one of the star acquisitions of the LIV Golf tour, shot up the leaderboard with birdies on three of his final four holes (Nos. 15, 16 and 18).\n\nThey find themselves two strokes up on the next closest players.\n\nKoepka is one of 18 players — including six past Masters champions — from the LIV tour who accepted invitations to play this week at Augusta National. Koepka is seeking his first green jacket. A victory by a LIV Golf player would certainly present an interesting, if awkward, moment for Augusta National and the PGA Tour, which are named in an antitrust lawsuit LIV filed in August 2022.\n\nRory gets back to even par; Koepka representing LIV Golf well\n\nWorld Golf No. 2 player Rory McIlroy's first round at the Masters has been all over the place. He birdied No. 2, bogeyed No. 3, got a double bogey on No. 7 and then birdied two of his latest three holes — Nos 8 and 10 — to climb back to even-par.\n\nAs far as the LIV Golf players in the field, Brooks Koepka has been far and away the top player. He is just one stroke off the lead as he starts the final hole of his first round. Koepka actually had a makeable birdie putt at No. 16 that just missed the pin.\n\nJordan Spieth rebounds from bogey on No. 5\n\n2015 Masters champion Jordan Spieth had a solid front-9 and is currently sitting at 4-under par through 10 holes. Spieth had dropped a stroke at No. 5 but has otherwise played cleanly, converting five birdies, on Nos. 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8.\n\nDrizzle starts to fall; Scheffler finishes front-9\n\nThe first round has seen warm and humid — though mostly dry — conditions at Augusta National. Coupled with rain earlier in the week, the greens have been amenable to low scoring, but after 4 p.m. ET hit, a slight drizzle started to fall. As of yet, it hasn't appeared to affect conditions, but as the forecast the rest of the weekend is projected rain, it will continue to bear watching.\n\nDefending champion Scottie Scheffler posted a clean and efficient, bogey-free front nine. An eagle at No. 2 and a birdie at No. 9 has him sitting at 3-under par at the turn.\n\nAlso making the turn is one of Scheffler's playing partners Thursday, amateur Sam Bennett, who has excelled in his Masters debut, and is actually outpacing Scheffler, currently at 4-under. That score ties him for the lowest-ever front nine score for an amateur at the Masters.\n\nViktor Hovland on his shirt\n\nCurrently tied atop the leaderboard, Viktor Hovland caught some attention for something else on Thursday, his colorful shirt that featured an oversized bright pink flower.\n\n\"I had nothing to do with it,\" Hovland said after his first round. \"I just wear what they tell me to wear. It’s definitely a little bit out there, but I’d rather take these than the pink pants I had last year.\"\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nA couple of low scores atop the leaderboard\n\nA pair of players, Viktor Hovland of Norway and John Rahm of Spain, have opened up a two-stroke lead on the rest of the field. Both Hovland and Rahm are tied atop the leaderboard at 7-under par (65).\n\nHovland blistered out of the gate, picking up an eagle on No. 2 and then birdies on Nos. 6, 8, 9, 11 and 13. His pace slowed, however, as he had to scramble for five consecutive pars to close his round.\n\nRahm was the opposite story; he double-bogeyed No. 1 and then slowly chipped away, going bogey-free the rest of the way. Rahm birdied four of his last six holes to climb into a tie with Hovlan\n\nWoods gains a stroke with bogey at 18, ends round at 2-over par\n\nTiger Woods had to manage a difficult second shot at No. 18, shooting out of an uneasy stance in which his left foot was on the first cut and his right foot was in a bunker. That shot eventually found a green-side bunker, from which he also had to navigate a tough stance. He set himself up with a challenging, but doable par putt that he pushed just left with too much pace.\n\nThat means Woods will have some work to do Friday, as he finishes his first round at 2-over-par (74). That left him hanging around the cut line, which will see the top 50 players, including ties, after the second round advance.\n\nAs warm and humid conditions have remained at Augusta National, scoring chances are available. John Rahm, the third-ranked player in the World Golf Rankings, made consecutive birdies at No. 15 and 16 to move up the board. A lenghty birdie putt at 17 left him with a tap-in par.\n\nRahm is currently second overall at 6-under par, one stroke behind leader Viktor Hovland, who finished his round at 7-under.\n\nTiger makes it two in a row\n\nAfter muddling through the middle of the back-9, Tiger Woods bridied his second-consecutive hole at the par-3 No. 16. His tee shot left him a manageable putt just left of the hole.\n\nWoods also converted par on the 17th hole, keeping him 1-over on the day.\n\nTiger gets second birdie of the day at No. 15\n\nThough Tiger Woods's approach iron again, following the trend of his opening round, left him a difficult birdie opportunity at No. 15, he recorded his second birdie of his Masters with a challenging but confidently-taken putt. The putt broke from left to right, but Woods read it perfectly and now sits at 2-over par, with three holes left to play. He had previously recorded his first birdie at No. 8.\n\nViktor Hovland remains the overall leader at 7-under par after notching birdie-par-par at Nos. 13, 14 and\n\nOf the LIV Golf players, Brooks Koepka is the one who has performed best thus far, recording consecutive birdies at Nos. 7 and 8. Koepka finished the front-nine bogey-free and is 4-under par.\n\nElsewhere, amateur Sam Bennett of Texas A&M has showed he's ready for the big stage. At No. 1, Bennett drained a putt of about 15 feet and then chipped in at No. 2 to start with a birdie-eagle. He parred at No. 3 and is at 3-under.\n\nDefending champ Scottie Scheffler races off to hot start; Tiger stays unsteady\n\nAfter kicking off his Masters title defense at No. 1 with a steady par, Scottie Scheffler's approach shot on the par-5 second hole, from about 245 yards, landed softly on the green within five feet. It set up a tap-in eagle meaning that — already — Scheffler has done something he didn't do last year when he won the green jacket: record an eagle.\n\nAt No. 14, Tiger Woods continued his uneven play, landing his tee shot in the rough. Though he eventually saved par — after his approach shot hit the branch of a pine and kicked out just in front of the green — Woods remains at 3-over par and needs to shave some strokes off his score if he is to make a move in the first round.\n\nScottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy start first round; Woods still at 3-over\n\nThe star power continues to make their way to the first tee, as defending champion Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy start their first rounds.\n\nTiger Woods' last three holes on No. 10, 11 and 12 were par-bogey-par.\n\nWill Zalatoris withdraws from Masters\n\nWill Zalatoris became the second golfer to withdraw from the tournament on Thursday after leaving the course minutes before his tee time. This time, it is due to a back injury.\n\nHe also withdrew from the WGC-Dell Match Play with a stomach bug and said he felt great heading into the Masters, even though he lost seven pounds due to the illness.\n\nTiger bogeys 11, now at 3-over\n\nTiger Woods missed a birdie opportunity from 17 feet on the 10th, as the shot just missed and he also got off to a good start on 11 with the driver but missed the green, hit a bunker, and had to settle for bogey. Woods is now 3-over through 11 holes.\n\nViktor Hovland still maintains the lead at 6-under. Cameron Young and Jon Rahm are at 3-under. Eight others, including four-time major champion Brooks Koepka and Fred Couples, the 1992 winner, are four shots off the lead.\n\nWoods finishes front nine at 2-over, Hovland increases lead\n\nTiger Woods finished his first nine holes with a 38, good for a score of 2-over with a birdie-par finish.\n\nPhil Mickelson went par on his first hole, but Viktor Hovland made two straight birdies at No. 8 and 9 and now is at 5-under for the tournament, good for a two-shot lead. Scott Stallings has completed his round and is at 2-under after a birdie on No. 18.\n\nTiger hits first birdie, Phil Mickelson tees off, Hovland takes lead\n\nOne of the early storylines of the tournament is how well the golfers on the LIV tour will do in the tour's first major. One golfer, Kevin Na, has already withdrawn from the Masters after only finishing nine holes. Phil Mickelson, one of the most popular players on the LIV Tour, has teed off for his first round.\n\nWoods finally got on the right side of a hole and birdied the par 5 No. 8 and now is at 2-over.\n\nOn the leaderboard, Viktor Hovland has a one-shot lead at 4-under over Shane Lowry.\n\nTiger Woods 3-over through 7 holes\n\nWoods had a chance to get his first birdie but instead two-putted the par-3 sixth. On the seventh, he was 20 feet from a birdie shot but again ended the hole with a bogey. He is struggling and now sits at 3-over-par.\n\nViktor Hovland has joined Cameron Young at the top of the leaderboard at 3-under after he birdied the par-3 sixth hole. Canada's Mike Weir was the first golfer to finish his round as his playing partner Kevin Na withdrew earlier in the tournament. Weir finished his round with a 72, good for even par.\n\nTiger Woods struggling, Cameron Young surges to lead\n\nCameron Young, who is making his second Masters appearance, birdied his first three holes and is leading the way early.\n\nThe scores are slowly falling as now there are seven golfers within striking range at 2-under, including 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott, and Sergio Garcia, the 2017 champion.\n\nWoods continues to chug along and after bogeying the 5th hole, now sits at 2-over.\n\nSurprising leaders at the top, Tiger 1-over through three holes\n\nAdrian Meronk from Poland has two bogeys and two birdies and is currently 2-under. He is joined by Norway's Viktor Hovland, who eagled the par-5 second hole after a par on the first hole\n\nWoods has hit two of the first three fairways first two holes and on the third hole, he badly missed the cup from eight feet out and had to settle for a bogey.\n\nTiger Woods tees off, pars first hole\n\n\"Fore please. Tiger Woods, now driving,\" started the five-time champion's tee time for the 25th time at Augusta National. On his first shot on the Par 4, 445-yard hole, Woods used his driver and hit the fairway down the right center to get off to a good start. He continued to play the course and ended up about 40 feet for a birdie on his second shot. He chipped in for par on the first hole.\n\nHow to watch Tiger Woods in first round of 2023 Masters\n\nFans will be able to watch Tiger Woods entire round on ESPN+ as coverage will follow his featured group.

History, winners ahead of Masters", "text": "The Masters Tournament is one of the most decorated and prestigious events on the sports calendar each year, and it is largely due to the history that surrounds golf's marquee major tournament.\n\nCelebrating its 89th rendition of The Masters at Augusta National Golf Club this week in Augusta, The Masters serves as the first of four major tournaments on the golf calendar and is part of one of golf's richest accomplishments: the career Grand Slam.\n\nWinning The Masters is a feat of its own, as it comes with that signature green jacket and a forever spot in the clubhouse at Augusta National as an honorary member, but winning the career Grand Slam is an even more challenging one for a golfer.\n\nRory McIlroy and Jordan Speith enter the 2025 Masters Tournament once flirting with adding their names to a prestigious group of golfers that have accomplished one of the hardest feats in the sport.\n\nFor McIlroy, the world's No. 2 ranked golfer, it is his 11th go-around at winning the career Grand Slam after winning the U.S. Open in 2011, PGA Championship in 2012 and The Open Championship in 2014. He came up short in 2022 of getting the final leg of the feat when he finished second to Scottie Scheffler.\n\nHere's what you need to know about golf's career grand slam leading into the 2025 Masters Tournament:\n\nWhat is the career Grand Slam in golf?\n\nThe career Grand Slam is considered one of golf's greatest achievements, as it marks the completion of winning each of the four majors at least once in a golfer's career. The first of the four majors is The Masters, followed by the PGA Championship, the U.S. Open and then The Open Championship.\n\nThere have been two career Grand Slams in golf history, both an original career Grand Slam and the modern career Grand Slam. The original career Grand Slam, which was achieved by Bobby Jones, included the U.S. Open, he U.S. Amateur, The Open Championship and the (British) Amateur Championship. Only five golfers have achieved the mountaintop of winning the modern career Grand Slam: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.\n\nAs noted by Golfweek, part of the USA TODAY Network, there are 12 golfers who are or have been one leg shy of pulling off the career Grand Slam. Three of those 12 are competing in this year's Masters: McIlroy, Jordan Speith and Phil Mickelson, who now competes in LIV.\n\n2025 MASTERS PREDICTIONS: Expert picks, predictions for 2025 Masters winner\n\nWhat are the Grand Slam's in golf?\n\nThe Masters\n\nPGA Championship\n\nU.S. Open\n\nThe Open Championship\n\nThe four career Grand Slam golf tournaments include The Masters, the PGA Championship, the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.\n\nLast person to win career Grand Slam in golf?\n\nThe last golfer to achieve the career Grand Slam was Tiger Woods, who withdrew his name from the 2025 Masters Tournament due to a ruptured Achilles injury that required surgery.\n\nA three-time Grand Slam winner, Woods dominated the game of golf as he came up and the way he won his first career Grand Slam is a perfect example of that: winning all four major champions consecutively. He first won the 2000 U.S. Open, then the 2000 Open Championship, the 2000 PGA Championship and then finally the 2001 Masters Tournament.\n\nThe 11-month span that Woods used to win his first career grand slam, of course, is famously known as the \"Tiger Slam,\" as he became the youngest golfer to reach the feat at 24 years old.\n\nHere's a breakdown of which wins claimed the first career Grand Slam for Woods:\n\n2000 U.S. Open\n\n2000 Open Championship\n\n2000 PGA Championship\n\n2001 Masters Tournament\n\nHow many golfers have won the career Grand Slam?\n\nFive golfers have achieved the modern career Grand Slam, one of golf's hardest feats to accomplish. The first to achieve the career Grand Slam was Gene Sarazen.\n\nSarazen won his first two legs in 1922 with the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship, his third leg in 1932 at The Open Championship and then his final leg in the 1935 Masters Tournament. Jack Nicklaus became the fourth member of the prestigious group when he won the 1966 Open. An 18-time major champion, Nicklaus became the first player to complete the grand slam a second and third time in his career.\n\nNicklaus and Woods the only two golfers in the history of the sport to win it three times.\n\nHere's the full list of golfers that have won the career Grand Slam:\n\nGene Sarazen\n\nBen Hogan\n\nJack Nicklaus\n\nGary Player\n\nTiger Woods\n\nNote: This does not include Bobby Jones, who completed the original career Grand Slam.

After hitting his opening drive, Woods received more cheers from fans.\n\nThe group of Tiger Woods, Joaquin Niemann and Louis Oosthuizen meet at the first tee ahead of the first round of the Masters. Jamie Squire/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nHis drive wasn’t perfect, though the 46-year-old ended up making par on the first hole to the delight of the watching patrons.\n\nWoods’ first birdie came on the sixth hole after his excellent tee shot left him a short putt to shoot up to under par for the first time.\n\nHowever, after bogeying the eighth hole, Woods finished the front-nine level par.\n\nHe once again dropped under par following a birdie on the par-five 13th hole, only to be pegged back to level par a hole later.\n\nWoods displayed some of the fight he’s become so famous for over his illustrious career on the 16th hole, rolling in a tricky putt for another birdie – a trademark fistpump in celebration – to move to one under to the delight of the thousands watching on.\n\nDespite a wayward tee shot on the 18th hole, Woods managed to salvage a par, meaning he carded a one-under par 71, which signaled a solid return to competitive golf after almost 17 months away.\n\nAfter his opening round, Woods said he was “as sore as I expected to feel,” but admitted it was “amazing” to be back out on the course.\n\n“I was telling the team all week, come game time, it will be a different deal,” he told the media. “My adrenaline will kick in. I’ll get into my own little world, and I’ll get after it. It’s about the training that we’ve done to have the stamina to go.\n\n“I’m going to be sore, yes. That’s just the way it is. But the training cycles that we’ve had to make sure that I have the stamina to keep going – and this is only one round. We’ve got three more to go. There’s a long way to go and a lot of shots to be played.”\n\nWoods added: “I can swing a golf club. The walking’s not easy, and it’s difficult. As I said with all the hard work, my leg, it’s going to be difficult for the rest of my life. That’s just the way it is, but I’m able to do it.\n\n“That’s something I’m very lucky to have this opportunity to be able to play, and not only that, to play in the Masters and to have this type of reception.”\n\nAt the end of Thursday, South Korea’s Im Sung-jae led the pack at five-under par.\n\nWoods salutes fans on the 18th green after he finishes the first round. Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nMust-watch\n\nWoods had been due to tee off at 10:34 a.m. ET, but due to the weather delay began his round just after 11 a.m. ET. His group is scheduled to tee off for the second round at 1:41 p.m. ET on Friday.\n\n“It’s a miraculous thing,” said 1992 Masters winner Fred Couples. “Fourteen months ago, I’m bawling like a baby every day, and now … he looks strong.\n\n“I know the leg is hurt but he’s hitting it plenty far enough to play this course, and he plays this course as well as he does, he’s won here a bunch, he knows what to do.”\n\nSpeculation first began to mount regarding Woods’ participation in the tournament when his private jet was sighted landing at an airport near Augusta last week.\n\nSince his car accident, Woods has appeared in public on a golf course just once – at the PNC Championship in December with his son Charlie. Then Woods used a golf cart to help him get around the course.\n\n“Walking is the hard part. This is not an easy walk to begin with,” Woods said to the PGA Tour, referring to Augusta’s hilly course.\n\n“With the conditions my leg is in, it gets a little bit more difficult. Seventy-two holes is a long road. It’s going to be a tough challenge and a challenge I’m up for.”\n\nScottie Scheffler, in his new green jacket, holds the championship trophy after winning the Masters golf tournament on Sunday, April 10.

Here is the game story:\n\n• • •\n\nAUGUSTA, Ga. — Think of some of the greatest moments in sports history – Bobby Thomson's pennant winning home run for the Giants in 1951; the Jets winning the Super Bowl in 1969; the U.S. hockey team winning the golf medal in the 1980 Olympics; Gene Sarazen's double eagle which led to his 1935 Masters victory.\n\nLast Sunday another such epic was etched into sports' greatest moments. it may go down as the greatest most memorable moment the game of golf has ever had.\n\nIf you were there, or watched the 1986 Master on television, you witnessed not just a happening, but will go down in history as \"the miracle at Augusta.\"\n\nIt was the 50th Masters Tournament, the golden anniversary. when it was over, it truly was golden – as in Golden Bear.\n\nSome said he was through, that he could not win again, let alone another major championship.\n\nOver the hallowed ground of Augusta National, a site of five of his record 19 previous major championships and a place where he has become legendary, Jack Nicklaus brought out the best of the Golden Bear. He gave that familiar look of determination, shoved all those thoughts and words of being washed up and down their throats and perhaps put forth the finest hour in not only his career, but in golf itself.\n\nAnd he did it the hard way.\n\nClosing with a dramatic 7-under-par 65, including a 6-under 30 on the back side, Nicklaus finished his 28th Masters at 9-under-par 279 and donned his sixth green jacket with his 20th major championship and 71st career PGA Tour victory.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm just tickled pink,\" said Nicklaus, the only player to win back-to-back Masters titles (1965-66). \"Some people said I was done, washed up, through. there was an article in the paper last Sunday that people 46-years-old don't win the Masters. A friend of mine cut it out and pasted it on my refrigerator. I kept looking at it and thinking about it all week. But sometimes thing like that can really spur you on.\"\n\nIt did just that to Nicklaus, especially down the stretch when the pressure was at its peak.\n\nThey say things get better with age. Each day older Nicklaus got an Augusta last week, the better he got, posting rounds of 74-71-69 before nailing down the title with his 65.\n\nHe trailed first round co-leaders Ken Green and Bill Kratzert by six shots. A second-round 72 put him at 145 and still six strokes out of the lead, this time Seve Ballesteros, who posted 71-68.\n\nBallesteros, playing like he had something to prove on the PGA Tour, which banned him for a year because he did not play in the required 15 events last season, appeared to be in total command of the tournament before bogeying the final two holes Saturday and thus opening the door to plenty of would-be challengers, Nicklaus included.\n\nNicklaus showed signs of days past – and a day to come – with a third-round 69 that put him at 2-under-par 214, four strokes behind leader Greg Norman, who used a third-round 68 and Ballesteros' bogeys on Nos. 17 and 18 to take a one-stroke advantage.\n\n\"In this tournament its not how many strokes you're behind, but how many people are in front of you that counts,\" said Nicklaus after Saturday's play.\"\n\nThere were eight, including South African Nick Price, who vaulted into the limelight with a course-record 9-under-par 63 Saturday. In posting the best round ever during the Masters, Price, who lives in Orlando while playing on the U.S. tour and has plans to become a U.S. citizen, charged from the back of the pack into a tie for second place at 5-under-par, one shot behind Greg Norman.\n\nAlong with Nicklaus, there were plenty of familiar names among the 21 players within five shots of the lead going into the last day – among them Ballesteros, defending champion Bernhard Langer, Tom Kite and Tom Watson.\n\n\"At dinner last night (Saturday), we were talking about the players still in the tournament,\" said Kite, who 12-foot birdie putt on the final hole just missed its mark and left him one shot behind Nicklaus. \"Some said that Jack not only wouldn't win this tournament, but he probably wouldn't win another. I said a player of his magnitude, you never could count him out.\"\n\n\"A reported asked me this week if I thought Jack Nicklaus was done,\" said Norman. \"I told him no way – he's got a few more wins in him.\"\n\nAlthough Nicklaus started slowly the final day, turning in 1-under 35 and not even one the leader board, he soon caught fire. And as soon as he did, the crowd of some 40,000 bean to sense something major was about to happen.\n\nBallesteros, playing two groups behind Nicklaus, eagled the par-5 eighth to go 8 under and, although he bogeyed No. 9, he still was four shots in front of Nicklaus.\n\nBut birdies on No. 10 and 11 put Nicklaus at 4 under and when his name went up on the leader board, gentle roars echoed through the Augusta pines. They were quickly quieted when he bogeyed the par-3 12th.\n\nThen i started to happen – one of the greatest charges this famed tournament has ever seen, and it has seen its share of fantastic finishes in its fabled 50 years.\n\n\"I know it sounds silly, but I think the 12th hole is what really got me going, even though I bogeyed it,\" said Nicklaus, who collected $144,000 for the victory to bring his official PGA Tour career earning to $4,843,683. \"Yesterday I birdied the hole and I got defensive. After the bogey today I felt it was time to get aggressive.\"\n\nHe birdied No. 13, missing a 30-foot eagle putt by inches, and after a par at No. 14, put himself in the think of things with a 12-foot eagle on the par-5 15th to go 7 under and two shots behind Ballesteros, who had eagled 13.\n\nThe crowd was now reacting to his every move. The eagle at No. 15 sent an ear-shattering roar blanketing over Augusta National. And when he birdied No. 16 from 3 feet and and No. 17 from 11 feet to go 9 under, it was becoming near hysteria among the masses outside the ropes.\n\nAs he walked to the 18th green, after hitting his approach shot some 30 feet short of the hole, the noise level grew. And despite being 12 to 15 deep in some places and a beehive of activity around the outskirts of the final hole, there was an eerie silence as Nicklaus prepared to putt for birdie.\n\nThe putt came up inches short and when he tapped in Augusta National became engulfed in sound of approval and appreciation.\n\nHow strong was the crowd's desire for a Nicklaus victory?\n\nWhen the scoreboard on No. 18 showed Ballesteros bogeyed No. 15 to drop to 7 under, a huge roar went out.\n\nWhen Tom Kite missed his 12 footer on the final hole, which would have forced a playoff, there was silence; no one groaned in despair.\n\nWhen Norman, who charged into a tie with Nicklaus at 9 under after birdies on Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17, hit his approach shot at No. 18 far right and into the crowd by the green, there were plenty of smiling faces circulating. And when he missed his 16-foot par putt that dropped him into a tie for second with Kite, fans of all ages began shaking each other's hand or giving a \"high-five\" victory hand slap.\n\n\"By the time we got to the back nine, Nicky (Price) and I were down to about 50 people following us,\" said Norman with a smile. \"It seemed like every five minutes. there was another roar, and Jack was making another birdie. The score he shot today is phenomenal. The back nine, my God. . .\"\n\nAlthough always a threat at Augusta, Nicklaus was far from being considered a favorite when the tournament started. And with good season. He had not won here in 10 years, had not won on the tour in almost two years and in his seven starts in 1986 his best showing was a tie for 39th at Hawaii.\n\n\"I'll be the first to admit I'm not the player I once was,\" said Nicklaus. \"I just want to be as good occasionally, and obviously this week I was. I feel for short periods I can still play. Last week at the USGA banquet I said I didn't feel it was time to quit playing golf because of the way I was playing. I don't want to quit on a down note.\"\n\n\"Maybe I should quit playing now. Maybe that would be the smart thing to do, but I guess maybe I'm not too smart. I still enjoy playing and still want to play. I'll tell you this, I had as much fun out there today as I've had playing golf that last six years.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2024/04/10/2024-masters-sleeper-picks-odds-golf/73265683007/", "title": "2024 Masters Tournament odds: Top sleeper picks for Augusta ...", "text": "Editor's note: Follow live coverage of the Masters, leaderboard, highlights and more.\n\nFor decades, the best golfers in the world have traveled to Augusta National Golf Club for the Masters Tournament. It's the biggest golf event of the year and brings prestige to the winner as the iconic green jacket and trophy make for a highlight victory in any golfer's career. Many of the greatest golfers of all time have multiple Masters wins, including Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Sam Snead, and Arnold Palmer.\n\nBut some Masters winners found some magic in Augusta to take a surprise win. Hideki Matsuyama won in 2021 at 60-1 odds. Per Sports Odds History, winners from 2007 through 2009 were all longer than 100-1 for victory: Zach Johnson (2007, 125-1), Trevor Immelman (2008, 150-1), and Angel Cabrera (2009, 125-1) all donned green jackets after a stunning run to victory.\n\n'I hurt every day': Tiger Woods battles physical limitations at the Masters\n\nMasters 2024 tee times: Thursday's opening round, including when Tiger Woods tees off\n\nWill we see another surprise winner in 2024?

But Dunlap is different. He was top-ranked junior golfer in the Class of 2022, and the top-ranked amateur golfer in the world after he won the American Express Championship in January to become the first amateur to win a PGA event in 33 years (Phil Mickelson).\"\n\nThe Augusta Chronicle: Dustin Johnson (+4800)\n\nTyler Palmateer writes: \"Dustin Johnson is tough to beat. Johnson won the 2020 Masters, held in November due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yes, he tied for No. 48 last year. But Johnson has five top 10 Masters finishes since 2015, including three inside the top four. Johnson won at LIV Golf’s Las Vegas Invitational earlier this season and placed fifth at Mayakoba.\"\n\nSean Zak, Golf.com: Russell Henley (+6000)\n\nZak says: \"No one has played better golf while flying completely under the radar for the past 12 months. No one. Henley is ranked 15th by DataGolf, but was never really in the running for a Ryder Cup pick last fall. He’s really never been in the running for a bunch of victories, either. But it was just last year that he tied for fourth at Augusta.\"\n\nWill Gray, PGATour.com: Russell Henley (+6000)\n\nGray says: \"The former Georgia Bulldog finished T4 here a year ago and has been known to heat up on the greens from time to time. Two top-5s in his last three starts show signs of promise.\"\n\nWashington Post: Joaquín Niemann (+2800)\n\nMatt Bonesteel says: \"I think Niemann has one of the better shots out of all the LIV golfers because he comes in with white-hot form: three wins and four top-fives since November, with one of those victories in a full-field DP World Tour event. (LIV golfers can play on the European tour.) He’s also one of only two LIV golfers to average at least two strokes gained per round this season. (Rahm is the other; Dustin Johnson — No. 3 on that list — is well behind both at 1.54 strokes gained per round.) Niemann’s best finish at Augusta National is a tie for 16th last year, but he has made the cut each of the past three years.\"\n\n2024 Masters Tournament odds\n\nScottie Scheffler is the heavy favorite for victory in Augusta, BetMGM golf odds.

That’s OK,” Woods told the media afterward. “As I said, I’ve got a chance going into the weekend. Hopefully I’ll have one of those light bulb moments and turn it on in the weekend and get it done. You’ve seen guys do it with a chance going into the back nine. If you are within five or six going into the back nine, anything can happen. I need to get myself there. That’s the key. I need to get myself there.\n\n“Tomorrow will be a big day. It’s going to be cool. It’s going to be tough. Again, the wind is supposed to blow again and tough scoring conditions.

Hong/AP Masters 2022: The best pictures from Augusta Prev Next\n\nTale of the day\n\nWoods capped off a remarkable comeback to golf Thursday as he carded a one-under 71 in the opening round at Augusta National.\n\nThe 46-year-old Woods displayed all his poise and experience to finish near the top of the leaderboard, just four shots behind leader Im Sung-jae at the end of the day.\n\nAs he looks to complete what would be another fairy-tale story and make the cut in his first appearance in a professional golf tournament since his February 2021 car crash, Woods hoped for more of the same on day two of the 2022 Masters.\n\nWith a large crowd watching on and anticipation in the air, the 15-time major winner stepped up and blasted his ball down the first hole, only for it to find the bunker on the right of the fairway.\n\nHe would end up bogeying the opening hole, moving him back to even par for the tournament.\n\nAnd his slow start to the second round continued over the next two holes, rescuing a par on the par-five second hole before missing a short putt on the third hole for his second bogey in three holes, putting him at one over par.\n\nUnfortunately for Woods, another bogey was to follow on the par-three fourth hole, when his par putt fell just inches short. According to the PGA Tour, the three-over through four holes start is Woods’ worst score through four holes in 92 career rounds at the Masters Tournament.\n\nWoods reacts to his shot on the ninth hole during the second round of the Masters. David Cannon/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nIt got worse for Woods still, as another bogey on the fifth hole dropped him to three over for the tournament.\n\nHowever, from there, Woods slowly recovered. He earned hard-fought pars on holes 6 and 7 before a vital birdie on the eighth hole helped drag him back to two over.\n\nAnd the recovery only got better from there, with the shot of his second round so far coming on the 10th hole, leaving him with a very short putt for a second birdie in three holes, which dragged him to one over.\n\nBut just when it looked like he was on the way back, things took a turn for the worse for Woods.\n\nFollowing his birdie on the 10th, he carded two successive bogeys on the 11th and 12th as the wind swirled around and undid his recent hard work.\n\nHowever, the roller coaster continued over the next two holes. Having picked up two successive bogeys, Woods collected two successive birdies to once again position himself at one over par.\n\nWoods did manage to wrestle some sense of stability to his round over the final four holes of his round, finishing with four straight pars to leave him with a two over par 74.\n\nAfter the rocky opening he went through – including four bogeys in five holes – it is a testament to Woods’ fighting spirit he was able to battle back and earn a chance to compete for the green jacket over the next two days.\n\nWoods tips his hat after making a bogey on the 12th green. Jamie Squire/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nAn unbelievable story\n\nNobody expected Woods to be playing at the Masters this year.\n\nFollowing a car crash in February 2021 in which he sustained serious leg injuries, he has only appeared in public on a golf course just once, at the PNC Championship in December with his son Charlie. Then Woods used a golf cart to help him get around the course.\n\nSpeculation first began to mount regarding Woods’ participation in the tournament when his private jet was sighted landing at an airport near Augusta last week.\n\nAnd a few practice rounds before the Thursday’s opening round only heightened the rumor. Woods said on Monday it would “be a game-time decision” on whether he plays at the Masters.\n\nHe confirmed his participation later in the week, and has been the main draw at the tournament – drawing huge swathes of patrons and media attention – as he makes his way around the Augusta National course.", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/pga/2025/04/07/masters-schedule-dates-and-times-for-2025-tournament/82973325007/", "title": "Masters schedule, dates, and times for 2025 tournament", "text": "AI-assisted summary The 2025 Masters Tournament, the first men's major golf championship of the year, takes place April 10-13.\n\nPractice rounds and events, including the Masters Par 3 Contest, are scheduled for the days leading up to the tournament.\n\nScottie Scheffler will defend his title after winning his second green jacket at the 2024 Masters.\n\nThe first men's major golf championship has arrived.\n\nThe 2025 Masters begins Thursday, as the best golfers in the world will head down Magnolia Lane to battle for the green jacket.

It's at the lowest level of the hilly golf course co-designed by club founder Bobby Jones and Alister MacKenzie and the amphitheater setting behind the 12th tee, with huge bleachers and thousands of patrons, has been the site for numerous Masters dramas since the tournament began in 1934.\n\nThe hole considered the most difficult on the course is 11.\n\nIt’s a downhill, tree-lined, watery and slick-greened challenge that often serves as a mid-round roadblock.

Only the low 30 scores from the opening 36 holes will advance to play the April 2 final round at Augusta National, televised from noon to 3 p.m. on NBC.\n\nThe winner receives an invitation to the next five Augusta National Women’s Amateurs (providing she doesn't turn professional), the 2022 U.S. Women’s Open, the 2022 Women’s British Open and any United States Golf Association, Royal & Ancient and PGA of America amateur championships for which she is eligible for one year.\n\nMorgan's mother, Elizabeth Morgan, said the Augusta women's event was \"all (her daughter) has talked about for the past year. As a little girl, I would watch the Masters with my grandfather in Thomaston, Georgia. Although we weren't golfers, we really followed the Masters and I never would have imagined I'd ever have a child playing at Augusta. Growing up she would watch any golf tournament, but the Masters has held a special place for her for a long time.\"\n\nMorgan will be the fourth Furman player to compete in the three years of the event (2020 was canceled by the pandemic). The first tournament featured Dorman alum Natalie Srinivasan, Haylee Harford and Alice Chen. Harford finished tied for seventh with a 1-under 71 in the final round and Sirinivasan tied for 17th with a 1-over 73 at Augusta. Chen missed the cut.\n\n\"It was really cool to be a part of the first one,\" Srinivasan said. \"We had three of us (from Furman) play, so that was really great. And then just being out there with my family. My dad caddied for me and then my brother was the designated guest (inside the ropes) so we spent a lot of time together, and it's something I'll always remember.\"\n\nSrinivasan, now on the Symetra Tour (the developmental tour for the LPGA) also received a 2020 invitation the year the event didn't take place. She still practices at Furman, so she sees Morgan regularly.\n\nThe Augusta National Women's Amateur \"has been one of her goals since back when I played,\" Srinivasan said. \"She's really super talented and I'm not shocked she got her invite. I just told her what things to work on from my experience and kind of just what to expect.\"\n\nMorgan said among the things Srinivasan told her was \"something along the lines of 'they'll treat you like royalty' and to just really appreciate the whole experience.\"\n\nFurman golf: Dorman grad Natalie Srinivasan staying positive over end of terrific Furman golf year\n\nGolf standout: Dorman, Furman alum Natalie Srinivasan wins college golf’s most prestigious award\n\nIt won't be the first time playing Augusta National for Morgan, a former Herald-Journal Player of the Year and Southern Conference Freshman of the Year and a first-time college champion at September's Lady Paladin on Furman's home course. She played the course as a guest of a family friend and Augusta National member twice, first as a high school senior and then again last month in anticipation of receiving her tournament invite.\n\nMorgan has also been to Augusta National for two Masters tournament rounds, two tournament practice rounds and the final round of the inaugural women's event in 2019.\n\nWhen asked for her favorite moments or memories from her two playing rounds, Morgan laughed and quickly responded, \"All of them.\"\n\nShe then offered a little more detail.\n\n\"Obviously just hitting that first tee shot. Then No. 13 (the Par-5 featuring an isolated tee-box that completes the three-hole stretch known as 'Amen Corner'). We played the member tees and not from where the pros play, but we walked back to the pro tee at the very back of 13 and it's one of the quietest places on the course. We went back and hit a tee shot from there. That's just a really cool spot. Any view out there is pretty, but that's just one of the cool places where you can just kind of take a moment and really appreciate where you are.\"\n\nMen's golf: Clemson's Jacob Bridgeman and Georgia's Trent Phillips compete at prestigious Palmer Cup\n\nFrom the first time she played the historic course Morgan recalled, \"Literally everything was incredible. I still remember the first time riding down Magnolia Lane (the private, tree-lined entrance to the clubhouse), remember the meal I had (cheeseburger, onion rings and an Arnold Palmer which is half tea, half lemonade) and just the whole experience. The second time was just as awesome as the first time. It's one of those things that would never get old.\"\n\nAs for how Augusta National looked during the cold of winter last month, Morgan said, \"Everything is still green and no blade of grass is out of place.\"\n\nA couple of the highlights were a par at the famous par-3 12th and then making birdie at the 18th.\n\n\"I was just trying to have a lot of fun out there,\" Morgan said. \"I went for every Par-5 in two and was definitely hitting shots I wouldn't necessarily hit in a tournament. Just being out there having the opportunity to try and hit those shots I was enjoying the experience. I couldn't even tell you what I shot. I was just so caught up in the moment and appreciating every single little thing with the environment, on the course and in the clubhouse.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/21"}]}

Vasco Sousa Cotovio/CNN\n\nFew, if any, buildings of the eastern Ukrainian town have been spared by the unending artillery barrages fired from side to side. Many of the structures have been completely destroyed, others left uninhabitable with collapsed sections, in apocalyptic scenes reminiscent of the battered city of Mariupol, captured by Russia earlier in the war.\n\n“After the (Russian) mobilization (in September), Putin threw all his forces (at Bakhmut) in order to achieve a breaking point in the war, but we are putting up a fierce defensive fight,” Caesar says.\n\nMuch of Ukraine’s resisting force has had to hunker down in muddy trenches, fighting tooth and nail to deny Russian forces a victory they desperately crave.\n\n“The fighting is very brutal now,” Caesar explains.\n\nA few miles away from the battle, but still in earshot of the constant thuds and explosions, Caesar’s commitment is unflinching and he does not regret his decision to join Ukraine’s foreign legion.\n\nWhile the urge to sign up came early on in the conflict, he could only leave his home country, with his close family, and join the Ukrainian military in the summer.\n\n“It was a very difficult process,” he says. “It took me several months to finally join the ranks of the defenders of Ukraine.”\n\nNow with his family in Ukraine – where he considers them to be safer – Caesar says he is one of around 200 Russian citizens currently fighting alongside Ukrainian forces, against their own country’s armies. CNN has not been able independently to confirm this number.\n\nIn Caesar’s view, Moscow’s forces are not true Russians.\n\n“Yes, I kill my countrymen, but they have become criminals,” he explains. “They came to a foreign land to rob and kill and destroy. They kill civilians, children and women.”\n\n“I have to confront this,” he added.\n\nCaesar is a self-confessed opponent of what he says is a “tyrannical regime” headed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, not just in Ukraine but also inside his own country. And in his confrontation of the war, he has had to shoot at least 15 Russian soldiers on the battlefield, he claims.\n\nThey are lives he did not pity and killings he does not regret, he says.\n\n“I am fighting a noble fight and I am doing my military and Christian duty; I am defending the Ukrainian people,” Caesar says. “And when Ukraine is free, I will carry my sword to Russia to free it from tyranny.”\n\nThe Orthodox monastery in Dolyna is one of many buildings damaged by shelling. Vasco Sousa Cotovio/CNN\n\nSome signs of the monastery's former occupants can still be found among the rubble. Vasco Sousa Cotovio/CNN\n\nFamily ties\n\nCaesar’s ideological drive is not the only reason some Russians have chosen to side with Ukrainians on the battlefield. For many the motivation lies closer to the heart.\n\n“Silent,” the call-sign of another Russian soldier whose full name CNN is not disclosing for his safety, was visiting Ukraine when Russian missiles and artillery shells started landing in its towns and cities on February 24.\n\n“I came to Ukraine at the beginning of February to visit my relatives. I stayed here and war started,” Silent says.\n\nHe says he joined the Ukrainian military shortly after he saw the atrocities perpetrated by Russian soldiers in the suburbs of Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka, just outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Evidence of mass graves and civilian executions in those areas emerged following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region in early April.\n\nRussia has previously denied allegations of war crimes and claimed its forces do not target civilians, despite extensive evidence gathered by international human rights experts, criminal investigators and international media in multiple locations.\n\n\"Silent\" says he was shocked by the atrocities he saw Russian soldiers commit in the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka. Vasco Sousa Cotovio/CNN\n\n“I was just outside Kyiv, not far from those places, and when they were kicked out of that territory, we went there to help people and saw what they had done,” Silent says. “Dead bodies, children, women, executions … When you see it in person … of course everything inside turned upside down.”\n\nHe adds: “I decided to stay here until the end and join the legion.”\n\nSilent says his best friend has recently been forcibly mobilized into Russia’s army back home. Silent says they’ve discussed the terrifying fact that it’s conceivable they could end up on opposite sides on a Ukrainian battlefield.\n\n“It’s weird that that could happen – especially as he wants to leave Russia and wants to come to fight with me against Putin’s army in Ukraine. We’re trying to get him out but he’s being held by the Russian army,” says Silent.\n\nHis family, like many in Russia and Ukraine, has roots in both countries. His wife and two children are now living with him in Ukraine but other relatives remain in Russia. Silent says that although they have stayed behind, they see through Putin’s propaganda on the war, still described as a “special military operation” by the Kremlin.\n\n“They understand what is going on: Russia invaded Ukraine,” he says, adding that his relatives were not angry with him. “They know my character, that if I have made a decision, I will act until the end.\n\n“They told me to stay safe.”\n\nThe long arm of the Kremlin\n\nAnother soldier, who goes by the call-sign “Vinnie,” insists on covering his face with a balaclava, fearing that the Kremlin’s long arm might try to reach him in Ukraine.\n\n“My family is not here with me right now,” he explains. He says he is fighting for them and for their future, but still fears what Moscow’s security apparatus might do to them.\n\n\"Vinnie\" didn't want to show his face for fear the Kremlin could target his family. Vasco Sousa Cotovio/CNN\n\n“My children, my wife, who I love very much, they’re my everything, my whole life,” he says, with a sparkle in his eyes and a smile that can be detected through the cloth covering his face.\n\n“If I show my face … I worry about them, because there’ll be no one to protect them,” he adds.\n\nIt’s one of the added risks for Russian citizens risking their lives for Ukraine, but not the only one. Russian soldiers fighting for Ukraine could face tougher consequences than their Ukrainian counterparts if they’re captured by the enemy.\n\nLast month, a soldier who deserted the Russian mercenary group Wagner and crossed onto the Ukrainian side, Yevgeny Nuzhin, was brutally murdered with a sledgehammer after he went back to Russia.\n\nHis execution was applauded by the head of the group, Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin. Without directly acknowledging that Wagner fighters had carried out the murder, Prigozhin said: “Nuzhin betrayed his people, betrayed his comrades, betrayed them consciously. He was not taken prisoner, nor did he surrender. Rather, he planned his escape. Nuzhin is a traitor.”\n\nThis kind of example is why Vinnie is certain of what will await him should he be captured.\n\n“There won’t be an exchange for sure. It will be the end, 100%,” he says. “It will just be more painful.”\n\nThe monastery and the village of Dolyna were the site of heavy battles between Russian and Ukrainian forces, with both sides using the area as a base. Vasco Sousa Cotovio/CNN\n\nBut pain and death are not a part of this unit’s lexicon, even as they face overwhelming odds in Bakhmut.\n\nRussia has been trying to capture the town for months and has thrown large numbers of men at Ukrainian defenses in an attempt to break them. But they haven’t broken Vinnie.\n\n“I am defending the country, I am defending homes, women, children, people who cannot defend themselves,” he says. “My conscience is absolutely clear.”\n\nCaesar, standing amid the remains of the Orthodox monastery, is equally defiant, saying not even the prospect of defeat will make him waver.\n\n“I will stay here while my heart will beats. I will fight to defend Ukraine,” he says.\n\n“And when we have defended Ukraine I will liberate my country.”", "authors": ["Vasco Cotovio Sam Kiley Peter Rudden Olha Konovalova", "Vasco Cotovio", "Sam Kiley", "Peter Rudden", "Olha Konovalova"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/13/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/7025078001/", "title": "Ukraine president Zelenskyy in daily talks with Russia: March 13 recap", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Sunday, March 13. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Monday, March 14, as Russia's invasion continues.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will continue negotiating with Russia and is waiting for a meeting with its leader, Vladimir Putin despite repeated escalated attacks by Russia in Ukraine.\n\nSo far, Zelenskyy's requests have gone unanswered by the Kremlin. During his nightly address to his nation, Zelenskyy said Sunday that his delegation has a “clear task” to do everything to ensure a meeting between the two presidents, the Associated Press reports.\n\nZelenskyy said there are daily discussions between the two countries via video conference. He said the talks are necessary to establish a cease-fire and more humanitarian corridors. He said those corridors have saved more than 130,000 people in six days.\n\nThe humanitarian convoy to the besieged city of Mariupol was blocked Sunday by Russian forces. Zelenskyy said they would try again Monday.\n\nDmitry Peskov, Russia's negotiator and President Vladimir Putin's press secretary, confirmed the daily talks, the BBC reports.\n\nIn a video posted on social media and in a subsequent tweet, Mykhailo Podolyak, Ukraine's negotiator and a Zelenskyy adviser, said Russia was beginning to engage constructively.\n\n\"Russia now much more adequately perceives the world around it,\" Podolyak said. \"It is much more sensitive to the position of Ukraine, which has been proven in battlefields, and in Ukraine's actions in terms of protecting its interests.\"\n\n►'MASS CASUALTY SITUATION': Downtown Kyiv hospital braces for carnage doctors fear will come\n\n►'WORSE THAN HELL': Mariupol mother fears for her daughter as Russia lays siege to the Ukrainian city\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan will meet with senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday. China has called for a peaceful settlement in Ukraine but has rejected sanctions against Russia.\n\n►Russia has opened 14 recruitment centers in Syria and will pay mercenaries up to $600 per month to fight in Ukraine, the Ukraine military said.\n\n►Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of trying to create “pseudo-republics” to break his country apart. He urged Ukraine’s regions not to follow the path of two eastern areas – Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic – where pro-Russian separatists clashed with Ukrainian forces in 2014.\n\n►An estimated 1,300 Ukrainian troops have been killed since Russia began its invasion, according to Zelenskyy, who claims 12,000 Russian forces have been killed.\n\n►Kyiv is preparing for a possible blockade by stockpiling humanitarian supplies to support the city's residents, city officials said Sunday.\n\n►Almost 2.7 million Ukrainians have fled the country, the U.N. refugee agency said.\n\nTens of thousands Europeans protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nEurope saw tens of thousands of people rallying Sunday in protest of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn Milan, Italy’s financial capital, protesters held bloodied cloth bundles to represent Ukrainian children killed in Russian attacks. Germans carried flags in the blue and yellow colors of Ukraine during protest in Berlin spurred by trade workers.\n\nAnti-war protests were also staged in Warsaw, London and the German cities of Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart. Small vigils took place in Russia as well, despite a crackdown by authorities against demonstrations.\n\nRussian protests against the war in Ukraine have been typically met with a heavy police response. Rights group OVD-Info said more than 668 people had been detained in 36 cities as of late afternoon Sunday Moscow time.\n\nThe number of Russians protesting nationwide appeared to have shrunk significantly from major protests a week ago when OVD-Info said over 5,000 people were detained.\n\nBiden talks to Macron about the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron Sunday about efforts to reach a ceasefire and ongoing negotiations with Russia.\n\nIn Biden's call Macron, the two talked about \"reviewed recent diplomatic engagements and underscored their commitment to hold Russia accountable for its actions and to support the government and people of Ukraine,\" according to a White House readout of the call, CNN reports.\n\nIn a separate call, Macron also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a French source familiar with the chat said Macron \"reviewed the situation with him. He expressed his full support and detailed the additional aid that the European Union decided to provide at the Versailles Summit. They exchanged views on the continuation of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine,\" CNN also reported.\n\nThe two leaders are expected to talk again later this week.\n\nThe talks come a day after he and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin urging an immediate ceasefire and a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n'Russian TV channels' will begin broadcasting soon, says new mayor of Russian-occupied Ukrainian city\n\nThe newly installed mayor in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city Melitopol said \"Russian TV channels\" would be broadcasting in the region soon.\n\nGalina Danilchenko said in a televised video Sunday claimed there was \"a great deficit of trustworthy information being circulated,\" as the decision for the broadcasting, according to CNN.\n\nHer televised address was later posted on social media by pro-Russian Telegram channels and by the Ukrainian-controlled Zaporozhye regional administration.\n\nDanilchenko was installed as mayor after elected mayor Ivan Fedorov was detained by armed men on Friday. The prosecutor's office for the Russian-backed separatist region of Luhansk later accused Fedorov of terrorism offenses.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for Federov's immediate release, saying his \"abduction\" was a \"crime against democracy.\"\n\nUS officials say Russia asked China for aid, US and China set to meet Monday\n\nRussia asked China for economic and military aid for the war in Ukraine after President Putin began his invasion last month, U.S. officials told The New York Times and the Washington Post.\n\nChina has called for a peaceful settlement in Ukraine, but has rejected sanctions against Russia. The relationship between the two countries has grown over the past few decades, and both have opposed a further expansion of NATO.\n\nThe developments comes as Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, is scheduled to meet on Monday with senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi in Rome.\n\n“We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,” Sullivan told CNN on Sunday.\n\n“We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,” he added.\n\nUS journalist killed in Ukraine by Russian soldiers\n\nAmerican photojournalist Brent Renaud was killed Sunday in Ukraine when Russian soldiers opened fire on a car in Irpin, a town 30 miles outside the capital of Kyiv.\n\nA second American journalist, Juan Arredondo was rushed to a hospital with shrapnel wounds, police said.\n\nArredondo, 46, told Italian journalist Annalisa Camilli in an interview from a hospital that the two men were filming refugees fleeing the area when their car rolled up to a checkpoint and the Russians began shooting. He said Renaud was shot in the neck.\n\nRenaud, 50, and his brother Craig frequently collaborated on film and television projects. They covered wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the earthquake in Haiti, political turmoil in Egypt and Libya, extremism in Africa, cartel violence in Mexico, and the youth refugee crisis in Central America, according to their website.\n\nRenaud was working on a project in Ukraine focused on the global refugee crisis for TIME Studios, the company said in a statement Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS News that the U.S. government would consult with Ukraine to determine what happened and would then “execute appropriate consequences.”\n\nAirstrike near Polish border kills at least 35\n\nA Russian airstrike on a military training base in western Ukraine killed at least 35 people and wounded 134, a local official said. The assault brought the war to within 25 miles of the border with Poland after a senior Russian diplomat warned that Moscow considered foreign shipments of military equipment to Ukraine “legitimate targets.”\n\nThe United States and NATO have regularly sent instructors to the range, also known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, to train Ukrainian military personnel. The facility has also hosted international NATO drills. Just weeks before the war began, Florida National Guard members trained there.\n\nThe base has become a crucial logistics hub and training center since Russia’s invasion began, The New York Times reported. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told ABC News that U.S. military personnel had left the training facility weeks ago and were not present during the airstrike. It was not immediately revealed whether any foreign fighters were at the center.\n\nThe governor of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyi, said Russian forces fired more than 30 cruise missiles at the Yavoriv military range, located about 20 miles northwest of the city of Lviv.\n\nPope rails against 'barbarism' of Russian siege\n\nPope Francis urged Russia to stop the massacre in Ukraine by allowing safe passage out of cities under siege and making a serious effort to bring peace at the negotiating table. Mariupol in particular is being \"martyred by the ruinous war\" raged by Russia against Ukraine, he said. He implored leaders to \"listen to the cry of those who suffer\" and end the bombings.\n\n\"Faced with the barbarism of the killing of children, and of innocent and defenseless citizens, there are no strategic reasons that hold up,\" Francis said. \"The only thing to be done is to cease the unacceptable armed aggression before the city is reduced to a cemetery.\"\n\nRussia could be preparing to use chemical weapons\n\nRussia could be preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, an act that would draw a \"severe price,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned Sunday.\n\nSullivan told CBS News that Russian rhetoric is increasingly claiming the Ukrainians and Americans will potentially use chemical or biological weapons \"and that's an indicator that, in fact, the Russians are getting ready to do it, and try and pin the blame elsewhere and nobody should fall for that.\"\n\nAsked what consequences would result, he said he would not go beyond what President Joe Biden indicated on Friday: \"They will pay a severe price.\"\n\n\"We have communicated that directly to the Russians,\" he said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nRussian yachts being seized across Europe\n\nRussian yacht owners are encountering rough seas around the world as nations sympathetic to Ukraine's plight press sanctions that include impounding assets of Russia's wealthy class. World leaders hope harsh economic sanctions that target Vladimir Putin's inner circle of oligarchs could apply pressure on the Russian president to end his brutal military assault on Ukraine. Italy announced Saturday that it had seized a $580 million superyacht linked to Russian energy and fertilizer magnate Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko. Several other yachts have been seized in recent weeks in Italy, Germany and Fance.\n\nSullivan: US nuclear posture hasn't changed\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday the U.S. has seen no reason to change its nuclear posture in light of Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine or threats involving nuclear weapons. In the opening days of the invasion of Ukraine, Putin indicated that if the U.S. and other NATO allies continued to impose heavy sanction against the Russian economy, or if they attempt to aid Ukrainian forces, the Kremlin would be ready to respond with nuclear weaponry.\n\n\"We are watching this extremely closely. And obviously the escalation risk with a nuclear power is severe, and it is a different kind of conflict and other conflicts the American people have seen over the years,\" Sullivan said. He noted that \"as things stand today\" the U.S. isn't making an adjustment to its nuclear posture, \"but it is something that we monitor day by day, hour by hour.\"\n\nUSA TODAY/Suffolk polls: Russian Americans, Ukrainian Americans oppose war\n\nU.S. residents who identify with Russian or Ukrainian heritage express strikingly similar views about the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, a pair of exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University polls finds. The two groups are united in their opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war being fiercely fought on his orders.\n\nThe invasion is opposed by nearly everyone in both groups: 87% of Russian-Americans and 94% of Ukrainian-Americans. Those of Russian descent have a more positive view of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (72%) than they do of Putin (6%). By nine-to-one, they say Putin should be removed from office.\n\n\"Somebody just needs to extract him,\" said Dina Sarkisova, 44, who owns a spa in San Diego and participated in the survey. Half-Russian and half-Azeri, she came to the United States as a refugee in 1990, fleeing conflict in Azerbaijan as the Soviet Union collapsed. \"There's no reasoning with him.\"\n\nRead more on the polling and the voices of those polled here.\n\nDeath toll in battered Mariupol surpasses 1,500, mayor says\n\nIn Mariupol, which has endured some of the worst punishment since Russia invaded, efforts to bring food, water and medicine into the port city of 430,000 and to evacuate civilians, were prevented by unceasing attacks. More than 1,500 people have died in Mariupol during the siege, according to the mayor's office, and the shelling has even interrupted efforts to bury the dead in mass graves. Russian forces shelled a mosque sheltering over 80 children and adults in Mariupol, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said Saturday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of trying to break his country apart, as well as starting “a new stage of terror” with the alleged detention of a mayor from a city west of Mariupol.\n\n“Ukraine will stand this test. We need time and strength to break the war machine that has come to our land,” Zelenskyy said during his nightly address to the nation Saturday.\n\nRussian soldiers pillaged a humanitarian convoy that was trying to reach Mariupol and blocked another, Ukrainian officials say. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces captured Mariupol’s eastern outskirts, tightening their siege of the strategic port. Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nUkraine government: 85 children killed by Russian attacks\n\nSince Russian attacks on Ukraine began, 85 children have died, the Ukrainian government said Sunday morning. Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova gave the casualty number in a tweet, adding the toll the war has taken on schools.\n\n\"Deliberate and brutal shelling of civilians continues. 369 educational institutions were damaged, 57 of which were completely destroyed,\" she said.\n\nBus with refugees overturns in Italy, 1 dead\n\nItalian state radio says a bus carrying about 50 refugees from Ukraine has overturned on a major highway in northern Italy, killing a passenger and injuring several others, none of them seriously. RAI radio said one woman died and the rest of those aboard the bus were safely evacuated after the accident early Sunday near the town of Forli’. It wasn’t immediately clear where the bus was headed.\n\nAbout 35,000 Ukrainians refugees who fled the war have entered Italy, most of them through its northeastern border with Slovenia. Forli’ is in the region of Emilia-Romagna, which borders the Adriatic Sea and which so far has taken in about 7,000 refugees.\n\nThe accident is under investigation.\n\nA third Russian general has died in fighting, Ukraine officials say\n\nA Russian general was killed in fighting at Ukraine's southern city Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nMaj. Gen. Andrei Kolesnikov would be the third Russian general to die since the invasion of Ukraine began, making an unusual loss of such a high-ranking military official during fighting. Kolesnikov was the commander of Russia's Eastern Military District, according to Ukraine's military.\n\nRussia did not confirm Kolesnikov's death, and has not shared many details about its military losses during the invasion of Ukraine. Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division, and Maj. Gen.

The number of non-fatal injuries from the shooting is unknown, the agency said.\n\nThe defense ministry additionally claimed that after the shooting, Russian soldiers would not allow other individuals to escape.\n\n“At present, it is practically impossible to contact them, as well as to provide humanitarian and medical care,” the agency said.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nMore Ukraine-Russia coverage", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/01/11/ukraine-captures-first-north-korean-soldiers-alive/77623107007/", "title": "Ukraine captures first North Korean soldiers alive, Zelensky says", "text": "Ukrainian forces captured two North Korean soldiers fighting with Russia's army, alive but wounded, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday.\n\nIt marks the first time Ukraine said it took North Korean soldiers prisoner since they arrived in Russia to fight in the war in October, according to Ukraine and the U.S.\n\nIn a post to X, Zelensky said the soldiers were captured in Kursk, a Russian region on the border that Ukraine is trying to hold after it staged an incursion into the area last summer. They were transported to Kyiv, where they are communicating with Ukrainian officials, he said.\n\n\"This was not an easy task: Russian forces and other North Korean military personnel usually execute their wounded to erase any evidence of North Korea’s involvement in the war against Ukraine,\" Zelensky said.\n\nNorth Korean forces have already suffered \"heavy casualties\" in the region, with more than 1,000 killed or wounded within a week, White House National Security Advisor John Kirby said at a news conference late last month. Some soldiers reportedly took their own lives to avoid surrendering to Ukraine, he said.\n\nThe North Korean troops have been deployed to the frontlines in Kursk, mostly as light infantry soldiers and mortar teams, a senior U.S. military official told reporters in December.

Proposals articulated by incoming Vice President J.D. Vance include freezing Ukraine's borders where they are now and indefinitely suspending Ukraine from joining NATO.\n\nSince Russian forces invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago, the U.S. has sent more than $30 billion in military assistance and weapons. The lame duck Biden administration on Thursday announced another $500 million aid package, including air defense missiles, air-to-ground munitions and support equipment for F-16 fighter jets.\n\nMeanwhile, as Biden prepares to leave office, his administration on Friday imposed its hardest sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies and more than 180 of its oil tankers. Many of the tankers ship oil to India and China, which have made up a growing share of Russia's oil exports after it was fenced out of European markets after the invasion.\n\nThe measures are \"the most significant sanctions yet against the Russian energy sector, the largest source of revenue for the Kremlin's war machine,\" a senior official told reporters.\n\nIn October, South Korea reported that more than a thousand North Korean troops had gone to training bases in eastern Russia.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/08/28/russian-soldier-deaths-ukraine/14727103/", "title": "Russians call for probe of soldiers' deaths near Ukraine", "text": "Anna Arutunyan\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nMOSCOW — A number of Russian soldiers are being killed or going missing, human rights activists say, amid growing evidence suggesting the casualties are the result of Russian military involvement in neighboring Ukraine.\n\nSergei Krivenko, of Russia's Presidential Human Rights Council, said a woman reported her son's body was brought to her home last week, with documents saying he died of his wounds, but not where he had died.\n\n\n\n\"She called other soldiers who served with her son,\" he said. \"They told her he was killed among 100 others\" in a rocket attack in Ukraine's Donetsk region, where much of the fighting between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian military has been focused.\n\nEarlier this week, the council filed a report with the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation over the deaths of nine contract soldiers of a mechanized infantry division in a training area in the Rostov region, which borders Ukraine.\n\n\"These aren't just civilians, but people who are following (military) orders,\" Krivenko said. \"That is why we asked that these deaths be investigated.\"\n\nSending soldiers to areas of military confrontation and not officially reporting their deaths was a common practice during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, and similar incidents occurred during Russia's first military conflict in separatist Chechnya in 1994.\n\nWhile deaths during training do occur in peacetime, Krivenko said they are normally investigated and confirmed immediately. That has not been the case this time.\n\nThe reports are sparking fears among relatives of soldiers who are being sent to areas near the Ukrainian border.\n\nKrivenko said his agency has been getting letters from parents of conscripts and contract soldiers who are being sent to the Rostov region for training, but parents fear they will be crossing the border into Ukraine.\n\n\"I am getting calls from people asking what to do, with (conscripts) being pressed to sign up as contract soldiers (to be sent to the border),\" said Lidia Sviridova, head of a regional Soldiers' Mothers committee in Saratov. The group is a Russian non-governmental organization protecting the rights of conscripts.\n\n\n\nThe concerns come amid new escalation in months-long fighting between Ukrainian authorities and pro-Russian separatists in the country's east. The U.S. and Ukraine say large numbers of Russian tanks have crossed the border this week into Ukraine in a \"full-scale\" invasion.\n\n\"These incursions indicate a Russian-directed counteroffensive is likely underway in Donetsk and Luhansk,\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nRussian forces, she said, are being sent 30 miles inside Ukraine, without them or their families knowing where they are going. Psaki cited reports of burials in Russia for those who've died in Ukraine and wounded Russian soldiers being treated in a St. Petersburg hospital.\n\nThere could be as many as 15,000 Russian troops in Ukraine, many of them deployed there without official documents, said Valentina Melnikova, head of the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers.\n\n\"The government is disavowing soldiers who are there,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe Russian government, meanwhile, continues to vehemently deny it is supplying weapons and expertise to the rebels. Alexander Zakharchenko, prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, conceded Thursday that up to 4,000 Russians were fighting alongside rebels, but doing so strictly as volunteers, ITAR-Tass reported.\n\nPhotographs emerged in the local Russian news media Monday of the burial of two soldiers of the 76th Airborne Division in the northern Russian city of Pskov, but relatives of those killed refused to talk to journalists.\n\nMemorials on the fresh graves said that Leonid Kichatkin and Alexander Osipov died on Aug.19 and Aug. 20, respectively. Around the same dates, the Ukrainian military captured a BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicle that it said belonged to the Pskov Airborne Division.\n\nPhotographs of a roll-call journal found at the site and published by Ukrainian journalist Roman Bochkala included Kichatkin's name. However, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman called the authenticity of the journal into question, saying such documents were no longer in use.\n\nAfter capturing 10 Russian paratroopers earlier this week, Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery Geletey urged Russians whose sons or husbands were serving in the armed forces to find out if they had been sent to Ukraine.\n\n\"Today the Ukrainian Armed Forces have captured a lot of Russian servicemen,\" he wrote on his Facebook page Monday. \"Officially they are undergoing training in various corners of the Russian Federation. But in reality, they are taking part in armed aggression against Ukraine. I am addressing relatives of Russian servicemen. Immediately find out where your loved ones really are. Take them out of Ukraine.\"\n\nHowever, Russia's Airborne Troops Union, an association of veterans, said it had no reports or complaints of any soldiers dying or going missing.\n\n\"There may be veteran paratroopers crossing the border into Ukraine as volunteers, but this is not legal,\" said Nikolai Belyayev, acting chairman of the union's council. \"We've had a lot of requests from veterans who want to go as volunteers and fight on the side of the (self-proclaimed) Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, but this is not allowed by the law, so we do not facilitate it.\n\n\"However, I know several people who are fighting as volunteers.\"\n\nStill, relatives of other soldiers serving in the Russian Armed Forces are finding their names on lists of those killed or captured by Ukrainian forces published by journalists and bloggers. While the authenticity of the lists has been questioned, seeing a loved one's name on it is enough to spark panic.\n\n\"The connection (with soldiers) is lost. They are afraid, they fear tragedy,\" Yuri Tikhomirov, of the Kostroma regional Committee of Soldiers' Mothers, said. \"Wives, mothers are coming to us.\"\n\nSaratov resident Lyubov Maksimova grew worried Aug. 21, when photos of her son Ilya's personal items showed up online, along with his name on a list of those who had died in Ukraine. Ilya, a serviceman in the airborne troops, had stopped calling her a few days prior. \"He used to call every day before that,\" she said.\n\nAfter going public with her concerns, Maksimova's family got a call from an unknown number, with an unidentified man telling them they would be speaking to their son.\n\nIlya spoke briefly, only to say that he was alive and well on a training ground in Rostov across the border from Ukraine, Maksimova said. \"I don't know anything else,\" she added.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/europe/donbas-region-ukraine-war-russia-explainer-intl/index.html", "title": "Donbas: Why Putin wants Ukraine's ravaged heartland | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nFighting in Ukraine has rounded on Donbas, a sprawling and beleaguered heartland region that has suffered years of conflict and now serves as the bloody stage on which Russia’s war could be decided.\n\nDonbas blankets much of eastern Ukraine, and has been the front line of the country’s conflict with Moscow since 2014.\n\nBut now its people, already scarred by eight years of fighting, are enduring an assault even more intense. Russian forces are closing in on the city of Severodonetsk, and are making gradual progress in some parts of the region. Some assaults have been repelled by stubborn Ukrainian counteroffensives.\n\nFailures to take Kyiv and central Ukrainian regions in the invasion’s early months meant Donbas became the centerpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military ambition.\n\nA Russian victory in the region would appall the West but could salvage Putin’s war aims, while a defeat could cement his invasion as a historic failure. Either way, it is almost certain to devastate yet more of the Donbas region, a historically and culturally significant place whose proximity to Russia has dictated much of its turbulent existence.\n\nThose who have lived in and studied the region describe it as an independent and gritty center of industry that has remained suspicious of outside forces for decades.\n\nBut the waves of conflict there since 2014 have reshaped and wounded its cities, and it is along its line of contact that both the Ukrainian and Russian military are most dug in – making for a familiar but unpredictable new phase of war.\n\n‘Fiercely independent’\n\nChimneys, factories and coal fields have dotted the landscape of Donbas for decades, and since its two major cities were founded – Donetsk by a Welsh ironmaster in 1869, and Luhansk seven decades earlier by a Scottish industrialist – industry has been the lifeblood of the region.\n\nThe name Donbas is itself a portmanteau of the Donets Coal Basin, and throughout most of the 20th century it served an outsized role as the industrial heartland of the Soviet Union, pumping out coal in vast quantities.\n\n“The Soviet Union intensively developed the Donbas as an industrial center,” said Markian Dobczansky, an associate at Harvard University’s Ukrainian Research Institute. “It was a place that set the tempo of Soviet industrialization.”\n\nIt was a place, too, of “extremely high-stakes industrial production, and repression,” Dobczansky adds. “Terror was present under Soviet rule. Repression happened all over the Soviet Union, but it happened intensely in the Donbas.” Suspicion, arrests and show trials were rife.\n\nThe Donbas remains Ukraine's industrial center, but its economy suffered in the early years of indepedence. Sergii Kharchenko/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nA rise in steel and metal manufacturing, the creation of a railroad and the development of a shipping industry in the port city of Mariupol diversified Donbas beyond its coal mining roots.\n\nBut in the three decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, the region’s economic might has shriveled. “In the 1990s, the Donbas saw the floor drop out economically,” Rory Finnin, associate professor of Ukrainian studies at the University of Cambridge, told CNN.\n\nA decline in living standards and rampant poverty plagued the region during its initial transition from communism, Finnin said, and Donbas is now often likened to the Rust Belt regions of the United States, where once-thriving heartland locations have struggled to adapt. But an upturn in fortunes followed the turn of the century; Donbas remains Ukraine’s industrial epicenter, complimenting the agricultural production of the rest of the country.\n\nWhile prosperity in the region has wavered, one steadfast characteristic of its inhabitants has not. The people of Donbas have and remain “fiercely independent,” Finnin said. “It marches to the beat of its own drum.”\n\nThe region’s long-standing industrial pull has attracted people from across Eastern Europe over the past century, and it has had strong social and economic ties to neighboring Russia as well as to the rest of Ukraine. Unlike much of central and western Ukraine, which had historically changed hands between various European empires, Donbas spent most of the past millennium under the control of Russia.\n\nIn the country’s only post-Soviet census in 2001, just over a half of the population of Donbas was made up of ethnic Ukrainians and a third of ethnic Russians. Russian is by some distance the most widely spoken language in Donbas, unlike in western Ukraine. But the country as a whole has a tradition of multilingualism and the connection between language and national identity is tenuous there, experts say.\n\nThe cities of Donbas lie “far away from the metropolitan centers, (and) far away from the big cities” in central and western Ukraine, said Dobczansky. “People could flee to the Donbas and get lost.” Western-influenced, pro-European politics has typically not been embraced in Donbas as it has in the west of Ukraine.\n\nThat sense of disconnect from the capital Kyiv and other metropolitan centers has given rise to a vast collection of local movements, and was the backdrop upon which pro-Russian separatists attempted to seize control following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea.\n\nBut Finnin and others warn “it’s important not to fall to notions that the Donbas is pro-Russian or anti-Ukrainian,” a concept that has been stirred up relentlessly by the Kremlin since 2014 but is roundly debunked by experts.\n\nIn an exclusive CNN poll conducted by Savanta/ComRes shortly before Russia’s invasion began, people in the easternmost region of Ukraine, which includes Donbas, mostly rejected the idea that Ukrainians and Russians are “one people,” and comprehensively disagreed that the two states should become one country.\n\nFewer than one in five people there felt that way, compared to about a third of Russians who did, demonstrating the lack of desire to change national allegiance despite the region’s longstanding cultural connections with Russia.\n\n“(Pro-Russian) separatism prior to 2014 was a distinctly minority position,” and no organized movement existed, Dobczansky said. Opinion polls – and the region’s own vote for independence in Ukraine’s 1991 referendum – affirmed Donbas’ desire to leave Soviet-era allegiances behind.\n\n“People would have a very strong sense of being a coal miner, or a metal worker, or being in the proletariat,” he added. “People (also) had a sense of being a part of the Ukrainian republic, but the idea was that the Donbas transcended national identities.”\n\nWhat Donbas means to Putin\n\nDespite its move into independence along with the rest of Ukraine in 1991, Donbas has maintained a place in the psyche of Russian leadership.\n\nA famous Soviet propaganda poster from 1921 dubbed Donbas “the heart of Russia,” depicting the region as a beating organ with vessels stretching across the Russian empire. Before then, the region was part of the concept of “Novorossiya,” or New Russia, a term given to territories towards the west of which the Russian empire had expansionist ideas.\n\nCities like Luhansk and Donetsk are historically “places that (Russians) could see a certain version of themselves,” Finnin said.\n\nAnd that historical image could still persist inside Putin’s own worldview, experts suggest.\n\nObservers have often suggested that Putin’s desired endgame is to rebuild the Soviet Union in which he first rose up the ranks. Anna Makanju, former director for Russia at the US National Security Council, last month suggested that Putin “believes he is like the czars,” the imperial dynasties that ruled Russia for centuries, “potentially called by God in order to control and restore the glory of the Russian empire.”\n\nAlmost all of Mariupol's infastructure has been destroyed during devastating Russian assaults. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nBut such a project could not be attempted without an effort to recapture Donbas, given its emotional resonance as the Russian empire’s industrial backbone. “It’s symbolically very important; the Donbas supplied the entire Soviet Union with raw materials,” Dobczansky said.\n\nIt is in that context that Putin has refocused his stuttering invasion on the region where his conflict with Ukraine began eight years ago.\n\n“There’s every possibility that Putin will move now to effectively bisect Ukraine; that will give him enough to be able to declare a victory domestically, and allay his critics that this has been a botched invasion,” said Samir Puri, a senior fellow in urban security and hybrid warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), who worked as a ceasefire observer in Donbas between 2014 and 2015.\n\n“Taking the Donbas (would be) a consolation prize, because Kyiv is now out of Russia’s military grasp, but it’s a good consolation prize,” Puri said.\n\nEight years of conflict\n\nPutin’s annexation of Crimea and the occupation of parts of Donbas by Russian-backed rebels in 2014 brought to a crashing halt a period of increasing prosperity in the region.\n\nWar broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting left portions of Luhansk and Donetsk in the hands of Russian-backed separatists.\n\nThe separatist-controlled areas in Donbas became known as the Luhansk and the Donetsk People’s Republics. The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserts the two regions are, in effect, temporarily Russian-occupied. The self-declared republics have not recognized by any governments, other than Russia and its close ally Syria, and the Ukrainian government has steadfastly refused to talk directly with the leaders of either.\n\nBut on the ground, living amid conflict became a way of life. “Eastern Ukraine residents were living in a twilight zone – they were in the front line of a geopolitical despite, and there was a sense of powerlessness,” said Puri, who spent time on each side of the line of contact while observing the ceasefire.\n\nEven before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, conflict between the countries had left buildings across Donbas in ruins. Joao Bolan/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nMore than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in Donbas since 2014, including 3,000 civilians caught up in the conflict. Ukraine says that since 2014, almost 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with over half of the registered internally displaced persons staying in the areas of Donbas that remained under Ukrainian control and about 160,000 resettling in the wider Kyiv region.\n\nRussia has meanwhile aggressively attempted to stir up separatist feeling in the region, which it has then pointed to as a justification for invading. Russian passports were offered to residents from 2019, and Kremlin messaging both in Russia and in separatist-held parts of Donbas has heavily played up notions of ethnic Russians being targeted.\n\n“In propaganda since 2014, the Donbas has become a sacrificial lamb in Russian narratives,” Dobczansky said.\n\n“It’s the place where the Russians have cultivated a cult of victimhood. They’ve managed to turn their own fomenting of a war into a narrative of victimhood at the hands of Ukrainian nationalists,” he added. “They hammer this point home.”\n\nThat pretext ultimately led to Putin, two days before he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, declaring the Donetsk and Luhansk regions independent in an opening salvo to his war on the country.\n\nA new Russian assault\n\nWhether the raging battle for Donbas will be the final chapter of Russia’s war, or merely its current phase, remains to be seen. But by zeroing in on the region, Putin has brought his assault on Ukraine full circle.\n\nThe so-called “liberation” of Ukraine’s Donbas region was described as an “absolute priority” for Russia by its foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, in an interview with French broadcaster TFI in late May.\n\n“The Donbas was the frontline for eight years, so the military positions on both sides are extraordinarily well-fortified,” Dobczansky said shortly before Russia’s invasion refocusing on the territory.\n\nThe secessionist conflict in Donbas had been costly but stagnant since the initial surges of pro-Russian forces in 2014; the lines of the conflict barely moved in several years, with trenches running along the point of contact from the southern coast to the Ukrainian-Russian border north of Luhansk.\n\nBut Russia has made a number of advancements into parts of the Donbas in the weeks since the battle there began.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the situation in the region is becoming increasingly difficult due to a ramp-up in Russian manpower in recent days. “That’s why we have to increase our defense, increase our resistance, and Donbas will be Ukrainian again. Even if Russia will bring all suffering and ruination to Donbas, we will rebuild every town, every community. There’s no real alternative,” Zelensky stressed in a video message last week.\n\nPart of the city of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine is “already controlled by the Russian army” and Russian troops are “gradually moving towards downtown Severodonetsk,” Serhiy Hayday, head of Luhansk region military administration said on Tuesday.\n\nUkraine’s military has said Russia’s current focus is seizing full control of the city, which lies close to the Donetsk-Luhansk boundary. Zelensky has said that 90% of the housing in Severodonetsk had been damaged.\n\nRussia has continued to intermittently strike cities in northern Ukraine; in recent days, Hirsk and Hrinivka in Chernihiv and Bachivsk and Seredyna-Buda in Sumy have suffered shelling. Analysts say Russian attacks on these areas are designed to prevent Ukrainian forces from being redeployed to the main fronts in Donbas.\n\nWhile Russia is making slow but gradual progress in parts of Donbas, some Ukrainian counter-offensives have seen success. Ukrainian forces have intimate knowledge of the towns and cities they have been defending for nearly a decade. Ukraine’s top general, Valery Zaluzhny, and much of the army’s top guard have on-the-ground experience fighting in the region after 2014.\n\nZelensky has called for more Western military aid and repeatedly warned in recent weeks of the devastation that Donbas has endured since the new phase of the war began.\n\n“The current offensive of the occupiers in Donbas can make the region uninhabited” Zelensky said last week. “They want to burn Popasna, Bakhmut, Lyman, Lysychansk and Severodonetsk to ashes.

But conscription remains a touchy topic in Ukraine, and officials have had to tread lightly amid dwindling enthusiasm for military service. Last year, Al Jazeera reported \"feared patrols\" hunting for potential conscripts, as officials searching for recruits \"stalk nightclubs, concerts and subway stations\". There are accusations that some are employing \"dubious measures\", including that they \"round people up randomly\".\n\nUkraine's \"inherent weakness is that it depends on others for funding and arms\", wrote the BBC's international editor, Jeremy Bowen. On the other hand, Russia \"makes most of its own weapons\" and is \"buying drones from Iran and ammunition from North Korea\" with no limitations on how they are used.\n\nIt also enjoys an advantage in raw manpower, yet this has not stopped Vladimir Putin from bolstering his fighting force even further. On Tuesday he ordered 160,000 Russian men aged between 18 and 30 be called up to the reserves in what is the \"largest conscription drive in 14 years\", said Sky News.\n\nWhile Russian authorities claim it has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine, \"in the long term, it has everything to do with the conflict, and the wider geopolitical tensions\", said Sky's Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett.\n\nPutin's aim is to have a bigger army than America's, with 1.5 million active servicemen.\n\nThe latest draft is \"a result of this, and it's a sign of Russia's relentless militarisation. Whatever the outcome of peace talks, the Kremlin will remain on a war footing for some time yet.\"\n\nWhat does victory look like for each side?\n\nBefore Russia launched its invasion in February 2022, Putin outlined the objectives of what he called a \"special military operation\". His goal, he claimed, was to \"denazify\" and \"demilitarise\" Ukraine, and to defend Donetsk and Luhansk, the two eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014.\n\nAnother objective, although never explicitly stated, was to topple the Ukrainian government and remove the country's president, Zelenskyy. \"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,\" said Zelenskyy shortly after the invasion. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound.\n\nRussia shifted its objectives, however, about a month into the invasion, after Russian forces were forced to retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. According to the Kremlin, its main goal became the \"liberation of the Donbas\", including the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – but Moscow has made little progress in achieving this aim.\n\nRussia has since scaled back its objectives. The Kremlin's \"minimum requirement\" appears to be \"occupying the entirety of the Donbas region (comprising the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk)\", said The Economist. It also wants to regain \"control of Russia's own Kursk region, which Ukraine has partly occupied\", and hold on to \"the 'land bridge' it seized in the early stages of the war connecting Crimea to Russia\".\n\nUkraine's main objective remains the liberation of its occupied territories. That includes not just those held by Russia since the February 2022 invasion, but a return to its internationally recognised borders, including Crimea.\n\nHow many Russian and Ukrainian troops have died in the conflict?\n\nTrue casualty figures are \"notoriously difficult to pin down\", said Newsweek, and \"experts caution that both sides likely inflate the other's reported losses\".\n\nMore than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and 380,000 injured on the battlefield, Zelenskyy said in an interview with NBC in February, with \"tens of thousands\" missing or in Russian captivity. However, in February, UALosses, a web project that records Ukrainian casualty data from open sources, listed more than 70,400 names.\n\nMoscow has also had to respond to extensive losses in Ukraine, with more than 100,000 verified by the BBC and Mediazona as soldiers killed in Ukraine. \"The true number could be more than double,\" said the BBC.\n\nUkraine's General Staff estimates that Russia has lost a total of 859,920 troops, a figure believed to include \"dead, wounded, missing and captured\" soldiers, said The Kyiv Independent in February.", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Anahi Valenzuela", "The Week Us", "Genevieve Bates", "Harriet Marsden", "Elliott Goat", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/europe/severodonetsk-luhansk-russia-ukraine-intl/index.html", "title": "Ukraine to withdraw from key city of Severodonetsk as Russia's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUkrainian forces are withdrawing from Severodonetsk, effectively ceding the city to Russia and putting the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk almost fully under Russian control following months of grueling and bloody fighting\n\nSeverodonetsk was one of the last major Ukrainian strongholds in the area. Serhiy Hayday, a top military commander in east Ukraine, said the military made the decision to evacuate “because the number of dead in unfortified territories may grow every day.”\n\n“It makes no sense to stay,” Hayday said.\n\nIt’s unclear if Ukrainian forces are currently leaving the city, or if they have already evacuated.\n\nThough the capture is a symbolic breakthrough for Russia, it comes after a lengthy and costly battle in which Moscow’s forces were met with a stubborn Ukrainian resistance.\n\nRussian forces have diverted much of their firepower toward overrunning the city, simply destroying every defensive position the Ukrainians have adopted. The strategy played out slowly, with the Russians making labored and sluggish gains around Severodonetsk throughout the spring and early summer.\n\nSmoke rises over Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUkrainian forces were, little by little, pushed into a few square blocks around the Azot chemical plant, where some 500 civilians, including dozens of children, have taken shelter – a scene reminiscent of the siege of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol.\n\nWith the military evacuating the city, however, the fate of those inside the Azot plant is unclear.\n\nHayday, the head of the Luhansk regional military administration, has repeatedly accused Moscow of scorched-earth tactics, flattening cities with little regard for casualties as it attempts to take them.\n\n“All the infrastructure of the city is completely destroyed,” he said of Severodonetsk on Friday.\n\nThe battle now moves across the Siverskyi Donets river to Lysychansk, the last city in Luhansk held by Ukrainian forces. And there are already signs that the Russians will use the same merciless tactic of aerial bombardment to grind down Ukrainian forces, deploying combat planes, multiple launch rocket systems and even short-range ballistic missiles.\n\nUkraine’s control over Lysychansk has become more tenuous in recent days. Russian forces have advanced into several villages south of the city, though not without sustaining losses from Ukrainian artillery fire. The Ukrainian military claims that some Russian battalion tactical groups are being consolidated or withdrawn to restore their combat capabilities.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank that follows the campaign closely, said the Russian breakthrough from the south means they “may be able to threaten Lysychansk in the coming days while avoiding a difficult opposed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets River.”\n\nA win for Putin, but at what cost?\n\nLuhansk and neighboring Donetsk together make up Ukraine’s Donbas region, an industrial heartland dotted with factories and coal fields that has been home to sporadic fighting since 2014, when Russian-backed separatists seized control of two territories – the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic.\n\nThe Kremlin has been quietly supporting troops there since 2014, and even began granting passports to residents in 2018, with more than half a million distributed by mid-2021, according to Russian state media.\n\nShortly before invading Ukraine in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the two separatist territories as independent states, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in defiance of international law.\n\nThe capture of Severodonetsk gives Putin an important propaganda victory in a war which, so far, has been mostly marked by Moscow’s military setbacks. A key goal of Russia’s so-called “special military operation” – the Kremlin’s official euphemism for the invasion of Ukraine – was to take control of Donbas.\n\nExperts expected a quick fight in the region, unlike the battles around Kyiv in the initial days of the war that Russia lost. The fighting near the Ukrainian capital was mostly urban warfare, which allowed Ukraine’s military to stymie Russia’s advantages in manpower and hardware by keeping the battles in tighter corridors, where Ukraine’s highly motivated fighting force could capitalize on its better knowledge of the local environment.\n\nDonbas, however, is a region of plains and open spaces. The battles there have involved long-range weaponry, a type of warfare that favors Russia and its superior power and larger armed forces.\n\nAfter little success in the first month of the conflict, Russian forces retreated from around Kyiv, regrouped and concentrated on eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin’s new offensive to take the Donbas region was launched April 18, according to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia’s progress was, initially, “slow and uneven,” according to US officials, as its army appeared to still be learning from its mistakes in the initial days of the invasion.\n\nA boy sits on the rubble of a building hit in a strike on Kramatorsk, a city in the Donetsk region. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe tide began turning in mid-May, when Mariupol, a strategically important port city, finally completely fell to Russian forces following an intense, three-month long bombing campaign that Ukrainian officials say left as many as 22,000 people dead. The fight there was markedly similar to the battle for Severdonetsk, both in terms of Russia’s tactical decisions and with Ukrainian fighters and civilians holing up in structures that, before the war, were used for heavy industry.\n\nRussian then increased the intensity of their bombardment in other parts of the Donbas region, a strategy Zelensky likened to genocide.\n\nEyes shift to Donetsk\n\nSome experts have questioned whether Russia’s efforts to take Severodonetsk were strategically worth it.\n\n“The loss of Severodonetsk is a loss for Ukraine in the sense that any terrain captured by Russian forces is a loss – but the battle of Severodonetsk will not be a decisive Russian victory,” said the Institute for War.\n\n“Ukrainian troops have succeeded for weeks in drawing substantial quantities of Russian personnel, weapons, and equipment into the area and have likely degraded Russian forces’ overall capabilities while preventing Russian forces from focusing on more advantageous axes of advance.”\n\nIf Russian forces capture Lysychansk, and with it the Luhansk region, they will likely concentrate more troops on Donetsk, where progress has come much more slowly.\n\nUkraine’s regional military administration says about 45% of Donetsk is held by Ukrainian forces, including the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the losses inflicted on Russian forces in recent weeks will impair their ability and desire to gobble up more territory, but the Kremlin has not veered from its ultimate objective of taking those two cities.\n\nEqually, it remains to be seen whether the punishment endured by Ukrainian units has left them with enough resources to launch counterattacks against the Russians.\n\nUkrainian officials have made repeated calls for more military assistance from its allies. Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said on June 14 that the country had received just 10% of military assistance it had requested.\n\n“No matter how professional our army is, without the assistance of our Western partners Ukraine will not be able to win this war,” said Maliar.\n\nUkrainian commanders will now have to decide whether it is strategically worthwhile to keep defending Lysychansk, as Kyiv could abandon the city and divert resources for a more consolidated defense of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka, the industrial belt of Donetsk.\n\nThe Kremlin has not veered from its ultimate objective of taking all of Donetsk and Luhansk. It now has almost all of the latter. But completing the so-called “special military operation” will likely take many more months, setting up a war of attrition.", "authors": ["Joshua Berlinger Tim Lister", "Joshua Berlinger", "Tim Lister"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/956461/can-ukraine-beat-russia-in-donbas", "title": "Can Ukraine beat Russia in Donbas? | The Week", "text": "Russian troops are close to surrounding two key cities in Donbas, a Ukrainian official has said, warning the outcome of the ongoing fighting will decide the “fate of the country”.\n\nOleksandr Motuzyanyk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, said during a televised briefing that Vladimir Putin’s invading force has almost encircled the neighbouring cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk.\n\nGaining control of the two territories would hand Moscow “half of the eastern region” of the country, The Telegraph reported, though “Ukrainian forces are heavily dug in after resisting Moscow-backed separatists in the war of 2014”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The fate of this country is perhaps being decided [there] right now.”\n\nLast defenders\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, last week said the courage of troops pinned down inside the Azovstal steel works, who refused to surrender for almost two months, could have slowed Russia’s plan to seize control of Donbas.\n\nDespite their eventual surrender, the fighters bought the Ukrainian defence valuable time by refusing to flee the steel works despite being surrounded, he said.\n\n“Azovstal defenders ruined Russia’s plan to capture the east of Ukraine, took a hit on themselves and proved the real combat capability of Ukraine,” he said, adding “This completely changed the course of the war.”\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIn early May, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the Ukrainian security and defence council, said that Russian forces had “tried to break through our defences” along almost “the entire front line in the territory of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions”.\n\nA successful counter-offensive has since raised Ukrainian hopes of fending off Russia’s second offensive. Until the successful attacks around Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, Russian gains in Donbas had been “minimal at best”, according to US officials.\n\nThis is largely due to the fact that the “heroic hold-out” by the Azovstal steel works fighters “stopped the Russians capturing Zaporizhzhya”, a key city in southeastern Ukraine, or “closing their encirclement in the Donbas”, according to The Telegraph.\n\nForeign correspondent Roland Oliphant said the Donbas offensive has seemingly “run out of steam”, adding that if Ukraine eventually succeeds in pushing Russia “back to the border”, historians will study how “men and women in the tunnels of Azovstal bought enough time for one of the most remarkable military reversals in history”.\n\nEastern front\n\nAccording to the i news site, Moscow refocused the invasion on the separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in a bid to “recover momentum following stalled attempts to storm the capital and Ukraine’s southern port cities”.\n\nThe Kremlin’s “military planners have abandoned their objective of simultaneously conquering the north, south and east”, and are instead making “a concentrated effort” to consolidate control over the Donbas region, the site continued.\n\nBut hopes for a “wider Donbas victory” appear to be “slipping from reach”, Reuters said.\n\nEven as Russia “prepares to take full control of the ruins of Mariupol”, Vladimir Putin “faces the growing prospect of defeat” in his “bid to conquer” the entire region. This is because his “badly mauled forces lack the manpower for significant advances”.\n\nThe Russian president must now “decide whether to send in more troops and hardware to replenish his dramatically weakened invasion force” as another “influx of modern Western weaponry bolsters Ukraine’s combat power”, the news agency added.\n\nDefining moment\n\nThe second phase of the Ukraine war could be “potentially decisive”, said Sky News’ security and defence editor Deborah Haynes. It represents the “biggest test yet for Ukrainian defenders” and “could dictate the future direction of the war”.\n\n“Ukraine has already dealt Russia a serious blow by forcing its troops to abandon an attempt to capture the capital Kyiv,” Haynes wrote. “If Ukrainian forces can prevent Russia's soldiers from achieving their objectives in the east, it would significantly strengthen Ukraine's hand in peace talks.”\n\nMilitary experts “are wary of predicting who will win” the battle for Donbas, said Reuters. But all agree that it will be “a crucial conflict that will likely be brutal and ultimately define the course of the war”.\n\n“The outcome of the battle could be that both sides will be battered to the point when neither one will be able to conduct an offensive or a counter-offensive,” Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, told the news agency.\n\n“Ukrainians will defend their land to the last man”, he added, while “the Russians will incur significant losses”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Genevieve Bates", "Harriet Marsden", "Elliott Goat", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/21/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/7683657001/", "title": "Ukraine: Ben Stiller meets Zelenskyy; 2nd American dead: June 21 ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Tuesday, June 21.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are focusing on two pivotal swing states on Wednesday: Georgia and Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris will take questions from voters at a town hall event in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, moderated by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. Trump is holding multiple events in Georgia, including a town hall focused on faith in Zebulon, and a rally in Duluth.\n\nGeorgia and Pennsylvania could easily decide the race for the White House on Nov. 5.

He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nBiden and Democrats have been careful to avoid commenting on Trump’s legal woes.\n\nAfter his initial comment to campaign workers in New Hampshire yesterday, Biden quickly clarified, “Politically lock him up.

And she agreed with Kelly's assessment that Trump is a \"fascist.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" she said. \"And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.\"\n\nHarris was responding to a question from Anderson Cooper, who asked her how she plans to convince millions of Americans that Trump made the comments.\n\nTrump's campaign has denied Kelly's account, and the former president assailed him on social media.\n\n\"I don't necessarily think that everyone has heard what you and I have heard repeatedly, which is, the people who know Donald Trump best . . . have all called him unfit and dangerous,\" Harris said.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nColorado man pleads guilty for threatening election officials, judge\n\nA Colorado man pleaded guilty Wednesday to threatening Colorado and Arizona election officials as well as a Colorado state judge from 2021 to 2022.\n\nIt marks the latest in a string of convictions secured by the Justice Department's election threats task force against threats to election personnel that cross state lines. Teak Brockbank, who also admitted he illegally possessed multiple firearms, posted on social media in 2021 that a Colorado election official \"has to Hang by the neck till she is Dead Dead Dead.\"\n\nIn the same post, Brockbank pledged there would be accountability \"for these peoples actions,\" saying it would come from him or from others who \"understand that there life does not matter anymore with the future our country has laid out before it.\"\n\nThe election threats task force also brought charges against two other men on Monday, one for allegedly threatening an election official in Florida and the other for allegedly threatening a Pennsylvania political party representative who was recruiting poll watchers.

Kennedy, Jr., is talking about Kelly.\n\nThe former presidential candidate called Kelly a “liar” and said the former Marine Corps general “invented” stories about Trump, while on stage in Duluth, Georgia, ahead of Trump’s appearance there this evening.\n\nKennedy also criticized Harris for “repeating these irresponsible stories.” The vice president earlier today gave a brief address from Washington regarding Kelly’s statements.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nJason Aldean introduces Trump at Georgia rally\n\nCountry singer Jason Aldean took the stage to introduce Trump at a rally in Duluth, Ga., on Wednesday night.\n\nAldean, a Georgia native who was also spotted sitting next to Trump at the Republican National Convention in July, touted his friendship with the former president.\n\n“He’s a president who when knocked down, gets back up, raises his fist in the air and says ‘fight,’” Aldean said, referring to a now infamous photo of Trump surviving the first assassination attempt against him. “And to me that’s a warrior, that’s who we need running this country right now.”\n\nThe singer emphasized Georgia’s swing state status, telling the crowd that “every vote is necessary, so do not sit this one out.”\n\nAldean and his wife have long ties with Trump. He defended the former president on social media earlier this year after Trump was criminally convicted.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nMankind vs. The Undertaker: WWE wrestlers weigh in on 2024 'Electionmania'\n\nWWE wrestlers the Undertaker and Mankind duked it out in a famous steel cage match in 1998 that left the wrestlers bloodied, and even one of them with broken bones.\n\nBut this time the fight is outside the ring – and will take place at the ballot box. Former WWE wrestler Mick Foley, also known as Mankind, on Wednesday endorsed Kamala Harris after WWE legend The Undertaker endorsed Donald Trump over the weekend.\n\n“I think it's important for everyone to have a moment where enough is enough,” Foley said in a roughly 4-minute long video posted on YouTube. “For me, enough was enough eight years ago.”\n\nTrump appeared on The Undertaker’s podcast, “Six Feet Under,” where the two spoke about realities of professional wrestling. The Undertaker, whose real name is Mark Calloway then endorsed Trump in a TikTok video on Sunday, alongside other former WWE wrestler Glen Jacobs, who played “Kane,” The Undertaker’s on-screen brother.\n\nFormer professional wrestling stars have played a role in Trump’s reelection campaign. WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan endorsed Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention over the summer.\n\nTrump, who is a member of WWE’s Hall of Fame, has long been associated with the professional wrestling company – even making his way into the ring in 2007 to feud with Vince McMahon, the former CEO of the company. McMahon is currently facing a federal investigation after a sex trafficking and sexual misconduct lawsuit was filed against him earlier this year. Linda McMahon, wife of Vince McMahon, served in the Trump administration as head of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump courts Christian voters at Georgia 'Believers' town hall\n\nTrump used a town hall focused on faith in Georgia to make a special request to Christian Americans: Vote.\n\n\"Christians are not tremendous voters,\" Trump said during a \"Believers and Ballots Faith Town Hall\" in Zebulon, Georgia.\n\nTurnout could make all the difference in Georgia, a major battleground state. Neither candidate currently holds a clear advantage in the Peach State; Trump led Harris by seven percentage points in a Quinnipiac poll last week, while Harris was up by four points in a Washington Post-Schar School survey released Monday.\n\nTrump on Wednesday also made an appeal by talking about his own beliefs.\n\n“When you have faith, when you believe in God, it’s a big advantage over people that don’t have that,” he said.\n\n− David Jackson and Savannah Kuchar\n\nAsk us anything!

The audit by Raffensper's office found just 20 noncitizens among more than 8.2 million registered voters.\n\n“This is the most comprehensive citizenship check conducted in the history of Georgia, if not the most comprehensive check ever conducted in the United States of America,” Raffensperger said.\n\nThe registrations were canceled for all 20 noncitizens, who have been referred for potential criminal prosecution, Raffensperger said.\n\nThe 20 individuals were found through affidavits they submitted to get out of jury duty, according to Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer within Raffensperger’s office.\n\n\"One of the reasons the secretary ordered this noncitizenship audit is to prove to people that, while there are ways that some can potentially get on, it is ceasingly rare,” Sterling said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHarris calls ex-aide's fascism warning a 'window into who Donald Trump really is'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris accused former President Donald Trump of wanting \"unchecked power\" as the Democratic nominee seized on remarks from John Kelly, Trump's former White House chief of staff, who warned Trump would rule like a dictator in a second term and recounted his past admiring statements about Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"This is a window into who Donald Trump really is from the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him, side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room,\" Harris said in remarks Wednesday from the vice president's Naval Observatory residence in Washington.\n\n\"The bottom line is this, we know what Donald Trump wants,\" Harris continued. \"He wants unchecked power. The question in 13 days will be: What do the American people want?\"\n\nOver three recorded interviews with the New York Times, Kelly said Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law.\n\nOver three recorded interviews with the New York Times, Kelly said Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law.\n\n\"Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he’s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators — he has said that,\" Kelly told the Times. \"So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.”\n\nHarris also referenced a separate report from the Atlantic, which quoted Trump saying that, \"I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,\" according to two unnamed individuals.\n\nThe Trump campaign has denied Kelly's accounts and the Atlantic story.\n\nSteven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, slammed Kelly’s accounts as “debunked stories” and said he had “beclowned” himself in a statement to the Times.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhen will the election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nJD Vance in Las Vegas urges supporters to vote with family, friends\n\nRepublican Vice-Presidential nominee JD Vance implored supporters during a Las Vegas rally on Tuesday to use methods of voting – including early in-person and by mail – that Republicans once criticized as ripe for fraud.\n\n“If Kamala Harris's team is using everything and we're only using one of those methods of voting, then we're going to get killed,” Vance told the crowd.\n\nDonald Trump, Vance’s running mate, attempted to sow doubt about the validity of mail-in voting during the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that it was “a whole big scam.”\n\nThis year, the Trump campaign has sought to walk back some of that rhetoric.\n\n“However you can – early, voting by mail, early in person, going on election day -- whatever makes the most sense to you. Get out there and let's try to bank as many votes by election day as possible,” Vance said on Tuesday.\n\nHe also joked that Trump supporters should “vote 10 times, the legal way” by bringing their friends and family with them to the polls.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nElection certification, inauguration to have heightened security\n\nBoth Jan. 6 and Jan. 20 will be treated as National Special Security Events, the U.S. Secret Service confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nThe results of the presidential election are certified in the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 and the next president-elect will be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20.\n\nA National Special Security Event is an event that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has deemed nationally or internationally significant and could be a target for terrorism or criminal activity, and enhanced security is likely.\n\nInaugurations, State of the Union addresses, the United Nations General Assembly and both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions are typically considered National Special Security Events. The 2024 NATO Summit held in Washington D.C. was also considered such an event.\n\nThe Secret Service could not confirm media reports that fencing would be erected around the Capitol complex from Jan. 5 to Jan. 20, said USSS spokesperson Nate Herring.\n\nAfter the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol building, an eight-foot-tall metal fence was erected around the complex and stayed up for months.\n\nThe National Park Service has already put up partial fencing near the White House that will stay up through February 2025.

The election night party could be at another venue, or spread across multiple venues, though, sources said.\n\nTrump was in New York City on election night in 2016 and the White House in 2020.\n\nKamala Harris plans to spend election night in Washington D.C. and is considering a speech at her alma mater, Howard University, according to NBC News.\n\n- Zac Anderson and David Jackson\n\nWalz: Trump crossed 'red line' with Hitler comments\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz addressed reporters Wednesday morning in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he reacted to former President Donald Trump's chief of staff John Kelly highlighting past comments made by Trump admiring Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"Donald Trump's descension into madness, and John Kelly, who I thank for showing the courage to come forward,\" Walz said. \"Truly telling the world, those closest to Donald Trump know how dangerous he is. The desire of Donald Trump to wish he had generals like Adolf Hitler had...\"\n\nHe added: \"If there was ever a red line, he has stepped across it.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung in an emailed statement to USA TODAY took issue with the former top White House staffer's comments. \"John Kelly has totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his President well while working as Chief of Staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" Cheung said.\n\n- Sam Woodward\n\nTrump's regard for Hitler referenced in 2022 book\n\nThis is not the first time voters have heard about Donald Trump's regard for German generals during the Adolf Hitler regime - or the first example of Trump's tenuous grasp of history.\n\nIn their 2022 book \"The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,\" authors Peter Baker and Susan Glasser reported that Trump told then-Chief of Staff John Kelly: \"You (bleeping) generals, why can’t you be like the German generals?”\n\nTaken aback, Kelly told Trump: “You do know that they tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off?”\n\nTrump did not know that, and insisted: “No, no, no, they were totally loyal to him.\"\n\nBaker and Glasser wrote about Trump: \"In his mind, the generals had been completely subservient to the Nazi dictator - and this was the model he wanted for his own military. Kelly told Trump there were no such generals in America, but the president was determined to test the proposition.\"\n\nTrump's campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung in an emailed statement to USA TODAY fired back at Kelly, saying the former White House chief of staff \"has totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his President well while working as Chief of Staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nJohn Kelly adviser says ‘he’s warning us’ about dangers of Trump\n\nThe Harris campaign Wednesday seized on remarks from John Kelly, Trump’s former White House chief of staff who warned that the Republican presidential nominee would rule like a dictator in a second term and made past admiring statements about Adolf Hitler.\n\nRetired Army Reserve Col. Kevin Carroll, a former senior adviser to Gen. Kelly, said during a Harris campaign call with reporters that speaking out “was no small step” for Kelly, who he called “a dedicated, measured public servant.”\n\n“But he’s seen Donald Trump up close in a way that very few other Americans have, and he's warning us that a second Trump term would be dangerous,” Carroll said.\n\n“What the public has learned about Donald Trump from John Kelly's accounting is damning,” Carroll said, adding that top officials who worked with the former president have made clear Trump “has no empathy, that he's increasingly unstable and unfit, and that he's more extreme than ever.”\n\n“Trump is seeking the power to do anything he wants, anytime he wants,\" Carroll added.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Kelly said the former president exhibits the tendencies of a fascist, including his threat to possibly use the military against domestic political opponents. Kelly also told the Times that Trump remarked on multiple occasions that “Hitler did some good things.”\n\n“It's no surprise that General Kelly came out like he did. I mean, I wish he had done it earlier, but it's great that he has,” said retired U.S. Army Brigadier Gen.

Americans, fiercely divided between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, are concerned about the accuracy of the vote count, anxious about the peaceful transition of power and even braced for political violence.\n\nNearly 8 in 10 voters trust the vote.

Among Harris voters, 70% were very confident and another 25% were somewhat confident; just 4% were not.\n\nIn contrast, a third of Trump voters, 34%, said they were not confident. The former president has fueled those concerns by continuing to argue without evidence that the 2020 election was \"rigged\" against him.\n\n−Susan Page, Sudiksha Kochi and Maya Marchel Hoff\n\nBiden tells voters to 'lock him up,' casting Trump as a menace\n\nPresident Joe Biden turned the tables on Donald Trump on Tuesday, suggesting the time has come to “lock him up” – at least politically.\n\nSpeaking to campaign workers in New Hampshire, Biden said Trump thinks he has the right under a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity “to actually eliminate, physically eliminate – shoot, kill – someone who is, he believes, to be a threat to him.”\n\n“If I said this five years ago, you’d lock me up,” Biden said during a stop at the New Hampshire Democratic Headquarters in Concord. “We’ve got to lock him up.”\n\nHe paused briefly, then added: “Politically lock him up.

Nevertheless, \"this election is critical for the capital's future\", with the next mayor overseeing the \"root and branch\" reform of the Metropolitan Police, addressing the chronic lack of affordable housing in the capital and trying to secure Transport for London's financial future.\n\nDespite being the overwhelming favourite with pollsters, bookies and political commentators, Khan \"is haunted by the spectre of defeat\", said George Eaton in The New Statesman. Khan and his team are said to fear the vote, which takes place on the same day as local elections, may be \"far closer than most believe\", partly due to the replacement of the supplementary vote system in mayoral elections with first-past-the-post voting. The change was introduced in 2021 by Boris Johnson's government and \"widely interpreted as an attempt to tilt the odds in the Tories’ favour\".\n\nWho is standing?\n\nKhan has said he wants to \"send a message\" to the Tories in seeking to become the first politician to hold the mayor of London office for three terms. He has urged voters not to \"let the Tories do to London what they've done to our country\", as he hit out at the \"hollow, desperate and divisive narrative\" put forward by the party.\n\nHe will face off against the Conservatives' Hall, a London Assembly member and former council leader. She is a vocal supporter of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Donald Trump and is hoping to ride a \"populist (if not yet popular) ticket to City Hall\", said Londonist. Since emerging from a shortlist of relative unknowns last year, Hall has endured a series of media missteps, including what The Mirror described as a \"meltdown\" on LBC when she was forced to admit she did not know the price of a bus fare, just days after criticising a decision to freeze fares in the capital. Her campaign was faced additional criticism for an attack ad in which the capital was presented as a crime-riddled Gotham-like metropolis, using footage which actually showed New York City.\n\nWhile Khan and Hall are the only candidates with a serious chance of winning in May, there are 13 people standing for election. These include the Liberal Democrats' Rob Blackie, an anti-Brexit campaigner and adviser to start-up technology companies, and Reform UK's Howard Cox, a small-business adviser with a track record of campaigning for lower petrol prices. Hackney councillor and NHS inequalities adviser Zoë Garbett will be looking to build on growing support for the Greens in the capital.\n\nIn alphabetical order, here is the full list of candidates:\n\nFemy Amin, Animal Welfare Party\n\nCount Binface, Count Binface Party\n\nRob Blackie, Liberal Democrats\n\nNatalie Campbell, Independent\n\nHoward Cox, Reform UK\n\nAmy Gallagher, Social Democratic Party\n\nZoë Garbett, Green Party\n\nTarun Ghulati, Independent\n\nSusan Hall, Conservative and Unionist Party\n\nSadiq Khan, Labour Party\n\nAndreas Michli, Independent\n\nBrian Rose, London Real Party\n\nNick Scanlon, Britain First\n\nWhat will be the key issues?\n\nKhan is looking to focus on his environmental and council-house-building policies as key achievements of his tenure, as well as the introduction of universal free school meals for primary pupils and freezing single Tube and bus fares until 2025.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph earlier this month, Hall re-iterated her plans for better policing, a greater focus on women and scrapping the ultra low emission zone (Ulez) – Khan's \"soft underbelly\" since he controversially expanded the charging zone to include outer London in August, said the paper.\n\nBut with both main candidates \"promising to bring better, greener transport to London, crack down on crime, and build more homes, according to their campaign websites\", said the London Evening Standard podcast, \"it appears that the only issue the two disagree on is Ulez\" – which Hall has made one of the centrepieces of her campaign.\n\nWhat do the polls say?\n\nA YouGov poll last week put Khan 19 points ahead of his Conservative rival but the mayor's aides insist that a \"perfect storm\" of factors could oust him from City Hall, said The New Statesman's Eaton.\n\nChief among these is the change to a first-past-the-post voting system, which is seen as the big wildcard in May's election. Forced through by the government, the change in how the mayor is elected is \"expected to improve the Conservative mayoral candidate's chances of winning in a city which has been increasingly Labour-leaning in recent years”, said On London. This is because they will not have to assemble a coalition of more than 50% of the voters; they just need the most votes.\n\nLooking at the last election, in 2021, Khan secured 40% of first preference votes, with his Tory rival Shaun Bailey on 35%. The new system will mean closing the gap should be easier for the Conservatives.\n\nIn a bid to counter this, Khan has warned against voting for other parties, arguing that a vote for the Greens or Liberal Democrats in a first-past-the-post system \"means one less vote for the Tories to get\".\n\nOn top of changes to the electoral system, Khan also faces the \"obstacles of incumbency\" in seeking a third term, said The Guardian, although the latest polls still give him a comfortable lead – albeit one growing less comfortable as election day nears.\n\nSky Bet still has Khan as the strong favourite to win at 1-25, with Hall an outsider at 8-1, so barring some 11th-hour scandal the race looks Khan's to lose.", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Catherine Garcia", "Harriet Marsden", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Rebecca Messina", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/27"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/956766/who-will-win-the-by-elections-in-wakefield-and-tiverton", "title": "Wakefield and Tiverton odds and polls: who will win the by-elections ...", "text": "Two forthcoming by-elections promise to be the next tests of the government’s popularity following the confidence vote in Boris Johnson.\n\nThe polls in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and in Tiverton and Honiton in Devon were triggered when Tory MPs resigned amid shocking headlines.

Parish, who has represented the constituency since 2010, said it had been a “moment of madness”.\n\nNHS worker Simon Lightwood will be Labour’s candidate for the Wakefield by-election. The BBC said the seat is regarded as a “key target for Labour” who had held it for more than 80 years before the Conservatives won it in 2019.\n\nThe selection of Lightwood did not come without controversy. The executive committee of the Wakefield Labour Party walked out of the final selection meeting, said The Telegraph, claiming that Lightwood was “parachuted in” by Starmer’s office. Ed Balls had also been linked with the seat but later said he had “no intention” of standing.\n\nLord David Frost, the former Brexit minister, had been rumoured by The Spectator to be a contender for the Conservative candidacy.

During Labour’s long run holding the constituency, the second-placed party was always the Conservatives.\n\nSince its creation in 1997, Tiverton and Honiton has always returned a Conservative MP. The area served by the constituency has not been represented by a party other than the Conservatives since 1923.\n\nSignificance and predictions\n\nThe two by-elections, taking place at either end of the country, “provide a dry run for the next British general election”, said The Economist.\n\nIn Wakefield, the Conservatives must show they “can hang onto the traditionally Labour-voting areas which they won in 2019”, while in Tiverton and Honiton they must “stave off a resurgent Liberal Democrat party” that has begun to “take chunks” out of their rural base.\n\nA poll from Survation on behalf of campaigning platform 38 Degrees at the start of the month put Labour 20 points ahead of the Conservatives in Wakefield. However, internal polling seen by The Sunday Times last weekend put the lead at a “less than convincing” eight points.\n\nWhile the Tories won Wakefield with just a 3,358 majority in 2019, they secured Tiverton with 24,239 votes more than Labour. Internal polling from the Lib Dems, who came in third place, suggests the party is now “neck and neck with the Conservatives” in the Devon seat, said the i news site.\n\nMost of the bookmakers agree that the Lib Dems will win, while Labour will take Wakefield.\n\nVoters in the two by-election constituencies are in a “privileged position” as they have the “opportunity to speak for the country”, said The Observer on Sunday. “A double whammy of byelection defeats will frighten Conservative MPs in red wall seats and those traditionally true blue.”\n\nYes, by-elections offer voters “a chance to protest against the government”, said Will Dunn at The New Statesman. But he warned that by “making this by-election all about Johnson and his leadership” the opposition parties also risk playing into the prime minister’s hands.\n\n“A Tory victory in the present circumstances could be spun as a kind of personal vindication,” said Dunn. And, more fundamentally, “when every vote is an act of applause or revenge, good policy and competent government become irrelevant, and populism always wins”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/23/third-party-presidential-candidates-2024-election/74501301007/", "title": "Who are the third-party candidates still running for president?", "text": "After President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the presidential election and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a November faceoff between former President Donald Trump and Harris is almost solidified.\n\nWhile the candidates for the two major parties are nearly locked in, a slate of third-party candidates, including independent Robert F.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nState and local election officials in Michigan and other political battlegrounds are gearing up to deal with a new element in this year’s elections: a large influx of Republicans seeking to become poll workers, recruited by the Republican National Committee and other conservative organizations to play an active role in administering the midterm elections.\n\nThe development – and a recent story in Politico detailing GOP recruitment sessions and how some of these would-be poll workers cling to debunked claims about fraud in the 2020 election – have raised alarms that Republican election deniers could infiltrate official election operations and undermine the process.\n\nThe surge in interest also comes against the backdrop of efforts by former President Donald Trump’s allies, such as Steve Bannon, to carry out what he calls a “precinct committee strategy,” with the goal of installing Trump loyalists in local Republican Party positions and election posts.\n\n“It is jarring to know that there is a political party, or a cohort of a political party, that is feeding folks misinformation and will use that as motivation to potentially interfere with our elections and with citizens’ right to vote,” Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, told Fredreka in a recent interview.\n\nBenson, who said she has been following the uptick in GOP poll worker applications for weeks as part of her regular discussions with local election officials, met Monday with the state attorney general’s office, the Michigan State Police and local officials to discuss, among other topics, how to protect against election interference, her aides said.\n\n‘Seat at the same table’\n\nRNC officials say their recruitment drive has a straightforward goal: correcting a longstanding party imbalance in who serves in these roles. At Detroit’s TCF Center in 2020, where election workers in the heavily Democratic city counted absentee ballots, Republicans made up 170 of the more than 5,400 poll workers, the RNC said.\n\n“We are only trying to get a seat at the same table,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a tweet.\n\nFor decades, the RNC also was shut out from so-called “ballot security” work under a federal consent decree after the national party targeted Black and Latino voters in New Jersey. The party’s operation – carried out during a 1981 gubernatorial election – included posting armed, off-duty law enforcement officers at polling places in heavily minority communities. The consent decree ended in 2018.\n\nGOP officials say they are now free to lead a multimillion-dollar electioneering effort that includes adding 16 state “election integrity” directors and 26 in-state lawyers, along with recruiting more than 14,000 poll workers and adding upwards of 10,000 poll watchers across the country.\n\nRNC communications director Danielle Alvarez said the party is scrupulously complying with state laws.\n\n“We were in a consent decree for 40 years,” she said. “We’re doing everything well above the law because we never want to be in that position again.”\n\n(A note about the distinction between workers and watchers: Poll workers are temporary employees of local election offices who receive their training and pay from those officials. Poll watchers, by contrast, are generally partisan volunteers deployed by political parties, candidates and third-party groups to “watch” or observe what’s happening at polling places. Their primary function is to help ensure their party or candidate has a fair shot of winning the election.)\n\n‘They will find there is no fraud’\n\nLocal election clerks interviewed by CNN say they stand ready to vet the new wave of GOP poll workers and deal with any challenges. But some said they weren’t overly concerned about the surge in applications and did not want voters to become unnecessarily alarmed.\n\nIn the Democratic stronghold of Detroit, more than 800 Republicans have applied for poll worker positions, said Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey. “We’ve never had as many Republican applicants,” she said. “Good for them. I hope it’s for the right and good reasons.”\n\nIn Southfield, another Democratic stronghold, the state’s GOP “election integrity” director last month forwarded the names of 76 potential poll workers to local election officials, the city clerk Sherikia Hawkins told Fredreka this week.\n\nSo far, three have formally applied to work the polls for Michigan’s August 2 primaries, Hawkins said.\n\nAnd in Canton, west of Detroit, Township Clerk Michael Siegrist said he has received applications for 11 new Republican poll workers through the GOP.\n\n“I don’t see anything here that makes me nervous,” Seigrist, a Democrat, said about the new applications.\n\nPoll workers are hired and trained by the township and take an oath “to faithfully discharge their duties,” Seigrist said. Anyone fails to do so or interferes with voting would be asked to leave a polling place, he added.\n\n“What they will find is that there is no fraud,” he said. “And they will see the boring, mundane bureaucracy of what it means to run an election.”\n\nDemocratic-led states move to expand and protect voter access\n\nIn the last week, two states – New York and Colorado – have moved to create new voter and election official protections – a departure efforts in mostly GOP-led states to limit access to the ballot box in the name of preventing fraud.\n\nLast week, in New York, the state Senate passed its own Voting Rights Act, which among other protections, would require local governments with a history of discrimination against minority voters to first get approval before making voting changes that might harm voters of color.\n\nThe bill, named after the late civil rights icon and congressman John Lewis, next heads to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s desk for approval. The Democrat is expected to sign the legislation into law.\n\nThe state Senate also passed other measures that create new criminal penalties for voter suppression, interference and deception. Separately, senators approved other election protection measures that would create new criminal penalties for voter suppression, interference and deception. Those bills still need to pass the state Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, in Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday signed into law two pieces of legislation aimed at protecting the state’s election processes from outside and insider threats. The Election Official Protection Act adds new criminal penalties for threatening or intimidating election officials.\n\nThe other legislation, known as The Colorado Election Security Act, would make it a felony for an authorized person to knowingly publish or cause to publish confidential information relating to a voting system. The legislation also requires election officials and workers to complete training and makes it a felony to tamper with voting equipment “before, during, or after any election.”\n\nThe new law follows the grand jury indictment earlier this year of Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters that stemmed from an election security breach investigation by local authorities.\n\nPrimary voters in seven states head to the polls\n\nOn Tuesday, seven states hold elections: California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.\n\nCalifornia hosts some of the most interesting contests, including the special election runoff for former Rep. Devin Nunes’ seat to represent California’s 22nd Congressional District. Nunes resigned in January to head the Trump Media & Technology Group.\n\nStaunch Republican Connie Conway and progressive Democrat Lourin Hubbard are facing off in the election to replace Nunes.\n\nWhoever wins on Tuesday probably will only serve a few months as the current district was sliced up amid the redistricting process and will cease to exist in its current form when the new Congress is sworn in next year.\n\nRead more about this race from CNN’s Maeve Reston here.\n\nIn Los Angeles, meanwhile, voters will elect a new mayor to replace term-limited Eric Garcetti. The contest features Democrat Rep. Karen Bass and real-estate developer Rick Caruso, a former Republican turned Democrat. The LA mayor’s race is a non-partisan election in which a candidate can win outright on Tuesday by winning a majority of the vote. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, then the top two vote-getters will advance to November’s general election.\n\nIn San Francisco, voters will decide whether to recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who has faced criticism amid rising crime and homelessness in the city. If a majority of voters support the recall, San Francisco Mayor London Breed would appoint an interim district attorney.\n\nMontana also will hold a primary for its newly designated 1st Congressional District. The district is located in the western part of the state and marks the first time in 30 years Montana has had two congressional seats.\n\nRyan Zinke, former Interior secretary under Trump and Montana’s one-time at-large member in the US House, is among the candidates for the GOP nomination in this heavily Republican state.\n\nThe first polls close in New Jersey, Mississippi and parts of South Dakota at 8 p.m. ET and the last in California at 11 p.m. ET.\n\nYou need to read\n\nThis New York Times story about how the US Supreme Court could weigh in on a legal theory that has the potential to upend how our elections are conducted. (We’ve touched on this so-called “independent state legislature doctrine” in this newsletter before.)\n\nThis piece in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about how a super PAC that supports Republican Herschel Walker’s US Senate bid handed out $25 vouchers for gas to voters.\n\nA look by CNN’s Maeve Reston at how growing unease with crime and homelessness is boosting billionaire developer Rick Caruso in LA’s mayoral race.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Today is Kelly’s last newsletter and last day with CNN.

Below, you'll find their written responses, presented in alphabetical order by last name. (One candidate, Spencer Dickinson, did not respond to the questionnaire. The Journal spoke with him on the phone to make sure that he was aware of the survey and the deadline.)\n\nAnswers have been edited only to conform with AP style, and not for spelling or grammar. Additionally, each candidate was informed that they would have no more than 75 words to answer each question. In instances where candidates exceeded that limit, their responses have been truncated at the 75-word mark, as indicated by an ellipsis in brackets.\n\nA separate questionnaire has been distributed to the two candidates who will appear on the Republican primary ballot. Their responses will appear in The Journal next Sunday.\n\nShould the U.S. government cancel all student loan debt, or should some Americans pay back what they owe?\n\nGabe Amo: I supported President Biden’s efforts to cancel $10,000 in federal student loan debt which was recently struck down by the Supreme Court. I would advocate to enact President Biden’s plan legislatively and would be open to canceling more than $10,000. We must cancel federal debt from predatory, for-profit institutions. Student loan debt holds back so many Americans from building wealth, buying a home, and growing or starting a small business.\n\nStephanie Beauté: The federal government's Troubled Asset Relief Program TARP provided a $700 billion bailout to keep troubled banks and companies in operation, utilizing $245 billion in taxpayer money to stabilize over 700 banks. More recently, the Paycheck Protection Program PPP provided loans to companies affected by the pandemic, and forgiven. Canceling student loan debt would boost the economy, give them the ability to buy homes, start businesses, and save for retirement.\n\nWalter Berbrick: I’m a first generation college graduate with $50K+ in student loan debt. The system is clearly broken and Rhode Islanders need relief now. I will work hard to lower costs of college, extend the freeze, forgive all student loan debt and medical debt for Americans making under $200K a year, expand Pell Grants, and make college free and forgive student loan debt for each year of public service so we can fill critical jobs.\n\nSandra Cano: Student loan debt is choking our economy. Decades ago, it didn’t cost what it does today to get a higher education. College tuition has skyrocketed well beyond inflation levels, making it less accessible to everyday people who then must rely on predatory loans. The federal government has the ability to forgive student debt; it should leverage that power to alleviate the burden on working families so the money can go more productively into our economy.\n\nDon Carlson: Student loan forgiveness should be linked to public service in chronically understaffed and underpaid professions like teaching, nursing, elder care, child care, and healthcare – as well as military service. For those professions, loan forbearance and forgiveness should begin on day one without the current 10-year waiting period. Let’s use student loan forgiveness as a way to encourage young people to pursue careers that serve the needs of the nation – and to reward those [...]\n\nStephen Casey: No, creating uncertainty in the banking industry and raising the country’s debt is not the answer. There’s also an issue of fairness for those who worked diligently to pay off their debts or the parents who paid off student loans for their children.\n\nTaking on debt and honoring financial commitments contribute to personal but the government should offer student loan refinance programs with lower payments, providing relief to borrowers while encouraging responsibility and financial understanding.\n\nJohn Goncalves: If the U.S. government can afford to forgive loans to major corporations, it can afford to forgive student loan debt. Young people took out loans because it was sold as a path to the middle class. That path has been closed for too long. Forgiving student loan debt would be a huge investment in our nation’s future by allowing young people to buy homes, start families, and create small businesses.\n\nSabina Matos: As the mother of an incoming freshman at URI, I personally understand how student loan debt is a heavy burden preventing economic mobility for millions of Americans of all ages. I support President Biden’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 per borrower and I am open to more forgiveness in the future. One aspect I like about the president’s plan is that it seeks to understand how these programs can benefit historically disadvantaged communities.\n\nAna Quezada: In Congress, I’ll fight to pass the College for All Act, which makes community college, public universities, tribal colleges and HBCUs tuition free. If we can afford to forgive PPP loans to large corporations, we can forgive student loans. K-12 education is free in the U.S. because it benefits all of society and sets up our kids for success, economic mobility, and wellbeing. I supported making CCRI and RIC free.\n\nAaron Regunberg: We’ve got to help the countless young people who are buried under mountains of student loan debt. Almost everyone with student loan debt has made payments – usually dramatic, life-restricting payments over the course of many, many years. We should start providing the millions of Americans trapped in this vicious cycle with as much relief as possible, and we should make public college tuition free to address this issue moving forward.\n\nAllen Waters: The federal government should not cancel any student loan debt as it is immoral and very unfair to the many Rhode Islanders who have already worked and paid off their college loans. At minimum, the principal amount borrowed must be paid back in full. Relatedly, I support closing the U.S. Department of Education and getting government out of the student lending business as it is inflationary and has been significant to increasing college costs.\n\nDo you think the United States should try to limit the power and influence of China? If so, please describe the policies you would support to accomplish that.\n\nAmo: I agree with President Biden that China and the United States should be economic competitors, not engaged in economic and political conflict. We should pursue diplomacy, especially on combating climate change, but we must limit their influence on industries relevant to our own national security priorities, like semiconductor, artificial Intelligence, and quantum computing sectors. We must stand firm in our defense of Taiwan and in our opposition to Beijing’s movement towards Vladimir Putin and Russia.\n\nBeauté: China's power is certainly a multifaceted and complex issue that can be viewed from various angles. From a trade and economic perspective, China's practices have been criticized for intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices, and state subsidies to domestic industries. Cyber espionage and hacking activities by China targeting other countries' governments and businesses have also been a cause for concern. This highlights the importance of having a woman with tech experience in Congress.\n\nBerbrick: The China challenge provides Congress an opportunity to rise above partisan politics and chart a smart, long-term strategy centered on cooperation, competition, and conflict. We need to focus on preventing and winning wars in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. We need to compete in Latin America and Africa, global trade, and research and development. And we need to collaborate on transnational challenges like climate change and global public health.\n\nCano: China is an important but complex ally, and competitor, on the world stage. We must hold China accountable to their continued contributions to the global economy, including infrastructure investments in developing nations as well as innovations in sustainable energy technology. We should make this a priority while investing in our own small businesses and protecting manufacturing jobs in America.\n\nCarlson: Yes. The most effective strategy is using our leverage wherever possible to bring manufacturing jobs back home. The CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act show we can decrease our reliance on Chinese manufacturing by providing incentives to buy American products and technology. Our supply chains will be more resilient, our economy healthier, and our planet cleaner if we can reduce our dependence on goods shipped from China. Moreover, our national security will be enhanced.\n\nCasey: The United States and China are two of the world's largest economies, and their economic interdependence is significant. Working closely with RIMA I saw the impact of supply chain disruptions on Rhode Island’s economy. Fairtrade practices make it difficult for businesses to compete and highlight the need to support reshoring to bring jobs back. Competition, collaboration, trade negotiations, and domestic investment in critical industries will ensure a balanced approach to managing China's influence.\n\nGoncalves: The best way that the U.S. can counter China’s influence is by growing our economy and rehabilitating America’s image with the world. As a millennial son of immigrants who grew up in a global world, I will bring a much needed fresh perspective to this effort. That includes supporting our allies and taking on threats like Russia’s aggression, but also tackling problems at home like gun violence and attacks on democracy that horrify the world.\n\nMatos: China represents the greatest geopolitical adversary to the United States. The government in Beijing has made clear they have little interest in cooperation, while their unfair trade practices hurt millions of Americans. I support cracking down on harmful Chinese trade practices, such as their theft of American innovation, and curbing Chinese influence in the Pacific and across the globe.\n\nQuezada: China continues to buy influence throughout the world, especially Latin America and Africa where the U.S. has failed to make investments in democracy and fair trade. We can limit China’s power through trade policy. We need to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. I also support the federal bill to ban oil exports to foreign adversaries like China and prohibit the Department of Energy from exporting petroleum products from the Strategic Reserve.\n\nRegunberg: I strongly support policies to build American, rebuild U.S. manufacturing, and prioritize American workers over multinational and Chinese corporations that have benefited from a shift in industry from the U.S. to China. But we need a sober – rather than alarmist – approach to U.S.-China policy, and we can’t lose sight of the need to work together with China on issues like climate.\n\nWaters: As it has grown to be our greatest adversary and an irresponsible global actor, China is an existential threat to American interests and values, internationally and domestically, like stealing trillions of dollars of intellectual property and a negative influence on American college campuses. To counter China in this New Cold War, I support polices growing the economy and providing energy independence, strong supply chains, secure borders, military deterrence and renewed Western global partnerships and leadership.\n\nWhat Rhode Island projects would you fight for to receive federal dollars through appropriations in omnibus spending bills?\n\nAmo: - Coastal resilience projects in communities like Barrington and Newport.- Expansion of workforce development and opportunities to place Rhode Island at the center of the clean energy supply chain, including the South Quay Marine Terminal in East Providence.- Additional funding to build out the Blackstone Valley National Park and protect and enhance the Blackstone Valley region- Public transit funding to close RIPTA shortfalls and improve our rail connection to Boston- Homelessness prevention funding for local providers\n\nBeauté: As your next Congresswoman, I believe it is crucial to prioritize the state's economic development and growth. We need to provide small businesses with the necessary resources. Investing in the local economy will stimulate growth and increase the standard of living for Rhode Islanders. Lastly, the blue economy is an essential part of Rhode Island's economy, this will promote sustainable economic growth while preserving our environment. That IS a campaign promise!\n\nBerbrick: To help working families and deliver a strong return on investment to taxpayers, we’ve got to make smart, forward-looking investments to lower costs for Rhode Islanders, protect our democracy, and tackle our climate crises. I’m focused on directing crucial federal funding back home on projects that improve Rhode Island’s public transportation and cleaner energy infrastructure, housing, K-12 education, retirement security, voter access, and protecting our air, water and public lands.\n\nCano: Rhode Island needs strong investments in infrastructure, with particular attention to projects that help bolster resiliency for municipalities across the district as we face the multifaceted threat of climate chaos. Sea level rise, flash flooding, extreme heat, deep freezes, storms and more threaten our communities while bridges and schools crumble. Investing in sustainable infrastructure will create well-paid jobs (especially by employing union workers) and help us transition to a green economy.\n\nCarlson: I would do a comprehensive search of the District to prioritize projects in close consultation with local leaders and David Cicilline. Top of the list: new life for the Cranston Street Armory; creating affordable housing options in our urban core surrounding Providence; reimagining the huge tracts of abandoned Navy land on Aquidneck Island that have been fallow for far too long; and investing in climate resiliency in low-lying areas like Barrington and other coastal zones.\n\nCasey: My priority is initiatives critical to economic development, public health, and education. I support the Pawtucket Development and the Housing, Jobs & Economic Development Initiative for Woonsocket and the recent $2 million request for Crossroads Rhode Island to build residential units.\n\nPresident Biden’s Infrastructure package is critical for improvements to our electric grid, schools, roads, and bridges after years of cutbacks in funding. We must also address the potential shortfall for social security and Medicare.\n\nGoncalves: We need to make Rhode Island a more attractive place to live and raise a family. In Congress, I will fight for federal funds to build more affordable housing, expand public transportation, and fully fund early education programs. I’ll also fight for funding that would invest in clean energy projects that reduce pollution, create good paying jobs, and move Rhode Island towards a carbon-neutral future.\n\nMatos: I believe that Rhode Island needs to continue to build its infrastructure, particularly when it comes to public transportation and housing. The lack of available housing is driving the cost of living up in every community. I will support programs that build more homes in Rhode Island at all income levels. I also will make repairs to the Mt. Hope bridge a priority.\n\nQuezada: I would fight to bring federal dollars to Rhode Island to support investments in its people. This includes building new schools, creating green jobs, investing in roads and bridges that are bike and pedestrian friendly, coastal protections to prevent catastrophic flooding, and expanding Medicaid funding to cover women’s health, housing, mental health, addiction treatment, and recovery services.\n\nRegunberg: Our next Congressperson must be ruthlessly persistent in securing federal dollars for Rhode Island. I’d fight for funding from recently enacted programs to make our schools more energy efficient, upgrade classroom air quality, and transition to electric school buses. I’d advocate for resources to support our developing offshore wind industry and strengthen industrial infrastructure. And I’ll make sure we get as many dollars as possible from the Inflation Reduction Act for pollution reduction and decarbonization.\n\nWaters: I support fiscal responsibility in Congress. Omnibus bills are haven for wasteful spending, earmarks and typically leave no time for debate, and must offer more cuts for budget deficit reduction to reduce the high inflation associated with excess government spending. Infrastructure. Community Development Block Grants. Fire Prevention. Affordable Cooperative Housing to promote ownership. Arts funding in schools.\n\nGina Raimondo says the CHIPS Act will restore critical domestic computer chip manufacturing, while Bernie Sanders calls it corporate welfare. Who is right?\n\nAmo: President Biden and his administration, including Secretary Raimondo. The CHIPS and Science Act has already led to an increase in domestic manufacturing investment and will strengthen our national security. There is no question that the CHIPS and Science Act will be one of President Biden’s lasting accomplishments. I am proud to have helped get the bill across the finish line and will work as a member of Congress to steer that funding to Rhode Island.\n\nBeauté: Bernie’s been wrong on some things, on this and his latest endorsement in this race. The CHIPS Act creates an opportunity that involves utilizing the state's industry to secure funds and create thousands of jobs while positioning the U.S. as a leader in this space. The initiative is expected to bring in billions of dollars in revenue and offer good-paying jobs at various levels. I intend to bring those dollars here to our state.\n\nBerbrick: The bipartisan CHIPS Act allows American manufacturers to compete with China and bolster our economy. Investments in the semiconductor industry must prioritize good-paying jobs, support domestic supply chains, and respond to current national security challenges. American workers deserve the right to care for their families and retire with dignity and financial security. A worker-centered focus is critical to delivering on the CHIPS Act's promise of rebuilding the semiconductor industry and a strong middle class.\n\nCano: The global supply chain breakdown in recent years was the direct result of a globalizing, relatively unregulated economy. The CHIPS Act invests in domestic high tech manufacturing in order to reduce our reliance on foreign manufacturing while boosting our economy. It will provide well-paid jobs and opportunity for more Americans, and bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States, all of which will help position our economy for resilience and leadership in the next century.\n\nCarlson: Secretary Raimondo is right. The CHIPS Act is essential to maintaining strong national security and reducing our dependence on China. Semiconductor chips are essential components for everything from refrigerators to phones and cars. Depending on our adversary leaves us vulnerable to hacking, spyware, and sudden supply cuts that cripple American industry and cause spikes in inflation – as we experienced so painfully during Covid. Shame on us if we don’t learn our lessons from that [...]\n\nCasey: Semiconductor technology is critical to the U.S. economy and it’s importance cannot be overstated. Industries including advanced medical devices, industrial equipment, and defense systems combined with rapidly changing technology in areas of artificial intelligence, data analytics, and 5G networks are critical to global competitiveness. Maintaining a strong domestic chip manufacturing capability allows the U.S. to remain at the forefront of innovation while safeguarding national security, economic growth, and technological leadership.\n\nGoncalves: I support the CHIPS Act, but I agree with Bernie Sanders that Congress needs to crack down on corporate welfare. Mega corporations shouldn’t be getting blank checks from the government in the form of tax breaks. Instead, we should be focusing on creating jobs by investing in small businesses and supporting companies that keep jobs in the U.S. That’s why I support a corporate minimum tax to make sure corporations pay their fair share.\n\nMatos: I believe that the United States needs to establish its own ability to build the things on which we rely. Otherwise, we are vulnerable to global political and supply chain issues that could be beyond our control. Computer chip manufacturing is a glaring example of this dynamic and I agree with Secretary Raimondo’s position on the CHIPS Act.\n\nQuezada: It’s corporate welfare. These corporations make huge profits. We need to stop giving handouts to large corporations and instead invest in people through education, housing, and health care. One potential hazard is that implementing the CHIPS Act may also inadvertently signal to the Chinese that we are unlikely to support Taiwan against an occupation.\n\nRegunberg: This is absolutely an opportunity to do good things for local communities who need this investment – re-shore production, bring back domestic manufacturing, prevent shortages, and more. But we can’t simply throw billions in subsidies at the same old corporate conglomerates who made a mess in the first place. That’s why we need to make sure these dollars are attached to unions, good pay, and community benefit agreements.\n\nWaters: U.S. semiconductor chip manufacturers are a highly profitable and the worldwide industrial leader with one-half of global market share. With the CHIPs Act, America moves away from a free-market philosophy to giving the government more leeway in manipulating the economy through industrial policy, a soft form of centralized control, using subsidies, regulation, and taxation. It puts Americans on the hook for $52 billion in subsidies and $24 billion in tax credits. I stand with Bernie.\n\nTo fight climate change, should the U.S. enact policies, such as a carbon tax or bans on fossil fuel infrastructure, that raise the cost of oil and gas?\n\nAmo: We must work to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and swiftly move towards renewable sources of energy. There are a range of factors that increase the cost of oil and gas. Ultimately, consumers will spend less money and use less energy as we build out our electric vehicle infrastructure, including a nationwide charging network, modernize our grid, and expand the production and use of alternative forms of energy like wind and solar.\n\nBeauté: It is important to address the issue of climate change and its impact on our planet, but we must also be mindful of the impact it has on our working citizens. The rising cost of food and gas has sent a crippling ripple effect through our economy. Extreme shifts in policy will not immediately reset the planet. We need to do our part while also ensuring that our working citizens are not bankrupted by the [...]\n\nBerbrick: As a career climate educator and policymaker, I speak with conviction in saying that a carbon tax is one of the most effective tools to reduce carbon emissions and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. To restore our position as a global climate leader, we must act now to save our planet. Moreover, revenue earned from carbon pricing can be used to reduce the effects of climate change on the most vulnerable communities.\n\nCano: All climate solutions need to be implemented through a lens of equity and justice: no intervention should burden the working class or marginalized communities. Nuanced analysis needs to be conducted on any policy. Higher fossil fuel prices would disproportionately impact lower income families for whom gas and utilities take up a higher percentage of the household budget, and for whom many green alternatives remain inaccessible. We must make sure our policies make sustainability broadly accessible.\n\nCarlson: I was a proud signer of the Economists’ Statement on Carbon Dividends in January 2019. The Carbon Dividends plan is NOT a tax; no money sticks to the government. The entire amount of the assessment is rebated out to every U.S. citizen in equal lump-sum dividends – much like the Alaska Permanent Fund. As a champion of this idea, I was deeply gratified by its endorsement by thousands of respected economists.\n\nCasey: As a 17-year EMT/Firefighter, no one sees the impact of climate change more than I do. I support initiatives to create a resilient infrastructure and allow the U.S. to transition to renewable energy sources that reduce greenhouse gases. Congress needs to encourage innovation and research to develop advanced renewables and research institutions. I support collaborating on grid modernization, expansion, and maintenance to accommodate renewable energy, energy storage systems, and advanced technologies for our infrastructure.\n\nGoncalves: That’s a false binary choice. The cost of oil and gas is rising because our world is running out of easily-obtained fossil fuels. Last year, fossil fuel corporations received almost $50 billion in tax breaks, while climate-fueled natural disasters cost the U.S. $165 billion. Clean energy would reduce costs for American households, reduce the deficit, and ensure there is a world to pass on to our grandchildren.\n\nMatos: The climate crisis is one of, if not the most, pressing threat to our economy, our way of life, and our future. At the federal level, we must crack down on polluters and incentivize businesses and individuals to move toward alternative, sustainable sources of energy. I would like to see us fast-tracking projects for offshore wind, like the one in Rhode Island, rather than implementing immediate bans on our existing infrastructure.\n\nQuezada: Yes. Carbon is a pollutant and should be taxed like one. We should ban new fossil fuel infrastructure. I was a co-sponsor on the bill imposing a carbon tax on R.I. corporations selling fossil fuels. I fought to stop an LNG facility because pollution from the port already affects my community’s health. We need to help people, especially poorer people, transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy like wind and solar power for their homes.\n\nRegunberg: We need to phase out fossil fuels as quickly as possible to have a shot at securing a livable future. And we must do it equitably. As a state legislator, I introduced carbon pricing legislation that would have protected working families from price hikes. In Congress, I’d continue fighting to make sure that the companies who brought our climate to the brink are the ones paying for our energy transition, not working families.\n\nWaters: Renewable Energy is 12% of U.S. Primary Energy Consumption (2021) and of which wind power is 27% of the Renewable Energy 12% and solar is 12% of the 12%. It is undeniable risk of folly for the government to continue to push a climate change industrial policy agenda to reduce the risk of global warming, when doing so by actively reducing the use of fossil fuels will destroy the economy and cause a depression.\n\nShould Congress scale back environmental regulations to allow renewable energy infrastructure to be built faster?\n\nAmo: We should not. We can protect our environment and move quickly without doing away with important regulations. I would look towards the appropriate agencies to direct and improve the regulatory process rather than forcing political intervention. There are investments in President Biden’s historic Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the growth of renewable energy infrastructure. We need a congressperson who is laser-focused on defending that legislation and its transformational impact from being gutted by Republican leadership.\n\nBeauté: At the heart of this issue is a fundamental question: how can we foster innovation and creativity in the renewable energy sector while still protecting our natural resources and ensuring a sustainable future? It is a challenge I deem worth committing to, and one that requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the complex interplay between economic development, environmental protection, and technological advancement. Scaling back environmental regulations is not the answer.\n\nBerbrick: Yes, we must build more renewable energy faster. But ignoring environmental laws isn’t the way to do it. We must make it easier to quickly build new transmission lines that would unlock a tidal wave of new wind, solar, and energy storage. I propose giving the FERC the ability to site new transmission lines across the country, require regional grid operators to strengthen connections, and require the voices of affected local communities be heard.\n\nCano: When renewable energy infrastructure conflicts with environmental regulation, another solution needs to be found. Cutting down trees to build solar panels might be the most expedient path to the infrastructure goal, however it’s counterproductive. We need to build the political will to get creative and utilize regulation to implement sustainable infrastructure solutions that make sense – like solar panels over existing parking lots and other paved spaces.\n\nCarlson: Yes. We face a climate emergency right now. As with any crisis we need to respond decisively with action: grid upgrades, charging stations, rapid deployment of renewable energy generation. Fossil fuel interests are spending billions in a last ditch attempt to save their profits. If we want to save the planet these critical initiatives can’t be bogged down forever in court. We can’t be reckless, but full speed ahead with all reasonable new projects.\n\nCasey: As our understanding of climate change evolves, regulations should be adaptable and updated to reflect the latest scientific knowledge and technological advancements. Regulations play a crucial role driving the adoption of cleaner technologies and protecting the environment, but we should focus on refining and targeting regulations to address specific areas detrimental to innovation or incentivizing clean energy; scaling back regulations could reverse progress. Instead, Congress should encourages innovation and promotes collaboration among stakeholders.\n\nGoncalves: It doesn’t have to be either or. In Europe, infrastructure follows stricter environmental and labor regulations and is still built at a much faster pace. We should be looking to Europe and Asia for best practices and engineering expertise. Then Congress needs to approach infrastructure building like we did in the 1950s with the interstate highway system: a clearly defined vision, measurable outcomes, and sustained investment.\n\nMatos: There is no question that we need to build renewable energy infrastructure faster. However, I believe that proper regulatory oversight is necessary to ensure the safe and responsible implementation of energy programs. Many of the biggest climate-impacting accidents in recent years have come at times when federal regulators had been reeled in by Republican-led deregulation efforts.\n\nQuezada: While we need new renewable energy infrastructure, it doesn’t make sense to reduce the regulations that protect people. However, if we can make the paperwork processes easier, I’d be open to looking into that.\n\nRegunberg: No – this is a false choice. Facilitating the urgent work of taking clean energy to scale doesn’t require us to gut bedrock environmental laws like the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA). But we can – and, I believe, should – create fast-track pathways for projects that would lower emissions, to help speed the development of renewable energy infrastructure without throwing the door open to polluting and dangerous new fossil fuel infrastructure.\n\nWaters: Infrastructures of wind, solar and electricity transmission run up against wildlife protection requirements because of bad effects they often have on migratory birds, marine mammals, and other biodiversity. Environmental protections are in place to protect the public, wildlife, and rights and powers of state and local jurisdictions. A problem with government actively replacing fossil fuels with wind and solar are the inherent unreliability of both. Waters for Congress supports nuclear power expansion with 24/7 reliability.\n\nThe U.S. continues to lead our peers around the world in terms of gun deaths and mass shootings. What country would you look to as a model for firearm legislation here and why?\n\nAmo: I would look towards Australia. In 1996, there was a mass shooting in Port Arthur, Tasmania that killed 35 people. They immediately responded and banned semi-automatic weapons and passed stricter gun ownership rules, some of which, admittedly, would not pass constitutional muster in the United States. However, Australia’s swiftness is something we should mirror in the United States so that we finally put an end to the plague of gun violence in our communities.\n\nBeauté: I would model my legislation after Japan. Individuals must complete a series of steps. First, they need to attend an all-day class, pass a written test, and achieve a minimum of 90% accuracy during a shooting-range test. Following this, they must pass a mental-health evaluation at a hospital and undergo a background check, where they will investigate any criminal records or ties and interview friends and family members.\n\nBerbrick: As a veteran, I know firsthand the responsibility and risks of handling firearms. Like Australia, I’d ban automatic and semiautomatic assault rifles; require a license, registration, and firearm safety course; and create a permanent gun buyback program to remove illegal or unwanted guns off our streets. Like Israel, I’d raise the age for ALL firearms purchases to 21, and require gun owners be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, and pass a health screening.\n\nCano: We are the only country in the developed world with a gun violence epidemic. We must move past the rhetoric and build up our political will to pass lifesaving laws like banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines, closing loopholes, and expanding background checks. Interventions like these will protect our communities – and keep all Americans safer.\n\nCarlson: Evidence: A British gunman killed 16 people in 1987; U.K. banned semiautomatic weapons. Same with most handguns after 1996 school shooting. U.K. has one of the lowest gun-related death rates in the developed world. A 1996 Australia massacre prompted mandatory gun buybacks that saw as many as 1 million firearms melted into slag. The rate of mass shootings plummeted from once every 18 months to only one in 26 years since.\n\nCasey: As a 17-year EMT/Firefighter, my focus is keeping people safe. I support President Biden's bipartisan \"Safer Communities Act\" which addresses children's mental health, housing, and related challenges and relies on evidence-based initiatives to prevent gun-related fatalities. I am a staunch proponent of strengthening universal background checks, terminating online sales of firearms and eliminating loopholes allowing anyone who should not be in possession of a firearm to acquire one; my priority is addressing the presence [...]\n\nGoncalves: As a teacher, this is something I unfortunately think about every single day. I have to teach my fourth graders how to defend themselves from an armed shooter, because an extremist Supreme Court majority is hell bent on gutting gun control laws.\n\nOur children would be safer if we had New Zealand’s political leaders, who acted decisively and swiftly after the 2019 Christchurch massacre to introduce a nationwide ban on assault rifles.\n\nMatos: There are countless countries that have common-sense gun safety legislation in place and they have far less gun violence. That being said, the first country I would look toward as an example is the United States. From 1994-2004 the U.S. had a federal assault weapons ban in place. It was only after it was allowed to expire that the number of AR-15-style rifles and the number of mass shootings began to surge throughout the nation.\n\nQuezada: Switzerland has very high rates of gun ownership and zero mass shootings because gun owners are required to apply for a license, pass red-flag checks, and undergo firearms training. As I’ve supported here in Rhode Island, we can and should pass common sense gun regulations like safe storage, background checks, red flag laws, and others which most Americans, including most gun owners, agree with.\n\nRegunberg: In 1996 Australia experienced a horrible mass shooting. Instead of bowing to the gun industry with useless “thoughts and prayers,” Australian leaders passed the National Firearms Agreement (NFA), which banned assault weapons and introduced a mandatory buyback program. Following the passage of the NFA, firearm suicide and homicide rates dramatically declined in Australia. We know what we have to do in the U.S. – we just need the political courage to do it.\n\nWaters: Rhode Island and America have a cultural Marxism problem where the ideals of family values, individual freedom, personal responsibility, freedom of speech, civil order, and a fair and balanced rule of law are being slowly undermined and compromised. Waters for Congress does not wish to use another nations’ model of gun control as our right to bear arms under 2A of the Constitution extends our natural right of self-defense and to keep tyrants at bay.\n\nGiven your personal experience, which House committee assignment would you most desire? How would you use it to impact RI?\n\nAmo: Obviously, I would love to be on Appropriations so that I can bring as many resources and jobs back to Rhode Island as possible. However, that would not be an option until I build up seniority. Realistically, I could join the Science, Space, and Technology Committee to invest in local jobs: at our federal labs, in agencies like NOAA, and research and development in critical industries in non-defense sectors.\n\nBeauté: If elected, I would most desire to join the Small Business Committee. Small businesses are the backbone of our state and it's time we start treating them like it. As someone who attended Hope High School, I have seen firsthand the failures of our education system. That's why I am also committed to joining the Education & Workforce Committee. It’s a committee that I also would be eligible for as a Freshman.\n\nBerbrick: The House committees on Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence, and Energy and Commerce are the most natural fits for me. But, I’m most interested in solving one of the greatest challenges facing Rhode Islanders today: HOUSING. As a member and eventual Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development & Insurance, I will advocate for increased affordable housing initiatives, streamlined access to housing assistance programs, and effective policies to combat homelessness.\n\nCano: I’m interested in the Committee on Education and the Workforce, as well as the Appropriations Committee. We need to protect and increase the federal investments that come back to Rhode Island to support our economy. Funding infrastructure improvements that improve our resiliency and climate preparedness is critical, and supports well-paid union labor jobs. We also need to ensure that schools are properly resourced and have what they need for students and teachers to thrive.\n\nCarlson: Energy & Commerce. All the action in the coming decade will be around the rapid transition to a renewable energy economy. Rhode Island can be the renewable energy hub of the Northeast if we claim bold leadership of the offshore wind industry today. Then we can build an ecosystem of thriving sustainable businesses (like Flux Marine) using the resources I can secure under the Inflation Reduction Act. E&C is where I can make that happen.\n\nCasey: House Veterans Affairs Committee because the Committee plays a critical role in addressing the needs and challenges faced by veterans. As a 17-year EMT/Firefighter, I see the struggles of those who served our country – they deserve better. I will advocate for increased funding to improve access to healthcare services and promote legislation and funding to address homelessness among veterans, including housing assistance programs that increase access to mental health services and job training.\n\nGoncalves: As an educator, I would bring much needed expertise and perspective to the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Rhode Island’s population is shrinking because young people grow up and move away to Boston or New York. We need to invest in the next generation to keep our state alive by increasing the federal minimum wage to $17/hr, passing paid family and sick leave, eliminating student debt, and expanding small business loans.\n\nMatos: Having spent more than a decade in local government before becoming Lt. Governor, I know how important public transportation and its infrastructure is to communities at all levels. I would like to serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure committee where I would help push federal support to build robust, renewable public transportation infrastructure in Rhode Island.\n\nQuezada: The Judiciary Committee. I serve on the Senate Judiciary because I’m passionate about criminal justice reform and human rights. I have been the most vocal champion for reforming LEOBoR, which unfairly protects police officers who abuse their power. I’m the only candidate who includes the words “Mass Incarceration” and “War on Drugs” in their website. The Federal Judiciary Committee will draft articles of impeachment against Justice Thomas for failing to disclose significant financial contributions.\n\nRegunberg: I am passionate about the climate crisis. As an organizer, I worked to limit pollution; as a state legislator, I created new clean energy programs; and as a climate lawyer, I’ve supported cases holding Big Oil accountable for their environmental crimes. I want to take that experience to the Energy and Commerce Committee. I’d also hope to continue David Cicilline’s work of taking on corporate monopolies on Judiciary.\n\nWaters: Based on my career experience of working as an investment consultant for various firms, the Financial Services Committee, would be a solid fit, but I would prefer to be assigned to the Committee on Education and the Workforce as one of my top choices because the goal of a receiving a solid grade level public education is failing too many students in Rhode Island which for most negatively affects their life long human capital potential.\n\nWhat's one thing you'd like to see Congress do to address the housing crisis, or increase housing production?\n\nAmo: Pass the elements of the Build Back Better proposal that were not included in the final Inflation Reduction Act, like massive investments in preserving our current public housing, building new rental units for extremely low income families, expanding rental assistance programs, and other programs to improve access to housing. I would incentivize zoning changes in communities and invest in housing-choice vouchers, known as Section 8, to make sure that they meet rising housing costs.\n\nBeauté: I have many but I would advocate for Low Income Housing Tax-Credits: simply put I would expand the Housing tax credit to encourage investment in the creation of low income as well as affordable housing projects.\n\nBerbrick: We need a bold, bipartisan response to reduce barriers to construction and build more homes that Rhode Islanders can afford now. I’ll do this by removing the federal volume cap on state’s private activity bonds (PABs) issuance, strengthening the Low-Income Tax Credit (LIHTC) program, promoting investment in entry-level starter homes, encouraging zoning reform, and creating a National Housing Loss Rate like the National Unemployment Rate to improve accountability and allocation of funding to local communities.\n\nCano: I support increasing funding for affordable housing programs, expanding transit-oriented development, providing rent subsidies, offering tax incentives for developers who build low-income housing, implementing zoning reforms, and protecting the rights of renters. Access to safe, stable, and decent homes isn’t a luxury; it’s a fundamental human right that must be upheld by our policymakers at all levels of government.\n\nCarlson: The root cause of the housing crisis is spiraling inequality. We build far too many mansions and luxury apartments and far too few affordable houses for the middle class. We need to spread wealth around more fairly – as we did in the rapid growth periods of the past (except without the racism this time). We need to rebuild our urban core with affordable housing to relieve the present crisis, but fairness is the long-term fix.\n\nCasey: I am proud as Chair, House Municipal Government and Housing Committee we passed the most comprehensive package in state history. Rhode Island’s history creating housing for employees would address the crisis. Formerly known as mill villages, these developments were built around factories to accommodate the workforce, providing housing, focused on smart growth design. Congress should incentivize employers and communities to encourage housing innovation. Drawing inspiration from the past will guide solutions for the future.\n\nGoncalves: If elected, I will work to expand the Low Income Housing Tax Credit to incentivize additional development and fight for a comparable Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit. I’ll also fight for the rights of existing tenants by co-sponsoring Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s bill that would establish a national cap on annual rent increases, restrict evictions without just cause, and make it illegal for landlords to discriminate against people who receive federal housing assistance.\n\nMatos: The most pressing thing that can be done at the federal level to address the housing crisis is to change the federal definition of homelessness. Right now, a family cannot receive federal support unless they are literally sleeping on the street or in a shelter. These people should be able to access federal support sooner so that they can avoid homelessness in the first place.\n\nQuezada: In Rhode Island, I passed legislation allowing old abandoned buildings to be rebuilt as affordable housing. Increasing housing supply would be one of my top priorities. Housing that is affordable to poor people requires federal subsidies to build. Building enough housing gets us only half way. I would support making Section 8 vouchers an entitlement program, ensuring that our lowest income neighbors, veterans, single moms, and people with disabilities can afford their home.\n\nRegunberg: New Deal Democrats launched housing programs that lifted millions out of poverty. We need that same energy today. I’d fight for direct federal spending and partnerships with states and local governments to build public, mixed-income housing in our communities. As a first step, I would advocate for the passage of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s American Housing and Economic Mobility Act, which would increase the national Housing Trust Fund by $445 billion.\n\nWaters: Waters for Congress is a strong advocate of cooperative housing in which tenants do not own the units in which they live, but own common shares of the corporation that owns the building. In Rhode Island, our political leaders at the State House, especially acting as reactionaries in this avoidable housing crisis, promote rental property development. Paying rent enriches the landlord. Paying off a mortgage on co-op housing shares provides the growth of financial equity.\n\nIs the Biden administration wrong to stop asylum seekers at the southern border?\n\nAmo: The Biden Administration has made progress in relieving pressure at the border by creating a parole system for certain countries and establishing more outposts across the Americas to increase access to legal pathways. We need to provide more support to swiftly process people upon arrival. Additionally, I support giving migrants the ability to legally work once they reach the United States as a strategy to address the arrival of asylum seekers at the border.\n\nBeauté: The issue of immigration reform has been a long-standing problem that needs to be addressed immediately. As someone with extensive experience in tackling complex issues, I believe it's time to resolve this roadblock. It shows instability in other nations and our own. Skipping the line is unfair to those who have followed the rules, and it ultimately breaks our immigration system. It's time for both sides to come together and work towards a solution that will work.\n\nBerbrick: Congress must confront cruelty with compassion and common sense. We must act now on regulatory and operational reforms while preserving due process and avoiding widespread detention. I will fight for bipartisan legislation that offers a path to citizenship for current and future immigrants, makes the Dream and Promise Act permanent, provides an automatic pathway to citizenship for military enlistment, and funding for new regional processing centers, and a whole-of-government Latin America strategy.\n\nCano: The system is broken: it’s failing migrants and communities across geography and ideology. What gets lost in the southern border conversation is the humanity of those leaving everything behind to get to safety. As someone who sought asylum in America, and as a current legislator who understands what it takes to craft policy, I know there’s no easy solution. However, we risk violating our obligations under the U.N. Convention on Refugees by deporting asylum seekers.\n\nCarlson: There is a humanitarian crisis at our southern border, and there are thousands of families looking to our great nation with hopes of a better life. I believe we should treat all asylum seekers with the utmost respect and dignity. However, our resources are limited, and we cannot simply open our borders without consequence. I believe all asylum seekers should be granted access to the proper legal process before a determination is made.\n\nCasey: Refusing asylum to an asylum seeker involves complex considerations, with both pros and cons. We should enact strict security measures to keep Americans safe and prevent potential threats from taking advantage of the asylum process to gain entry. We must find a way to ensure resources are allocated appropriately because the immigration system is overwhelmed creating a humanitarian crisis.\n\nGoncalves: We can secure our borders without criminalizing lawful asylum seekers. I’m the proud son of immigrants who came to this nation for a better life for themselves and their children. These asylum seekers are fleeing extreme violence to do the same. Allowing asylum seekers to enter the U.S. and work as they await their court date will reduce crowding at overfilled border shelters and help with our nation’s labor shortage with 10 million jobs unfilled.\n\nMatos: As someone who came to this country as a young woman, in search of the American Dream, I understand the challenges of our immigration system. The United State's asylum program arose from our considerable history of exclusion toward certain groups and is an important part of our country's values. Every request for asylum should be considered carefully and individuals seeking asylum should be able to know they are safe while their request is being considered.\n\nQuezada: President Biden is wrong. These people are fleeing oppression and coming to our country as political and climate refugees. This country was built by immigrants (and slave-labor) and we need to make sure we support those who are looking for a safe life for their families. Hard-working people who want to escape poverty and pay taxes are the American Dream. Investing in them will grow the economy and broaden our tax base.\n\nRegunberg: Yes. As the grandson of a refugee from the Holocaust, my family knows all too well that asylum policy can be a matter of life and death. I believe the Biden administration must replace its “Circumvention of Lawful Pathways” rule with solutions that prioritize the protection of human life. We should end asylum bans and create a fair and orderly process to seek asylum at the border.\n\nWaters: The primary role of government is to protect the American people. The Biden Administration has not only failed to protect us by enforcing and maintaining our immigration laws and the assumed civil order that is associated doing so, but has blatantly ignored our laws encouraging mass illegal migration into the U.S., increasing safety risks, financial burdens, and illegal competition for scarce resources such as jobs, housing, and medical care upon us. Asylum is subjectively qualitative.\n\nLastly, on a more fun note: If you could get any vanity plate, what would it say?\n\nAmo: RI4EVR\n\nBeauté: RIJOBS (“RI JOBS”) Rhode Island has consistently been ranked as the lowest for small businesses for several decades. If elected, I will prioritize policies that support small businesses and entrepreneurs, and work towards creating a more supportive environment for them to thrive in. When I win, I’ll request the plate name (assuming it hasn’t been changed, that’s a campaign promise!)\n\nBerbrick: IWork4U\n\nCano: VOTE 11 – I am the 11th candidate on the ballot and it's important for people to vote.\n\nCarlson: I currently have a vanity plate! “Loon82” is derived from my spirit animal and my Boy Scout Troop 82 on the East Side of Providence, led by the legendary Scoutmaster Donald C. Dewing after whom I am named.\n\nCasey: RI CD1\n\nFor the record, I had the students at River’s Edge Arts in Woonsocket design my Casey for Congress RI business cards – which are designed using the backdrop of our Ocean State plates\n\nGoncalves: EDUC8 ME since I’m a teacher and I believe you never stop learning. As a city councilman, I learned so much from my constituents by being willing to meet with them and engage and that’s the energy I’m going to bring to Congress.\n\nMatos: WMN2W1N\n\nQuezada: ¡ SI SE PUEDE !\n\nRegunberg: I’m not cool enough to pull off any vanity plates. I never used my state representative plates either. But I love seeing funny vanity plates when I’m driving!\n\nWaters: CFMILK [Waters explained this stands for coffee milk.]", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/17"}]}

It’s the newest part of the brain in terms of evolution, and differentiates the brains of mammals from other animals, according to researchers.\n\nA team of researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston started by recording brain activity in a portion of the mouse’s visual cortex roughly the size of a grain of salt while it watched a series of YouTube clips and movies.\n\nScientists at the Allen Institute, a research center in Seattle, then sliced that piece of the mouse’s brain into more than 25,000 layers, each a tiny fraction of the width of a human hair, and took high resolution photos of the slices through microscopes. The material was sent to a team at Princeton University, in New Jersey, which used artificial intelligence to reconstruct the pieces in 3D.\n\nOther scientists compared their approach to understanding a car's combustion engine.\n\n“Just as an engine is composed of pistons, cylinders and a fuel system, the brain consists of neurons and synapses – the tiny, specialized connections at which neurons communicate,” two Harvard researchers wrote in a companion piece to the Nature article.\n\nThe data set from the research contains 84,000 neurons, 500 million synapses and neuronal wiring that could extend the length of New York’s Central Park nearly one and a half times, molecular biologists Mariela Petkova and Gregor Schuhknecht wrote.\n\nFindings from the studies have led to discoveries of new cell types, characteristics and ways to classify cells, researchers said. The achievement also puts scientists closer to their larger goal of mapping the wiring of the entire brain of a mouse.\n\n“Inside that tiny speck is an entire architecture like an exquisite forest,” Clay Reid, a senior investigator who helped pioneer this area of study, said in a statement. “It has all sorts of rules of connections that we knew from various parts of neuroscience, and within the reconstruction itself, we can test the old theories and hope to find new things that no one has ever seen before.”\n\nWhy it matters\n\nResearchers view wiring diagrams as a foundational step that scientists can build on and, eventually, potentially use to find treatments for brain conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s and schizophrenia.\n\nThey compare the studies to the Human Genome Project, which created the first complete map of the DNA in every human cell. The Human Genome Project has led to profound advances in drug discovery, treatments and disease screenings and helped pave the way for revolutionary gene therapies to treat certain diseases, including some cancers.\n\nWith a functional map of the brain, researchers say they now have the ability to understand the brain’s form and function and have opened up new pathways to study intelligence.\n\nNuno da Costa, an associate investigator at the Allen Institute, described the data they collected as a “kind of Google map” of the piece of the visual cortex.\n\n“If you have a broken radio and you have the circuit diagram, you’ll be in a better position to fix it,” he said in a statement. “In the future, we can use this to compare the brain wiring in a healthy mouse to the brain wiring in a model of disease.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/02/rabies-california-teacher-leah-seneng/76710890007/", "title": "Rabies virus kills California teacher bitten by bat in classroom", "text": "AI-assisted summary Rabies is rare in the U.S. with less than 10 cases identified each year.\n\nHealth officials urge the public to avoid contact with wild animals and seek immediate medical care if bitten.\n\nEarly symptoms of rabies can mimic the flu, but the disease is almost always fatal once symptoms begin.\n\nA California teacher died a month after contracting rabies from a bat that bit her, and now health officials are warning the public about the extremely deadly disease.\n\nA Fresno County resident died after being bitten by a \"presumably rabid bat\" in Merced County last month, according to the California Department of Public Health.\n\nMultiple local health departments worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate rabies as a possible cause of the illness in mid-November, and samples collected at the hospital confirmed the rabies diagnosis, the health department said.\n\nLaura Splotch told KFSN-TV that her friend, 60-year-old Leah Seneng, is the woman who contracted rabies and died on Nov. 22. Seneng was a teacher at Byrant Middle School in Dos Palos, California, Splotch told the outlet.\n\nFriend of teacher who died: 'She was a lover of life'\n\nWhile speaking with KFSN-TV, Splotch said that her friend of 15 years \"was a lover of life.\"\n\n\"She spent a lot of time in the mountains where her mother lived,\" Splotch said. \"She loved to explore the world, she's a great explorer.\"\n\nSeneng found the bat that possibly bit her in her classroom around mid-October, according to Splotch.\n\n\"I don't know if she thought it was dead or what 'cause it was laying around her classroom and she was trying to scoop it up and take it outside. She didn't wanna harm it. But that's when, I guess it woke up or saw the light or whatever it swooped around a bit and it took off,\" Splotch said.\n\nAbout a month after the bite, Seneng began feeling ill and her daughter had to take her to a hospital where she was put into a coma, Splotch told KFSN-TV.\n\nSplotch organized a GoFundMe for Seneng's funeral expenses, which had raised over $6,000 as of Monday.\n\nCDPH: 'Leave wild animals alone'\n\nDying from rabies is rare in the U.S., with less than 10 cases identified each year, the California health department said. Although not common, thousands of people receive preventive treatment for rabies every year after a bite or other direct contact with an animal possibly carrying the disease, with the most common source being bats, according to the agency.\n\n“Bites from bats can be incredibly small and difficult to see or to detect. It is important to wash your hands and look for any open wounds after touching a wild animal, and to seek immediate medical care if bitten,\" Tomás Aragón, the agency's director and state public health officer said. “It is always safest to leave wild animals alone. Do not approach, touch, or try to feed any animals that you don't know.\"\n\nIf a bat is found, regardless if it's dead or alive, the agency recommends residents take the following precautions:\n\nDo not touch the bat; contact local animal control to remove or collect it. Keep pets and family members away from the area.\n\nIf touched by a bat, wash the area with soap and water. If bitten, immediately contact a healthcare provider for additional guidance.\n\nReport the incident to a local health department.\n\nPay attention to a bat that can't fly, a wild animal that seems \"unusually tame\" or unafraid to approach people, a nocturnal animal that is active during the day and a pet that has trouble walking, eating or drinking.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of rabies?\n\nAccording to the CDC, the first symptom of rabies, called \"prodrome,\" could feel like the flu and include weakness, discomfort, fever or headache. People may also notice a discomfort, prickling or itching sensation at the site of the bite, the government agency said, adding that these symptoms can remain for several days.\n\nTypically, severe sickness appears within two weeks of the first symptoms when the rabies virus causes brain dysfunction, the CDC said. Rabies symptoms in humans may include one or more of the following, and once symptoms begin, it is almost always fatal:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/03/12/how-keep-kids-entertained-during-coronavirus-quarantine/5012810002/", "title": "How to keep kids entertained during coronavirus quarantine", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nIf the thought of being quarantined with your children for days—or weeks—on end sends you into a panic spiral, rest assured you're not alone. Without exception, every parent I've talked to recently is freaking out about the possibility of school closures. What does one do to occupy a high-energy child when you're not allowed to leave the house? Here's a list of 13 ways to keep kids entertained in the event of a quarantine—and it's not just unlimited screen time.\n\n1. Sticker books\n\nKids _love_ stickers, and there are lots of sticker book options for kids of all ages. Melissa & Doug's giant sticker pads come with over 100 reusable stickers that will provide loads of entertainment for toddlers. For older kids who know their numbers, opt for something that requires a little more concentration, like the Paint By Sticker Zoo Animals book.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n2. Play-Doh\n\nI don't usually allow my kids to use Play-Doh inside the house, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Spread out an old sheet or some towels, and set the kids loose with a 36-pack of Play-Doh and the Play-Doh Kitchen Creations Magical Oven. They'll use their imaginations and the colorful modeling compound to come up with lots of kooky \"baked goods.\"\n\n3. Puzzles\n\nPuzzles have the potential to keep kids—and adults—entertained for hours, especially if they're old enough for one of the really complicated 5,000-piece ones. Puzzles help encourage problem-solving skills and boost memory, and they are fun to play over and over again. I like the MasterPieces Explorer Kids USA Map puzzle because it's a great way for kids to learn about the United States. If you don't want to have to move half-finished puzzles off a the dining room table, set-up a card table to serve as a puzzle station.\n\nGet the MasterPieces Explorer Kids USA Map Puzzles on Amazon for $5.33\n\n4. Art supplies\n\nNever underestimate the power of markers, crayons, or paints to keep a child busy for long stretches of time. Even if your kid isn't super artistic, providing them with a selection of fresh new art supplies can spark creativity. Teach older kids about famous artists and their various techniques by looking through fine art books or online galleries, and then have them create their own masterpieces. My kids always find Georges Seurat's pointillism fascinating.\n\n5. Math workbooks\n\nIf you have school-age children, and you don't want the learning to stop just because school is out of session, Tiger Math books are a great way for kids to keep up with their numbers and math skills. These aren't like the boring workbooks you remember from your own childhood—they actually make learning fun, and my kids actually _ask_ to do them.\n\nGet Tiger Math books on Amazon starting at $6.99\n\n6. Anything from Lakeshore Learning\n\nAvoid any quarantine-related brain drain by keeping a stash of age-appropriate learning toys on hand. Lakeshore Learning has the best selection, hands-down, and I love that it was started by a single mom. Whether you have a preschooler who is just learning their ABC's, or a tween who needs a little math boost, Lakeshore has plenty of items to fit the bill. All of their products are colorful and appealing to kids—and they really do make learning fun.\n\nShop at LakeshoreLearning.com\n\n7. Science kits\n\nScience can be fun, and a great way for kids to learn about how things work. While younger kids will definitely need some help to execute the experiments (or at least read the directions), the My First Mind Blowing Science Kits includes lots of cool chemistry experiments that kids will love. It even includes a set of test tubes, which my son found super cool. For younger scientists, get a Glow 'n Grow Terrarium Kit. They'll love decorating the jar, planting the seeds, and watching everything grow.\n\n8. Costumes\n\nDon't get rid of last year's Halloween costumes too quickly—they're a great thing to dust off for long days trapped inside. Have your kids write their own sketches and then put on a performance. You'll be amazed at the different ways that kids can repurpose costumes to suit their imaginative play. Don't have any costumes on hand? Melissa & Doug offers a great selection of popular outfits, like a chef, firefighter, and veterinarian.\n\nGet Melissa & Doug costumes on Amazon starting at $24.99\n\n9. Get cooking\n\nCooking is not only a good activity for long days spent at home, but it's also a great opportunity to teach kids about science and math. Get them their very own baking set, and stock up on ingredients for their favorite recipes so that they can do some kitchen experimenting and whip up some delicious creations. If you want an easy way to provide some guidance, sign your kids up for an eat2explore subscription.\n\n10. Subscription kits\n\nA quarantine seems like just the situation that warrants signing your kids up for a monthly activity box subscription. My kids love KiwiCo's STEM kits, and babies and toddlers will get lots of use out of a Lovevery Play Kit. Kids who haven't been able to leave the house in days/weeks/months will be thrilled to receive a box in the mail.\n\n11. A book club subscription\n\nThere's nothing better than getting lost in a great book. Make sure you and your kids have plenty of reading material on hand by signing everyone up for a monthly book subscription. Bookroo offers options for kids from toddler (board books) to age 10 (chapter books). Older book lovers might enjoy a Book of the Month subscription, which allows them to rate and review their past selections and customize their books to their personal interests.\n\n12. Building toys\n\nToys that kids can use to build structures usually provide quite a few hours of fun. Kids of lots of different ages can find creative ways to play with MagnaTiles, Tinkertoys, and—our personal favorite—Zoobs. While it may seem like these are just fun toys to pass the time, they're actually teaching kids important lessons about engineering and spacial perception.\n\n13. The best tablet for kids\n\nReal talk: There's going to be a lot of screen time happening if kids get quarantined. The Kindle Fire HD 8 Kids Edition is our favorite tablet for kids thanks to its long battery life and that it comes with a free year of Amazon FreeTime Unlimited. Download some great educational apps so that you won't feel totally guilty about letting your kids zone out in front of a screen.\n\nGet the Kindle Fire HD 8 Kids Edition on Amazon for $129.99", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/guardian/2023/09/11/renowned-scholars-to-discuss-truth-and-democracy-at-uf-on-thursday/70825682007/", "title": "Renowned scholars to discuss truth and democracy at UF on ...", "text": "Editor's note: The Guardian no longer accepts fliers as information for events that appear under \"About Town.\"\n\nThe information must be typed out and sent via email.\n\nPlease include the following: type/name of event, date, time, location, speakers, theme and cost, if any, and who to contact for more information.\n\nSend via email to guardian@gainesville.com (The new email address — now in effect — to send announcements/information and to request coverage).

The patient was a Michigan resident and had received the organ from a donor who was not a resident of Ohio or Michigan, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) also shared in a statement.\n\nAn investigation conducted by Michigan DHHS, Ohio Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found no risk to the public in either state.\n\n“There is no threat to the general public. Health officials worked together to ensure that people, including health care providers, who were in contact with the Michigan individual were assessed for possible exposure to rabies,” Michigan DHHS spokesperson Lynn Sutfin told USA TODAY. “Post exposure preventive care, if appropriate, has been provided.”\n\nNo further information about the donor or recipient is being released, she said.\n\nNo risk to the public, say health officials\n\nThe University of Toledo Medical Center confirmed to local news station WTOL that it was the hospital where the transplant was performed on Wednesday. In a statement to the outlet, it said the patient had died in January after undergoing a deceased donor organ transplant in late 2024.\n\n“Person-to-person transmission of rabies is extremely rare, though it has been documented in a very small number of cases involving organ transplantation,” the statement said. “UToledo Health is committed to the safety and wellbeing of all our patients. The health system has worked closely with public health authorities and has conducted a thorough review of this case, which found all best practices and standard safety protocols were appropriately followed.”\n\nKara Steele, a representative from Life Connection of Ohio, also spoke with WTOL, saying that a donor risk assessment interview and physical assessment are conducted before any organ donation.\n\n“[It gathers] a potential donor’s comprehensive medical and social history on top of a physical assessment and lab work in order to ensure the safety of organs for transplantation,” Steele told WTOL. “If an organ procurement organization received word from a transplant center concerning any recipient issues, the organ procurement organization would reach out to additional centers that transplanted other organs from a donor hero to see how their recipients are doing and then report back.”\n\nThis marked the first known case of rabies in a human in Ohio since 1970, according to the Ohio Department of Health, and the first case in Michigan since 2009. Because the recipient was not an Ohio resident, this will be counted as a human rabies case in Michigan, not Ohio.\n\nWhat is rabies?\n\nRabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease that primarily affects the central nervous system, according to the CDC. It can lead to severe brain damage and death in humans and some animals.\n\nIn the United States, more than 90% of reported cases of rabies in animals occur in wildlife. We most commonly associate animals like bats, raccoons and skunks or foxes with being carriers. Human cases are exceedingly rare in the U.S., where fewer than 10 deaths are reported each year and at least 7 out of 10 of those are the result of exposure to an infected bat.\n\nBecause rabies vaccines are a legal requirement for dogs and cats in the U.S., cases in dogs are rare in the states. Worldwide, however, dogs are responsible for more than 95% of the estimated 70,000 annual human deaths caused by rabies.\n\nIf you are exposed to rabies, immediate medical attention is required. A protocol called post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP is administered, which includes wound care, a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG), and a series of four or five rabies vaccines. It is nearly 100% effective if administered quickly after exposure.\n\nOrgan donation and transplants are still safe\n\nWhile a story like this is both scary and headline-catching, it’s important to put organ donation and its risks into perspective.\n\nThe United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) is the nonprofit organization that maintains and administers the only Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) in the United States. In 2024, it tracked more than 48,000 organ transplants performed.\n\nIn the same year, 27,759 kidney transplants were performed nationwide. Kidney transplant recipients have a 1-year survival rate of 93%-98% and a 5-year survival rate of 83%-92%, according to the Kidney Transplant Organization.\n\nIn Ohio, 26,498 kidney transplants have been done to date since 1988 and 1,293 were done in 2024 alone. So far this year, 206 kidney transplants have been performed in the state. Only one has been reportedly infected with rabies.\n\nWhile UNOS has reported record donation numbers year-over-year, there is still far more need than supply. Currently, 104,668 people are waiting for a life-saving organ on the transplant waitlist. Of those, 58,660 people are active waiting list candidates, meaning they are eligible to immediately receive organ offers and undergo surgery. At least 16 people die a day waiting.\n\nOrgan donation is heavily regulated and overall safe. Like any medical procedure, there is the potential for surgery-related complications like bleeding and infection, according to the Mayo Clinic. However, common myths that often deter people, such as the misconception that doctors will not try as hard to save your life if you’re a donor or the idea that people can pay large amounts of money to jump to the top of the list, have been repeatedly debunked.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2019/09/05/on-front-lines-of-rhode-islands-fight-to-contain-eee/3524181007/", "title": "Battle of the bug", "text": "Alex Kuffner\n\nakuffner@providencejournal.com\n\nSOUTH KINGSTOWN — The mosquito traps were stacked in a picnic cooler.\n\nThey were retrieved after sitting out all night in places across southern and eastern Rhode Island. Here, at the state Department of Environmental Management’s mosquito abatement office in Kingston village on a recent morning, lab technicians began the painstaking task of going through the contents of the traps.\n\nThey would sort hundreds of mosquitoes by species and trap location, placing samples on ice to be taken to a state Department of Health lab in Providence so they could be tested for the presence of Eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus.\n\nWhile West Nile is a relative newcomer to New England, having been first documented in Connecticut in 1999, it is rarely fatal to humans. The bigger concern is EEE, a virus that is native to the region and isn’t as common as West Nile but can be far more potent, causing brain damage and, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, death in about a third of the cases.\n\nThe Health Department announced last Friday that a person in West Warwick had tested positive for the virus, the first human case in Rhode Island in nine years. The news came a day after the DEM announced a case in a horse in Westerly, the first in the state in six years. Two mosquito samples from Westerly and two from Central Falls also tested positive for the virus in August.\n\nThe DEM monitors mosquito activity at between 28 and 32 sites on a weekly basis for four months every spring and summer, but the current human case of EEE triggered an expansion of the program to an additional 10 sites, and, with the help of staff from the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency, more frequent checking of traps.\n\nOn Thursday, the DEM started dropping pesticide pellets from helicopters into Chapman Swamp in Westerly, the South Branch of the Pawtuxet River in West Warwick and the Valley Marsh area surrounded by Lincoln, Cumberland and Central Falls, targeting mosquito larvae. It was the first time ever that the state agency has taken such action.\n\nAlan Gettman, who has headed Rhode Island’s mosquito program since 1992, described this as the worst year for EEE that he’s seen in the region in his 27 years on the job.\n\nThe DEM created the mosquito abatement program in 1983 after a nine-month-old Hopkinton girl fell into a coma after a mosquito bite. She died the following year, becoming Rhode Island’s first documented EEE fatality.\n\nThere have been three more deaths in the state since, according to the Health Department: a 14-year-old Middletown boy in 1993, a West Warwick man in 1998, and a case previously unreported in the media of a person in their 30s who may have contracted the virus while out of state in 2007. Four other people were diagnosed with the disease and survived, one each in 1983, 1991, 1993 and 2010.\n\nThe network of traps that Gettman and his staff set out are designed to act as an early-warning system, a way to track changes in the state’s mosquito population, detect what viruses the insects may be carrying, and pinpoint potential hot spots.\n\nEEE is spread by several species of mosquitoes that live in hardwood, freshwater swamps, such as Chapman Swamp, where the virus has most frequently been found in Rhode Island, or the swamps that dot the Taunton River watershed in Massachusetts. These types of mosquitoes feed only on birds, many species of which can carry the virus without suffering any ill effects. They are what’s known as the “host reservoir” for the virus.\n\nIn most years, EEE is generally contained by geography and by animal carrier, but every few years there is an outbreak when the virus spreads to different places and species. An infected bird may be bitten by a different kind of mosquito that also feeds on mammals. The mosquito then picks up the virus and bites, say, a horse, and infects that animal. Or it may bite a human.\n\nInfections in humans and horses generally show up toward the end of the summer, because it takes time for the number of bird carriers to mount enough for the chances of transmission to grow. The risk of infection is expected to continue through this month, according to Rhode Island officials.\n\nThe spread of the disease has been particularly bad this year in Massachusetts, which has reported four human cases of EEE, including one fatality, a woman from Fairhaven who died last month while receiving treatment. There have also been eight cases in horses and one in a goat in the state. In nearby Connecticut, there have been two cases in horses.\n\nIn typical years, EEE detections in Massachusetts are confined to swampy areas in Plymouth and Bristol counties, but this year is unusual in that the virus is showing up in the central part of the state. Four of the horse infections occurred in towns in Worcester County near the Rhode Island border. The last major outbreak of the virus in Massachusetts took place in 2012.\n\nHoward Ginsberg, an insect ecologist who sits on Rhode Island’s Mosquito Advisory Board, said it’s been hard to determine the exact causes of EEE outbreaks because the virus is so rare, with only five to 10 human cases nationwide every year. One reason human infections are so sporadic is because the mosquitoes that are known to carry the virus live in areas that are generally far from neighborhoods — unlike the types of mosquitoes that carry West Nile, which breed in urban areas.\n\n“There’s a lot of coincidence involved in getting this virus from birds to people,” said Ginsberg, a researcher with the U.S. Geological Survey based at the University of Rhode Island. “You need just the right conditions.”\n\nGettman, who has a doctorate in medical entomology, said there was no expectation that this year would be worse than previous years. But looking back, he said, the wet spring and early summer probably created the perfect conditions for mosquitoes to breed.\n\n“A lot of this is a numbers game,” Gettman said. “High mosquito numbers translate into high risk.”\n\nOnly female mosquitoes seek out a blood meal. While the males can subsist on nectar alone, the females must supplement their diet with the blood of mammals and birds to get enough nutrition for egg production.\n\nBecause it is the females that spread disease, the traps set out by the DEM target them. One type uses carbon dioxide to draw them in from a wide area, much like the exhalation of an animal would, and then a light to make the trap more enticing. Another type uses putrid water that some species prefer to lay their eggs in.\n\nA good night can result in a couple of hundred mosquitoes in a single trap, but a typical number is two or three dozen.\n\nOn this morning in the DEM lab at the University of Rhode Island’s East Farm, Aya Rothwell, one of three seasonal technicians working under Gettman, emptied a trap onto a paper towel laid over a bed of dry ice that will keep the mosquitoes’ bodies cold and preserve any virus particles present inside them.\n\nRothwell has found about 25 different species of mosquito in the traps so far this year and she has become adept at telling them apart based on wing shapes, mouth protrusions and markings on their abdomens and legs.\n\nShe picked out one specimen, placed it under a microscope, and after scrutinizing a clump of short hairs at the base of its wings, identified it as Culiseta melanura — a species that is known to carry EEE.\n\n“You get to know them pretty fast,” she said.\n\nThe mosquitoes that she and the other technicians sort are put in test tubes filled with tiny metal balls. The “BBs,” as the workers call them, will help grind up the mosquitoes’ bodies when a machine in a Health Department lab in Providence vigorously shakes the tubes to create a type of stew that can be tested for viruses.\n\nWhen Rothwell started working for the mosquito program in the spring, she was pretty relaxed about going out to set and collect traps. Now, after the spate of positive EEE tests in the region, she makes sure to wear long sleeves and apply bug spray.\n\n“I’m being a lot more careful now,” she said.\n\nA spokesman for the Health Department said the agency is limited in what it can say about the current condition of the person from West Warwick diagnosed with EEE, other than that the case is still not fatal.\n\nGettman said the person’s symptoms appeared near the beginning of August and that it took time for the CDC to confirm a positive test for the virus.\n\nWhile this is the first year that the DEM is carrying out aerial larviciding, the Town of Westerly does it as a matter of routine every April in Chapman Swamp, where EEE has been detected in mosquitoes in 1996, 2003, 2013, 2016 and this year. Both the agency and the town use Bti (Bacillus thuringiensis), a naturally occurring pathogen that is also commonly placed as pellets in storm drains and catch basins around the state, to kill mosquito larvae before they mature into adults.\n\nThe aerial application is being done with the insecticide in a granular form that a DEM spokesman compared to rock salt that is unlikely to be distributed beyond the three target areas that total about 1,000 acres. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that Bti does not pose a risk to humans. The bacterium also kills the larvae of black flies and fungus gnats but does not harm other insects, such as honey bees, according to the DEM.\n\nThe agency is also planning to carry out aerial spraying to kill adult mosquitoes, but has yet to release a schedule and list of locations. Dates and times will be dependent on weather. Aerial spraying began last month in Massachusetts.\n\nMeanwhile, Gettman and his team have started trapping mosquitoes in parts of Rhode Island where they don’t usually need to sample, venturing farther north and west into Exeter, West Warwick, Burrillville, Lincoln and North Smithfield.\n\nBut finding the types of swamps that may be harboring mosquitoes that carry EEE has been a challenge. There is still much that isn’t known about how the virus spreads.\n\n“It’s not as simple as finding new trap sites and bringing home tons of mosquitoes,” Gettman said. “As far as future expanded trapping, I’m still figuring it out.”\n\n— akuffner@providencejournal.com / (401) 277-7457", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2021/10/28/great-gifts-kids-who-love-read/115120730/", "title": "Great gifts for kids who love to read", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAges: 3-8 years\n\nThis is coding at its most basic. The Think & Learn Code-a-Pillar has a motorized, caterpillar-shaped head, and kids can make it move in different directions or complete certain actions by adding a variety of pieces to the body of the Code-a-Pillar. Changing the order of the body parts changes the Code-a-Pillar’s routine.\n\nThe Code-a-Pillar is just so adorable. The different Code-a-Pillar body parts are big, colorful, and kid-friendly. Children just getting the hang of hand-eye coordination and with minimal hand strength may need some help from parents with assembly, but once the Code-a-Pillar is all put together, it’s just a push-and-play experience from there.\n\nGet the Think and Learn Code-a-Pillar at Barnes & Noble for $50\n\n2. A cute wooden robot for younger kids\n\nAges: 3+ years\n\nI have never wanted to hug a small wooden box with a smile on it before, but I guess there’s a first time for everything. By placing the tiles on the control board in the correct order, kids can follow the steps listed in the storybook to help Cubetto get to its next destination.\n\nThe bottom line: Cubetto is an awesome copilot on your kid's journey to becoming a junior programmer.\n\nGet Cubetto at Target for $225\n\n3. A stuffed bear on a coding journey\n\nAges: 3+ years\n\nUsing bear-shaped coding blocks, kids can guide Mochi, a cuddly bear, on fun and educational adventures.\n\nWith coding command blocks shaped like bears, kids learn about the order of operations by placing those coding blocks in the numbered slots, hitting the big yellow “Please GO!” button in the center of the board, and watching Mochi move slowly across the playmat.\n\nThe bottom line: With its gorgeous illustrations and an interactive introduction to coding basics, kids will be easily drawn into the adventures of Mochi.\n\nGet Mochi at the Learn With Mochi website for $189\n\n4. A playset that splits the difference between \"coding\" and \"toy\"\n\nAges: 4+ years\n\nHaving a tough time imagining a toy your young child could play with long enough to pick up on some coding basics? The Coding Critters playsets might be right for your kid.\n\nIf you’ve ever thought to yourself that there’s no way your kid would want to play with an educational toy, Coding Critters is a great solution. While it definitely helps to teach a valuable lesson about the order of operations (i.e. the difference between “forward” and “left” vs. “left” and “forward”), the playset pieces are cool and durable enough to be regular toys in their own right.\n\n5. A screen-free card game perfect for those who love turtles with laser beams\n\nAges: 4+ years\n\nRobot Turtles is a board game that beautifully demonstrates the basics of coding. Each player is given a \"robot turtle\" tile, which depicts a turtle with a laser mounted on its back (obviously). Using cards representing motions or actions, the colorful turtles must navigate the gridded game board to find the jewel at the center of the board.\n\nRobot Turtles is a really neat, screen-free experience for both parents and kids. This game involves moderate parental involvement, so I definitely recommend saving Robot Turtles for family game night, or other instances where parents can devote their full attention to playing this game with their kids.\n\nThe stated age range of 4+ is correct; while all kids will love learning the basics and hearing adults make hilarious turtle noises, older children or more advanced coders may soon surpass the higher levels of Robot Turtles, and may want to move on to more complex methods of coding games and toys.\n\nGet Robot Turtles at Amazon for $25\n\n6. A high tech robot that can climb a whiteboard\n\nAges: 4+ years\n\nUsing Root Robotic’s block coding system and extremely thorough coding lessons, children as young as 4 years old can start driving and drawing with this robot.\n\nThe deceptively simple-looking robot has bumper sensors, touch sensors, light sensors, a surface sensor (to prevent Root from falling off of any edges) and a color sensor.\n\nRoot Robotics is an easy and fun way for young children to learn how to code, yet it’s complex enough that it can keep older kids and parents interested as well. With Root, the possibilities are literally endless. Be aware that you can’t progress very far in the “Learn” module without the Root Academy subscription service before you buy Root Robotics.\n\nGet Root Robotics at iRobot for $200\n\n7. A renaissance robot\n\nAges: 4+ years\n\nIf you’re looking for a kids’ coding kit that doubles as a creative outlet, you’ll want to check out the Matatalab Pro Set.\n\nUsing coding commands found on colorful, kid-friendly pieces, children are tasked with guiding the little robot around a gridded board that is covered in beautiful depictions of different environments such as an island, a volcano, and a forest. After kids place the coding pieces on the command board and hit the big orange “play” button, the tower reads the commands and transmits them to the robot on the board.\n\nParents and kids alike will appreciate the versatility of the Matatalab kit, which gives kids insight into the logic inherent in computer coding, music composition, and geometric shapes.\n\n8. A robot that can keep up with your kid's action figures\n\nAges: 4+ years\n\nCoji is an emoji-themed robot aimed at teaching young kids the basics of computer programming.\n\nThe \"Free Play\" part of the Coji app offers a way for users to write code for Elmoji and make it perform a sequence of motions or display certain emojis. Users tap to add motions and emojis, and after being paired with a device via Bluetooth, Elmoji receives and enacts the code from the app.\n\nElmoji is fast. We recommend playing with Elmoji on the floor; otherwise, Elmoji tends to take headers off of table edges.\n\nGet Coji at Walmart for $46\n\n9. Learn to code in augmented reality\n\nAges: 4+ years\n\nIf you want your kids to spend their screen time on activities that are both fun and educational, you won’t be disappointed with Botzees. With its easy-to-build robots, fun plot, and coding tasks disguised as neat puzzles, the Botzees robots and app are a recipe for success.\n\nThose who are a fan of augmented reality will love the absurd robot and environmental images that are superimposed on the boring flat surfaces in your home.\n\nGet the Botzees Kit at the Apple Store for $70\n\n10. Kid-friendly figurines that turn your tablet into a coding game\n\nAges: 4+ years\n\nTangiplay is a neat way for younger children to learn coding concepts and solve puzzles at the same time. By placing large kid-friendly blocks on the tablet screen in the right order, your little coder can help the explorer vehicle plot a safe path for the oncoming train.\n\nYou’re tasked with solving a series of puzzles wherein you help the explorer robot to fill in the gap between an incomplete set of railroad tracks without running out of power. To solve each puzzle, your kid must use the 12 figurines to successfully navigate a grid space that has obstacles, a passenger who must be picked up, and a train depot.\n\nEvery time you solve a puzzle, you get a star rating that varies with the elegance of your coding solution; this will entice more competitive kids to solve the puzzles in multiple ways to achieve the highest star rating for each level.\n\nGet Tangiplay at the Indiegogo website\n\n11. A toy that is an art project and a robot at the same time\n\nAges: 4-7 years\n\nKIBO is a robot who operates on a combination of sensors and barcode inputs. To make KIBO follow a sequence of actions, kids build a program by assembling a line of large, kid-friendly wooden blocks, each of which has a different barcode on it. Each block line must start with the \"Begin\" block, and finish with the \"End\" block, which tells KIBO's barcode reader to start and stop looking for additional barcode inputs, respectively.\n\nThen, children flash KIBO's barcode reader over each block in the order they want the actions performed, and KIBO chirps every time a barcode is successfully read. After placing KIBO on the floor, press the \"Go\" button, and let the fun begin!\n\nGet KIBO at the Kinderlab Robots website for $470 (pricing may change depending on the kit)\n\n12. A whole environment of fun coding games on your tablet\n\nAges: 5-12 years\n\nIn Osmo Coding Awbie, Awbie is an adorable creature who has to rebuild its home after a natural disaster. Kids progress through Awbie’s adventures in the wild by using the coding blocks to navigate Awbie through a gridded environment.\n\nOsmo Coding Jam is less adventure and more musical discovery. In this app, kids are tasked with building code to play certain musical cues in a particular order. Each new character always made me laugh (my favorites were the grim reaper and the chemist), and I was pleased by how well musical sequences that seemed random during the coding stage came together when combined with the sound bites from other characters. The music is surprisingly catchy!\n\n13. A funny card game for those who like pirates (and potatoes)\n\nAges: 6+ years\n\nPotato Pirates is a card game whose box hits the nail on the head with the phrase “Coding with carbs.” Between the adorable artwork on the cards, the funny commentary in the manual, and the soft fuzzballs meant to represent the pirate crew, this game is a lot of fun for people of all ages. Attacks aimed at other players' potato pirate ships are determined by cards that demonstrate coding concepts such as counting loops and conditional statements.\n\nThe potato fuzzballs come in a cloth sack that should prevent you from losing them, but don’t be surprised if a few go missing, as throwing the fuzzballs at other players is doubtlessly a common outcome in the case if potato pirate crews are decimated.\n\nGet Potato Pirates at Amazon for $15\n\n14. Coding kits for fans of popular Disney movies\n\nAges: 6+ years\n\nWith these two coding kits from Kano, you can use coding and an interactive light sensor to create blizzards, levitate Porgs, and complete plenty of challenges in these fun \"Frozen\"- and \"Star Wars\"-themed environments.\n\nOnce you follow the directions in the app to assemble each program, testing out the code is a blast. You can bet that I made ginormous snowflakes and waved around a purple lightsaber à la Mace Windu. Also, who hasn’t wanted to force push C-3PO away at one point or another?\n\n15. A robot that will keep your kids chasing after it\n\nAges: 6+ years\n\nDash is a robot whose adventures evolve in tandem with your kid’s coding abilities, and provides them with plenty of laughs and fun along the way.\n\nDash’s vast library of motions, behaviors, and sounds is sure to delight coders both old and young. Who could resist watching Dash flail about in a tornado, and then promptly stop and let out a very earnest cat meow?\n\nOur test family loved that there were tons of different ways to play with Dash, with interesting and fun challenges for both younger and older children. In particular, playing “Marco Polo” with Dash, who was using the kids’ own recorded voices to say the titular phrase, resulted in much giggling. In their experience, one of the best parts about Dash is that it is sturdy enough to withstand repeated bonking into walls and other obstacles on the floor.\n\nGet Wonder Workshop's Dash Robot at Amazon for $150\n\n16. A robot to ease your kids into getting a pet\n\nAges: 6+ years\n\nFurReal Maker Proto Max is a dog-shaped robot who is a solid companion for kids who want to learn to code. Without the companion app, FurReal is still a responsive robot who makes calm, happy noises when kids pet it on its furred back, or barks a warning when its tail is tweaked.\n\nWhere FurReal really shines, though, is the coding and programming modules in the companion app. The app also offers a few games for children to play without the robot, so the fun can continue on the road as well. FurReal is a beginning coder's best friend.\n\nGet FurReal Maker Proto Max at Walmart for $50\n\n17. A high tech robot that can live in AR\n\nAges: 6+ years\n\nAugie is one of the more complicated robots we got to test, despite being aimed at children as young as 5-6 years old. The \"Coding Classroom\" module in the app is amazing; it quickly but thoroughly teaches new programmers the uses of Augie's different tricks, as well as conditional statements, variables, and other coding basics. Augie has a hilarious variety of expressions and sounds; hearing a chicken clucking, immediately followed by jaunty clarinet music, definitely made my day.\n\nThe AR itself is a lot of fun. In the \"AR Adventures\" module in the app, players must ward off small robots with laser beams, which will doubtlessly amuse kids and adults alike.\n\nGet Augie at the Pai Technology website for $200\n\n18. A circuit board kit for those who like to build models\n\nAges: 7+ years\n\nWhile the mPie Microduino Kit is more focused on the circuit-building aspect of STEM, rather than computer coding, it really helps to illustrate the concept of the order of operations. The circuit simply will not work if the modules are assembled (via magnets, which connect with a very satisfying click noise) in the wrong order, a lesson that we found to be a bit too advanced for kids below the stated age range of 7 years old and above.\n\nThis kit is great for kids who have a more visual style of learning; the modules are large and colorful, and the models (everything from a flyswatter to an ambulance) really make the lessons tangible. If the ambulance's siren doesn't go off when it should, then it's back to the circuit board.\n\nThe mPie Microduino kit can help kids to translate commands and the concept of \"order of operations\" into models that they can interact with in real life.\n\nGet the mPie Microduino Kit at the Microduino website for $110\n\n19. An artistic robot\n\nAges: 7+ years\n\nBy coding specific commands in the right order, kids can make Artie 3000 draw beautiful designs or fun games on a piece of paper. Additional modules in the Artie 3000 module allow your coder to explore different coding languages, such as Javascript, Python, and more.\n\nThere’s something for everyone in the Artie 3000 UI. Younger children can use Artie with point-and-click or remote-control functionalities, but they’ll probably find the freestyle coding functionality a bit more difficult. It can be fun to draw random designs or geometric shapes.\n\nGet Artie 3000 at Target for $55\n\n20. A sassy, clever companion robot\n\nAges: 7+ years\n\nCozmo is adorable and extremely responsive, and acts like a curious, mercurial pet when it is not being actively directed from the app. Cozmo's intense processing requires a more solid connection between the app and the device, so it uses WiFi, rather than Bluetooth pairing.\n\nThe included games and tricks are neat, but the \"Code Lab\" part of the app is especially robust. After being walked through useful tutorials, users can do tons of cool stuff by combining a variety of icons representing different actions, emojis, noises, and logical operators.\n\nEditor's note: Since we tested, Anki has gone out of business. Cozmo is available in limited quantities, and customer support may be limited.\n\nGet Cozmo at Walmart for $275\n\n21. A LEGO kit every coder will want\n\nAges: 7-12 years\n\nThe Lego Boost kit comes with over 800 pieces, a stiff paper grid map, and a Bluetooth-connected motor that also includes motion, color, and orientation sensors.\n\nWhile this Lego kit can naturally be enjoyed on its own without the app, kids who want to get the models moving and reacting to their environment will want to use the sleekly-designed app.\n\nAs you might expect, the models are awesome. I built the cat model in a few hours (admittedly, a large portion of that time was taken up in trying to find certain Legos), and it is truly amazing. Once the Lego builders in your life are more advanced in coding, they can try the freeform coding section of the Lego Boost app, where kids can make creations move and react to their heart’s content.\n\nGet the Lego Boost kit at Walmart for $132\n\n22. A spherical robot that just keeps rollin'\n\nAges: 8+ years\n\nSphero SPRK+ is a spherical robot that rolls and reacts according to the code created in the Sphero Edu app. Watching this little spherical robot roll and bounce is a great deal of fun.\n\nI found the coding language to be extremely detailed; on a block of code for motion, kids can control the robot's direction, speed, and the duration of that movement. Users can code in blocks, draw paths with their fingers, or actually code SPRK+'s movements and actions in Javascript. SPRK+ gets more fun and more complex as kids get better and better at computer programming.\n\nGet Sphero SPRK+ at Walmart for $103\n\n23. Coding at home and in the classroom\n\nAges: 8+ years\n\nKOOV is a robotic coding kit that teaches kids not only about the different coding elements, but also the philosophical goals and logic of computer programming.\n\nIf you want a kit that really gets down to the nitty gritty of the “how” and the “why” of computer programming, the Sony KOOV kit is the kit for you and/or the young coder in your life.\n\nThe robots are fun to build and play with—almost all of the robots are fun animals or vehicles that kids will recognize. The fact that the KOOV Trial Kit comes with LED lights, a proximity sensor, and a buzzer means that children will not only get to watch their code come to life, but they’ll get to watch their creations react in real time to real-world obstacles.\n\nGet the Sony KOOV Trial Kit at the Sony website for $250\n\n24. This is the droid that you're looking for\n\nAges: 8+ years\n\nThe Droid Inventor Kit from littleBits will be an instant hit with \"Star Wars\" fans both young and old. Using both circuit-building skills and coding skills, you can make R2-D2 dance around or attack intruders, or you can create your own customized robot.\n\nThe Droid Inventor Kit helps you to unleash the Rebel fighter within you and your kids. The kit involves six circuit components that can be mounted in a variety of arrangements to a Lego-like structure to build droids that can move easily both on hardwood and carpeted floors.\n\nOnce you assemble R2-D2, there are tons of interesting programming \"missions\" get more complicated until kids really start to understand the real-life effects of code built on a screen and the endless possibilities that can arise from combining the same coding elements in different ways.\n\nGet the littleBits Droid Inventor Kit at Amazon for $57\n\n25. A coding kit that wants your kids to keep moving\n\nAges: 8+ years\n\nWith a small computer and motion sensors, the Mover Kit allows kids to combine physical activity and programming in this toy that can be worn like a watch.\n\nThe Mover Kit is the perfect marriage of computer programming and non-screen play time. The sensors are activated by movement; kids will enjoy seeing the ultimate fulfillment of their coding skills once the lights activate according to the uploaded programs. The Maker part of the Technology Will Save Us website has tons of neat sample projects, including shadow puppets and Gandalf's staff.\n\nGet the Mover Kit for free by joining Club Make at the Tech Will Save Us website\n\n26. A robot that jumps when you tell it to\n\nAges: 8+ years\n\nThe JIMU Robot Buzzbot & Muttbot Kit is a DIY robotics kit that, in addition to showing kids how to build and operate the standard models (the aforementioned Buzzbot and Muttbot), also encourages them to build their own models and explore the relationship between computer code and the real world.\n\nThe robots are fun and lively; when I told Muttbot to “play” (in the “Actions” module), I was instantly surprised by how much movement was actually involved. Muttbot pranced like a champion breed at a dog show, and then jumped and stretched with the grace of a cat (albeit a robotic one).\n\nThe JIMU Robot Buzzbot & Muttbot Kit has a steep learning curve, but it will really help the more advanced coders to flourish and inspire them to imagine and create robots beyond the basic models.\n\nGet the JIMU Robot Buzzbot & Muttbot kit at Amazon for $49\n\n27. Three board games that the whole family can play\n\nAges: 8+ years\n\nOn the Brink, Robot Repair, and Rover Control all come with a small game board, game pieces, a mission book, and a solution manual. Each \"level\" is its own individual mind teaser, where only a specific combination of colors or moves is the correct solution.\n\nEach game really hammers home the various situations in which logical operators (Robot Repair), functions (On the Brink), and conditional statements (Rover Control) are useful. Our testers really enjoyed the fact that these are screen-free games. For those parents who limit screen time for their kids, these games are a great way to get some solid face-to-face quality time. All in all, the //CODE games are a fun challenge for more advanced programmers and anyone who loves a good logic puzzle.\n\n28. A fun circuit and coding kit for the advanced coder in your life\n\nAges: 8+ years\n\nThe Boolean Box kit is an amazing kit that introduces programming, circuit design, and logical thinking in fun, bite-sized lessons that will be fun for both new and advanced coders.\n\nI love the Boolean Box, and I wish I'd had it growing up. The lessons on the Boolean University website are illustrative and thorough. My favorite part of the Boolean Box, however, is the circuit board.\n\nEven though the circuitry components are very basic (LED lights, push buttons, wires, etc.), being able to write code that dictates commands to or receives input/output from a circuit board is going to be mind-blowing to kids encountering that phenomenon for the first time.\n\nIt’s one thing to code a program on a computer; it is quite another thing to be able to affect (or see the effects of) that code in the real, non-digital world.\n\nGet the Boolean Box at Walmart for $150\n\n29. A laptop computer for the burgeoning hacker in your life\n\nAges: 8+ years\n\nHack is an exciting (and growing!) digital environment full of coding tutorials cleverly disguised as fun games that will make your kid want to advance to the next level (and learn increasingly sophisticated coding techniques along the way). Hack is built into the Endless operating system of an Asus laptop, and comes with its own ecosystem of highly relevant and useful apps.\n\nThe true genius of Hack lies in the fact that not only does it teach kids vital coding concepts, but because they have to \"hack\" games to finish each level, it makes them feel like they’re getting away with something while they do it.\n\n30. A fun Lego Education kit for intermediate coders\n\nAges: 10+ years\n\nIf your kids have some experience with programming, they’ll appreciate the new challenges and fun builds in the Lego Education Spike Prime Kit.\n\nLego Education Spike Prime Kit is a Lego Education kit that allows kids to explore the practical applications of computer programming, especially when it comes to engineering and data science problems.\n\nThe Spike Prime Kit is billed as a kit that is used in the classroom, although there’s no reason why a parent couldn’t purchase it and use it at home. It’s targeted at kids in grades 6-8, and is a genius combination of fun robots and useful coding lessons.\n\nGet the Lego Education Spike Prime Kit at the Lego Education website for $330\n\n31. Structured lessons for those interested in electronics and coding\n\nAges: 12+ years\n\nThe Let’s Start Coding Ultimate Kit is a no-frills kit that walks your kid through increasingly complex coding and electronics concepts through neat projects such as building a police siren and a clap on/clap off light system. It's a great kit for self-motivated kids who just want to learn about electronics and computer coding without the window dressings of characters or animations.\n\nGet the Let’s Start Coding Ultimate Kit 2 at the Let's Start Coding website for $125\n\n32. A fun and challenging kit that's perfect for gamers\n\nAges: 12+ years\n\nThe Juku Light Games Coding Kit allows the more advanced coder in your life to create and code his or her own arcade-style game using only a joystick, a microphone, a control unit, and an LED light grid. If your kid has the coding basics down, and is looking for a new challenge, the Juku Light Games Coding Kit gives your kid the chance to explore game logic, and to see how coding concepts translate onto the light grid in real time.\n\nGet the Juku Light Games Coding Kit at Office Depot for $100\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

In the 1950s, the tabloid Bild ran a cartoon about a call girl named Lilli, who was saucy and irreverent. (One cartoon, for example, shows her in a bikini, being told by a policeman that two-piece swimsuits are illegal. She replies: “Oh, and in your opinion, which part should I take off?”) The Bild Lilli doll was launched in 1955 as a novelty gift for men, but proved a hit with children too. In 1956, Lilli caught the eye of Ruth Handler, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company in California, when she was on holiday in Hamburg with her husband and business partner Elliot and her 15-year-old daughter Barbara, who loved Lilli. At the New York Toy Fair in March 1959, Mattel launched a very similar-looking doll, named after Barbara: Barbie.\n\nSo Ruth Handler stole the idea?\n\nMattel clearly used Bild Lilli as a template. In 1961, Greiner & Hausser, Lilli’s manufacturer, sued Mattel for infringing its patents. Mattel settled out of court and bought the rights in 1964, burying Barbie’s origin story. However, Ruth Handler had, it seems, already spotted the gap in the market and, a brilliant entrepreneur, was able to exploit it. She and Elliot had started Mattel in their garage in 1945, making dolls’ furniture out of newly available plastics. Later, they tapped into the baby boom by making toys and marketing them innovatively. In 1955, Mattel advertised its “Burp Gun” on the first ever series of The Mickey Mouse Club, the first time a toy had been advertised directly at children on TV. It was a great success – an early triumph for “pester power”.\n\nWhy did she think Barbie was a good idea?\n\nAt the time, children in the US only really played with baby dolls, and Handler thought a doll of an adult woman would capture children’s imagination. She had also noticed that Barbara loved playing with paper dolls that came with cut-out outfits that children could change; this gave her the idea for a “fashion doll”, of which there were very few at the time. Her colleagues were dubious: “Ruth,” Elliot is said to have told her, “no mother is ever going to buy her daughter a doll with breasts.” But she was adamant. “Every little girl needed a doll through which to project herself into her dream of her future,” she said in a 1977 interview. “If she was going to do role-playing of what she would be like when she was 16 or 17, it was a little stupid to play with a doll that had a flat chest. So I gave it beautiful breasts.”\n\nWas the doll an immediate hit?\n\nAt first sales were slow, because industry buyers and parents were hesitant. But once again, Mattel bypassed the adults by advertising on The Mickey Mouse Club. The first Barbie was relatively cheap, too: it was $3 and came in a now famous black and white swimsuit. You could buy blonde or brunette (though blonde Barbie has always sold better). To keep sales ticking over, a range of clothes costing $1-$5 were also available. By the end of its first year, it was a hit: 350,000 Barbies had been sold. By 1966, Mattel controlled 12% of the $2bn US toy market and had 15,000 employees.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhat was the secret of her success?\n\nIn 1959, Barbie was arguably a revolutionary figure. She lived alone, worked for a living and later had her own “Dreamhouse”. Ruth Handler’s idea was that girls should imagine themselves living as adults the way they wanted to, not just as stay-at-home mothers. Barbie did get a boyfriend, Ken, in 1961 (oddly enough, named after Barbara Handler’s brother), but she wasn’t defined by her relationship. Mattel’s marketing was ingenious. It created an entire character for her. Her full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts and she’s from Willows, Wisconsin. She started as a fashion model, but over the years she has had countless jobs, as a doctor, astronaut, model, Nascar driver, Olympic athlete, soldier, engineer, rock star, palaeontologist, and a presidential candidate, running under the slogan: “Go vote. Go run. Go lead. Go, girl!” She has also moved with the times, albeit not as fast as critics would like; the first black Barbie appeared in 1980.\n\nWhy is Barbie controversial?\n\nShe has long been a target for feminist criticism, because of her unrealistic figure and the hyper-feminine “candy pink” image that she projects. (In the 1990s, a New York group calling itself the Barbie Liberation Organisation swapped the voice boxes inside Barbie dolls and GI Joes in shops, so that Barbie bellowed “Vengeance is mine!”, while Joe chirped “Wanna go shopping?”) Barbie’s measurements in inches, if she were 5ft 9in, would be approximately 39-18-33, with a nine-inch neck, and a dangerously low BMI of 16.2. Scientists say she would be unable to hold herself up, and “would likely not menstruate”. One study, in the journal Body Image, concluded that girls aged 6-8 who played with Barbie dolls had more complaints about their bodies than girls who had dolls with more realistic proportions.\n\nWill she ever stop?\n\nIt seems unlikely. Since 1959, well over a billion Barbie dolls have been sold. Today, according to Mattel, more than 100 dolls are sold every minute, across 150 nations. In 2022, the brand racked up $1.5bn in sales. Barbie has continued to evolve: more realistically proportioned “petite, tall and curvy” versions are now available (though the original still vastly outsells them). Barbie has expanded into TV, film and social media, and has adapted to “age compression”, the phenomenon of children growing up faster: the average customer used to be 12; now they are three to five. Love her or loathe her, she is, according to M.G. Lord, author of Forever Barbie, “the most potent icon of American popular culture in the late 20th century”. Another Barbie expert, Christopher Varaste, went even further, dubbing her “the face of the American dream”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Anahi Valenzuela", "The Week Us", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/04/14/how-old-is-barbie-doll-history-information/11635666002/", "title": "How old is Barbie?

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIf Barbie doesn't exactly look like a baby boomer, it might be because when Barbie was released she was meant to be 19 and plastic dolls aren't usually subject to the aging process.\n\nWhen was the first Barbie made?\n\nThe first Barbie was released on March 9, 1959.\n\nIn subsequent years Mattel released Ken, a boyfriend doll for Barbie, a best friend named Midge and countless others.\n\nIn her lifespan, Barbie has existed in hundreds of different iterations: as an astronaut, a presidential candidate, an athlete and a glamour girl.\n\nNot until twenty years after her release did Barbie begin to more fully resemble the American women it was meant to represent. In 1980, the first Black and Latina Barbies were introduced, though Mattel had previously released Christie, a friend of Barbie's, who was Black.\n\nWhat is Barbie's full name?\n\nBarbie is short for Barbara Millicent Roberts.\n\nThe name may seem old-school now but in 1959 – the year the first Barbie doll hit shelves – Barbara was the 11th most popular name for girls.\n\nThis Barbie is a sports icon: Meet Bayou Barbie and All-Pro Ken! Sports teams have fun with Barbie Selfie Generator\n\nWho created Barbie?\n\nBarbie is a product of the toy company Mattel, a giant in the doll market. Mattel is also behind the popular American Girl and Polly Pocket dolls.\n\nRuth Handler, who cofounded Mattel with her husband Elliott, was the principal architect of the doll's campaign. She was inspired by watching her daughter play with paper dolls resembling adult women – a departure from the typical baby doll popular at the time.\n\nBarbie was designed in the image of Bild Lilli, a doll inspired by a German comic strip and originally marketed as a sex symbol before she became popular with children.\n\nThe first Barbie sported a striped, strapless swimsuit, a perky blonde ponytail, and a set of gold hoops.\n\nWhen is National Barbie Day?\n\nNational Barbie Day is marked on Barbie's birthday, celebrated each year on March 9.\n\nDid Barbie have a boyfriend?\n\nIn 1961 Mattel followed up the launch of their popular Barbie doll with a beau to keep her company: Ken Carson.\n\nRuth and Elliott Handler had two children named Barbara and Ken.\n\nKen and Barbie have had an on-again-off-again relationship over the years, even calling it quits publicly in 2004 before reuniting seven years later.\n\nWho gets to be a Barbie doll?: New all-pink Barbiecore trend invites everyone to the Dream House\n\nHow tall is Barbie?\n\nThe Barbie doll is 11.5 inches tall, which converts to 5' 9\" making her above average height for an American woman.\n\nBarbie's dimensions have been the subject of fierce debate over the years.

The script was the “best … [he’d] ever read,” he told host Jimmy Fallon, but he wanted to take a moment and consider the decision in the fresh air.\n\nWhen he walked into his backyard, he discovered an otherwise-pristine, shirtless Ken doll, facedown in the mud next to a “squished lemon,” Gosling said.\n\nRyan Gosling Addresses His Viral Ken Picture and Paints Jimmy’s Fingernail Pink (Extended)\n\nThe future Ken snapped a photo of the affecting scene, perhaps a sign from the universe, and texted it to Gerwig.\n\n“I said, ‘I shall be your Ken. For his story must be told,’” Gosling told Fallon.\n\nAnd though the film recently wrapped, Gosling is continuing to name-drop his beloved Mattel character wherever he goes, even when he’s promoting his other projects, and he defends Ken fiercely against detractors.\n\n“I was surprised how some people were kind of clutching their pearls about my Ken, as if they ever thought about Ken for a second before this!” Gosling said, pointing a faux-angry, accusatory finger. “They never played with Ken!”\n\nThen the conversation turned bleak and existential: “Nobody plays with Ken, man,” Gosling lamented. “He’s an accessory, and not even one of the cool ones.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Gosling has considered the failings of Ken’s seemingly plush life. In an interview earlier this month with Entertainment Tonight, Gosling said that life in plastic is much harder than the life of the fictional mercenary he plays in Netflix’s “The Gray Man.”\n\n“Ken’s got no money, he’s got no job, he’s got no car, he’s got no house,” Gosling said in the earlier interview. “He’s going through some stuff.”\n\nBut the “Barbie” film will be much more fun than Gosling’s devastating descriptions of Ken make it out to be, he assured Fallon this week.\n\n“Those are not plot details; those are just objective facts about Ken,” he said. “That’s the Ken life.”\n\nUntil “Barbie” hits theaters in July 2023, we can just hope Gosling will continue to wedge Ken into all his interviews for the foreseeable future.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/07/15/selling-vintage-barbies-dont-take-out-box-premium-price/1734410001/", "title": "Selling vintage Barbies: Don't take it out of the box for premium price", "text": "Mike Rivkin\n\nSpecial to The Desert Sun\n\nThe quintessential mid-century girl, Barbie was conceived in 1959 by Ruth Handler, co-founder of Mattel and keen observer of what youngsters liked to play with.\n\nUntil that time, dolls were mostly infants but Handler recognized the need for a young adult figure that children could relate to. Named after her daughter, Barbie Millicent Roberts debuted at the New York Toy Fair in 1959 and was an immediate hit. More than 350,000 were gobbled up that first year and some one billion Barbies have been sold since. She remains one of the best-selling toys of all time.\n\nDespite her initial success, Barbie was not embraced by everyone. Some saw her as an overprivileged manifestation of the leisure class, while others were concerned that a working girl was too liberal an image for the age.\n\nNonetheless, her popularity continued to grow.\n\nVintage Barbies had distinct characteristics\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFirst-generation Barbies from the so-called \"Vintage Era\" (1959-1966) remain the most valuable today. Early versions had either brunette or blonde hair, and came with a substantial backstory. Barbie was from Willow, Wis., and achieved success as a teen fashion model.\n\nShe usually came with a ponytail, heavy make-up and a touch of jewelry, and she stood upright thanks to flexible legs mounted on a plastic stand. Variations in jewelry, clothing, make-up and eye color soon followed.\n\nA red-haired Barbie was introduced in 1961, and names like Bubblecut, Fashion Queen, Swirl Ponytail, American Girl and Color Magic became objects of adoration for grade-school females everywhere.\n\nKen wasn't as successful, but remains popular\n\nThe year 1961 also saw the debut of Ken for the first time. Named after Handler's son, Ken was the all-American boy: athletic with a strong jaw and good hair. Ken was lily-white until the early 1980s when Kens of color were first introduced. While never as successful as Barbie, Ken was nonetheless a popular doll and remains so today in all his hues.\n\nCondition matters most to collectors\n\nIn 1967, the \"Mod Era\" began with new models reflecting the times. Some bore a striking resemblance to Jackie Kennedy while others wore boots and hip-huggers. In 1968, a talking Barbie was introduced with a pull-string in back that prompted a few hard-to-understand phrases. Most of these will no longer talk but those that do command premium prices among modern collectors.*\n\nOther eras followed with ever-changing hair and fashion. Variations in small features can have a big impact on value. The fact that certain Barbies have individual fingers while others have hands molded together does not go unnoticed by enthusiasts. In general, markings, feet, hands and hair are the most substantive details, with hair being the most important.\n\nNote, however, that condition is key. An uncommon Barbie new-in-box will generally sell for considerably more than a rare but well-used model.\n\nBarbies can sell well into five figures\n\nThe most expensive Barbie sold to date changed hands in 2010 when a designer-enhanced version sporting real jewels sold for $302,500. Other custom or commemorative examples have sold well into five figures and there remains a very active collectors group around the world.\n\nIt has been calculated that, today, three Barbies are sold every second.\n\nWhile other toys come and go, Barbie remains eternal.\n\nInterested in antiques?

As if Barbie didn't already have enough accessories, the movie has spawned so much related merchandise that everywhere you turn, it's like you're viewing the world through pastel pink-colored glasses.\n\nEven Starbucks offers a Barbie frappuccino, although it's not an official menu item. But it's all over TikTok, so it must be a \"thing.\"\n\nDon't count on the summer sensation dying down when the season ends, since COSI will jump on the Barbie bandwagon with its first exhibit of the fall. \"Barbie You Can Be Anything: The Experience,\" opens on Oct. 4 and runs through Jan. 7.\n\n\"This is first and foremost an early childhood education experience,\" said Kristy Williams, COSI's director of communications. \"The movie may be for adults, but this is more geared toward little kids. Adults can enjoy it, but the activities are more like our 'Doc McStuffins' exhibit.\"\n\nLike \"Doc McStuffins: The Exhibit,\" the \"Barbie\" experience is an adventure that emphasizes imaginative, hands-on play. Young COSI visitors will be immersed in the colorful Barbie-verse while discovering their interests at different stations, where they can explore the many jobs Barbie's held since her debut on March 9, 1959.\n\n\"Kids can try on a career to see what fits,\" Williams said. \"This is a good opportunity for kids to go through and see what they might be inspired by.\"\n\nCan't wait until October to visit \"Barbie You Can Be Anything: The Experience?\" To tide you over until then, here are five things to know about the exhibit.\n\n1. The exhibit isn't related to the movie\n\n\"Barbie You Can Be Anything: The Experience\" has no ties to the \"Barbie\" movie, but the two do share a common relative. Barbie doll creator Mattel, Inc., which teamed up with The Children's Museum of Indianapolis to create the exhibit, also partnered with Warner Bros., distributors of the $1 billion-plus-grossing \"Barbie\" movie.\n\n2. Barbie could make a career out of job-hopping\n\nIn her 60-plus years of existence, Barbie has pursued more than 250 careers. She's literally done it all from A to Z: actor, artist, astronaut, art teacher, animal rescuer, Army medic, architect, Avon representative, aerobics instructor, aircraft engineer, astrophysicist, zookeeper and zoologist.\n\nBarbie has famously delved into the fashion world as a designer, editor, model and trend forecaster; shown off her footwork as a ballerina, ballroom dancer, and Rockette; and worked more chef and fast-food jobs than you can shake a spatula at. She's even been a politician, running for commander-in-chief in nearly every presidential election since 1992.\n\nThe many faces of Barbie: Here's an illustrated look at the doll's evolution\n\nWhile there won't be hundreds of job stations at COSI's exhibit, the pickings won't exactly be slim, either. \"There will be a jungle with a Jeep, so kids can see if adventure is their style, as well as an airline pilot, a surfer area, and an archaeology area,\" Williams said, listing just a few of the career options.\n\n\"They can try different activities from adventuring to nurturing to see what part of the Barbie universe they belong to.\"\n\n3. It's not all about classic blonde Barbie\n\n\"When you think about Barbie, you get a certain image, but (the exhibit) is completely different than what I thought it would be,\" said Williams, who viewed \"Barbie You Can Be Anything: The Experience\" at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis.\n\n\"There are tons of dolls on display, including rare ones. There are important women all through the exhibit — Eleanor Roosevelt, Amelia Earhart, Ella Fitzgerald, Katherine Johnson and many others — inspiring, real-life female role models. There are so many different iconic Barbies to look up to, to see what Barbie is like as a boss lady.\"\n\n4. The exhibit ties into a larger initiative\n\n\"Barbie You Can Be Anything\" is linked to Mattel's initiatives to empower girls, such as the corporation's Dream Gap Project, designed to help reverse the stereotypes and societal biases about what young girls can and can't do.\n\nThe multifaceted project includes STEM activities, 250-plus Career Dolls and a line of \"sheroes\" — dolls based on real-life female role models ranging from journalists, athletes and astronauts to CEOs, activists and medical professionals.\n\nAmong Mattel's most recent \"sheroes\" are tennis player Naomi Osaka; late Afro-Cuban salsa star Celia Cruz; and the Wojcicki sisters — Susan, former longtime YouTube CEO; Janet, an anthropologist and epidemiologist; and Anne, CEO and co-founder of 23andMe.\n\n5. The 'Barbie' exhibit isn't just for girls\n\n“This exhibit is for girls and boys. Both girls and boys can learn about women in history through the Barbie lens. We absolutely encourage people to bring kids of all ages, no matter who they are,” Williams said. “COSI is for everybody.”\n\nWhat to know when you go\n\nAdmission to \"Barbie You Can Be Anything: The Experience\" is included with admission to COSI, which is $25 for ages 13 and older; $20 for ages 2-12; $23 for 60 and older, as well as military adults; and $18 for military youth ages 2-12. Those 60 and older, and military personnel and family must have valid ID. Children younger than 2 are admitted for free.\n\nHours at COSI, 333 W. Broad St., are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. The center will close on Sept. 5 and reopen with the \"Barbie\" exhibit on Oct. 4.

Journalists from all over the state contributed, ensuring we painted a true picture of how Iowa has changed from river to river.\n\nWe remain committed to telling these stories. If you would like your loved one remembered in this way, email me at ccrowder@dmreg.com or submit their name here.\n\nTogether, we can make certain the Iowans lost will always be more than a number.\n\n— Courtney Crowder\n\nREMEMBERING:\n\nA\n\nConnie Abegglen, 74, Merrill.

This means Singapore’s Changi International loses its crown after taking top spot from 2013 to 2020.\n\nConducted from August 2020 until July 2021, and assessing customer service and facilities across more than 500 airports, the annual customer survey for the passenger’s choice awards saw many travellers vote for their favourite airport based on pre-pandemic travel experiences, the awards organisers said. Meanwhile, others voted after their Covid-19 airport experience during the past 12 months.\n\nAirports in Europe and Asia dominated the 2021 awards. Japan was voted best-rated country overall, with three airports in the top ten, including both of Tokyo’s airports. Moving from No.102 in 2020 to No.17 in this year’s survey, Istanbul Airport in Turkey was named the world’s most improved airport in 2021.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Hamad International Airport\n\n(Image credit: Karim Jaafar/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nDoha, Qatar\n\nAs well as taking the No.1 spot for the world’s best airport, Hamad International was also named the best airport in the Middle East, the world’s best airport in the 25 to 35 million passenger category, and best airport staff in the Middle East. “Inaugurated in 2014, Hamad International Airport has rapidly become a customer favourite,” said Edward Plaisted of Skytrax. “Achieving this honour is very much a team effort.”\n\nThe airport is “gearing up for an influx of crowds” as Doha and Qatar will host the Fifa World Cup next year, says Travel+Leisure magazine. It has been implementing new changes ahead of the World Cup, including “increasing its annual capacity to 53 million passengers and building a 110,000 sq ft tropical garden, complete with a waterfall that is nearly 900ft tall”.\n\n2. Tokyo Haneda Airport\n\n(Image credit: Philip Fong/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nHaneda Airport in Tokyo was a big winner in the 2021 Skytrax World Airport Awards. Ranked No.2 in the world, it was also named best airport in Asia, the world’s best domestic airport, the world’s best airport for cleanliness, and the best airport for passengers with restricted mobility and accessible facilities. It is the first of three Japanese airports in the top ten.\n\n3. Changi International Airport\n\n(Image credit: Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSingapore\n\nChangi International in Singapore has been a frequent winner of the world’s best airport title. However, for the time in nearly a decade it’s been knocked off the top spot and is No.3 in 2021. Third place is “an achievement for any other airport”, CNN says, but “perhaps not from the perspective of its superfans, who regularly praise the airport’s ease, comfort and top-notch food and drink options”.\n\n4. Incheon International Airport\n\n(Image credit: Jung Yeon-je/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSeoul, South Korea\n\nSeoul’s Incheon International Airport takes fourth place in the 2021 awards. It is certified as a five-star airport for facilities, comfort, cleanliness, shopping, food and beverages, staff service and security/immigration. “The opening of Terminal 2 at Incheon Airport has greatly alleviated passenger density in Terminal 1,” Skytrax said. “T2 provides superb architecture, technology and passenger comfort.”\n\n5. Tokyo Narita Airport\n\n(Image credit: Carl Court/Getty Images)\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nNarita joins fellow Tokyo international airport Haneda in the top ten. The main international gateway to the Greater Tokyo region of Japan, Narita is a major hub for airlines including ANA, Japan Airlines and Delta Air Lines, says the Capa Centre for Aviation.\n\n6. Munich International Airport\n\n(Image credit: Andreas Gebert/Getty Images)\n\nMunich, Germany\n\nMunich Airport retained its stronghold at the awards - taking sixth spot overall and named the best airport in Europe and best airport in central Europe. After a year hit by Covid, the volume of traffic at Munich Airport is beginning to “soar once again”, Travel Daily News reports. The Bavarian state capital’s airport is the second busiest in Germany and with more than 150 retail stores and 50 places to eat and drink, “it’s like a city centre, offering travellers and visitors plenty to see and do”, Skytrax says.\n\n7. Zurich Airport\n\n(Image credit: Michael Buholzer/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nZurich, Switzerland\n\nNo.7 on the overall list, Zurich is Switzerland’s largest airport. Widely recognised as one of Europe’s best airports, Zurich is “a cavalcade of services, conveniences, and essentially, everything you would want from an airport”, says Expatica. In the 2021 awards it was named best airport for five to ten million passengers, Covid-19 airport excellence, and best airport for cleanliness in Europe.\n\n8. Heathrow Airport\n\n(Image credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\nLondon, England\n\nLondon’s Heathrow was named best airport for 20 to 25 million passengers in the 2021 awards, as well as the best airport in western Europe. One of the world’s busiest international airports, it is the primary hub for British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. Coming a very respectable eighth in the 2021 ranking, Heathrow is “way ahead of rival hub Gatwick, which comes 69th”, the Daily Mail reports.\n\n9. Kansai International Airport\n\n(Image credit: Buddhika Weerasinghe/Getty Images)\n\nOsaka, Japan\n\nThe closest major airport to the cities of Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe, Kansai has become an important international hub for Japan. It provides one of the largest networks for both domestic and international routes with 24-hour operations. Kansai is the third Japanese airport in the top ten.\n\n10. Hong Kong International Airport\n\n(Image credit: Anthony Kwan/Getty Images)\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nOne of the world’s largest passenger and cargo airports, Hong Kong International is the main airport for Cathay Pacific Airways. Hong Kong is an “excellent hub” which delivers a “high standard for customers in many product and service areas”, Skytrax says.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Catherine Garcia", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2013/06/19/ratings-emirates-named-worlds-best-airline/2437131/", "title": "Ratings: Emirates named world's best airline", "text": "Ben Mutzabaugh\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nEmirates was tabbed as the world's best airline, according to the annual airline ratings published by SkyTrax.\n\nEmirates' win was its first top finish in the SkyTrax World Airline Awards since 2002. Emirates jumped from eighth to first in the 2013 ratings, overtaking two-time defending winner Qatar Airways.\n\nQatar Airways did not fall far, however, with the overall ratings reflecting the strength of the fast-growing \"Gulf carriers.\" Qatar Airways finished No. 2 while Abu Dhabi-based Etihad finished No. 7, meaning all three of the big three Gulf carriers finished in the global top 10.\n\nAs usual, Asian airlines also fared well. Third-place Singapore Airlines took the highest spot of the five Asian carriers (not counting the Gulf carriers) that cracked the top 10.\n\nSkyTrax, a U.K.-based travel consultancy that runs what it calls the \"world's largest review site,\" determines its annual ratings from reviews by more than 18.2 million passengers that represent more than 150 countries.

But analysts say the two disasters could make it difficult for the airline to continue operating.\n\n\"It will be tough,\" said Robert Mann, of R.W. Mann & Co. in Port Washington, N.Y., who noted that the airline and Malaysian tourism generally were already suffering before March.\n\nDespite growing, the airline has lost money for years because of higher fuel costs and airport charges, competition from low-cost carriers and weakening currency against the dollar, according to the company.\n\n\"This incident is more grave news for an airline that doesn't need it,\" said Henry Harteveldt, an analyst at Atmosphere Research Group in San Francisco. \"It is imperative for the airline and relevant authorities to determine whether the crash is the result of external fire from the ground, and thus, outside Malaysia Airline's control, or a problem with the aircraft or its crew.\"\n\nHarteveldt said the airline would need new leadership if it is to continue, because of lingering concerns about the missing plane.\n\n\"The airline absolutely must take urgent, tangible, and meaningful steps to show it is in control of its destiny,\" Harteveldt said. \"Though its airplanes fly, as a business, Malaysia Airlines seems to lurch from one day to the next.\"\n\nMann said that ironically, damage to the airline's reputation would be less severe if the plane was shot down, which U.S. intelligence officials said late Thursday was indeed the case.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant as vice president at Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said as a state-backed carrier, the airline wouldn't feel the same financial pressures as Pan Am after Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n\n\"If the powers that be want to back you, you're fine,\" Aboulafia said. \"Given the way things are shaping up, this is an airline that is the victim of nothing more than very bad luck.\"\n\nThe plane that went down Thursday, a Boeing 777-200ER, is a similar model to the one that disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The search for that flight has focused on the Indian Ocean about 1,000 miles west of Australia, based on intermittent signals that a satellite picked up.\n\nMalaysia Airlines, the country's national carrier, flies about 37,000 passengers aboard 250 departures daily to 80 destinations, according to the company's website.\n\nIt boarded 13 million passengers in 2011, generating revenue of about $4.5 billion, according to the website. That revenue compares with a smaller airline, such as JetBlue Airways, for the same year.\n\nMalaysia Airlines' fleet of 88 aircraft includes Boeing 747-400, 777-200ER, 737-800 and 737-400, as well as Airbus A330-300, A330-200 and its flagship A380-800.\n\nThe airline considered the July 2012 launch of its A380 service from Kuala Lumpur and London Heathrow as a major milestone in a history that began with its incorporation as Malayan Airways Limited (MAL) on Oct. 12, 1937.\n\nThe airline has won numerous awards from industry groups Skytrax UK and the World Travel Awards for the quality of its cabin crews, food and general excellence. World Travel Awards called it the best airline in Asia in 2013.\n\nService began between Penang , Malaysia, and Singapore, and Malayan Airways had its first commercial flight as a national airline on April 2, 1947, according to the company's website. In less than a decade, the airline began international flights.\n\nThe airline changed its name to Malaysian Airlines Limited with the formation of Malaysia in 1963. Two years later, with the separation of Singapore, the airline became a bi-national airline, Malaysia-Singapore Airlines. That partnership ended in 1972, and the airline later was renamed Malaysia Airlines.\n\nMalaysia Airlines became a full member of the Oneworld airline alliance in February 2013 and is now connected to 850 destinations through that network.\n\nThe airline's last crash was Sept. 15, 1995, when a Fokker 50 crashed and killed 34 people out of 53 on board, according to a summary at the Flight Safety Foundation.\n\nThe investigation found the plane touched down 500 meters short of the runway, probably due to the pilot's poor decision-making and failure to follow standard procedures, according to the foundation's summary.\n\nOther factors were the co-pilot's failure to alert the captain to unsafe maneuvers and the controller's failure to provide better assistance, according to the summary.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/17"}]}

Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou’re exhausted, your body yawning for sleep. Yet once your head hits the pillow, your mind is flooded with worry, making sleep elusive, at times impossible.\n\nDon’t fret, experts say: There are relaxation techniques you can use to calm that racing mind.\n\n“Think of these relaxation exercises as tools in your tool kit for better sleep,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School.\n\n“Practice them, and you’ll get better and better at falling asleep, which is the holy grail, right? No one wants to spend time tossing and turning at night.”\n\n1. Controlled deep breathing\n\nDeep breathing is a science-backed method of calming the body and mind that can be done easily before you get into bed and when you wake during the middle of the night.\n\nChanging the rhythm of your breath slows your heart rate, reduces blood pressure and stimulates the body’s parasympathetic “rest and digest” system, which can take worry and anxiety offline.\n\n“Consciously focusing on the breath can help you separate yourself from the darting thoughts that fly through your brain,” Robbins said.\n\nThere are a number of deep breathing techniques you can try. Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing, focuses on relaxing the diaphragm, the main muscle of respiration. Start by taking a deep breath through your nose to a slow count of six, making sure that you can feel your stomach rise with your hand as it fills with air. Count to six again as you let the breath slowly escape.\n\n“Strive for effortless inhales that are soft and soundless while treating your exhales like gentle, extended sighs of relief,” suggested CNN contributor Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach.\n\nStay in the moment, Santas said, by focusing on the sounds and sensations of your breath: “Direct all of your senses to follow the path of air in through your nose, down your throat, into your lungs and out again. If your mind wanders, bring it back to your breath, happening in the here and now.”\n\n2. Meditation\n\nMeditation is a centuries-old method of calming the body and the mind. Studies show it can help perfectionists stop judging themselves and can assist in the treatment of smoking, pain, addictive disorders and depression, among others.\n\nUsing direct measures of brain function and structure, one study found it only took 30 minutes a day of meditation practice over the course of two weeks to produce a measurable change in the brain.\n\n“When these kinds of mental exercises are taught to people, it actually changes the function and the structure of their brain,” neuroscientist Richard Davidson, professor of psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the founder and director of the Center for Healthy Minds, told CNN in an earlier interview.\n\nThere are many resources on the internet to help someone begin to meditate. Davidson and his colleagues have created a free, science-based app designed to help people practice meditation and mindfulness.\n\n3. Visualization\n\nVisualization is another sleep aid. Picture a calm and peaceful spot in your mind’s eye and fill it with specific objects, colors and sounds. Researchers have found that people who visualize in detail were able to push unwelcome thoughts more successfully from their minds.\n\nIf you have trouble populating the scene, the researchers suggest asking yourself questions about smell, touch and light, such as “Can I feel the sun on my skin? What do I smell in the air?”\n\nYou can also visualize your body relaxing, experts say. While breathing deeply and slowly, imagine your breath is a wind coursing through the body, easing stress and relaxing tension as it moves through each part of the body and then escapes.\n\n“I like to think of the breath as a light in your mind’s eye that grows when you inhale and gets smaller as you exhale,” Robbins said. “Those tangible strategies where you visualize something and match that to a breath are really powerful.”\n\n4. Progressive muscle relaxation\n\nMost of us aren’t even aware of how much tension we carry in our muscles until it shows up in backaches and headaches.\n\nProgressive muscle relaxation is a way of relaxing those muscles, thus making it easier to fall asleep, experts say. You tense and release muscle groups in the body in a certain order, starting at the head and working your way down to the toes and feet.\n\nEach section of the body is tightly tensed and held for 10 seconds as you breathe in. Strive to squeeze each muscle hard, but not to the point of cramping or pain. Then, as you breathe out, relax the muscle suddenly and all at once. University of Michigan Health recommends you do the exercises in a systematic order that you can find here.\n\nThere’s an added benefit to the exercise, experts say: There’s no room in your brain for anxious thoughts.\n\n5. Set up a ‘worry time’ before bed\n\nHere’s a way to stop your mind from repetitively listing all the things you need to do (or haven’t done), but it only works if you do it before you hit the sack.\n\n“Don’t worry in bed. Schedule a ‘worry time’ – a period of time outside of the bedroom, outside of sleep, to worry about the things that naturally creep in your mind at night,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\n“Write down a list of things you need to do tomorrow,” suggested Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, a professor of medicine and director of sleep research at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n“You can even email it to yourself. It gives you satisfaction and the realization that it is night and there’s nothing you can do with your list, but you can attend to it tomorrow,” Polotsky said.\n\nAll these mental tricks and relaxation tips serve a purpose beyond that night’s sleep, experts say.\n\n“They are extremely beneficial from a classical conditioning standpoint,” Robbins said. “If your body knows what comes after the end of these activities is sleep, then you start to condition yourself, and after a bit of time, your body will more easily slip into a state of relaxation, which increases your chances of sleep.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/health/4-7-8-breathing-technique-relaxing-wellness/index.html", "title": "The 4-7-8 method that could help you sleep | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Want to sleep better? During Sleep Awareness Week, sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nFalling asleep or coming down from anxiety might never be as easy as 1-2-3, but some experts believe a different set of numbers — 4-7-8 — comes much closer to doing the trick.\n\nThe 4-7-8 technique is a relaxation exercise that involves breathing in for four counts, holding that breath for seven counts and exhaling for eight counts, said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a clinical associate professor of medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, via email.\n\nAlso known as the “relaxing breath,” 4-7-8 has ancient roots in pranayama, which is the yogic practice of breath regulation, but was popularized by integrative medicine specialist Dr. Andrew Weil in 2015.\n\n“What a lot of sleep difficulties are all about is people who struggle to fall asleep because their mind is buzzing,” said Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and associate scientist in the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “But exercises like the 4-7-8 technique give you the opportunity to practice being at peace. And that’s exactly what we need to do before we go to bed.”\n\n“It does not ‘put you to sleep,’ but rather it may reduce anxiety to increase likelihood of falling asleep,” said Joshua Tal, a New York state-based clinical psychologist.\n\nREAD MORE: Sign up for CNN’s Adulthood, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide wil help you make more informed decisions around personal finance, career, wellness and personal connections.\n\nHow 4-7-8 works\n\nThe 4-7-8 method doesn’t require any equipment or specific setting, but when you’re initially learning the exercise, you should sit with your back straight, according to Weil. Practicing in a calm, quiet place could help, said Robbins. Once you get the hang of it, you can use the technique while lying in bed.\n\nDuring the entire practice, place the tip of your tongue against the ridge of tissue behind your upper front teeth, as you’ll be exhaling through your mouth around your tongue. Then follow these steps, according to Weil:\n\nCompletely exhale through your mouth, making a whoosh sound.\n\nClose your mouth and quietly inhale through your nose to a mental count of four.\n\nHold your breath for a count of seven.\n\nExhale through your mouth, making a whoosh sound for a count of eight.\n\nRepeat the process three more times for a total of four breath cycles.\n\nKeeping to the ratio of four, then seven and then eight counts is more important than the time you spend on each phase, according to Weil.\n\n“If you have trouble holding your breath, speed the exercise up but keep the ratio (consistent) for the three phases. With practice you can slow it all down and get used to inhaling and exhaling more and more deeply,” his website advised.\n\nWhat research shows\n\nWhen you’re stressed out, your sympathetic nervous system — responsible for your fight-or-flight response — is overly active, which makes you feel overstimulated and not ready to relax and transition into sleep, Dasgupta said. “An active sympathetic nervous system can cause a fast heart rate as well as rapid and shallow breathing.”\n\nThe 4-7-8 breathing practice can help activate your parasympathetic nervous system — responsible for resting and digesting — which reduces sympathetic activity, he added, putting the body in a state more conducive to restful sleep. Activating the parasympathetic system also gives an anxious brain something to focus on besides “why am I not sleeping?” Tal said.\n\nWhile proponents may swear by the method, more research is needed to establish clearer links between 4-7-8 and sleep and other health benefits, he added.\n\n“There is some evidence that 4-7-8 breathing helps reduce anxious, depressive and insomniac symptoms when comparing pre- and post-intervention, however, there are no large randomized control trials specifically on 4-7-8 breathing to my knowledge,” Tal said. “The research on (the effect of) diaphragmatic breathing on these symptoms in general is spotty, with no clear connection due to the poor quality of the studies.”\n\nA team of researchers based in Thailand studied the immediate effects of 4-7-8 breathing on heart rate and blood pressure among 43 healthy young adults. After participants had these health factors and their fasting blood glucose measured, they performed 4-7-8 breathing for six cycles per set for three sets, interspersed with one minute of normal breathing between each set. Researchers found the technique improved participants’ heart rate and blood pressure, according to a study published in July 2022.\n\nWhen researchers have observed the effects of breathing techniques like 4-7-8 breathing, they have seen an increase in theta and delta brain waves, which indicate someone is in the parasympathetic state, Robbins said. “Slow breathing like the 4-7-8 technique reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes and improves pulmonary function.”\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe 4-7-8 technique is relatively safe, but if you’re a beginner, you could feel a little lightheaded at first, Dasgupta said.\n\n“Normal breathing is a balance between breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide. When you upset this balance by exhaling more than you inhale, (it) causes a rapid reduction in carbon dioxide in the body,” he said. “Low carbon dioxide levels lead to narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the brain. This reduction in blood supply to the brain leads to symptoms like lightheadedness. This is why it is often recommended to start slowly and practice three to four cycles at a time until you are comfortable with the technique.”\n\nThe more you practice the 4-7-8 technique, the better you’ll become, and the more your body and mind will incorporate it into your usual roster of tools for managing stress and anxiety, Dasgupta said. Some people combine this method with other relaxation practices such as progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, mindfulness or meditation.\n\nUnmanaged stress can rear its head in the form of sleep difficulties, Robbins said. “But when we can manage our stress over the course of the day (and) implement some of these breathing techniques, we can put ourselves in the driver’s seat instead of being victim to events that happen in our lives.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/09/13/baby-wont-stop-crying-how-to-get-them-to-sleep/10368278002/", "title": "Baby won't stop crying?

Now, researchers say they have figured out – scientifically – the best way to get a newborn back in their crib, and it involves moving around.\n\nThe findings, published Tuesday in the peer reviewed journal Current Biology, suggest the best method is to hold a crying baby and walk with them for five minutes. After that, researchers say to sit and hold the baby for five-to-eight minutes before putting them to bed. The walking-to-sit method even worked in the daytime, the results showed.\n\nResearchers came to their conclusion be comparing 21 infant reactions to four scenarios: being held by walking mothers, held by sitting mothers, lying in a crib and lying in a rocking motion.\n\nThe team found crying babies calmed down and heart rates slowed within 30 seconds of the mother walking and carrying.

Babies also had their heart rates go up and continue to cry when just held while sitting, but not carried while walking.\n\nAlso, when babies were asleep for longer periods before being laid back down, they were more likely to stay asleep.\n\n\"Even as a mother of four, I was very surprised to see the result. I thought baby awoke during a laydown is related to how they’re put on the bed, such as their posture, or the gentleness of the movement,\" Dr. Kumi Kuroda, researcher at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Japan and co-author, said in a statement. \"But our experiment did not support these general assumptions.\"\n\nThe research done supports the transport response, something Kuroda and her team have discovered before in that baby mammals – including humans – feel calmness when carried by their mothers.\n\nWhile this method suggested positive results, it isn't the only way to get babies to sleep, and it may not work for everyone. The American Academy of Pediatrics says parents could put their babies to bed when they are drowsy versus asleep, and not to rush them back to sleep if they wake up. Pregnancy, Birth and Baby also suggests multiple ways to get babies back to bed.\n\nAbout about 20%–30% of infants cry \"excessively and exhibit sleep difficulties\" for no known reason, the researchers said, and their goal was to provided an immediate solution for parents. More research is needed to determine if this method could improve sleep long-term, the team determined.\n\n\"Like science-based fitness training, we can do science-based parenting with these advances, and hopefully help babies to sleep and reduce parental stress caused by excessive infant crying,\" Kuroda said. \"We need science to understand a baby’s behaviors, because they’re much more complex and diverse than we thought.\"\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/09/health/sleep-history-wellness-scn/index.html", "title": "How our ancestors used to sleep can help the sleep-deprived today ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nLike many people, historian A. Roger Ekirch thought that sleep was a biological constant – that eight hours of rest a night never really varied over time and place.\n\nBut while researching nocturnal life in preindustrial Europe and America, he discovered the first evidence that many humans used to sleep in segments – a first sleep and second sleep with a break of a few hours in between to have sex, pray, eat, chat and take medicine.\n\n“Here was a pattern of sleep unknown to the modern world,” said Ekirch, a university distinguished professor in the department of history at Virginia Tech.\n\nEkirch’s subsequent book, “At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past,” unearthed more than 500 references to what’s since been termed biphasic sleep. Ekirch has now found more than 2,000 references in a dozen languages and going back in time as far as ancient Greece. His 2004 book will be republished in April.\n\nThe practice of sleeping through the whole night didn’t really take hold until just a few hundred years ago, his work suggested. It only evolved thanks to the spread of electric lighting and the Industrial Revolution, with its capitalist belief that sleep was a waste of time that could be better spent working.\n\nThe history of sleep not only reveals fascinating details about everyday life in the past, but the work of Ekirch, and other historians and anthropologists, is helping sleep scientists gain fresh perspective on what constitutes a good night’s sleep. It also offers new ways to cope with and think about sleep problems.\n\nThere is value in knowing about this prior pattern of sleep in the Western world, said Ekirch. He’s convinced “a large number of people who today suffer from middle-of-the-night insomnia, the primary sleep disorder in the United States – and I dare say in most industrialized countries – rather than experiencing a quote unquote, disorder, are in fact, experiencing a very powerful remnant, or echo of this earlier pattern of sleep,” said Ekirch, who stressed he was speaking from a historical perspective and not as a medical doctor.\n\nAdults need more than seven hours of sleep a night, but more than a third of American adults are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA panel from a medieval stained glass church window depicts a married couple sleeping. TonyBaggett/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nMyth of 8-hour sleep?\n\nThe first reference to biphasic sleep Ekirch found was in a 1697 legal document from a traveling “Assizes” court buried in a London record office. The deposition of a 9-year-old girl called Jane Rowth mentioned that her mother awoke after her “first sleep” to go out. The mother was later found dead.\n\n“I had never heard the expression, and it was expressed in such a way that it seemed perfectly normal,” he said. “I then began to come across subsequent references in these legal depositions but also in other sources.”\n\nThese are notes made by historian A. Roger Ekirch when he came across the first reference to segmented sleep in a London archive office. University Distinguished Professor of History at Virginia Tech\n\nEkirch subsequently found multiple references to a “first” and “second” sleep in diaries, medical texts, works of literature and prayer books. A doctor’s manual from 16th century France advised couples that the best time to conceive was not at the end of a long day but “after the first sleep,” when “they have more enjoyment” and “do it better.”\n\nBy the early 19th century, however, the first sleep had begun to expand at the expense of the second sleep, Ekirch found, and the intervening period of wakefulness. By the end of the century, the second sleep was little more than turning over in one’s bed for an extra 10 minutes of snoozing.\n\nBen Reiss, author of “Wild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World” and professor and chair of the English department at Emory University in Atlanta, blames the Industrial Revolution and the “sleep is for wimps” attitude it engendered.\n\n“The answer is really to follow the money. Changes in economic organization, when it became more efficient to routinize work and have large numbers of people showing up on factory floors, at the same time and doing as much work in as concentrated fashion as possible,” Reiss said.\n\nOur sleep schedule got squeezed and consolidated as a result, Reiss said.\n\nThe image shows a lamplighter up a ladder. British streets were lit by oil lamps until the introduction of gas lighting around 1807. SSPL/Getty Images\n\nNo golden age\n\nHowever, preindustrial life was no halcyon era when our ancestors went about their day well rested and rejuvenated, untroubled by insomnia or other sleep problems, effortlessly in sync with the cycle of night and day, weather patterns and seasons, according to Sasha Handley, a professor of history at The University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. She studies how families optimized their sleep in Britain, Ireland and England’s American colonies between 1500 and 1750.\n\n“Every discussion of sleep history seemed to center around the sort of watershed moment of industrialization, the coming of electricity ruining everybody’s sleep lives. The corollary of that is that anything preindustrial was imagined as this golden age of sleep.”\n\nA 15th century miniature of a room is shown. NSA Digital Archive/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nHandley said her research suggested, just like today, sleep was linked to physical and mental health and was a topic that people worried about and obsessed over.\n\nDoctor’s manuals from the time are full of advice on how many hours to sleep and in what kind of posture, she said. The reference guides also list hundreds of sleep recipes to aid a good night’s sleep, she said. These include the bizarre – cutting a pigeon in half and sticking each half to each side of your head and the more familiar – bathing in camomile-infused water and using lavender. People also burned specific types of wood in their bed chambers that were thought to aid sleep.\n\n“For our period, sleep is very strongly linked to digestion, emotion, stomach, and therefore to people’s diets,” Handley said.\n\nDoctors advised sleepers to rest first on the right side of their body before turning to the left side during the second half of the night. Resting on the right, perhaps during the first sleep, was thought to allow food to reach the pit of the stomach, where it was digested. Turning to the left, cooler side, released vapors and spread the heat evenly through the body.\n\nIt’s thought this habit could be the origin of the phrase about getting out of bed on the wrong side.\n\nThis is a woodblock print of a fisherman dreaming, circa 1700, Japan. The artist is unknown. Heritage Images/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nNot all scholars believe that sleeping in two shifts, while perhaps common in some communities, was once a universal habit. Far from it, said Brigitte Steger, a senior lecturer in Japanese studies at the University of Cambridge in the UK, who didn’t uncover any references to segmented sleep in her work on sleep habits in Japan.\n\n“There is no such thing as natural sleep. Sleep has always been cultural, social and ideological,” said Steger, who is working on a series of six books about the cultural history of sleep.\n\n“There is not such a clear-cut difference between premodern (or pre-industrial) and modern sleep habits,” she said via email. “And sleep habits throughout pre-industrial times and throughout the world have always changed. And, of course, there has always been social diversity, and sleep habits have been very different at court than for peasants, for instance.”\n\nSimilarly, Gerrit Verhoeven, an assistant professor in cultural heritage and history at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, said his study of criminal court records from 18th century Antwerp suggested that sleep habits weren’t so different to our own today. Seven hours of sleep was the norm and there was no mention of first or second sleep.\n\n“As a historian I’m concerned that arguments about alleged sleeping patterns in the past – prolonged, by-phasic and with napping during the day – are sometimes presented as a possible remedy for our modern sleeping disorders. Before drawing such conclusions, we have to do much more research about these early modern sleeping patterns,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Try this routine before sleep to get a good night of rest 07:23 - Source: CNN Try this routine before sleep to get a good night of rest 07:23\n\nRethinking insomnia\n\nRussell Foster, a professor of circadian neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said Ekirch’s findings on biphasic sleep, while not without controversy, had informed his work as a sleep scientist.\n\nExperiments in sleep labs had shown that when humans are given the opportunity to sleep longer, he said, their sleep can become biphasic or even polyphasic, replicating what Ekirch found in historical records. However, Foster, who is also the director of the Sir Jules Thorn Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford, doubted that it was a sleep pattern that would happen for everybody.\n\nNobody should impose a regime of segmented sleep on themselves, particularly if it resulted in a reduction of total sleep time, he added.\n\nWhat was clear, Foster said, was that interrupted sleep was perceived as less of a problem in the past and that modern expectations about what constitutes a good night’s sleep – sleeping through the night for eight hours – weren’t always helpful.\n\nHe said a key point was waking at night need not mean the end of sleep. One example he cited was more people waking up at night during lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“They’ll get terribly anxious and worried about waking up in the middle of night, because that’s not what they normally experience,” said Foster, who is also the author of “Life Time: The New Science of the Body Clock, and How It Can Revolutionize Your Sleep and Health,” which will be published in May 2022. More likely, what had happened was that people’s sleep episode – how much time they have available for sleep – had expanded and wasn’t constricted by an alarm clock going off.\n\n“It’s a throwback to a time when we genuinely got more sleep,” he said.\n\nIf we wake up at night, sleep is likely to return, if sleep is not sacrificed to social media or other behavior that makes you more alert or activates a stress response, Foster’s research has suggested. Like most sleep experts, he recommended getting out of bed if you’re getting frustrated by the failure to fall back to sleep and engaging in a relaxing activity while keeping the lights low.\n\n“Individual sleep across humans is so variable. One size doesn’t fit all. You shouldn’t worry about the sort of sleep that you get,” he said.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/health/get-to-sleep-early-wellness/index.html", "title": "How to get to sleep the night before an early call or big event | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou’re catching a 5 a.m. flight tomorrow. Your boss, a true early bird, has set an unbearably early weekly meeting. School is starting, and you have to rise and shine to goose the family into gear. The clock has rolled back, and suddenly you’re climbing out of bed in the dark.\n\nThose are the nights you crawl into bed early and beg for sleep – all too often in vain.\n\n“This has happened to me many times unfortunately,” said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “If you’re unable to fall asleep, don’t worry about it. It will not help.”\n\nSleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta has similar guidance.\n\n“My general advice is ‘don’t force it’ because that worry about getting those zzz’s will begin to ruminate in your mind, making matters worse,” said Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\n“The reality is that often the harder we try to relax and transition into sleep, the more we worry that we’re losing precious sleep time, making the elusive ‘good night’s sleep’ more difficult to obtain, ” he said via email.\n\nIf your sleep chronotype – the time your body is naturally programmed to want to sleep – is that of a night owl (late to bed, late to rise), those nights (and subsequent days) can be especially rough, experts say.\n\nHere are some tried-and-true tips from experts on how to ease those “please-let-me-get-to-sleep” worries.\n\n1. Don’t try for the impossible\n\nFirst, unless you’re a morning lark, don’t try to fall asleep at 9 p.m., which may be much too early for your body clock. It only sets you up to fret.\n\nInstead, “start dimming lights at 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.,” Zee advised, and aim for a 10 p.m. bedtime.\n\nYou also want to avoid blue light, which tricks your brain into “thinking it’s still daytime. This prevents the release of key hormones like melatonin, which help you sleep,” Dasgupta said.\n\n“Blue light is emitted by electronic devices like smartphones and computers,” he said, so be sure to avoid those as well as bright lights during the two hours before bedtime.\n\n2. Meditation, mindfulness and breathing\n\nBeing stressed about sleeping is “a huge barrier from getting refreshing sleep,” Dasgupta said, and can “worsen existing sleep issues such as insomnia.”\n\nFight back with mindfulness and meditation to promote calmness, he suggested. “(These practices) can help quiet the mind and body, making the transition into sleep easier and hopefully pleasant,” he said.\n\nMeditation can help quiet the mind and let you get to sleep. Kilito Chan/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nOne of the best ways to help you fall asleep is to focus on breathing, experts say.\n\n“One technique is the ‘4-7-8 breathing method,’ which has been shown to reduce stress,” Dasgupta said. “Take a deep breath for four seconds. Hold your breath for seven seconds, then slowly release your breath and exhale while counting from one to eight. Repeat these steps several times and then pause and notice if you feel more relaxed.”\n\n3. Introduce daylight\n\nWhen that all-too-early alarm goes off, immediately turn on bright lights, Zee said. That tells your brain it’s daylight and helps shut off melatonin production.\n\nThen get into some sunlight as soon as you can, experts suggest.\n\n“Natural sunlight during the day helps keep your circadian rhythm healthy,” Dasgupta said. “This improves daytime energy as well as nighttime sleep quality.”\n\n4. Plan a power nap\n\nYou might want to plan a 20- to 30-minute power nap in the early afternoon that day and then try your best to go to bed earlier that night as well, Zee said. Your “sleep drive” will be high, she said, due to being “sleep deprived the night before.”\n\nIt will be “easier to fall asleep around 10 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. and get some catch-up sleep,” Zee said.\n\n5. Avoid alcohol and sweets\n\nAvoid consuming caffeine after lunch and avoid alcohol near bedtime, “as both can disrupt sleep,” Dasgupta said. “If hungry after dinner, keep snacks small, sugar free and easily digestible so as to not disrupt sleep.”\n\nThat middle-of-the-night call\n\nWhat if you’ve done all this and happily dozed off, but you live in California and confused relatives call you at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. ET – which would be 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. PT?\n\nHere are the rules for that scenario, according to Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, professor of medicine and director of sleep research in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nDon’t turn the light on.\n\nTry to calm down, finish your conversation promptly and go back to bed.\n\nIf you cannot fall back to sleep in less than 10 minutes, go to another room, turn on a dim light and try to read a boring book. (No electronic devices allowed, Polotsky said. They emit blue light that will wake you up.)\n\nDo not check your email or text messages. In fact, do not use your smartphone, computer, e-reader or TV (again, due to the blue light stimulation).\n\nDo not do dishes, go outside or exercise.\n\nMeditate or relax and think about something pleasant.\n\nSo relax, don’t worry and sweet dreams!", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/health/crying-baby-sleep-parenting-wellness/index.html", "title": "A scientific way to calm and put a crying baby to sleep | CNN", "text": "Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt’s every parent’s nightmare – an exhausted baby who just won’t stop crying when it’s time go to sleep. Even worse? The baby finally falls asleep in your arms but wakes again and starts sobbing when laid in the crib.\n\nThe solution is a magic pair of numbers – five and eight – according to Japanese researchers who did experiments with 21 moms trying to lull their little ones into slumber.\n\nHere’s how it works: Walk your baby for a minimum of five minutes with no sudden movements, at which time the little one will be calm, if not asleep, according to the study. Then sit and hold baby for another eight minutes before making a gentle crib transfer.\n\nPlacing the sleeping infant in the bed without first sitting quietly for a full eight minutes ended in disappointment, according to study coauthor Dr. Kumi Kuroda, team leader of the affiliative social behavior unit at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Saitama, Japan.\n\n“Although we did not predict it, the key parameter for successful laydown of sleeping infants was the (delay) from sleep onset,” Kuroda said in a statement.\n\n“I have raised four children and I performed these experiments, but even I couldn’t foresee the key results of this study until the statistical data came up,” Kuroda added.\n\nTiming guidelines might be helpful for some parents and caregivers, but won’t necessarily work for everyone, said Atlanta pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu, medical editor-in-chief of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ parenting website.\n\nWalking for at least five minutes put many babies to sleep, the study said. Then sit for eight minutes before placing them in the crib. Cavan Images/Getty Images\n\n“Babies are different and (some) might not all respond to this system,” said Shu, who was not involved in the study.\n\nParents and caregivers shouldn’t use this technique regularly if a baby can fall asleep on their own, added Shu, who is also the coauthor of “Heading Home With Your Newborn: From Birth to Reality.”\n\n“The goal should be to make sure baby is getting good sleep using this or other techniques while eventually encouraging them to fall asleep on their own, both at the beginning of bedtime, as well as through the night (when they wake),” Shu said in an email.\n\nHeartbeat data key\n\nThe study, published Tuesday in the journal Current Biology, examined the impact of four soothing behaviors on infant crying. Mothers were asked to carry their baby while walking, walk with their baby in a stroller or “mobile cot,” hold their baby when seated, and finally, put their baby directly into a crib or cot. Researchers monitored the baby’s heartbeats and videotaped each session to record and time the response.\n\nSitting and holding a crying baby didn’t work, according to the study – monitors showed that the baby’s heart rate rose and the behavior continued. Not surprisingly, putting the crying baby directly into the crib also didn’t work.\n\nOnly movement calmed the babies, the study found. Within five minutes, all of the babies carried by walking moms had stopped crying, heart rate had slowed, and 46% of the infants were asleep. An additional 18% of babies fell asleep within another few minutes, the study found.\n\nHowever, the five-minute walk resulted in sleep only for crying babies. “Surprisingly, this effect was absent when babies were already calm beforehand,” Kuroda said.\n\nThe researchers saw similar results when parents pushed babies in strollers, but the impacts were not as robust.\n\nNow for the even harder part: putting sleeping babies down without waking them. A third of the babies in the study woke up immediately after being laid down, no matter how gently. But it wasn’t the touch of the bed on a baby’s body that woke them, the study found. Instead, monitors showed the baby’s heart rate response shot up when the infant was first detached from the mother’s body.\n\nHowever, when babies were held for an additional eight minutes, they entered a more stable state of sleep – one that did not waver when they separated from their mom, the researchers found.\n\nWhy does carrying work?\n\nHuman babies, like other mammals, respond to what is called the “transport response,” an innate reaction seen in species with infants that are too immature at birth to walk or care for themselves.\n\nYou see it in nature videos all the time: Mother lions, tigers and other wild cats, as well as their domesticated cousins, carry their babies by the scruff of the neck. So do wild and domestic dogs, mice and rats. Great apes, monkeys and other primates carry their babies on their back, where babies quiet down and cling, as do opossums and giant anteaters. Marsupials like kangaroos, koalas and wallabies all have specialized pouches to cradle their babies as they grow.\n\nThe response appears instantaneous – once Mom picks up the baby and begins moving, the infant is relatively docile and the rate of their heart slows, according to research done by Kuroda and her team.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears humans aren’t as lucky as other mammalian moms, and need to carry their young longer to obtain the same response. There’s another thing that sets people apart – the need for human babies to learn to sleep on their own.\n\n“Holding or rocking a baby completely to sleep creates a routine that the baby will learn to expect,” Shu said. “When the baby wakes up in the middle of the night in a stage of light sleep (as we all do), they may require the routine to be performed again.”\n\nFor babies 4 months and older, the AAP recommends putting them to bed when they are drowsy instead of waiting for them to fully fall asleep.\n\nAnd don’t rush to soothe a baby over 3 months old when they wake, the AAP recommended. Just like adults, the baby may well wiggle and fuss and fall back asleep.\n\nBe sure to follow safe sleep guidelines: You should always put babies to sleep on their back for naps and nighttime, in an approved crib without bumpers, pillows, soft toys, quilts, comforters or blankets.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/01/29/sleeping-trouble-tips-sleep-apnea-melatonin/71271059007/", "title": "Trouble falling asleep? An expert on melatonin, sleep apnea and more", "text": "Almost everyone is familiar with the sensation of tossing and turning in bed, finding sleep elusive.\n\nFor some, that's a rare event. For others, it's every night.\n\nThere are myriad reasons. Biology. Time of life. Illnesses.\n\nBut for most people, there are ways to improve both the quantity and quality of sleep.\n\nThese strategies take knowledge, discipline, ingenuity and maybe a good fan – not medication or gizmos and gadgets, according to experts. The vast majority of people can even continue their caffeine habits. At least, in moderation and in the morning.\n\n\"The best sleep comes when we're practicing the healthy sleep strategies that set us up for success at night,\" said Rebecca Robbins, an investigator in the division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nHow to fall asleep fast: 'Don't try so hard'\n\nFor the roughly 15% of people who struggle to consistently get a good night's sleep, researchers like Harvard University's Dr. Charles Czeisler have a lot of advice, starting with a simple suggestion: Don't worry so much.\n\nMany people who think they sleep terribly have an unrealistic expectation of what a good night's sleep is, likely remembering earlier years when they could sleep like a rock for half the day. That's simply not realistic in middle age, he and others said.\n\nIf you have to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom or find yourself waking up a few times, so be it, the experts say. In modern society, we all want to be able to sleep efficiently and we get impatient when we don't, said Czeisler, who directs the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution put a value on the workday, our ancestors used to sleep in two chunks with a gap of a few hours in between, historical research suggests.\n\nSome people may think they can't sleep well, Czeisler said, because they aren't accounting for their body's natural desire for this gap.\n\n\"They may just not be allocating enough time in bed to get as much sleep as they need. They want to be asleep 95% of the time they set aside for sleep, which they're going to minimize,\" he said.\n\nCzeisler and others advocate patience, instead.\n\nEven a well-rested person takes 15 to 20 minutes to fall asleep and older people take the same amount of time to fall asleep or fall back asleep as younger ones. \"It's important not to throw in the towel on the night just because you have awakened,\" Czeisler said.\n\nTracking sleep with wearable devices might help some people, several experts said, but too often, they become a source of stress.\n\nSleep is not a time for perfectionism.\n\n\"We want people to get in bed feeling like sleep could happen,\" said Jennifer Martin, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"Ultimately, they have to just stop trying so hard.\"\n\nSleep hygiene\n\nThe term \"sleep hygiene\" refers to good habits and practices that can help people sleep well most nights.\n\nWhile the specifics of when to go to bed and when to wake up will be different for everyone based on their individual needs and demands of daily living, the basic principles apply to everyone.\n\n\"All these behavioral changes are the secret sauce for healthy sleep,\" Robbins said.\n\nHere are some basics:\n\n◾ Go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time every night. Drastically different bedtimes will confuse your body clock and make it harder to fall asleep.\n\n◾ While some people might need a bedtime snack to fall asleep, others find food before bed disruptive. \"Breakfast of kings, lunch of princes, dinner of paupers,\" works best for most people, Robbins said. In other words, eat a lot in the morning, modestly in midday and not as much at night.\n\n◾ Avoid drinking \"nightcaps.\" While alcohol at night might help people fall asleep initially, it has been shown to disrupt sleep later and makes sleep apnea worse.\n\n◾ If you're sensitive to caffeine, avoid consuming too much, especially in the afternoon. If you're not sure, try an experiment for a week, cutting back or eliminating it entirely.\n\n◾ Manage stress. Meditation or breathing exercises can help decompress.\n\n◾ Keep naps short and not close to bedtime.\n\n◾ Get as much natural light as you can in the morning. This sets up circadian rhythms and helps with alertness in the morning.\n\n◾ Some sleep researchers have special lights in their homes or software on their computers (f.lux is one) to limit exposure to blue light in the evenings. Blue light is what signals \"morning!\" to the brain.\n\n◾ Have a bedtime routine. This includes turning off devices like phones and bright lights and other stimulating activities for a period of time.\n\n◾ Feel the need for noise? Opt for a fan, not the television, said Dr. James Rowley, president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine board of directors. \"There's no yelling and no car crashes\" on a fan. Even reading can be too stimulating for some.\n\n◾ A phone \"needs to be face down on the side of the bed being charged and it should not be on you,\" Rowley said.\n\nMedications can work but at a cost\n\nDrugs developed as sedatives work pretty well in the short term, Rowley said.\n\nHe worries more about people using drugs designed for other purposes like allergy or cold medicines that have sedation as a side effect. \"That's where a lot of us get upset,\" Rowley said, speaking about the feelings of sleep specialists.\n\nOne patient, who recently came into his office, was taking an \"all-natural\" sleep aid that included about 15 ingredients, all of which might interact with other medications. \"You have to be cautious,\" he said.\n\nMelatonin has not been shown to be effective for insomnia in any research trial. In addition, most people do not use it correctly, using either too high a dose or taking it too close to bedtime to make a difference, Rowley said.\n\n\"If melatonin's going to help you, it's probably going to help at .5 to 3 (mg),\" Rowley said. \"Not that it's great for insomnia, but if it's something you want to try, low doses are probably better than high doses.\"\n\nPlus, Martin said, \"If you have a hard time staying asleep and you're taking melatonin in the evening, it might actually make your problem worse, not better.\"\n\nAt least one new drug therapy is now in late-stage clinical trials, but researchers said they're withholding judgment until they see whether new medications perform better than existing ones or than behavioral changes.\n\nMuch better than medications so far is a kind of talk therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or CBT-I, Martin said.\n\nCBT-I trains people to avoid behaviors and ways of thinking that make their insomnia worse.\n\n\"The way people think and the actions they take are what sustains their insomnia problems,\" Martin said. \"If we can help people get into bed in a better mindset and structure their sleep and wake habits and routines in a way that makes sleep most likely to happen when they're in bed, that seems to get people back on track.\"\n\nWhen to get medical help: sleep apnea\n\nPeople who have true sleep issues need to have them addressed by a specialist, the experts said. Sleep problems are more common with advancing age.\n\nMany physical and mental ailments are associated with sleep problems. People with ADHD, autism, or depression often report problems with sleep, for instance. Getting help with sleep issues may limit other symptoms.\n\nTypically, a sleep issue that lasts more than about three months should be treated, as should sleep apnea, which is often characterized by loud snoring and choking that wakes someone up (and often the person next to them).\n\nOne study followed people with and without sleep apnea for 18 years, starting at age 48. In the group that had sleep apnea, only 58% were still alive at age 66, compared to 94% of those without sleep apnea. That's a 6- or 7-fold increased risk of death, mainly due to heart attack and stroke, \"so it's really important to get it treated,\" Czeisler said.\n\nThe standard therapy, called CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), which uses a machine to keep airways open, can be cumbersome and hard to stick with, but most patients can adjust over time, experts said.\n\nOne widely used brand was recalled in 2021, stigmatizing the industry and confusing patients. Supply chain problems with the microchips used in the devices meant many people went without CPAP machines for long periods. These barriers unfortunately persist and limit treatment of an already complex and hard-to-address condition Robbins said.\n\nOther apnea treatments include implantable devices, which are increasingly being covered by health insurance, and surgery.\n\nBusting myths about sleep\n\nIn a study published in 2020, Robbins and Czeisler, among other experts, weighed in on 20 popular myths about sleep. Robbins recently offered a take on some of the most enduring ones.\n\nFalling asleep anywhere, anytime isn't the sign of a good sleeper. It's the sign of someone who is sleep-deprived.\n\nEvidence suggests seven to nine hours of sleep provides the most optimal health and well-being. People who think they can get away with sleeping less are likely setting themselves up for health problems later on.\n\nOlder adults don't need less sleep than younger ones, though they often get less, because they don't sleep as well and are more likely to have disrupted sleep.\n\nWhen you sleep does matter. Eight hours of shut-eye in the middle of the day are not as restful as eight hours in the darkness, though it's better than less sleep.\n\nLying in bed does not count as time sleeping.\n\nStaying in bed isn't a good idea if you can't fall asleep. Instead, experts suggest changing your environment and doing low-stress activities for a little while before trying again to fall asleep. That doesn't mean picking up your phone or getting work done, but maybe taking a warm shower or doing some stretching until you feel tired.\n\nFinally, experts say, sleep is not a time when the brain is \"turned off.\" The brain is not passive during sleep but instead is actively firing, clearing waste, storing memories and preparing for the day.\n\nIn general, Robbins said, the public has begun to realize sleep is just as important as diet and exercise in maintaining health.\n\n\"Gone are the days of bragging about not getting enough,\" she said.\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Poor sleep at night is associated with poorer health, and naps are not enough to make up for that,” said clinical psychologist Michael Grandner in a statement. Grandner directs the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Clinic at the Banner-University Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona, and was not involved in the study.\n\nStudy participants who typically napped during the day were 12% more likely to develop high blood pressure over time and were 24% more likely to have a stroke compared with people who never napped.\n\nIf the person was younger than age 60, napping most days raised the risk of developing high blood pressure by 20% compared with people who never or rarely nap, according to the study published Monday in Hypertension, an American Heart Association journal. The AHA recently added sleep duration as one of its eight essential metrics to optimal heart and brain health.\n\nThe results held true even after researchers excluded people at high risk for hypertension, such as those with type 2 diabetes, existing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep disorders and who did night-shift work.\n\n“The results demonstrate that napping increases the incidence of hypertension and stroke, after adjusting or considering many variables known to be associated with risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke,” said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\n\n“From a clinical standpoint, I think it highlights the importance for health care providers to routinely ask patients about napping and excessive daytime sleepiness and evaluate for other contributing conditions to potentially modify the risk for cardiovascular disease,” said Zee, who was not involved in the study.\n\nLonger naps are worse\n\nThe study used data from 360,000 participants who had given information on their napping habits to the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource that followed UK residents from 2006 to 2010.\n\nTaking a regular, lengthy nap may be a sign of an underlying sleep disorder, said Dr. Raj Dasgupta of the University of Southern California. globalmoments/Adobe Stock\n\nPeople in the UK study provided blood, urine and saliva samples on a regular basis, and answered questions on napping four times over the four year study. However, the study only collected nap frequency, not duration, and relied on self-reports of napping, a limitation due to imperfect recall.\n\n“They didn’t define what a nap should be. If you’re going to be sleeping for an hour, two hours, for example, that’s not really a nap,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\n“A refreshing power nap that’s 15 to 20 minutes around noon to 2 p.m. is 100% the way to go if you’re sleep deprived,” said Dasgupta, who was not involved in the study. “If you have chronic insomnia we don’t encourage napping because it takes away the drive to sleep at night.”\n\nMost of the people in the study who took regular naps smoked cigarettes, drank daily, snored, had insomnia and reported being an evening person.\n\nMany of these factors could impact a person’s quality and quantity of slumber, Dasgupta said. Poor sleep causes “excessive daytime fatigue which can result in excessive napping during the day,” he said.\n\n“I do believe napping is a warning sign of an underlying sleep disorder in certain individuals,” he added. “Sleep disorders are linked to an increase in stress and weight regulation hormones which can lead to obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes – all risk factors for heart disease.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/02/13/del-doc-bedtime-routines-and-boring-activities-can-help-fall-asleep/319118002/", "title": "Del. doc: Bedtime routines and boring activities can help to fall asleep", "text": "A new study has found that Americans are getting more sleep than they have in more than a decade, but many still struggle to keep the proper amount of shut-eye.\n\nPublished in the medical journal \"Sleep,\" the study found that Americans are getting about 18 more minutes during the weeknights than they did in 2003. Researchers consider this the \"first successes in the fight against sleep deficiency.\"\n\nYet more than one-third of American adults aren't getting enough regular sleep, which is about seven hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHere in Delaware, about 37 percent of adults reported sleeping less than an average seven hours a night, according to America's Health Rankings' 2017 annual report.\n\nThe News Journal spoke with Dr. Shilpa Kauta, the medical director of the Christiana Care Sleep Disorders Center, about easy ways Delawareans can get a better night's sleep.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nDon't stress about getting eight hours\n\nSleep is key to one's overall health and gives your body time to rest, Kauta said. Research shows that a lack of sleep can be connected to a myriad of health problems, including diabetes, depression, heart disease and obesity.\n\nMany people believe the misconception that eight hours is the absolute, set amount of time needed for a good night rest, Kauta said.\n\nBut in reality, some people might be OK with as little as six hours while others might need as much as nine hours, she said. The \"need\" to get eight hours could be anxiety provoking for some people, especially those with busy schedules, and ultimately make it harder for them to fall asleep.\n\nShe recommends people aim for six to nine hours of sleep every night. Anything less than six is not enough, she said.\n\nFor those trying to get more sleep, Kauta recommends increasing their sleep schedule by 15-minute increments every week. This is a more realistic goal to achieve than immediately trying to tackle the big hurdle of getting eight hours, she said.\n\nEstablish a bedtime routine\n\nIf people are looking to get more sleep, Kauta said they need to make it an important part of their life.\n\nThis means establishing a time they need to be in bed every night and then creating a night routine — like you would for a child — about 20 to 30 minutes before that time, she said.\n\nKauta does this in her personal life: She has the goal of going to sleep no later than 11 p.m. every day.\n\n\"It helped me make sleep a priority,\" she said.\n\nShe also recommended using apps focused on sleeping. There are dozens of apps that range from playing white noise while you sleep to sending notifications about when you should start going to bed, she said.\n\n\"They're good motivators,\" Kauta said.\n\nSome of the top sleep apps for the iPhone include Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock, Relax Melodies and AutoSleep Tracker.\n\nTry aromatherapy and phone filters and avoid taking naps\n\nAromatherapy can be a helpful way to \"tune the brain down\" before bedtime, she said.\n\nLavender, particularly, is one of the most calming scents used in aromatherapy and is known to help people fall asleep. She also recommends creating a \"dark and cool environment\" devoid of stimulating factors, such as the bright lights from electronics.\n\nSince scrolling through Instagram and Twitter can be a relaxing activity for some, Kauta advises people change their phone's setting to night mode to help eliminate the \"alerting\" blue color.\n\nAnd if you enjoy taking naps during the day or after work, you might want to reconsider, she said. For those who struggle to fall asleep at night, taking naps can decrease one's sleep drive. It can result in a person being more alert at night and getting less sleep.\n\n\"Naps can be counterproductive,\" she said.\n\nDo something boring right before bed\n\nOne of the most underrated tricks for falling asleep is to engage in a boring activity right before bed, Kauta said.\n\nIf you're lying in bed for longer than 20 minutes and haven't fallen asleep, she recommends getting up and doing a monotonous activity such as folding laundry, doing the dishes or adult coloring.\n\nFocusing on a simple, boring activity can help get people into a \"lull,\" making it easier for them to fall asleep.\n\n\"It seems counterintuitive,\" she said. \"That one helps a lot.\"\n\nContact Meredith Newman at (302) 324-2386 or at mnewman@delawareonline.com.

Without restful sleep, women are more prone to waking up downbeat or mad, recent studies show. And sleepy women have an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes compared with sleep-deprived men.\n\n\"These associations tended to be much more strongly observed in women than in men,\" said Dr. Edward Suarez, a Duke University sleep specialist whose study showed that women are more likely to display worsening mood, anger or hostility after inadequate sleep than men.\n\n\"Sleep is a critical part of your health whether you're a man or woman, but it seems to be critically important for women,\" Suarez said.\n\nLet's face it, beauty sleep is crucial.\n\nTurning to sleep aids\n\nAn estimated 50 million to 70 million Americans can't sleep, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 8.6 million Americans use prescription sleep aids, according to a survey released in August 2013. Women and people older than 50 are most likely to use prescription sleep aids. The study found more Americans struggle to get to sleep and stay asleep than ever before.\n\nWomen are the primary patients of sleep clinics, researchers have said. They're susceptible to debilitating sleep deprivation as new mothers. And to nerve-racking insomnia as they go through menopause. Post-menopause, women are at greater risk for sleep apnea, the disorder in which sleepers unknowingly choke for air.\n\nWomen who have children at home tend to have more sleep issues than women with no children in the household, according to the National Sleep Foundation.\n\nLeslie Swanson, a University of Michigan Behavioral Sleep Medicine Clinic psychologist and specialist in postpartum mental health, helps new mothers learn tricks and habits to deal with the trying schedules of newborns. She specializes in promoting sleep in new mothers without using prescription or over-the-counter medication.\n\nBy following structured sleep tips, a U-M study found new mothers could improve their sleep without medication. It was a small study but with big results that are applicable to all who struggle with sleep.\n\nSwanson's study concentrated on a dozen women with babies less than 1 year old, who were suffering from insomnia and depression. After five sessions of therapy and instruction on sleeping habits, two-thirds of the women showed significant improvement in depression symptoms, said Swanson.\n\n\"Even though they have a baby at home, they can see improvements in their sleep — and their moods get better — after five weeks of treatment,\" she said.\n\nAbout 82% of the women said their insomnia had eased, and the amount of time they spent awake in the middle of the night went from 125 minutes to 49 minutes.\n\nSwanson and her staff challenge the women to change their behaviors and beliefs.\n\nThey ask the women to limit napping and to avoid excessive time in bed tossing and turning. For individuals with insomnia, even the act of going to bed can stimulate hyperarousal and worry about whether sleep will occur, said Swanson.\n\nWhen it comes to sleep, for many with insomnia, she said, \"the bed is a place for anxiety and frustration and worry.\"\n\nWhen you can't sleep, get out of bed and do something else in a quiet, dim room and don't return to bed until you are sleepy, urges Swanson. Recommended activities — reading, knitting, folding laundry, even watching TV in a dark room. But don't turn on all the lights and start re-organizing the catch-all closet.\n\nAmong treatment techniques are relaxation training — instruction on breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation.\n\nSwanson, 34, said she sleeps very well. \"My husband calls me a vampire when I start dimming the lights an hour and a half before bed,\" she said. The dim lighting signals the body's ancient time clock that it's time to sleep.\n\nMenopause issues\n\nIn their middle-age years, women's hormones ride the roller coaster of menopause. That's when women become more susceptible to sleep apnea, when one essentially stops breathing. Risk factors for sleep apnea are hypertension and obesity, but doctors say other women also develop it.\n\nThat's what happened to Nesa Muthleb, 64, of Bloomfield Township. At her high school son's urging after he saw a TV show, the preschool teacher talked to her doctor about whether she might have sleep apnea because she was feeling sluggish and worn. Diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2006, she wore a Darth Vader-like breathing mask, known as a CPAP, with tubing attached to a nightstand console for two years, until she started unconsciously ripping it off in the middle of the night.\n\nA few years ago, she found herself gaining weight she had lost, dead-tired by workday's end and foggy after she woke up in the morning.\n\n\"What do I need to have a productive time in my later 60s,\" she asked herself. To control what she could, Muthleb decided she needed to deal with her sleep apnea. Rediagnosed at Henry Ford Hospital, she's now using a less cumbersome, less comical-looking machine.\n\n\"It's amazing. I have a much smaller machine, and it's much more user-friendly,\" said Muthleb. \"The air flow is calibrated, and there isn't a big blast. There's very little on my face.\n\n\"With the other mask I had to sleep on my back and couldn't turn to either side. Now, whatever position I'm in, I can deal with it. That makes a huge difference.\"\n\n\"I have more energy ... and I don't have that deep, tired look. I think, all over, you feel better about yourself.\"\n\nBetter for beauty\n\nScience has measured that \"deep, tired look\" of the sleep-disturbed.\n\nUniversity of Michigan patients treated for sleep apnea saw scientifically-measured improvements in their facial skin — less redness and forehead puffiness — in a study released last year by University of Michigan sleep specialist Dr. Ronald Chervin.\n\nIn addition, observers who viewed photos of sleep apnea patients, consistently cited the after-treatment images as being more attractive, youthful and alert.\n\nWhile treating sleep apnea has profound implications for overall health — untreated sleep apnea is associated with heart disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, weight gain — Chervin said he now can additionally tout that treatment can improve appearance. His study might motivate more patients to wear the mask, which only about 50% do on a regular basis.\n\nEven with all the evidence about how sleep apnea can harm the heart and other vital functions, some people resist the treatment.\n\n\"How do you get people to pay attention and use it?\" Chervin asked. \"Now we're starting to use the argument — you'll look younger, more attractive and more alert to people who see you.\"\n\nNora Kryza, 56, a credit card account manager, participated in the U-M study. She didn't quite believe her husband when he told her that she snored — snored loud enough to wake him up. She didn't hear it, wasn't bothered by it and slept right away and right through it — or so she thought.\n\nBut when her sister-in-law was diagnosed with sleep apnea, Kryza got curious about the symptoms. She talked to her primary doctor about it, and when she told him about the snoring, the doctor referred her to the University of Michigan sleep clinic.\n\nIt was a two-part study. On the first night, she was observed and monitored with sensors attached to her head, her heart, her torso. They tested muscle twitching, rapid eye movement, brain waves and heartbeats and determined she had obstructive sleep apnea. She spent another night at the clinic being fitted properly for the CPAP mask.\n\nAlthough Kryza participated in the U-M study about how sleep apnea affects appearance, she said she was more concerned about the condition's long-term impact on health.\n\n\"For me, it's not hard. I'm really motivated. For some people, if you're vain, wearing the mask at night makes you feel less than beautiful,\" said Kryza. \"But it makes you look better in the daytime.\"\n\nSleep-inducing advice\n\n-- Skip the nightcap: Contrary to popular lore, that alcoholic nightcap isn't going to help you sleep better.\n\nBut National Sleep Foundation Chairman Christopher Drake, a Henry Ford Hospital sleep specialist and investigator, said a nightcap is often the remedy that many insomniacs turn to first.\n\n\"Alcohol makes you sleep at first, \" said Drake. \"You might sleep well for the first half of the night, but the second half is fragmented. But then you develop a tolerance.\" Also, avoid coffee after 5 p.m.\n\n--Get out of bed: This may seem counterintuitive, but when you can't fall sleep after 30-40 minutes, seek another setting. By staying in your bed, instead of associating it with rest, it can become a \"hyperarousal stimulant.\" Do something calming in dim light.\n\n--Progressive muscle relaxation: This is a good thing to associate with being in bed. Henry Ford Sleep Disorders and Research Center clinic coordinator Cynthia Fellman-Couture narrates a 25-minute MP3 audiotape on how to relax. The instruction explains how to concentrate and isolate muscle groups — how to tense them and to relax them — to promote a sleep-inducing meditative zen.\n\nFor step-by-step audio on how to relax and get better sleep, visit freep.com/beautyrest.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/05/05"}]}

The No. 1 seed Gamecocks (35-3) beat Texas 74-57, and the No. 2 seed Huskies (36-3) beat UCLA 85-51 to advance.\n\nSouth Carolina beat UConn 64-49 in the 2022 final, the only other time they met in the championship game.\n\nUConn handed the Gamecocks a 87-58 loss during the regular season, snapping their 71-game win streak in Columbia, South Carolina. It was also the largest margin in a home loss for South Carolina since 2008.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the rematch.\n\nBattle of the freshmen: Joyce Edwards vs. Sarah Strong\n\nThe championship matchup with feature arguably the two best freshmen in the country. UConn's Sarah Strong and South Carolina's Joyce Edwards both play significant roles for their teams.\n\nIt's no surprise the freshmen have helped lead their teams to the national championship game — there were signs a year ago of the dominance to come. Strong, the No. 1 recruit of the 2024 class, and Edwards, the No. 3 recruit in the 2024 class, were co-MVPs of the McDonald's All-American game last April.\n\nStrong is the second-leading scorer for the Huskies, behind senior star Paige Bueckers. The 6-foot-2 forward averages 16.2 points, 8.7 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 2.3 steals and 1.5 blocks per game. Strong had 22 points, eight rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block Friday.\n\nEdwards leads the Gamecocks in scoring off the bench. The 6-3 forward averages 12.7 points, five rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.1 steals in 21 minutes per game. Edwards bounced back from a three-game slump Friday, logging 13 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and a steal.\n\nBoth players are confident with the ball in their hands and impact every area of the game. How each freshman performs in the first national championship game of their careers will heavily influence the outcome.\n\nCan South Carolina become first repeat champion since 2016?\n\nNo team has repeated as national champions since UConn won four straight titles from 2013-16.\n\nSouth Carolina had the chance to repeat during the 2022-23 season, but it fell in the Final Four. After going undefeated last season en route to their third national championship, the Gamecocks have another opportunity to repeat. They would become only the fourth program in NCAA history to win back-to-back national titles, joining an elite group with USC, Tennessee and UConn.\n\nSome might look at the Final Four results and think UConn will blow out the Gamecocks again. But South Carolina was playing Texas for a fourth time this season, and it still won by 17 points.\n\nSouth Carolina's tournament run hasn't been as dominant as last season's, but the Gamecocks looked like a championship team again as they dismantled Texas on Friday.\n\nWill Paige Bueckers leave UConn with a national championship?\n\nIf UConn doesn't win Sunday, Paige Bueckers would leave the program as the only player to win National Player of the Year and not a national championship. She would be the best player by far to leave UConn without adding to the program's 11 national titles.\n\nBueckers was hampered by injuries throughout her career, and her team as a whole has suffered injuries that prevented championship runs. But now, the Huskies have all the pieces to win a title, and they looked like it when they throttled UCLA on Friday.\n\nBueckers had a slower night offensively against the Bruins, scoring 16 points on 7-for-17 shooting, but she has been on a tear during the NCAA tournament. Going into the Final Four, Bueckers was averaging 29 points on 58.7% shooting. Even with a slower scoring night, Bueckers had 16 points, adding five rebounds, three steals and two assists.\n\nSouth Carolina will have to contain Bueckers, who is more than capable of rising to another level with a championship on the line.\n\nDawn Staley, Geno Auriemma square off in NCAA final again\n\nThe matchup is a clash between one of the original dynasties of women's basketball and the one taking hold in the modern era. It's also a coaching battle between two of the most accomplished coaches in the sport.\n\nUConn coach Geno Auriemma was undefeated in national championship games before losing to South Carolina and Dawn Staley in 2022. He was 11-0 in NCAA finals prior to the loss, and now Staley holds the mantle of being undefeated in national championship games (3-0).\n\nAuriemma holds a 9-5 overall head-to-head record against Staley. South Carolina has won four of the five last matchups with the Huskies, who won the first seven matchups against the Gamecocks under Staley.\n\nAuriemma has won 11 national championships, but hasn't won a title since 2016.

Those are your Final Four teams for March Madness in 2024.\n\nThe favorite to win it all in 2024 remains Dawn Staley's 36-0 Gamecocks, the No. 1 overall seed in the women's tournament. That group, led by Te-Hina Paopao, Kamilla Cardoso and more, is looking to become the first undefeated team in women's college basketball since Geno Auriemma's UConn Huskies last achieved the feat in 2015-16.\n\nClose behind them is fellow 1 seed Iowa, led by star Caitlin Clark, who not only has myriad season and career records for her scoring prowess (including several in Monday's game), but also helped the Hawkeyes vanquish LSU in the Elite Eight. With Iowa's 94-87 victory over Kim Mulkey, Angel Reese and Co., Iowa is back to its second final Four in as many seasons, and third ever.\n\nThen there's UConn, which, despite being a 3 seed, is led by arguably the best player in the country in Paige Bueckers. Geno Auriemma's claim that his player is the best in women's college basketball will be put to the test when they face off vs. Iowa in Friday's semifinal matchup.\n\nLast up: a Wes Moore-coached NC State team that, alongside its men's program, has made history in reaching the Final Four.

Bueckers, Azzi Fudd and Sarah Strong led the way for UConn, combining to outscore the entire South Carolina roster (65-59).\n\nAfter a 17-point outing, Bueckers finishes with 477 career points in the NCAA Tournament, third most all-time. She exited the game with 1:32 left, crying in Auriemma's arms on the sideline.\n\n\"He told me he loved me, and I told him I hated him. So,\" Bueckers said about what Auriemma told her while they hugged. \"No, I love that man like more than words can describe.\"\n\n\"They have all been gratifying, don’t get me wrong. But this one here, because of the way it came about and what’s been involved,\" Auriemma said. \"It’s a long time since I’ve been that emotional when a player has walked off the court.\"\n\nFudd’s 24-point performance put her past the 1,000-point mark for her career, a total she’ll build on when she’s back with the Huskies next season. She was named the game's Most Outstanding Player.\n\nStrong dominated with a 24-point, 15-board double-double, her fourth double-double of this March Madness. She now holds the record for most points in an NCAA Tournament by a freshman and is the first freshman since at least 2010 to record at least four double-doubles in a tournament.\n\n\"There are players that play four years and don't get as much done as she did this year,\" Auriemma said. \"And I mean everywhere. Shooting the ball, handling the ball, finishing at the basket. Eleven rebounds in the first half. There's not a part of the game where she doesn't dominate.\"\n\nWith the win, Bueckers, who is expected to be the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft on April 14, puts a flourish on her spectacular UConn career. Auriemma, in his 40th season, extends his record for most national championships by a college basketball coach.\n\n“This afternoon I went for a walk and as I’m walking outside the hotel at one point I said, ‘Dear God, I don’t need one of these, but damn my players do. Can you do it for them?’\" Auriemma said. \"So I think it means a lot personally that we can still do this after all these years, but I’ve said this 100 times — Tomorrow I get up in the morning and I’m the same person ... but these kids, their lives have changed forever and I’m glad I had a part in that.\"\n\nUSA TODAY brought you live updates, analysis and highlights throughout the game. Check them out below.\n\nPaige Bueckers on winning NCAA championship\n\n“Unreal. Just so much gratitude for everything this program has meant to me, for how much my teammates have meant to me,\" she said after the game. \"I can’t name all the people. Everybody here, it takes a village just to do what we do here. Every one is important to the team success.”\n\n\"I love that man like more than words can describe, and there's a lot of stuff about him that I don't, but it's because he's challenging me and making us all better in ways we never even knew we could,\" Bueckers said of Geno Auriemma. \"And he always has our back. That's the thing, sometimes it feels like he's on you and he has nothing but bad things to say. But he always has belief. He always has your back and just the relationship that we have, I can't even put in the words.\"\n\nWhat Geno Auriemma said after winning 12th national title\n\n\"You just never know if you will be back in this situation again. There were so many times when I think we all questioned if we’ve been here too long,\" Auriemma said, \"and yet we kept hanging in there and hanging in there. It’s because these players. They make me want to hang in there every day. And this team has changed so much from the beginning of the season. If people only knew.\n\n\"We had a preseason scrimmage and we lost the scrimmage. I thought we wouldn’t make the NCAA Tournament. They have all been gratifying don’t get me wrong. But this one here, because of the way it came about and what’s been involved. It’s a long time since I’ve been that emotional when a player has walked off the court.\"\n\nUConn women's basketball national championships\n\nGeno Auriemma has led the Huskies to a record 12 national championships: 1995, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2025. The program recently shared a photo of him wearing his first 11 rings on social media. Auriemma has been at the helm since 1985.\n\nAzzi Fudd stats\n\nUConn guard Azzi Fudd scored 24 points so far on 9-of-17 shooting. She also had five rebounds, three steals and an assist. Fudd entered Sunday's national championship game with 990 career points, and her 13 first-half points vs. South Carolina pushed her past the 1,000-point threshold in 76 career games.\n\nFudd could have reached the milestone sooner, but she missed all but two games in the 2023-24 season after tearing her right ACL at practice. There are now 52-players in UConn's 1,000+ point club, lead by the Huskies' all-time leading scorer Maya Moore (3,036 points). — Cydney Henderson\n\nPaige Bueckers points\n\nUConn guard Paige Bueckers recorded 17 points on 5-of-14 shooting, six rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal. She was 7-of-7 from the free throw line.\n\nBueckers is now third on the NCAA Tournament all-time scoring list (477 points). She passed Maya Moore (476) in the national championship and sits behind Chamique Holdssclaw (479) and Caitlin Clark (492).\n\nSarah Strong stats\n\nUConn freshman Sarah Strong has made some NCAA Tournament history. Her holds the record for most points in a tournament by a freshman (114) and she is the first freshman since at least 2010 to record four double-doubles in a tournament. She finished with 24 points and 15 rebounds against South Carolina.\n\nMaya Moore, Breanna Stewart among stars in Tampa\n\nIt was a star-studded affair at Amalie Arena. The national championship game between UConn and South Carolina brought out many famous faces and alumni. Former Huskies Maya Moore, Breanna Stewart and Stefanie Dolson were in the building, in addition to former Gamecock stars Aliyah Boston and Allisha Gray. Legends Sylvia Fowles and Sheryl Swoopes are also on hand.\n\n“I thank all of my former players that are here,\" Geno Auriemma said after the game. \"You know when you cut down the nets and everybody gets a little piece of it. I wish we had enough nets that all of them got a piece of it, because that’s how much they mean to us.\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nUConn vs. South Carolina score in 3Q\n\nThe Huskies blew open a 62-42 lead by the end of the third quarter. UConn's Azzi Fudd continued to be the hot hand and is up to 24 points. Sarah Strong has a double-double of 17 points and 14 rebounds, and Paige Bueckers has 12 on 3-of-9 shooting.\n\nUConn vs. South Carolina score at halftime\n\nWith 9 seconds left in the second quarter, sophomore guard Ashlynn Shade sunk a 3 to give the Huskies a 36-26 lead at halftime.\n\nUConn's Azzi Fudd recorded a game-high 13 points in the first half, surpassing the 1,000-point mark for her career. Paige Bueckers and Sarah Strong each added eight. South Carolina's Joyce Edwards and Tessa Johnson, who both came off the bench as they usually do, leads the Gamecocks with five points each.\n\nUConn vs. South Carolina score after 1Q\n\nUConn and South Carolina traded leads early in the first quarter, but the Gamecocks ended the frame on a nearly 4-minute scoring drought and the Huskies held a 19-14 advantage.\n\n\"Man, it was a hell of a first quarter, and I'm just tired watching it,\" UConn head coach Geno Auriemma said at the quarter break. \"These guys gotta rebound better. Right now, Sarah's the only one. And I think we can get one or two more opportunities in transition.\"\n\nSouth Carolina women's basketball championships\n\nDawn Staley has led the Gamecocks to three: 2017, 2022, 2024.\n\nSouth Carolina women's basketball roster\n\nThe Gamecocks have depth and defense on their side, ranking first in the nation in bench points per game (40.5) and fifth in blocks per game (5.8). Here's a look at the full South Carolina women's basketball roster.\n\nUConn women’s basketball roster\n\nThe Huskies score 81.7 points per game (ninth in the country) and shoot 51% from the floor, tops in women’s college basketball. In addition to touting Paige Bueckers and her 20 points per game, the Huskies get 16.2 points from Sarah Strong and 13.3 points from Azzi Fudd per game. Here is the full UConn women’s basketball roster.\n\nGeno Auriemma vs. Dawn Staley\n\nUConn coach Geno Auriemma is 12-1 in national championship games and Dawn Staley is 3-1. Auriemma holds a 10-5 overall head-to-head record against Staley. South Carolina has won four of the six last matchups with the Huskies, who won the first seven matchups against the Gamecocks under Staley. — Cora Hall\n\nUConn women's basketball starting lineup\n\nThe Huskies' lineup: G Paige Bueckers, C Jana El Alfy, G Kaitlyn Chen, F Sarah Strong, G Azzi Fudd.\n\nSouth Carolina women's basketball starting lineup\n\nThe Gamecocks' lineup: G Te-Hina Paopao, G Raven Johnson, G Bree Hall, F Chloe Kitts, F Sania Feagin.\n\nPaige Bueckers stats\n\nSuperstar UConn guard Paige Bueckers has been on a tear this March Madness. She dropped three consecutive 30-point games, including a career-high 40-point outing against Oklahoma in the Sweet 16, to average 26.4 points per game during the NCAA Tournament. On the season, she averages 20 points, 4.4 boards, 4.7 assists and 2.2 steals per game and she shoots 53.9% from the floor and 42.4% from 3.\n\nDawn Staley outfit\n\nSouth Carolina head coach Dawn Staley is rocking a black Louis Vuitton track suit, embellished with what looks to be blue pearls.\n\nWhy Sarah Strong could become best UConn player ever\n\nSarah Strong’s mother, Allison Feaster, is a friend and former Charlotte Sting teammate of Dawn Staley's. Staley watched Strong grow up and saw her work up close when the Gamecocks lost to the Huskies in mid-February. She is all the more impressed with the forward, who is averaging a double-double of 18 points and 11 rebounds during the NCAA Tournament and joined Maya Moore as the only freshman in UConn history to score more than 600 points in a season.\n\n“The (basketball) IQ is off the charts,” Staley said Saturday. “The skill set, off the charts. Big play after big play after big play.”\n\n“In the next three years, she might be the best player to come out of UConn,” Staley said.

But this was no ordinary foe. Iowa women's basketball got the same up-close experience every other South Carolina opponent has received this season.\n\nThe Hawkeyes again exited the national championship game forced to find solace in second place, as South Carolina took control for an 87-75 win Sunday afternoon inside Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. Ultimately, Iowa couldn't derail the Gamecocks' unbeaten roll a second time — as it did in last season's Final Four.\n\n\"I'm proud of my team,\" Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. \"Finishing national runner-up two years in a row is an amazing feat. Nobody thought we were going to be here at the beginning of the year, so that makes it pretty special.\n\n\"Always saying goodbye to your seniors is really, really tough. And every time you see a season end it's another chapter closed, and that's tough. But I know we're going to look back on this and be very, very proud of the effort we gave this year.\"\n\nDespite early evidence that Caitlin Clark's final collegiate game would entertain full fairy-tale status, the top-seeded Gamecocks sidestepped that instant turbulence and eventually settled in like the championship squad they've been all season. Iowa had some second-half sparks, but not enough for a magical rally to cap this memorable campaign.\n\nA dominant third quarter gave way to a forceful fourth, when South Carolina firmly flexed its basketball muscle while methodically making Iowa work for every ounce of success.\n\nA two-point Hawkeyes hole midway through the third quarter ballooned to double digits before the final period commenced. An 8-0 Iowa surge in the fourth with South Carolina up 14 could only reinvigorate the Iowa noise momentarily, the same when Iowa climbed within five. Pleas for a riveting Clark finish echoed through the building as she fired away for the final times.\n\nIt didn't materialize, as Iowa went the final four minutes without a point.\n\n\"They're a really good team,\" Clark said. \"We knew they were going to go on runs. By no means, when we started off as hot as we did, did we think we'd be able to hold that lead. That's just what teams do. There's some crazy statistics where South Carolina just outscores everybody in the second half by a ton of points every single game.\n\n\"To me, I'm just proud of our resiliency. We go into the fourth quarter, I think we cut it to five. And we just weren't able to come up with a few stops and a few baskets. That speaks to our team. That's the story it's been all year long. My whole entire career, we never give up. We just keep fighting.\"\n\nClark's last collegiate stat line: 30 points on 10-for-28 shooting, including 5-for-13 from deep, with eight rebounds and five assists. Kate Martin delivered 16 points in her final Iowa action, while double-digit efforts from Sydney Affolter (12 points) and Hannah Stuelke (11 points) kept this championship dream alive as long as possible.\n\nJust as much balance permeated the South Carolina box score. Tessa Johnson led the charge with 19 points while picking up double-figure assistance via Kamilla Cardoso (15 points), Te-Hina Paopao (14 points) and Chloe Kitts (11 points).\n\nEven as the underdog, the thought of this championship spot overwhelming the Hawkeyes came off the table quickly. As Clark operated with career-ending urgency — putting up 18 first-quarter points while draining as many treys as she hit all of Friday night against UConn — Iowa surged out to robust advantages of 13-2 and 20-9 with everyone still settling in.\n\nStill, the scorching start altered little emotion on a locked-in Iowa bench that knew South Carolina was coming. It wasn't surprising to see the Gamecocks storm back, but that anticipation does little to ease the challenge.\n\nSouth Carolina was back even less than two minutes into the second quarter — ahead for the first time with five minutes until the break — as Cardoso finally found a rhythm. A disheartening end to the first half saw the Hawkeyes yield five points in the closing 30 seconds for a 49-46 intermission hole.\n\n\"It's hard to guard 6-foot-7,\" Affolter said. \"We knew rebounding was going to be an issue, and we tried our best boxing out. I think we did play good defense, but the amount of points they had on offensive rebounds caused a problem. They're a great team. Coach Bluder came in and said that's like a professional team.\n\n\"We gave it our all, but South Carolina is an amazing team.\"\n\nThe Gamecocks' first-half finish offered a preview of what was arriving next. Iowa knew four quarters of unwavering intensity was the only way to conquer this challenge. The Hawkeyes couldn't quite muster a productive closing.\n\nPlastered all over the Iowa locker room was the inevitable raw emotion that comes when special seasons have to end. The Hawkeyes again extended this postseason run as long as possible, bringing joy to their supporters and countless others across the nation. That will be appreciated by everyone associated with the Iowa program in due time, even if Sunday's outcome stings tremendously.\n\n\"To be in this position and be with coach Bluder and make it to back-to-back national championships,\" Martin said, \"I just feel super grateful.\"\n\nDargan Southard is a sports trending reporter and covers Iowa athletics for the Des Moines Register and HawkCentral.com.

The game is scheduled to tip off at 8:30 p.m. CT on ESPN.\n\nThe winner will advance to the national championship game.\n\nThe Hawkeyes are 33-4 after beating LSU, 94-87, on Monday, and the Huskies are 33-5 after beating USC, 80-73, on Monday.\n\nHere's a look at what to expect in Friday's game:\n\nWho are UConn women's basketball's best players?\n\nThe Huskies have one of the nation's best players in Paige Bueckers, a former freshman sensation who's returned to prime form this year after missing all of the 2022-23 season because of a knee injury.\n\nShe averages 21.9 points and 4.0 assists per game on 54.3/40.1/83.5 shooting splits. She has size, athleticism and can score from anywhere, making her a worthy matchup with Clark.\n\nAaliyah Edwards is an elite player as well. At 6-foot-3, she has significant size and scoring ability in the paint, which allows her to average 18.2 points and 9.8 rebounds per game on 60.4% shooting. She is a four-year veteran with experience and savvy, but Iowa proved against LSU that it's capable of handling bigger stars.\n\nAshlynn Shade (11.4 PPG) and KK Arnold (8.9 PPG) round out the Huskies' top scorers, but UConn has also lost multiple key players to injury this campaign. That makes its deep postseason run all the more impressive and has everyone on the team extremely motivated to outperform expectations.\n\nUConn women's basketball is a true 'blue blood'\n\nThere is no more historic women's college basketball program than UConn. It is the only team with double-digit national titles, having won 11 from 1995 to 2016 under legendary head coach Geno Auriemma.\n\nWhile the current Huskies players don't have such championship pedigree, they went to a Final Four (2021) and national championship (2022) in the two seasons Bueckers was playing before she missed all of last year.\n\nThere's also something to be said for both Auriemma's extensive coaching expertise and the way in which he's developed his upperclassmen leaders. It's likely that, talent aside, UConn won't be rattled and will deploy a strong game plan on both ends of the floor.\n\nUConn matches up better against Iowa than LSU\n\nLike LSU, UConn doesn't just win, it wins big. The Huskies' 23.5 average margin of victory is second in the nation, only behind undefeated South Carolina. But unlike LSU, which fell victim to a lack of perimeter shooting and one-dimensional play style, UConn is a more malleable group.\n\nUConn is similar to Iowa in many ways: It shares the ball (fourth in the country in assists per game), it can score inside and out, has a superstar guard and has postseason experience. Iowa won't be able to pack the paint and deny post entries as easily as it did against LSU, yet Edwards still presents a mismatch in the paint for Hannah Stuelke and company.\n\nThe Huskies also defend the 3-point line well. Opponents shoot just 28.1% from deep against them, and while that almost certainly won't stop Clark from taking and making triples, that could make the game more difficult on Gabbie Marshall and other role players.\n\nIowa women vs. UConn prediction in March Madness\n\nIowa 88, UConn 83\n\nAccording to BetMGM, Iowa is a 2.5-point favorite over UConn. The over/under is 163.5, and the moneyline is Iowa (-155) and UConn (+125).\n\nThis is a terrific matchup on paper that can go either way. But Iowa gets the slight edge because of how well Clark is playing right now and her teammates repeated ability to follow her lead and rise to the occasion.\n\nThe true X-factor is how Iowa defends Edwards in the paint and if its bigs can avoid getting in foul trouble against her. Iowa did well against Angel Reese in the second half in the Elite Eight, but it was difficult to tell how hampered Reese was by the lower leg injury she suffered in the second quarter. And when more defensive attention was paid to her, her frontcourt mate, Aneesha Morrow, started getting open looks at the rim.\n\nBut Clark has proven she's not the woman to bet against.\n\nGus Martin is a Digital Producer/Content Director for The Des Moines Register.

Chloe Gannon (14), Triniti Ralston (14) and Meredith Raley (13) also finished in double figures scoring.\n\n\"We push hard for offensive rebounds (and) just have a nose for the ball,\" Raley said. \"Whenever we see a loose ball, we're going to get it whenever it's bouncing off that rim.\"\n\nFour Eagles landed on the OVC All-Tournament Team: Raley (MVP), Gannon, Madison Webb and Ali Saunders.\n\nDespite the loss, the Skyhawks (16-16) will receive the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament because USI is ineligible during this four-year probationary period as a Division I program.\n\nSo, USI will accept its automatic bid to the WNIT, which isn’t operated by the NCAA and permits teams who are completing their D-I transition.\n\nThe WNIT’s 48-team field will be announced next Sunday night before it reveals the bracket the following day. First-round games will be played between March 20-22 — perhaps at Screaming Eagles Arena.\n\nUSI is peaking at the right time and embracing each opportunity of leaving it all out on the floor.\n\n\"If today was the end, that would be a shame,\" Stein said. \"I'm not sad right now. I'm happy. This group has earned the chance to play more. We get to practice this week and hit the court again. Can't wait for Selection Sunday to find out what's going to happen with this basketball team.\"\n\nSaturday is a day the USI faithful won't forget.\n\n\"It's definitely nice to bring in a large crowd to Screaming Eagles Arena, on the road and here at the Ford Center especially,\" Raley said. \"There was a lot of red and blue in the stands.

Once in the tournament, it has to win six consecutive games against the best competition in the country and in highly pressurized environments that can cause even the most talented and experienced players to crumble.\n\nOne team from a single school clearing all those hurdles is enough of a challenge.

Well, that’s even rarer.\n\nStill, NC State is tantalizingly close to doing so.\n\nWith a pair of Elite Eight victories Sunday, the Wolfpack’s men’s and women’s basketball teams advanced to the Final Four, putting each team two wins away from their sport’s ultimate prize.

The Huskies captured both the men’s and women’s NCAA titles in 2004 and 2014.\n\nIn 2004, UConn’s basketball teams combined to go 64-10, with the men defeating Georgia Tech in the championship game while the women got past rival Tennessee in their title matchup. Both teams were 2 seeds that year.\n\nTen years later, the Huskies replicated the accomplishment, with one of the two champions being a little more surprising than the other. While the women, with eight future WNBA players on their roster, won each NCAA Tournament game by at least 15 points on their way to a 40-0 season, the men, as a 7 seed that entered the event with a 26-8 record, became the second-lowest seed to ever win a title, behind only 8 seed Villanova’s championship in 1985.\n\nHas a school ever made the men’s and women’s basketball championships in the same year?\n\nA school’s men’s and women’s basketball teams have made the NCAA championship game in the same year four times, going back to 1982, when the NCAA assumed governing power over women’s college basketball.\n\nIn addition to UConn in 2004 and 2014, Louisville did so in 2013 and Duke did so in 1999. The Cardinals’ men’s team defeated Michigan in the national championship game (a win later vacated by the NCAA following an investigation into the school’s escort scandal) while their women’s team lost to UConn. Both of the Blue Devils’ teams lost in the title game in 1999, falling to UConn on the men’s side and Purdue on the women’s side.\n\nHas a school ever made the men’s and women’s Final Four in the same year?\n\nThere have been 15 instances of a school’s men’s and women’s teams reaching the NCAA Final Four in the same year, with NC State and UConn becoming the newest members of that exclusive club.\n\nHere is a list of the schools that have done so:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/31"}]}

Dr. José Romero, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, noted that the majority of people with polio don’t have symptoms and so can spread the virus without knowing it.\n\n“There are a number of individuals in the community that have been infected with poliovirus. They are shedding the virus,” he said. “The spread is always a possibility because the spread is going to be silent.”\n\nA team of CDC disease detectives traveled last week from agency headquarters in Atlanta to Rockland County, and they are “quite nervous” that polio “could mushroom out of control very quickly and we could have a crisis on our hands,” said a community health leader who has met with the team.\n\n“They are – what is the opposite of cautiously optimistic?” said another community leader, an expert in vaccine education, who has also met with the CDC team in Rockland County. Both leaders requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nPolio can cause incurable paralysis and death, but most people in the US are protected, thanks to vaccination. Others, however, may be vulnerable to the virus for a variety of reasons.\n\nUnvaccinated and undervaccinated people are vulnerable, and polio vaccination rates in Rockland County and neighboring Orange County, just north of New York City, are about 60%, compared with 93% nationwide, by age 2. Immune-compromised people can be vulnerable even if they are fully vaccinated.\n\nRomero said the CDC is considering a variety of options to protect people from polio, including offering children in the area an extra shot of the vaccine, as UK health authorities are doing now in London, or recommending extra doses to certain groups of adults.\n\n“We’re looking into all aspects of how to deal with this. At this point, we don’t have a definitive answer,” he said.\n\nA ‘silent killer’\n\nThe Rockland County polio case is the first identified in the United States in nearly a decade.\n\nThe virus has also been detected in sewage in Rockland County and neighboring Orange County. The positive samples were genetically linked to the individual case, but no other cases in the US have been reported.\n\nAbout 3 in 4 people infected with polio don’t have symptoms, but they’re still capable of spreading the virus to others, according to the CDC. Among the rest, most have symptoms such as a sore throat or headache that could easily be overlooked or confused with other illnesses. Only a relatively small number, about 1 in 200 infected people, become paralyzed. A few of those who are paralyzed die because they can’t breathe.\n\nIn the late 1940s, polio outbreaks disabled an average of more than 35,000 people a year in the US. A vaccination campaign started in 1955, and cases quickly plummeted. Today, a full round of childhood polio vaccinations – four doses between 2 months old and 6 years old – is at least 99% effective, according to the CDC.\n\nBut in recent decades, some small groups have not vaccinated their children against the virus. One of them is within the ultraorthodox Jewish community in New York, including in Rockland County.\n\nMuch of the rest of the religious Jewish community in Rockland County has rallied around efforts to educate the “outliers” who refuse to vaccinate, the community health leader said.\n\n“This is a silent killer, like carbon monoxide, and we don’t know when it will hit us,” she said.\n\n‘A press release is not going to cut it’\n\nThe vaccine educator said the CDC team has been intent on learning the best ways to communicate with members of this community, who tend not to use the internet and instead get a lot of their information from the messaging platform WhatsApp as well as community newspapers.\n\nThis week, Rockland County and local health-care providers distributed an infographic in several languages, including Yiddish, that announced, “Polio is spreading in Rockland County.”\n\nThe vaccine educator in Rockland County said that at the meetings with the CDC team, “we spoke about the need for messaging that resonates, and a press release is not going to cut it.”\n\nDr. Mary Leahy, CEO of the largest health-care provider in Rockland County, Bon Secours Charity Health System, a member of WMCHealth, has attended meetings with the CDC and said that to get people who are not vaccinating their children against polio to understand the severity of the disease, “I turn to the grandparents and the great-grandparents who actually lived through the days of polio in the ’40s and ‘50s.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat makes sense to Romero.\n\n“I grew up in Mexico. I saw this disease, the complications,” he said. “I went to school with children that had braces.”\n\nHe said many Americans don’t recognize the “devastating” effects of “lifelong paralysis” from polio.\n\n“I think most of the American public has never seen a case of polio. People have lost that fear, if you will, of the disease.”", "authors": ["Elizabeth Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}]}

It resembles the raccoon because it has dark facial markings that contrast with its yellowish brown coat, but it does not have a ringed tail.\n\nThey are native to eastern Siberia, northern China, North Vietnam, Korea and Japan, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It’s illegal to sell or breed raccoon dogs in the United Kingdom because they’re considered an invasive risk to species in Europe, according to the charity, and they must be kept in a secure location.\n\n'He was coming right at me': Alligator encounters are on the rise in Florida\n\nMandy Marsh, 53, and her husband Dale, 54, told British online newspaper The Independent that one of the animals attacked their pet goat and pony. The couple heard the animal making noise in their field and grabbed planks of wood to chase it off, according to the newspaper.\n\n“It was actually terrifying,” Marsh told the outlet. “It was absolutely crazy. It was hissing and screaming and snarling. It was going absolutely mad.”\n\nAfter two hours, the couple finally got rid of the creature, but their pets were left with scratches from the attack, The Independent reported.\n\nPolice advised anyone who spots the animals to call emergency services and report the sightings.\n\nContributing: John Buffone, York (Pa.)

Lasers may be the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter dealing with thousands of crows roosting in downtown, Sunnyvale, California, for years, the city is taking a note from nearby Silicon Valley and going high-tech with lasers.\n\nMayor Larry Klein told CNN crows have roosted in the downtown area for generations, but during the pandemic the numbers have grown. The birds have become a problem for restaurants and other businesses, as well as a noise nuisance for the residential areas.\n\nWhen it comes to eating outdoors, “I’ll go inside unless I’m under an umbrella,” resident Frank Hampton told CNN affiliate KGO-TV. “Thing is, they’re not here during the day, it’s just at night. It’s just when they start coming around when the sun goes down.”\n\nThe city has tried everything to get the birds to find a new spot, but all success has been short lived.\n\n“We have had a falcon previously, a hawk, but it has had limited success and the crows return,” Klein said.\n\nReflectors were also a failure, given the crows tend to congregate at night. Now, the town is moving to laser pointers.\n\n“The cost of bringing in a falconry person is actually fairly high long term, and here we are mainly talking about a $20 solution and some staff time, to have a pilot program to try to resolve the problem,” Klein explained.\n\n“It’s a health problem we’ve had to deal with, and at the cost of the city, so if we have a cheap solution, there’s no reason to try it, right?” Klein said.\n\nThe mayor got the idea from a friend who has been using a green laser to disperse birds squawking in his yard. He learned other towns with bird problems were using the same technique, since it is deemed safe by the Humane Society of the United States.\n\nThe program will start at the end of the month. City staff and residents will be armed with the lasers in hopes of success.\n\n“If the green lasers don’t work by themselves, then we start looking at the sound of crows in distress or other opportunities that present themselves, but this is the first step in trying to deal with the birds,” Klein said.\n\nHowever, not everyone is a fan of trying the technique. The Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society told Klein they are worried the lasers will blind the birds and cause harm to humans and aircraft. They want the city to continue exploring other options.", "authors": ["Lauren M.

As mercury levels in Moscow hit record-breaking highs in June, the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was reaching a “point of no return”\n\nIn August, Boris Johnson described the latest global assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a “wake-up call to the world”. The “most comprehensive” climate report from the panel issued a “code red for humanity”, said The Independent, and stated the link between global warming and the increased rate and severity of extreme weather events.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Record-breaking snowfall, Madrid\n\n(Image credit: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images)\n\nIn the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.\n\n2. Storm Christoph, UK\n\n(Image credit: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images)\n\nThe period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.\n\n3. Cyclone Ana, Fiji\n\n(Image credit: Leon Lord/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.\n\n4. Winter storms, Texas\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.\n\n5. Dust storm, China\n\n(Image credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nFlights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\n6. Flooding, New South Wales\n\n(Image credit: Jenny Evans/Getty Images)\n\nIn March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\n7. Cyclone Seroja\n\n(Image credit: Alfred Ike Wurin/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades”.\n\n8. Record temperatures, Moscow\n\n(Image credit: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.\n\n9. Heat dome, Pacific Northwest\n\n(Image credit: Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\n\nSoaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”. Lytton, a village in Canada’s British Columbia, was “engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire” as a result of the temperatures, National Geographic continued.\n\nBlistering Pacific Northwest temperatures should act as a wake-up call\n\n10. Bootleg fire, Oregon\n\n(Image credit: Payton Bruni/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA “heavier-than-normal start to the US wildfire season” saw “one of the largest blazes in Oregon’s history” consume more than 364,000 acres of land, the BBC reported in July. More than 2,000 firefighters tackled the wildfire, which took more than a month to contain. The fire “generated its own weather system”, noted Oregon Live, and thousands of homes were threatened by the blaze, which saw residents temporarily housed in evacuation centres in the state.\n\n11. Flooding, west Germany\n\n(Image credit: Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFloods destroyed homes and bridges along the River Ahr in July, while in the German village of Schuld, water “engulfed streets and swallowed homes” CNN reported. Victims will be supported by a government-approved €400 million recovery package, as ministers have promised to move quickly on rebuilding affected areas, Euronews reported. A study by World Weather Attribution found that this event was between 1.2 and nine times more likely to happen in 2021 compared to pre-industrial periods.\n\n12. Flooding, China\n\n(Image credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMore than 300 people died when China’s Henan province experienced severe rainfall and flooding in July. Twelve people lost their lives in a Zhengzhou metro train, with survivors describing how water leaked through the carriage’s doors until it became difficult to breathe. While the country typically experiences flooding in the summer months, this year’s occurrence was “exacerbated by rapid urbanisation, conversion of farmland and the worsening climate crisis, as well as overwhelmed flood mitigation systems,” The Guardian reported.\n\n13. Wildfires, Greece\n\n(Image credit: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHuge wildfires “ravaged” large regions of southern Europe in August, claiming lives in Greece, Turkey and Italy, The Guardian reported. The blaze came as a heatwave swept the region, and Greece’s second largest island - Evia - was evacuated. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis apologised for the blazes, and said that more than 580 fires have broken out in the past seven days. More than 20 countries offered to send firefighting resources, and the “camaraderie” that’s developed between Greek and British firefighters “is testament to the scale of the job before them”, Sky News reports.\n\n14. Hurricane Ida, US\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nMore than one million homes and businesses were left without power in the southern US states of Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane Ida made landfall on 29 August, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Ida hit with maximum sustained winds of 150mph. It was later downgraded to a tropical depression, and moved from a category four storm to category one. “Katrina followed a similar trajectory”, Sky News said. In the following days, Storm Ida moved up the northern-eastern coast of America. Subway stations and roads were flooded in New York, where the lives of at least nine people - including that of a two-year-old boy - were claimed by the storm. For communities in New Orleans, Ida has brought “painful reminders of the death and devastation” caused by the 2006 hurricane which killed more than 1,800 people, The New York Times reported.\n\n15. Monsoon floods, India and Nepal\n\n(Image credit: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSeveral Nepalese regions and two Indian states were hit by “heavy late monsoon rains” in October, Reuters reported. “Deadly flash floods” took the lives of more than 180 people as “homes were submerged or crushed by rocks”, said the BBC. The Nepalese government committed to giving each of the victims’ families $1,700 (£1,220) in response.\n\nThe unseasonal rainfall was attributed to the climate crisis, but some experts indicated that hydro-power projects in the Himalayas, and “excessive and often unchecked construction on steep slopes”, had contributed to the damage caused to the region’s “fragile ecology”, said the broadcaster.\n\n16. Tornadoes, Kentucky\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden said that Kentucky had experienced “one of the largest tornado outbreaks in US history”. More than 30 tornadoes “tore through” Kentucky and seven other states, claiming the lives of at least 90 people, and leaving thousands of residents homeless, said Sky News.\n\nThe state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said that this was “the most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky’s history”.\n\nTwo brothers, aged 15 months and three months old, were placed in a bathtub before being carried away by the severe winds. Their grandmother, Clara Lutz, later learned that both boys had been found alive in her garden under the upturned bath.\n\nBiden’s infrastructure bill has allocated billions of dollars to climate resilience projects, in the hope of strengthening infrastructure and defence against future extreme weather events.\n\n17. Typhoons, Philippines\n\nThe Philippine Red Cross described “complete carnage” in coastal areas of the country after Super Typhoon Rai “sent some 400,000 people running for safety” on 16 December, said the BBC. Thousands of military and service personnel were working to assist with search and rescue efforts in the worst-hit areas.\n\nWinds of around 120mph ripped through the nation’s south-eastern islands, injuring at least 500 people. A further 375 people are known to have died. “There are some areas that look like it has been bombed worse than World War Two,” Red Cross chair Richard Gordon told the BBC.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "David Faris", "The Week Us", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Devika Rao", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/10/23/halloween/17769591/", "title": "Your guide to Halloween happenings in Central Jersey", "text": "Angela Wyatt and Bradley W.

After years of separation following wildly divergent paths, they must finally confront how their traumatic secret has irrevocably shaped their lives.\n\nThe film is written and directed by Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr. (who is Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians), marking his feature film debut. It is produced by Oklahoman Blake Pickens (“The Land”) and Thomas Mahoney (“The Girl in the Photographs”).\n\nThe line producer is Edgar Rosa (“Brand New Old Love”), and executive producers are Eisenberg, Eric Tavitian, Katy Bettner, Lesli Masoner, Dan McClung, Niraj Bhatia, Joel Michaely and Oklahoman Brent Ryan Green.\n\nThe film was supported by the Sundance Institute through the Writers and Directors Labs, and a large majority of the crew were current and former Oklahoma residents.\n\nWild Indian LLC, in association with the Oklahoma Film + Music Office, announced the completion of principal photography on the film in February. (Eisenberg attracted early attention for the project locally when he attended an Oklahoma City Thunder game alongside OKC Mayor David Holt in November 2019.)\n\nGreyeyes, who is Plains Cree, plays a man who has left his tribal reservation to become an accounting executive, while Eisenberg plays his right-hand man and sole ally in both his personal and professional life, Variety reported last year.\n\n\"Wild Indian\" continues a streak for Oklahoma's burgeoning film industry, marking the fourth straight year that a movie made primarily in the Sooner State will make its bow at Sundance. As previously reported, the acclaimed family drama \"Minari,\" which filmed in fall 2019 in Tulsa, debuted at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, where it earned both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award in the U.S. Dramatic Competition.\n\nAlso as previously reported, the period drama \"To the Stars\" premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, while Paul Dano's directorial debut \"Wildlife,\" starring Oscar nominees Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal, bowed at Sundance 2018. Both those films lensed primarily in the Enid area.\n\nIn addition, Oscar-nominated English writer-director Sean Ellis' (\"Anthropoid\") period horror movie \"Eight for Silver\" will make its world premiere at Sundance 2021. Producers on the project include Pete Shilaimon, Ellis and Liddell, a Norman native and University of Oklahoma graduate whose numerous producing credits include \"Anthropoid,\" \"The Grey\" and \"Jackie.\"\n\n\"Eight for Silver\" is set in the late 1800s, as a man arrives in a remote country village to investigate an attack by a wild animal. Instead, he discovers a much deeper, sinister force that has both the manor and the townspeople in its grip.\n\nThe cast includes Boyd Holbrook (\"Logan\"), Kelly Reilly (TV's \"Yellowstone\"), Alistair Petrie (\"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\"), Roxane Duran (\"The White Ribbon\") and Aine Rose Daly (Amazon Prime's \"Hanna\").\n\nAlso, the animated short film \"Ghost Dogs,\" directed and co-written by former Oklahoma City artist Cappa, is among the 50 shorts chosen from 9,933 submissions to play in the 2021 festival. Co-written by J.W. Hallford, \"Ghost Dogs\" is a mind-bending horror short that centers on a family's new rescue pup as it is terrorized by deceased pets. Now based in Denver, Cappa is an animator, cinematographer and actor.\n\nAs previously reported, the six-day 2021 Sundance Film Festival will be offered digitally via a custom-designed online platform at festival.sundance.org, alongside drive-ins, independent arthouses and a network of local community partnerships in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe nonprofit Circle Cinema is the official Satellite Screen for the festival in Tulsa and will serve as the only venue in several surrounding states. Twelve festival films will screen alongside programming from local directors and artists from Jan. 28-Feb. 2.\n\nFilm titles and showtimes will be announced in the coming weeks. Circle Cinema members will have access to an exclusive ticket pre-sale window on Jan. 4. Tickets will be available for the general public beginning Jan. 7.

There’s an open mic — with ice cream — at the end.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/magnolia/entertainment/2018/10/26/20-best-vampire-and-werewolf-movies-all-time-scary-halloween-horror/1731865002/", "title": "The 20 best vampire and werewolf movies of all time", "text": "Dustin Whitlock\n\nSpecial to the Clarion Ledger\n\nWhile ghosts and ghouls reign supreme in the scariest movies of all time, the monsters of the old world have not gone out of style on Halloween night, and this list of the 20 best vampires and werewolf movies has few modern takes on the classic beasts. The list stretches from the nearly lost “Nosferatu” to the king of Spanish werewolf movies, Paul Naschy. The list is dominated by vampires because of the dearth of great werewolf movies, but the ones that are great are strong enough to challenge the best vampire movies for the top spots, and a couple of choices feature both tribes of the moon.\n\n20. Subspecies (1991)\n\nThis is the first film on the list to draw inspiration from the vampire in the 1922 \"Nosferatu,\" with long fingers, monstrous facial features and the ability to move in shadows. “Subspecies” is a film by Full Moon, a studio that produced many low-budget exploitation monster movies (known for featuring stop-motion animation) which went straight to video store shelves in the 1990s. This one is a must-see for filming on location in Romania.\n\n19. Fright Night (1985)\n\nCharley’s new neighbor is a vampire. Desperate for help, he visits fictional vampire movie icon Peter Vincent (a parody of actors Peter Cushing and Vincent Price) to try to get him to help him dispatch his neighbor. Vincent isn’t convinced, but later in the film, he sees that Charley’s neighbor gives no reflection in a mirror. Horrified, Vincent flees to his apartment and the quest is put in peril.\n\n18. Underworld (2003)\n\n“Underworld” mixes the martial arts-heavy vamp action of “Blade” with massive werewolves and tells a story of a centuries-old war between the tribes. A lot of silver bullets fly and we get an answer to the question of what happens when you're bitten by both a werewolf and a vampire. The 2006 sequel delivers more comic book action and the pinnacle of practical monster effects in the genre with a winged vampire and an animatronic white werewolf.\n\n17. Horror of Dracula (1958)\n\nIt was Christopher Lee’s first outing as Dracula and the first time the novel was adapted in color. This version diverges from the plot of the novel with Jonathan Harker coming to Castle Dracula under the guise of serving as a librarian but with the secret agenda to kill Dracula while he sleeps in his crypt. Harker fails and is turned into a vampire, and Dr. Van Helsing, played by Peter Cushing, must dispose of his friend and face Dracula alone.\n\n16. Dracula (1931)\n\nThe most iconic portrayal of Count Dracula will always be Bela Lugosi’s version of the bat-man. His tightly swept back, jet black hair and long, gothic cape have been emulated in numerous versions of the character over the years, from the costume and hair design of Christopher Lee in the role in Hammer’s movies to blaxploitation spoof “Blacula.” Lugosi’s accent is repeated by Gary Oldman in his version of the character in Francis Ford Coppola’s adaptation of the book. “Dracula” is the keystone of all versions of the Dracula story. Without it, like Universal’s “Wolf Man,” you are missing a piece in your horror literacy.\n\n15. The Company of Wolves (1984)\n\nThis anthology film is a collection of fairy tales about werewolves told within a dream (so it’s a story within a story within a story). The dream is set in an 18th-century European forest and centers around a teen girl who is dressed in a red cloak with a hood sewn by her grandmother. The story is an adaptation of “Red Riding Hood,” expanded with the short stories about men whose eyebrows meet and who are hairy on the inside. The story arrives at the well-known end of the fairy tale, at grandmother’s house, with the girl discovering a werewolf waiting for her inside.\n\n14. Black Sabbath (1964)\n\nBoris Karloff joins his peer Lugosi on the list with the anthology film “Black Sabbath” whose final story tells of a traveler who lodges in the home of strangers for the night when a vampire comes home. The patriarch of the house, played by Karloff, is suspected to be dead, but returns late, disheveled and with a distant, angry stare. He has been turned into a vampire. It’s a colorful throwback to the golden age of horror and starring one of the era’s icons.\n\n13. Salem’s Lot (1979)\n\nBased on the Stephen King novel of the same title, the television adaptation of “Salem’s Lot” followed the theme of foreign invasion from “Dracula” with a foreign vampire moving into a small, American town. The mundanely named, Mr. Barlow, is the runaway champion for the scariest looking vampire in all of film, with a bald head, yellow eyes, blue skin and fanged incisors. The design of the adaptation draws inspiration from “Nosferatu” and updates the style for the grindhouse generation of horror.\n\n12. Lost Boys (1987)\n\nThe movie is about a single mom and her two sons who move back to her coastal California hometown which is infested with vampires. This is Corey Haim’s first film on the list, and it was his first teaming with the actor he would become inseparable from in his acting career, Corey Feldman.\n\nThe youngest son, played by Haim, befriends two teens, one of which is played by Feldman, who are obsessed with horror movies and vampires that they claim live in their town. Their suspicions are confirmed when the older brother of Haim’s character is turned into a bloodsucker and leads them to where the vamps sleep.\n\n11. Curse of the Werewolf (1961)\n\nThe lone Hammer werewolf film and the oldest wolf on the list, “Curse of the Werewolf” is loosely based on Guy Endore’s 1933 novel “The Werewolf of Paris.”\n\nThe werewolf doesn’t transform until an hour into the film and we don’t see the makeup until the final act, but it’s worth the wait. Oliver Reed’s intense eyes and the unique makeup make this a wolfman that cannot be confused with any other (though 1975’s “Legend of the Werewolf” tried to copy it). Reed gives a physical performance that you don’t see in other werewolf movies, climbing up the faces of buildings, running along the flashings and leaping from roofs to the ground (nothing but ground). The more you know about stunts, the more suspenseful the scene is to watch as you realize the actor (or stunt performer) could have died at any point.\n\n10. Silver Bullet (1985)\n\nA series of murders happen in the small town of Tarker Mill. Corey Haim plays a wheelchair-bound kid named Marty who believes the murders were committed by a werewolf. When Marty sneaks out at night to shoot fireworks in the woods, the werewolf comes for him and Marty shoots a rocket into its eye. The next day, Marty’s sister is collecting bottles to recycle when she sees the local priest wearing a bandage over his eye. Convinced that he is a werewolf and with the help of their uncle, they have a silver bullet forged.\n\n9. Let the Right One In (2008)\n\nThis Swedish film is about a vampire who is stuck as a young girl and requires someone to kill for her and take care of things she cannot in the body of a child such as pay bills and rent an apartment. The title is a reference to the natural law that prevents a vampire from entering a dwelling without permission.\n\nWhen the vampire’s companion is caught, she visits him in the hospital and kills him. The boy next door takes over as her familiar, protecting her in the day, and they run away together. There is an American remake titled “Let Me In.” Don’t bother with it though. Look up the Swedish original.\n\n8. Nosferatu (1922)\n\nThis is the earliest adaptation of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula,” but the silent film changes the name of the title character to Count Orlok in an attempt to sidestep being accused of producing an unlicensed adaptation of Stoker’s work. The name change wasn’t enough to shake the legal challenge and all copies of the film were ordered destroyed. The story goes that only one survived and was smuggled to the United States (like a vampire on a ship) where it was safe from European copyright laws. The unusual appearance of the actor portraying the vampire is echoed in multiple films on this list. There is a 1979 remake titled “Nosferatu the Vampyre” and a new remake that is currently in production. In 2000, the film “Shadow of the Vampire” portrayed a fictional history of the production of the silent era film based on the legend that the actor playing Orlok was a true vampire (thus his grotesque features).\n\n7. Blade (1998)\n\n“Blade” is based on a comic book by Marvel Comics and was the first among the comic book company’s massive catalog of characters to achieve theatrical release. The title character is a black American vampire-human hybrid who is invulnerable to daylight and able to control his hunger for blood with a serum. Wesley Snipes was born for this role and continues to be a fan-favorite to reprise the role in a potential Disney-Marvel produced revamp of the franchise (in a separate universe from the Marvel Cinematic Universe).\n\n6. Night of the Werewolf (1981)\n\nThere are 12 Paul Naschy werewolf movies, but there can be only one on the list. The honor goes to the remake of Naschy’s most famous wolfman movie and one of the best of the best bad movies ever, 1971’s “The Werewolf vs the Vampire Woman.”\n\nThree friends go on vacation to Romania to explore a castle crypt, but one of the girls plans to bring Elizabeth Bathory back from the dead. Exploitative, filled with gratuitous nudity and a literal shower of blood; “Night of the Werewolf” is a lost gem of 80s horror.\n\nThe vampires are not the only ones returned from the grave — the werewolf Waldemar Daninsky has also been resurrected when the silver cross was pulled from his heart. As the original, in your face title of the 1971 film tells you, you’re in for a vampire on werewolf brawl at the end.\n\n5. Let’s Scare Jessica to Death (1971)\n\nJessica suffers from a hallucinatory mental illness and has been in an institution. The film opens with Jessica, her husband and his friend driving in a hearse to a country house which they hope will help her stay stable. There is a vagrant woman with red hair living at the house when they arrive and they decide to let her stay.\n\nIt seems at first that the film is a ghost story and halfway through the movie we learn about a bride that lived in their home and drowned in the cove behind the house. But the redhead turns out to be a vampire (one unaffected by daylight like Dracula). The ambiance of the wind, eerie piano score and natural lighting make it one of the scariest vampire movies.\n\n4. The Howling (1981)\n\nThis monster flick is based on the book “The Howling” by Gary Brander resurrected the werewolf genre in the 1980s and introduced a new kind of wolf that has the head of a wolf but walks upright.\n\nA female news anchor is attacked and her therapist recommends that she and her husband attend a retreat in the woods that the doctor runs. The retreat is actually a colony of werewolves. The news anchor escapes with the help of a friend who comes to her rescue with a rifle and silver bullets, but during their escape she is bitten. The film ends with her transforming live on television during the evening news.\n\n3. Interview with the Vampire (1994)\n\nBeginning almost a century before Stoker’s novel and set in the American South, “Interview” is based on the Anne Rice novel of the same title. It explores the mundane, practicalities of being a vampire, how to make money and get away with weekly murder. It also looks at the idea of people trapped with each other’s company for the foreseeable eternity ahead and explores sexual taboos. Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt were cast for their hyperbolically handsome faces and statuses as Hollywood sex symbols to play the fabulous, bisexual vampire lovers. The subtext of their relationship, as well as a relationship between Pitt’s character and Kirsten Dunst’s character who is permanently frozen in childhood as a vampire, is less explicit in the film than the novel but still legible if you look.\n\n2. Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1994)\n\nThis may be ranked Francis Ford Coppola’s greatest film when historians look back in a 100 years. The adaptation is the most faithful version of “Dracula,” preserving the themes of feminism and xenophobia of Jewish immigrants in Britain in the period, with Dracula portrayed as the film’s dark hero who comes from a foreign land with a foreign tongue to overthrow British society and free women from the patriarchy. Coppola references both the silent era “Nosferatu” and the golden age films of Universal with expressionist sets, the wandering shadow of the vampire, early film techniques and the casting of American actors in the roles of the Brits, Mina and Jonathan Harker, as was done with old Hollywood movies.\n\n1. An American Werewolf in London (1981)\n\n“American Werewolf” is the scariest werewolf of all. It begins with a pair of American 20-somethings back-packing in the England. They encounter an unseen animal out in the moors in the night—the werewolf circles the adventurers and audience through the surround sound speakers and then it strikes, killing one and infecting the other before the locals shoot the werewolf dead. The injured man awakens to find he is haunted by the ghoulish, decaying ghost of his dead friend who informs him that he is a werewolf now.\n\nDustin Whitlock is a freelance writer for theClarion Ledger and Scott County Times.

Fire also forced the state railway company to suspend service between Madrid and Galicia.\n\nMore than 70,000 hectares have been destroyed in Spain because of fires this year, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday. “Seventy-thousand hectares, to give you an idea, is almost double the last decade’s average,” he said.\n\nThe heat wave in Portugal has intensified a pre-existing drought and sparked wildfires in central parts of the country, including in the village of Memoria, in the Leiria municipality. Paulo Cunha/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nThe country’s Carlos III Health Institute on Monday estimated a cumulative total of more than 510 heatwave-related deaths in the country, based on statistical calculation of excess deaths.\n\nHundreds have also died in neighboring Portugal, where sweltering temperatures exacerbate a severe drought.\n\nOn Saturday, Portugal’s Health Ministry said 659 mainly elderly people had died in the previous seven days, Reuters reported.\n\nAn elderly couple also died Monday after their vehicle overturned while fleeing wildfires in northern Portugal, the country’s state broadcaster RTP reported.\n\nIn total, over 1,100 people are thought to have died due to the ongoing heatwave in southern Europe.\n\n‘Peak of intensity’\n\nThe blistering heat wave is expected to peak early this week.\n\nAs the heatwave moves across the country, French capital Paris is expected to reach 39 degrees Celsius (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday.\n\nIn the UK – where Monday’s temperatures reached 38.1 degrees in eastern England’s Santon Downham, making it the third hottest day on record – officials warned things would likely get worse.\n\nThe head of the UK's Met Office said the country could experience the \"hottest day\" on record Monday. Alberto Pezzali/AP\n\nTuesday is “expected to be even hotter,” according to the Met Office’s CEO, Penelope Endersby.\n\n“It’s tomorrow that we’re really seeing the higher chance of 40 degrees and temperatures above that,” Endersby told BBC Radio on Monday.\n\n“Even possibly above that, 41 is not off the cards. We’ve even got some 43s in the model but we’re hoping it won’t be as high as that.”\n\nIn France, the heat wave is expected to move away from the western part of the country on Tuesday, heading toward the center and eastern part instead, including Paris.\n\nBelgium’s Royal Meteorological Institute (KMI/IRM) has issued a “code red” weather warning for heat in two provinces on Tuesday, forecasting temperatures up to 40 Celsius in the west and southwest.\n\n“With such very high temperatures certain measures will be necessary: drink regularly, wear lighter clothes, spend the day in cooler rooms, monitor the state of your health regularly, eat easily digestible food (and in smaller portions), keep doors and windows closed to keep the heat out. Pets and animals also need extra care,” it warned residents.\n\nFacing drought\n\nNearly half of Europe’s territory, including the UK, is “at risk” of drought, researchers at the EU Commission said Monday.\n\nThe Joint Research Centre highlighted that the drought in much of Europe is “critical” as the “winter-spring precipitation deficit … was exacerbated by early heatwaves in May and June.”\n\nWater supply may be “compromised” in the coming months, according to the report.\n\nSpeaking to CNN on Monday, Oxford University Professor Myles Allen warned that such heatwaves will be inevitable if mankind doesn’t soon reduce its carbon emissions.\n\n“This isn’t a new normal because we’re just on a trend towards ever hotter temperatures,” Allen told CNN on Monday.\n\nThe solution, he said, is sweeping change across the energy industry. Individual companies are unlikely to change their business models unilaterally due to concerns over losing competitiveness with rivals, he added.\n\n“It’s got to be a regulation on the industry as a whole,” said Allen.", "authors": ["Joseph Ataman Jimmy Hutcheon Xiaofei Xu Zahid Mahmood Sana Noor Haq Jorge Engels", "Joseph Ataman", "Jimmy Hutcheon", "Xiaofei Xu", "Zahid Mahmood", "Sana Noor Haq", "Jorge Engels"], "publish_date": "2022/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/05/13/genghis-khan-re-examined-franklin/27242023/", "title": "Genghis Khan: Re-examined at Franklin", "text": "RENEE WINKLER For the Courier-Post\n\nA likeness of Genghis Khan, a bit overweight and with a tiny chip on one of his shoes with the curving tip, holds court at the entrance to a new exhibit at Philadelphia's Franklin Institute.\n\nHe looks regal as portrayed in the copy of a bronze statue that guards the entrance to Mongolia's parliament building — not mean at all, just imperial, and you can't help but pick up on a similarity in his pose to the marble statue of Benjamin Franklin in the grand entry of the museum off JFK Parkway.\n\nTurns out, Khan, whose horse soldiers captured almost all of Eurasia in the 13th century, wasn't as bad a guy as reported. His method of conquering rival tribes was basic: If you fought back, he killed you. The killing might have been delayed until you filled in the front line as a human shield for his attacking army as he overrode the walls of the next set of enemies. This tactic was used in Khan's 1214 attack on Beijing, according to exhibit creator Don Lessem.\n\nIf rival tribes gave into to Khan's approaching troops, he brought wealth, religious freedom, mail delivery, and even passports to the nomadic people who lived on the steppes, Lessem said.\n\nThe emperor also sired a remarkable number of children. It was reported more than a decade ago that 8 percent of all men living in the 11 million square miles of the former Mongolian empire carry Khan's DNA. That percentage translates into 16 million descendants.\n\nThe first generation of Khan's progeny didn't get his message to live in peace and show to loyalty to family and friends, said Franklin Institute president and CEO Larry Dubinski. Khan's four sons fought among themselves for control of the grasslands and it was a grandson, Kublai Khan, who was able to pull it together to establish the Mongolian dynasty in China.\n\n\"He was not a hero without faults,\" Dubinski said of Khan. \"He was never given supernatural powers but he was intelligent and loyal to his friends. He impressed his followers and kept his promises,\" he said.\n\nSurely, Khan wasn't a pushover, says Lessem, describing the Mongol as \"one of the world's most visionary geniuses. Movies have been produced that feature his life. One, 'Mongol,' a Russian-produced film won an Academy Award for best foreign film in 2014. In 1956, Howard Hughes produced a movie about Khan starring John Wayne. Filmed in the Utah desert, it was a bomb. A short clip of that is included in the Franklin Institute exhibit.\n\nLessem has written that Khan was terrifying. \"His soldier slew hundreds of thousands, whether by sword, arrow, or boiling in oil. Rivers were re-routed through towns. Cats and dogs were set afire to scurry back to their masters and set villages aflame.\n\n\"Genghis' army made use of cannons, anti-personnel mines and even germ warfare,\" Lessem continues, commenting that Khan kept body counts of those he conquered by cutting the right ear from corpses. He placed military leaders who were unfaithful to him on racks to break their spines. But his tactics were no worse than his rivals, who were marching children in Crusades.\n\n\"Genghis attacked only with provocation and after issuing warning,\" Lessem said. He reduced taxes for scholars and clerics, who were permitted to continue to teach and practice their religions.\n\nRecent scholarly work shows Khan, who lived from 1162 to 1227, was a military tactician who often tricked those he was attacking into believing he had fled, and then returning with his fear-inspiring cavalry, who could not only ride the plains ponies with great skill, but could shoot arrows, and some of the earliest gunpowder weapons, with accuracy. Khan, whose father was poisoned when he was only 11, practiced meritocracy, promoting his soldiers by talent instead of lineage.\n\nEventually he controlled territory that stretched from the Pacific Ocean the Caspian Sea, including lands now within the borders of Hungary. All this with an army that never exceeded 100,000, according to Lessem.\n\nThroughout his reign, Khan dressed as an ordinary man and never slept indoors. \"I sleep with only the stars above me and the earth as a pillow,\" he wrote. His burial spot remains unknown.\n\nHis control of the region led to the expansion of trade along both the Silk Road and the Tea Road through Tibet.\n\nEstablishing a system of passports guaranteed safe passage to his trade representatives, who warned that if they were not respected the power of Khan would be felt. Marco Polo traveled with a gold passport issued by Khan, according to the exhibit.\n\nLessem's creation has been shown in Mongolia, Singapore and Canada. Its first American viewing was in Houston and most recently was at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.\n\nOn view are piece of gold jewelry, pill boxes and snuff boxes, musical instruments, porcelain and silk robes, along with the wooden \"bones\" of saddles and a huge triple crossbow as well as a trebuchet, used to hurl rocks and, sometimes, human waste.\n\n\"Genghis Khan: Bring the Legend to Life,'' will continue through Jan. 3. Entrance is included with general admission. (\"The Lego Exhibit,'' which opened Feb. 7, continues through Sept. 6.)\n\nInside the third-floor exhibit are more than 200 artifacts, from a life-size wooden horse carrying a soldier in interlocking metal armor, to tiny pieces of carved jade and a carved domino set. Short audio interpretations accompany most of the pieces.\n\nA video details the redesign of bows used by soldiers to develop longer flights of arrows, as far as 400 yards. The arrow heads were designed for different targets.\n\nAt one point, herds of attacking horses are projected onto walls at a narrow passageway, creating the impression that you are stuck in the middle of a mounted attack.\n\nMany of the pieces are from the private collection of Gankhuyag Natsag, a native of Mongolia who now lives in Arlington, Virginia, who attended the opening of the exhibit with his son and daughters, who performed two ceremonial dances.\n\nUntil Lessem, most known for his research into dinosaurs, organized the exhibit, many of the items in the 1,000-square foot space never were seen outside Mongolia.\n\nThe largest single exhibit is a recreation of a ger, (English speakers use the term yurt) a tent-like structure built of felted wool over a wooden brace. The one here is furnished with intricately carved chests and brightly colored robes.\n\nA section at the end of the exhibit space encourages children to try on robes and hats and handle musical instruments.\n\nIf you go\n\n\"Genghis Khan: Bring the Legend to Life'' at The Franklin Institute is included with admission to the museum.

That includes any NOAA employees hired within the last year, or in some cases two years.\n\nIt also includes anyone promoted in the same period, meaning many experienced employees with years of institutional knowledge who recently advanced in their jobs were also let go.\n\nA source told CNN that some employees in critical positions may have been exempted. Andrew Hazelton, a researcher responsible for evaluating hurricane forecasts and improving the models the National Hurricane Center uses to track storms, verified on X, formerly Twitter, that he was fired.\n\nHow will this affect Florida, a state where lives depend on hurricane forecasts and tornado alerts? NOAA has not commented on how the agency will accommodate the changes, saying it does not discuss personnel and matters.\n\n\"NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation’s environmental and economic resilience,” spokesman Scott Smullen told USA TODAY.\n\nHurricane DOGE hits NOAA: Mass job cuts hit NOAA, agency that oversees hurricane center and weather service\n\nWhat is NOAA?\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration uses a vast network of research programs, vessels, satellites, science centers, laboratories, scientists and experts to understand and predict climate and extreme weather impacts. Countless lives have been saved through advance warning of dangerous weather, and many industries rely on NOAA for planning.\n\nData from NOAA and its agencies inform weather predictions, fisheries management, coastal restoration and marine commerce, along with whatever weather app you use.\n\nNOAA oversees the National Weather Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Ocean Service, the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service, Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations & NOAA Corps.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is a division of the NOAA/National Weather Service.\n\nFlorida NOAA offices\n\nWhat are Trump's plans for NOAA?\n\nNOAA's weather data going back over a century on the warming climate and its impact on the intensity of rainfall in storms, rising sea levels, coastal flooding, extended droughts and other scientific evidence have made the agency a target of conservatives who dismiss the threat and wish to remove obstructions to business interests.\n\nIn his first term, Trump proposed slashing NOAA's budget by 18% and the agency's weather and climate research office by 43%.\n\nOn the first day of his second term, Trump rescinded 78 executive orders approved by former President Joe Biden that included efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and signed an executive order leaving the Paris Climate Agreement again. In his first week, Trump ordered federal departments to scrub references to topics that do not fit his priorities, such as mentions of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and climate change.\n\nAs of early Friday morning, the climate change section on NOAA's website and its standalone site climate.gov are still visible.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump nominated Dr. Neil Jacobs to lead NOAA. Jacobs was Trump's acting NOAA chief in 2019 who backed him up in what became known as Sharpiegate after meteorologists contradicted his claims about where Hurricane Dorian might go and the president doubled down, presenting a hurricane impact map with a crude loop added with a Sharpie, Trump's preferred pen.\n\nWhat does Project 2025 say about NOAA?\n\nThe National Weather Service provides a wealth of detailed, comprehensive weather information and forecasts, all completely for free, used by researchers, weather apps and everyday people every day.\n\nProject 2025, the conservative roadmap and wishlist from right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation, would like people to pay for it instead, and it calls for NOAA to be broken up because the agency \"has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity.\"\n\nAfter a public backlash to its extreme proposals, Trump disavowed the project during his campaign, but many of his executive orders and the actions of DOGE mirror, if not surpass its recommendations.\n\nThe plan also makes a point of stating that \"Scientific agencies like NOAA are vulnerable to obstructionism of an Administration’s aims if political appointees are not wholly in sync with Administration policy,\" suggesting that scientific data about the world around us must be changed to fit official policy, rather than the other way around.\n\nThe project calls out NOAA specifically for \"climate alarmism\" and recommends the agency be \"dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.\"\n\nAmong other things, Project 2025 suggests:\n\nBreaking up NOAA and reassigning the ships and planes used by NOAA to other agencies\n\nCharging for currently free National Weather Service data\n\nTransfer NOS Survey functions to the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Geological Survey\n\nStreamline the National Marine Fisheries Service and reduce or remove regulations on fisheries, the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act.\n\nDownsize the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and disband the bulk of its climate change research.\n\nDoes Project 2025 call for closing the National Hurricane Center?\n\nNo. The project says the department's data provides \"important public safety and business functions as well as academic functions, and are used by forecasting agencies and scientists internationally.\"\n\nHowever, the project does call for a review of all data from the National Hurricane Service and the National Environmental Satellite Service to ensure it is presented neutrally, \"without adjustments intended to support any one side in the climate debate.\" It remains to be seen if ideological pressure will affect the accuracy of NOAA's forecasts.\n\nFormer NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad said in an essay on his LinkedIn page that slashing NOAA could reduce the federal budget \"if we are willing to kill a few thousand Americans every year, put our economy further into debt, and guarantee the loss of real property around the country.”\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-impacts-tracker-live-updates-from-tallahassee/75386305007/", "title": "Hurricane Helene impacts tracker: Landfall updates from Tallahassee", "text": "A Category 4 Hurricane Helene crashed into the Big Bend as a storm whose fury has never been seen in this area.\n\nAs Helene closed in on Thursday, residents in the path prepared, hoped and prayed.\n\nHere's the latest from the path of the storm:\n\nLeon County Administrator Vince Long: Damage assessments to begin at first light\n\nLeon County Administrator Vince Long, who rode the storm out at the Emergency Operations Center, told the Democrat around 2:40 a.m. Friday that there were a couple of reports of trees on structures but no widespread damage to buildings.

But once the eye moves, on winds are going to come from the opposite direction and be just as strong as when they came in, he said.\n\nTallahassee to see worst weather between 9 p.m. and midnight\n\nWinds are picking up in Tallahassee, and now is the time to take shelter, the National Weather Service Tallahassee says.\n\nAs of 8 p.m., the storm was located 130 miles south of Tallahassee with an expected landfall in Taylor County around 10 or 11 p.m., said Andy Haner, a meteorologist at NWS Tallahassee.\n\n“We are at the stage in Tallahassee where people need to be hunkering down,” Haner said.\n\nThe worst weather is expected to hit Tallahassee between 9 p.m. and midnight, he said, simmering down around 1 or 2 a.m.\n\nTallahassee is slated to be in or immediately west of the left side of the eyewall, which is usually where the worst winds of a hurricane are located, he said.\n\nSome of the Big Bend counties will eventually come under an “extreme wind warning” that should prompt residents to take the same precautions as if a tornado was coming.\n\nBy sunrise, winds are projected to be around 15 to 20 miles per hour, “which is less than what we’re seeing outside at this moment,” Haner said.\n\nTallahassee predicted to get 3-6 inches of rain\n\nThe NWS Tallahassee is forecasting 3 to 6 inches of rain along and west of the eyewall including Tallahassee. An area southwest of the city has seen 6 to 10 inches over the past 24 hours but will likely be west of the band of intense rainfall mentioned above.\n\nWhat to do if you hear trees snapping in a hurricane\n\nFlorida Department of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie advised Big Bend residents that if they start to hear trees snapping while sheltering from the hurricane, treat it like a tornado:\n\nTake shelter in an interior portion of their home, such as a windowless bathroom.\n\nGet as low as possible and cover yourself with a heavy blanket, a comforter or even a thin mattress.\n\nThe sound of pine trees snapping is \"an awful lot like fireworks or potentially gunshots, so please make sure if you hear that, act immediately,” Guthrie said.\n\nIf the sound suddenly stops and it becomes calm and quiet, Guthrie warned that does not mean the storm is over. It means you’re in the eyewall of the storm. He urged residents to stay inside, and especially not to start surveying any damage to one's property.\n\n“This eye is projected to be anywhere from 50 miles wide to 20 miles wide. But again, if it's moving at 21 miles an hour, and it's a 20-mile wide eyewall, you may have only 30 minutes, 45 minutes before that eyewall collapses right back on you and trees start snapping again,” Guthrie said.\n\nWeatherTiger: NHC intermediate advisory shows Helene's outer core pushing ashore\n\nHere's an excerpt from the 8:05 p.m. live blog update from Dr. Ryan Truchelut of Tallahassee-based WeatherTiger:\n\n\"The NHC’s 8 p.m. advisory is out, and there is little change from the previous information we had. Estimated minimum central pressure is down to 942 millibars, and motion remains to the north-northeast (25 degrees) at 23 mph.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Checking on radar, Category 4 Helene’s outer core is now pushing on shore into Florida’s Big Bend. While on-the-ground weather observations are sparse in this part of Florida, Cedar Key recently reported sustained winds of 52 mph and a gust to 65 mph, so tropical storm conditions with embedded hurricane-force gusts are likely to overspread the Apalachee Bay coastline in the next hour.\"\n\nLocal officials appear on NewsNation to talk Helene response\n\nLeon County Sheriff Walt McNeil and Tallahassee Mayor John Dailey both appeared on NewsNation this evening to talk about response and recovery plans for Hurricane Helene.\n\nDailey said the city was ready and waiting to see what Mother Nature brings. He also touted the city’s partnership with the state, the Governor’s Office and the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n“We have a saying here in Tallahassee that we’re ‘Tallahassee strong,’ ” Dailey said.\n\nHurricane Helene is now a Category 4\n\nA NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft currently investigating Helene recently found that the maximum sustained winds have increased to 130 mph, according to a post by the National Hurricane Center on X.\n\n\"Helene now an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane,\" the post says.\n\nLeon County say Category 3 force winds are expected inland\n\nHurricane Helene started picking up speed, meaning the storm will get here and be done quicker, Leon County Emergency Management Director Kevin Peters said. But the faster the storm, the stronger the winds inland towns — like Tallahassee — will see.\n\nLeon County’s 5 p.m. forecast showed sustained winds were clocking in at 125 miles per hour, Peters said. Category 3 force winds are still expected to make landfall tonight, alongside six to 12 inches of rainfall.\n\n“Trees will come down, roads will be blocked, power lines will be down, and it’s going to take time to repair and restore and clear all of that,” he said.\n\nPeters said crews are ready to begin restoration efforts as soon as winds die down, but “it’s going to be a process” with a core of the storm this close to Tallahassee.\n\n“We’ve not had that happen in the past,” he said. “We’ve seen storms like Hurricane Michael or Hurricane Idalia, but the cores were a little further away.”\n\nResidents should expect heavy debris and roadblocks and proceed with caution. It’s best to treat every down line as a power line and let the professionals clear them, Peters said.\n\nLatest NHC cone no longer includes western Leon County, but NWS Tallahassee says any eastern shift only 'incremental'\n\nThe National Hurricane Center’s 5 p.m. advisory for Hurricane Helene indicated another small shift to the east, with the cone of uncertainty stretching from eastern Leon County into Taylor County.\n\nThe hurricane’s center line, which ran between Tallahassee and Quincy in earlier forecasts, is now east of there, between Tallahassee and Perry.\n\nHowever, Felicia Bowser, meteorologist in charge with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, said residents shouldn’t pay attention to the center line.\n\n“If it changed at all, it was very, very incremental,” Bowser said. “The southeast Florida Big Bend is still the same area of where it’s going to be making landfall. So not really that much change in regards to that.”\n\nAnd while some forecasters have predicted later landfalls, Bowser said she still expects the hurricane to make landfall before 10 p.m.\n\n“Just how strong it can get is a little bit questionable at this time,” Bowser said. “But it’s a strong Category 3 hurricane, sustained winds of 125 mph and not too far from Category 4.”\n\nDuring a news conference shortly before 6 p.m., Gov. Ron DeSantis said landfall was expected around 11 p.m. and that the track had shifted toward Taylor County. But the change may not mean much for the capital city.\n\n\"Tallahassee remains in the path of the storm, and the impacts are expected to be significant,\" Mayor John Dailey said in a post on X at about 6 p.m. \"Widespread and prolonged power outages, damage to critical infrastructure, catastrophic damage to the trees and powerlines, widespread inaccessibility due to blocked roads, and damage to well-built structures will all be likely.\"\n\nMost Leon shelters at capacity; evacuees directed to Rickards High shelter\n\nMore than 1,000 people are hunkering down at eight local public schools turned shelters as Hurricane Helene approaches the Big Bend coast.\n\nA district representative said Rickards High School opened this morning to accommodate more evacuees. Aside for Rickards, all other school shelters have reached capacity. Those still seeking shelter must go to Rickards at 3013 Jim Lee Road.\n\nTallahassee City Manager Reese Goad: 2K workers across all utilities will respond to Helene\n\nSome 2,000 workers across all the city utilities and including mutual-aid electric repair crews and contract workers, will be working to restore power and other services once Hurricane Helene has passed, City Manager Reese Goad said in an interview with the Democrat.\n\nGoad said he expects the damage to eclipse Hurricane Michael, which knocked out power to 90% of city customers in 2018. Repairs will take days, but estimates are unlikely until Saturday, after assessments are done. He added that the city put generators at critical intersections to keep signals operating while power is down and will deploy more as needed.\n\n\"I would expect hundreds of roads to be blocked by trees, based on our past experience, and so you'll have a lot of roads that are impacted just by downed trees and wires,\" Goad said. \"And so that'll take some time to dig out from that. Obviously, we would hope that people kind of stay still on Friday, allow the first responders to get out and do their work. Then I would be hopeful by the weekend that, people can start to move about a little bit, things start to resume a little bit of normalcy. But you know how long ... the pace will be for restoration, it's too early to say at this point.\"\n\nFSU athletics hunkers down for Helene\n\nFlorida State Athletics is preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Helene as the potential major hurricane is expected to make landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region.\n\nFor instance, the FSU football team is flying out of Jacksonville International Airport a day ahead of its game against Southern Methodist University in Dallas.\n\nThe Seminoles baseball complex was significantly damaged in the May 10 tornados that tore through Tallahassee. The right field wall of Dick Howser Stadium toppled over after the storms, with significant damage to the trees and surrounding area.\n\nThe wall was replaced in the days after the tornados, but the university is prepared for the potential arrival of Helene. Safety measures were put in place throughout the week with loose objects like chairs and training equipment moved indoors or zip-tied to fences.\n\nFSU’s basketball stadium, the Donald L.

Many roads will be impassable, and there may be downed power lines, fallen trees, and other dangerous conditions,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nWakulla County sheriff shares personal message to residents\n\nWakulla County Sheriff Jared F. Miller asked residents to join him in prayer for the coastal community, which will have a long road to recovery after Hurricane Helene.\n\n\"I have lived here my entire life and have never witnessed some of the storm predictions we are currently seeing,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nHe assured residents the sheriff's office would be ready to help during the recovery process and asked for patience once the storm passes.\n\n\"May God keep each of you safe during this storm and may God Bless Wakulla County,\" he wrote.\n\nNWS: Time running out for big changes in Helene track\n\nThere was no change in Hurricane Helene’s forecast track in the National Hurricane Center’s 11 a.m. forecast, though its maximum sustained wind speeds were up slightly.\n\nHelene is projected to make landfall tonight as a high-end Category 3 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. That’s slightly lower than Wednesday projections of a low-end Category 4.\n\nFelicia Bowser, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, said Helene is expected to make landfall this evening.\n\n“It’s still moving at a pretty decent speed,” she said.\n\nAs for Helene’s slight jog to the east, Bowser said it happened as of the NHC’s 11 p.m. Wednesday forecast and that any move in that direction since was “extremely incremental.”\n\n“That slight eastward shift did occur, and the fact that it wobbles a little bit east, west, east, west, that’s pretty typical,” she said. “Will we not see any more wobbles? That’s just a little bit hard to say. Will it keep going east? That’s a little bit hard to say, too.”\n\nShe said NHC Hurricane Hunter aircraft will continue to collect data that will show whether there are more wobbles or the track is as refined as it will get.\n\n“We’re definitely getting to that time where the refinements are probably going to be minimized, because it looks like it’s on target,” Bowser said. “And eventually that will happen.”\n\nAt 11 a.m., Helene was 290 miles south of Apalachicola and moving north-northeast at 14 mph. Its maximum sustained winds were 105 mph.\n\nPower outages mount as Helene stalks Florida peninsula ahead of landfall\n\nThe power struggle has begun.\n\nMore than 27,000 Florida customers are already in the dark as an intensifying Hurricane Helene lashes the peninsula as it heads north to a Big Bend landfall.\n\nSouth and central Florida counties like Lake, Collier, Lee, Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade have the most outages, but as rain bands begins to lash northern Florida, even Wakulla and Leon counties are beginning to see outages with about 650 and 500 respectively.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest outages, visit our power outage tracker.\n\nEntire Big Bend under tornado watch; Franklin County warning set to expire\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for more than two dozen Florida counties, including Leon and nearby counties. The watch, which means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form, is in effect until 10 p.m.\n\nFlorida counties under the watch are: Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Calhoun, Clay, Columbia, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Nassau, Putnam, St. Johns, Suwannee, Taylor, Union and Wakulla.\n\nAn earlier tornado warning for central Franklin County will expire at 11:30 a.m.\n\nNWS in Tallahassee said, \"The storm which prompted the warning has weakened below severe limits, and no longer appears capable of producing a tornado. Therefore, the warning will be allowed to expire.\"\n\nWeatherTiger's offers 'slightly positive trends' for Tallahassee in latest Helene update\n\nDr. Ryan Truchelut of WeatherTiger offered up the one thing Tallahasseeans have been praying for — a glimmer of hope — in his latest forecast for Hurricane Helene.\n\nTruchelut said Helene did not intensify as much as expected overnight. And while it’s still expected to become a Category 3 or 4 hurricane, the delay in intensification “is helpful in shaving a bit of the high-end potential off the hurricane’s core of destructive winds tonight,” he wrote.\n\nIn his newsletter to his subscribers on substack, Truchelut added that Helene nudged a few miles east, but no further, from the National Hurricane Center’s 5 a.m. forecast centerline.\n\n“I’ll be watching carefully to see if that persists, as every tick east counts towards increasing the potential for Tallahassee staying on the weaker, western half of the storm,” Truchelut wrote. “Make no mistake: in Tallahassee, your rooting interest is that the center of Helene passes to our east.”\n\nHelene was about 350 miles south of Apalachicola and moving north-northeast at about 12 mph, according to the NHC’s 8 a.m. forecast. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph.\n\nDespite what he called the \"slightly positive trends,\" Truchelut said Helene remains a \"catastrophic threat.\" The hurricane is expected to make landfall in Apalachee Bay tonight or early Friday morning.\n\nLeon County opens eighth shelter at Rickards High School\n\nLeon County opened its eighth shelter for people seeking refuge from Helene this morning at Rickards High School.\n\nThe shelters are run in cooperation with Leon County Schools.

Ron DeSantis appeared on Fox & Friends Thursday morning to talk about Florida's preparations for Hurricane Helene.\n\nThe governor warned that time is running out for those living in evacuation zones to leave.\n\n\"People just need to make decisions, keep themselves safe,\" DeSantis said. \"Soon as the storm passes, you're going to see the response very quickly.\"\n\nHe also emphasized the potential damages for Tallahassee, which has historically missed the brunt of major hurricanes.\n\n\"If it does hit Tallahassee, they have not had a major hurricane in Tallahassee in recent memory,\" DeSantis said. \"We've got a lot of beautiful trees here — the neighborhoods have them. But when you start having 125 mph winds, that could cause a lot of damage, a lot of debris as well.\"\n\nHe gave another warning for those who live beneath trees: \"You got a big oak fall on your roof, that is not going to be something that you're going to want to be there for,\" he said.\n\nJim Cantore, a harbinger for hurricane damage, in Tallahassee\n\nThe Weather Channel's Jim Cantore was in Tallahassee Thursday morning.\n\nThat's something making city residents uneasy, as he's known to visit areas before and as they get significantly damaged by hurricanes.\n\n\"It cannot be understated the threat (Hurricane Helene) poses across the southeastern United States just based on current intensity projections,\" Cantore said in a social media post Wednesday.\n\nThe Tallahassee Democrat spotted Cantore doing live coverage outside the Old Florida Capitol on Wednesday evening. See the images below.\n\nHurricane Helene grows to Category 2 storm\n\nHurricane Helene is now a Category 2 with 100-mph winds, according to the National Hurricane Center's 8 a.m. bulletin.\n\n\"ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING EXPECTED BEFORE LANDFALL IN FLORIDA... ...PREPARATIONS TO PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY SHOULD BE RUSHED TO COMPLETION...\"\n\n\"Weakening is expected after landfall,\" NHC forecasters say, \"but Helene's fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.\"\n\nThat scenario harkens back to Hurricane Michael, which punched into Georgia with Category 3 winds.\n\nDreams washed away: Horseshoe Beach residents pray for a miracle ahead of Helene\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH — This beloved Gulf Coast fishing destination was a ghost town in the hours leading up to Hurricane Helene's anticipated landfall.\n\nOnly a few residents remained Wednesday afternoon as they made final preparations for the storm before evacuating to more inland towns.\n\nThe town lost more than 50% of its homes to Hurricane Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane that hit Aug. 30, 2023, causing major damage to the eastern Big Bend and Nature Coast. Now it faces the prospect of a 10- to 15-foot storm surge that could be even worse.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking to come back and see your dreams you've always had get washed away in two hours,\" resident John Hamelink said.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWeatherTiger's video forecast outlines a harrowing night ahead\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK meteorologist Ryan Truchelut of WeatherTiger broke down the impacts ahead of Hurricane Helene in a late Wednesday night video forecast.\n\nHe warned that Tallahassee could be blasted by 115 mph winds. He also noted that a record storm surge of 15 to 20 feet will occur during high tide, which will ratchet up the life-threatening risk potential for those coastal dwellers under hurricane and surge warnings.\n\n\"This is not a survivable situation,\" he said. \"You just have to get out.\"\n\nWhen the night is over, Truchelut said, \"(Helene) will stand toe to toe with one of the biggest hurricane hits in Florida hurricane history, unfortunately.\"\n\nFlorida becomes the evacuation state as residents wake-up to final decision\n\nResidents are awaking Thursday morning and facing a final decision on whether to stay or go.

The National Weather Service offered these tips to keeping warm if freezing rain and ice take out the power and leave you in the dark – and the cold.\n\nClose blinds or curtains to keep in some heat.\n\nClose off rooms to avoid wasting heat.\n\nWear layers of loose-fitting, lightweight, warm clothing.\n\nEat and drink. Food provides energy to warm the body.\n\nAvoid caffeine and alcohol.\n\nStuff towels or rags in cracks under doors.\n\nExperts also say to:\n\nBe careful with heat sources . Candles and space heaters are a fire risk.\n\n. Candles and space heaters are a fire risk. Practice portable generator safety . Use generators outdoors, at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and garages. Avoid carbon monoxide poisoning by following instructions on proper use.\n\n. Use generators outdoors, at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and garages. Avoid carbon monoxide poisoning by following instructions on proper use. Check on neighbors: Once your family is safe, check on your neighbors and vulnerable individuals to ensure they are okay.\n\nNational Weather Service ups snow potential in evening forecast\n\nIn its evening update, the National Weather Service is urging residents to be prepared for a \"widespread winter-weather event\" Tuesday evening into Wednesday.\n\nWhile the area will likely see a mix of rain, sleet, freezing rain and snow, forecasters bumped the possible snow accumulation for the Tallahassee area to 1 to 2 inches. Even the coastal areas near St. Marks could see about an inch of snow. Models have suggested values as high as 6 inches.\n\nBut forecasters warn that if there is warmer air aloft any frozen precipitation could tilt more toward freezing rain. Already forecasters warn that Leon and Wakulla counties could see up to a quarter of an inch of ice. That would be enough to make roads very dangerous and potentially bring down powerlines and tree limbs.\n\nAreas around St. Marks and Perry are expected to see more freezing rain than Tallahassee in the latest forecast.\n\nForecasters also brought the impact timeline forward. The earliest onset of a wintry mix for Tallahassee now could begin as early as 3-5 p.m. Tuesday with accumulation beginning at 6 p.m. and concluding at 6 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"Once snow/ice accumulations begin, travel will begin to become hazardous,\" forecasters write. \"Travel is not recommended after the onset of accumulations.\"\n\nGovernor declares a state of emergency ahead of winter storm\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency ahead of this week's hazardous winter weather that's expected to bring snow to the Florida Panhandle. For the first time in seven years, winter storm warnings are in effect from Pensacola to Jacksonville and as south as Gainesville.\n\n\"Dangerously cold wind chills and prolonged freezing and sub-freezing temperatures are expected for North and North-Central Florida for the next several days,\" the executive order says.\n\nThe order activates the National Guard and Florida Guard as needed to respond to the emergency and allows the governor to \"suspend the effect of any statute, rule, or order that would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay any mitigation, response, or recovery action necessary to cope with this emergency.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nGovernment offices, facilities shutting down Wednesday\n\nLeon County Government is battening down the hatches and closing on Wednesday. Public-facing offices, community centers, libraries and the solid waste management facility will be closed.\n\nIn their emailed briefing, the county noted that the cold night shelter continues to operate nightly from Sunday through Friday morning, \"with shelters prepared to accommodate an increased number of clients.\"\n\nModels locked in on Tallahassee snow as FDOT mobilizes\n\nThe European model has become something of the gold standard when it comes to hurricane and weather forecasting. What about when it comes to snow? Well, now we have a Tallahassee test of its accuracy.\n\nIn its afternoon run, each one of its 50 separate models that make up its ensemble declared that Florida's capital city would see at least .5 inches of snow. Such conformity is rare for a system designed to show different probabilities. In fact, total accumulations vary widely with some models calling for as much as 6 inches of snow.\n\nIn advance of whatever kind of winter weather materializes, the Florida Department of Transportation has deployed crews across North Florida and nearly 200 pieces of heavy equipment, including snow plows, de-icing equipment, and spray rigs, in anticipation of icy conditions.\n\n\"FDOT will conduct winter weather operations beginning today at 2 pm across NW Florida in preparation for freezing temperatures and precipitation forecast in the area,\" the agency wrote on X. \"Crews will deploy various tankers and bridge deck sprayers to apply anti-icing products on bridges & overpasses.\"\n\nTallahassee, Big Bend under a Winter Storm Warning\n\nIt's becoming real. National Weather Service forecasters issued a Winter Storm Warning for Tallahassee, the first such warning since 2018 when a short-lived dusting of snow with large flakes thrilled the capital city.\n\nThis time around, things could be more serious.\n\n\"Heavy mixed precipitation expected,\" the forecasters wrote in the alert. \"Total snow accumulations up to one inch and ice accumulations up to two tenths of an inch.\"\n\nThe warning means there is an 80% to 90% chance of a winter storm impacting the region.\n\n\"Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning commutes. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.\"\n\nCity of Tallahassee prepping for icy roads\n\nThe city of Tallahassee said it is working with its government agency partners to prepare roadways for the possibility of sleet, freezing rain and snow.\n\n“Hazardous travel conditions are likely,” the city said in a news release. “The city of Tallahassee is coordinating with local and state partners to prepare, including spreading sand and deicer on bridges and roadways as necessary. As winter precipitation arrives, motorists are advised to use extra caution and only be on the roads if necessary.”\n\nThe city also said it was trickling water from spigots in area parks and other public spaces as a precaution.\n\n“Signs should be posted nearby, but if you see water running lightly from a pipe when arctic air threatens, please do not turn it off,” the city said. “This is intentional. City crews are on standby to respond to service issues should they arise.”\n\nFAMU and TSC will close Tuesday as well as Wednesday\n\nFlorida A&M University and Tallahassee State College said they will close on Tuesday as well as Wednesday in anticipation of Winter Storm Enzo. The university earlier announced it would close on Wednesday.\n\nFSU cancels classes, suspends operations Tuesday and Wednesday\n\nFlorida State University announced that it will cancel classes and suspended normal business operations on Tuesday and Wednesday \"due to anticipated wintry precipitation and ice and their impact on roadways and critical services in the region.\"\n\nFSU said in a news release that the closure includes the Florida A&M University-FSU College of Engineering. The university said it will resume classes and normal operations at 5 a.m. on Thursday.\n\n\"Students are strongly encouraged to return to the Tallahassee area before road conditions are anticipated to deteriorate Tuesday evening,\" FSU said. \"There is a potential for road closures around the region, that could include Interstates, Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Residential housing operations will continue throughout the closure.\"\n\nThe university added that essential business operations will continue on both days.\n\n\"Employees designated by their department as essential personnel should consult with their supervisors,\" FSU said.\n\nSeminole Dining locations will operate on an adjusted schedule. Seminole Express buses will cease operations during the closure.\n\nLeon County Schools will close early Tuesday\n\nLeon County Schools announced it will dismiss class an hour early on Tuesday because of the winter storm. High schools will dismiss at 12:50 p.m., elementary schools at 1:50 p.m. and middle schools at 2:50 p.m.\n\nAdditionally, all after-school activities have been canceled for Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n\"After consulting with the Leon County Emergency Management Center and reviewing the updated forecast from the National Weather Service, LCS has adjusted school operations due to the earlier arrival of the incoming winter weather system,\" the district said in a news release.\n\nCounty administrator shares latest window for ice, snow in Tallahassee\n\nLeon County Administrator Vince Long shared the latest guidance from the National Weather Service with county commissioners in an email storm update just afternoon. Long wrote that the wintry precipitation is expected to arrive as early as 6 p.m. Tuesday, with the most likely time frame between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"The National Weather Service also anticipates that freezing rain will cease and thaw by 11 a.m. on Wednesday, allowing roads to become safe again,\" Long wrote.\n\nUntil that happens, drivers are urged to be extra careful while driving.\n\n“Whether it’s snow, sleet or freezing rain that is occurring, travel with extreme caution,” said Kevin Peters, director of Leon County Emergency Management.\n\nPeters urged people to reschedule travel plans if they can, dress in layers to stay warm and to use space heaters safely. He also encouraged people to take care of the Four P’s: people, pets, plants and pipes.\n\nClosure announcements begin to pile up ahead of winter storm\n\nWith a parade of forecast models ratcheting up the possibility of a record snowfall, Leon County Schools and Florida A&M University have already announced they are closing the doors on Wednesday. Many more institutions and businesses will follow. We're tracking the latest closings here.\n\nThe Florida Legislature also canceled its meetings this week due to the winter storm, and possible accumulation of inch in the Tallahassee area. Lawmakers, though, are set to return to the Capital next week for a special session convened by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Full story here.\n\nEmail us at news@tallahassee.com if you'd like to announce a closure, delay or cancellation.\n\nA brief history of snow and ice in Tallahassee\n\nCould we be on the frozen precipice of history?\n\nTallahassee gets a trace of snow every now and again — in 2018, 2010 and 2004, for instance. But measurable snow has fallen only eight times since 1891, according to the Weather Service in Tallahassee.\n\nIt has snowed in Tallahassee 34 times since then, according to the University of Florida Extension Office. In general, the return period for measurable snow has been just once every 17 years in Florida’s capital city.\n\nFreezing rain is also a rarity in these parts. The last ice storm recorded in Tallahassee occurred Jan. 28-29 in 2014. Even though the city only recorded a trace amount of ice, it sill briefly shut down much of the city.\n\nFull story here.\n\nA ‘crazy’ for Florida snowpack could send temperatures into a ‘freefall’\n\nA snowpack — highly unusual for the North Florida area — could send subfreezing low temperatures plunging even further.\n\nLows are expected to drop to the mid to upper 20s over the next few nights. But the National Weather Service in Tallahassee said that could change with the total accumulation of snow and ice on the ground.\n\n“In fact, Wednesday night`s temperatures could be a little tricky depending on if there is a snowpack (crazy to say for this area!). If there is, temperatures could freefall into the 10s,” wrote NWS senior meteorologist Molly Merrifield in a morning forecast discussion.\n\nOtherwise, Merrifield said, most locations should “bottom out” in the low to mid 20s. She said a warming trend will begin Thursday afternoon with highs climbing to the upper 40s by the end of the work week and the 60s by Sunday.\n\n‘Quick burst of snow’ possible before ice in the Tallahassee area\n\nThe National Weather Service says the winter storm expected to hit the area Tuesday or Wednesday could bring an initial round of snow before changing into a wintry mix closer to the Tallahassee area.\n\nNWS Tallahassee forecasters said in their Monday morning discussion that widespread snow totals of 1-2 inches are expected along and northwest of the Flint and Apalachicola Rivers, with less than 1 inch expected south and east, which would include Tallahassee.\n\nAnd while higher snowfall totals are expected to the west, the Big Bend and south-central Georgia could see higher ice totals between a tenth and a quarter of an inch.\n\nForecasters said, however, that uncertainty remains about what kind of precipitation will fall, from rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow, and how long each type may last.\n\nNWS said ample moisture aloft will allow snowflakes to form, though they won’t hit the ground at first because they’ll go through a drier layer of air in the lowest part of the atmosphere.\n\n“It`ll take a few hours for the lower levels to saturate and allow the precipitation to reach the ground, cooling the lower-levels of the atmosphere as it does so, or wet-bulbing, to near or below freezing for most of the region,” forecasters wrote. “This should allow for a quick burst of snow at the onset for most everyone before transitioning toa wintry mix of snow, sleet, and/or freezing rain along the southern edge of the precipitation while remaining predominantly snow on the northern side.”\n\nTallahassee could get under an inch of snow, quarter inch of ice\n\nTallahassee could get a quarter of an inch of ice — enough to make roads impassable and knock out power lines — and less than an inch of snow from the winter storm forecast to hit the area.\n\n“Confidence continues to increase on the potential for an impactful winter weather event late Tuesday afternoon-Wednesday morning.,” the National Weather Service in Tallahassee said.\n\nThe storm could bring higher snowfall amounts of up to 3 inches to parts of the far western Florida Panhandle and up to 2 inches in places like Marianna and Thomasville, Georgia. A winter storm watch remains in effect for the entire area for Tuesday afternoon through early Wednesday morning.\n\nNWS said an area of low pressure moving across the Gulf of Mexico will interact with an arctic air mass that began filtering into the Deep South on Sunday. Snow, sleet and freezing rain could hit parts of North Florida, Georgia and Alabama.\n\n“The first batch of wintry precipitation is forecast to arrive as soon as Tuesday afternoon across Southeast AL and the FL Panhandle, initially as cold liquid rain before transitioning to snow or sleet,” the Weather Service said. “Precipitation chances notably increase Tuesday night and spread east to the FL Big Bend and Southwest GA where freezing rain/sleet come into play.”\n\nExactly where the low goes will play a role in how much snow or ice falls in the Tallahassee area.\n\nIt appears increasingly likely (60 to 90%) that the region experiences at least minor winter storm impacts with a low to medium (20 to 40%) chance of moderate winter storm impacts,” NWS said.\n\nWhy an ice storm can be such a weighty problem\n\nThe National Weather Service says Florida's capital city and Big Bend, already expecting a week of freezing temperatures, could be in line for as much as an inch of snow overnight Tuesday into Wednesday. Much more dire, a quarter inch of ice accumulation is also possible.\n\nIn addition to making roads hazardous, freezing rain and the ice that forms can weigh down a stretch of powerlines by 500 pounds. It can also increase the weight of a tree limb by 30 times.\n\n\"Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will likely become slick and hazardous by Tuesday night,\" forecasters wrote in the Winter Storm Warning. \"The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday morning commute. Persons should consider delaying all travel.\"\n\nHow to prepare for a winter storm\n\nFloridians are far more accustomed to preparing for squall lines and hurricanes than a winter storm.\n\nJasmine Montgomery, meteorologist at the National Weather Service, noted that residents can prepare now in much of the same way they prepare for tropical trouble: have flashlights ready, be stocked up on staples and charge your electronic devices.\n\nShe said to prepare for the possibility of power outages, have extra blankets to keep warm, and be ready to use the fireplace safely if you have one.\n\n\"This is by no means a hurricane, but do have a plan to keep your home safe during adverse weather,\" she said.\n\nThe Leon County Sheriff's Office also has you covered with a checklist for before and after the storm.\n\nClick here for the full story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/04/08/solar-eclipse-2024-time-path-live-stream-glasses-ohio/73131432007/", "title": "When is the solar eclipse? Follow the April 8 phenomenon in Ohio", "text": "After months of anticipation, emergency preparedness planning and hype, the day of the solar eclipse is finally here.\n\nThe peak of the solar eclipse -- when the moon completely blocks the sun, save for a shimmering ring of golden sunshine called a \"corona\" -- happened at about 3:14 p.m. in Akron and lasted 2 minutes, 46 seconds before darkness started to lift.\n\nAfter a soggy morning, the skies cleared for the afternoon. The National Weather Service in Cleveland is forecasting partly sunny skies this afternoon with a high temperature of about 72 degrees.\n\nYou can follow all of our reporting here live, as eclipse day 2024 unfolds:\n\nDid you get chills during the eclipse?\n\nAnyone else feel a chill in the air during the eclipse? It wasn't just you: The National Weather Service reported that temperature dropped almost 10 degrees leading up to and during the total solar eclipse, according to data from the Cleveland-Hopkins Airport:\n\nTraffic troubles after the eclipse\n\nAll of those visitors who merged with Greater Akron locals to watch the eclipse are now trying to get home and, as local leaders forecast, there are some traffic problems.\n\nAccording to the Ohio Department of Transportation's OHGO website:\n\nExpect lane closures on Interstate 76 East at Interstate 76 East/Interstate 77 South due to a crash.\n\nExpect lane closures on Interstate 80 East, the Ohio Turnpike, beyond Route 44 due to a crash.\n\nHowever, Tommy Smoot, the director of the Summit County Emergency Management Agency, said he had not heard of any major incidents connected with the eclipse and that, so far, things have gone smoothly.\n\n\"We had a number of events in the county,\" Smoot said. \"We saw lots of different license plates, a lot of people coming from other states. We don't have an exact number of how many visitors we had but a lot of events were maxed out. This was a once-in-a-lifetime event. The weather cooperated this afternoon. We've had a few minor accidents, like on Route 8 and on 77, nothing out of the ordinary.\"\n\nWitness to the eclipse\n\nHere are some of the things our Beacon Journal photographers and reporters saw before, during and after the eclipse:\n\nWe saw the whole of the moon\n\nWhat did you think?\n\nAs day turned to dusk during the eclipse, the street lights downtown Akron flicked on.\n\nAt the MAPS Air Museum in Green, Pink Floyd blared on the speakers and the Akron Art Museum played a hit list of sun- and moon-themed music.\n\nWhen totality arrived, there were cheers in Akron, from Highland Square through downtown and onto Goodyear Heights.\n\nIn Cleveland, at Progressive Field, everything went quiet as darkness fell and then, at the end of totality, the Corner Bar broke out into cheers of “Jose! Jose! Jose!\"\n\nDogs barked in some neighborhoods while birds and other creatures went silent in others.\n\nAnd for better or worse, some people celebrated with fireworks or by honking their car horns.\n\nWe're heading toward totality\n\nNow's the time to step outside, put on your eclipse glasses and look up.\n\nNo one alive has seen a full eclipse in Greater Akron.\n\nThis is your chance.\n\nAt 2:45 p.m., the Weather Channel said it was 72 degrees in Akron. The temperature is expected to drop when the moon covers the sun.\n\n'It's once-in-a-lifetime,' at Progressive Field\n\nSisters Tiffany and Jasmine Nason traveled north from Wooster to watch the eclipse at Progressive Field in Cleveland on Monday.\n\nThey said they drove most of the way, then took the RTA. train into downtown.“Actually it was surprisingly pleasant,” Tiffany said.Traffic was light they said, but the metro was packed with Guardians fans.“It’s once-in-a-lifetime,” Tiffany said.“And Opening Day,” Jasmine said.\n\nMichele and Eric Harrison, of Tallmadge, brought a nice camera and a filter to photograph the eclipse from the stadium.\n\nThey said they waited until Friday to buy tickets, wanting to make sure the forecast looked promising. They said traffic was much easier than anticipated and they didn’t mind paying $40 for parking today.“It’s worth it today,” Michele said.\n\nFreeway closure: State Route 2 at I-90 east of downtown CLE\n\nAll lanes are closed on Route 2 West at I-90/ Route 2 West, near the Burke Lakefront Airport, according to the Ohio Department of Transportation.\n\nCleveland police confirmed in a social media post that the state route was closed until further notice. No details were given as to why.\n\nLocal officials have warned there could be traffic tie-ups related to the eclipse, both because the area was expecting an influx of visitors seeking to see the event and because people would pull off the road to witness it.\n\nSigns were up on roadways earlier today warning people not to stop along freeways.\n\nThe unusual thrill at Cedar Point today is in the sky\n\nApril 8 has always been too early for Cedar Point amusement park to open.\n\nThe winds off of Lake Erie can still be brutal in April. And sometimes, it still snows.\n\nBut today's eclipse changed Cedar Point's history.\n\nFor the first time since it opened as a bath house in 1870, Cedar Point welcomed guests to ride the rides and check out mother nature's afternoon sky show.\n\nPeople from across the US are pouring into MAPS Air Museum for eclipse event in Green\n\nDennis Bachtel, helping to guide vehicles at the sold out MAPS Air Museum eclipse event Monday, said he's seen people from across the country today. They'd come to Green from as far away as California and Seattle.\n\nMore than 350 vehicles were expected for the sold-out event, MAPS marketing manager Doug Perry said.\n\n\"The first car in this morning was from New Jersey and she was a meteorologist,\" Perry said.\n\nKent welcomes locals, out-of-towners with glasses, toys, sweets and maps\n\nThe information tent on Kent's Water Street is set up to welcome eclipses tourists with stickers, magnets and maps.\n\nExecutive Director for Mainstreet Kent Heather Malarcik said the tent also offers minor medical assistance for anyone who needed help.\n\nMalarcik said she expecting locals, but out-of-towners too, hoping to catch a glimpse of a total solar eclipse.\n\nFood trucks and brick-and-mortar businesses aimed to cater to eclipse lovers.\n\nDaisy Pop's food truck was selling \"eclipsefetti\" pops with sprinkles and a \"2024 Eclipse\" label. And they offered a do-it-yourself sweet eclipse, selling separate moon-shaped chocolate pops and sun-shaped vanilla pops.\n\n\"We've been gearing up for this I'd say for probably a year, doing the meetings and learning all about it,\" Daisy Pop owner Amy Mucha said. \"It's hard to believe the day is finally here.\"\n\nAt Kent's Off the Wagon toy store on East Main, interactive puzzle blocks were set up outside so adults and kids could play.\n\nThe store is also selling eclipse glasses designed by local art teacher Cody Knepper.\n\n\"I think it's gonna be a really cool moment when the eclipse starts,\" said Jade Brundelet, an Off the Wagon employee. \"I feel like it's the perfect place to be around here, and it's a really cool sense of community.\"\n\nLocals may have heeded leaders' advice: Stay Home\n\nBy 1 p.m., Akron Zoo workers Angie Walsh and Abby Sipos had talk to about 62 people visiting the zoo for the eclipse.\n\nMany, Walsh said, are from out of town.\n\n\"I think a lot of local people are probably staying at home in their backyards, hanging out, trying to stay out of traffic and stuff,\" said Walsh, an education mission coordinator.\n\nShe and Sipos are talking to people about a citizen science undertaking at the zoo today called the \"eclipse soundscapes project.\"\n\nThe project enlists zoo-goers to record animal reactions during the eclipse.\n\nIf you had planned to venture out to watch the eclipse, many venues -- including local and state parks -- are already at capacity.\n\nWhat's poppin'? Solar eclipse 'astronaut' passes out popcorn coupons\n\nCuyahoga Falls downtown EclipseFest 2024 is getting busier as the clock ticks toward the eclipse.\n\nThe phenomenon begins about 1:59 p.m. and should peak about 3:15 p.m.\n\nRachael Vanfossen of Metropolis Popcorn in Cuyahoga Falls got into the spirt by dressing as a solar eclipse astronaut and handing out coupons.\n\nAkron RubberDucks' Party in the Park: Hitting one straight to the moon(or the sun)\n\nTrish Ostroski, 76, of Cuyahoga Falls takes a pitch inside the Akron RubberDuck's stadium today at the Party in the Park until Dark event to celebrate the eclipse.\n\nFans can take batting practice in the minor league park and watch the moon overtake the sun from the outfield grass.\n\nNothing says eclipse quite like Santa, alien mini golf and two Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles?\n\nCastle Noel, the year-round Christmas museum in Medina, today is hosting two of the six Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles in the world.\n\nIt's only the second time in recent memory that two of the hot dog-shaped vehicles have appeared at the same place at one time, organizers said.\n\nCastle Noel, which is just off Medina's historic town square, was created by artist Mark Klaus. The museum has a collection of Christmas movie memorabilia, including the original slide featured in \"A Christmas Story.\"\n\nKlaus later added Alien Vacation Mini Golf to the museum, which fills a former Methodist church and several nearby buildings.\n\nSuburban D.C. travelers following their eclipse bliss pop up at Akron's Daily Pressed\n\nRandy Payne, of suburban Washington, D.C., said he decided to drive to Akron on a whim Sunday night.\n\n\"The weather gods are cooperating,\" he said Monday morning while waiting for breakfast at The Daily Pressed downtown.\n\nClouds over downtown disappeared by 11 a.m.\n\nThree others at the Daily Pressed Monday morning also drove from the D.C. area.\n\nMarquise McDonald, Frank McDonald and Lamares Alston said were staying in Pittsburgh because Cleveland was to chaotic. They plan to hover around downtown Akron to observe the moon overtake the sun.\n\nAkron Zoo opens doors, expecting 2,500 visitors on eclipse day\n\nWhen the Akron Zoo opened its doors at 11 a.m., people were already lined up outside.\n\nCarrie Bassett, the zoo's education mission manager, said that the zoo has several events planned throughout the day, including two citizen science projects.\n\nAmong the crowd is Connie Benner. Benner is celebrating her 52nd birthday today.\n\n\"I have been counting it down since I knew (the eclipse) was going down on my birthday,\" she said. Joining her is her sister in law, daughter, niece-in-law, and her great nieces and nephews.\n\n\"I just prayed for nice weather, so we have that now,\" Benner said.\n\nEarly in the day it looked like Benner's birthday wish might come true. The clouds cleared shortly before the doors open.\n\nWill early birds get best seats for eclipse?\n\nEric Flanders of Akron's North Hill neighborhood set up lawn chairs atop of one of Cuyahoga Falls’ parking garages at about 10 a.m. for himself, his wife, son and daughter to view the eclipse in the afternoon.“You never know, even today, if you’re going to get a clear view of it,” he said from the garage roof at about 10:40 a.m.Flanders said he and his family will check out the street level of Cuyahoga Falls’ EclipseFest throughout the day.\n\nBut when the moon starts to cover the sun, they plan to return to their rooftop seats.\n\nJoe Siegferth, Cuyahoga Falls Ward 4 councilor, said he will watch the eclipse this afternoon if he helping with crowd control.Siegferth said Cuyahoga Falls’ “beautiful downtown” and “walkability” makes the city well-suited to hosting many people, adding that he hopes the eclipse event allows out-of-town visitors to see what all the city has to offer — and that they decide to return.\n\nWorried about radiation from the eclipse? Don't be, NASA says\n\nNASA is using part of its website to debunk myths about today's total solar eclipse, including worries about radiation.\n\nWhen the disk of the moon fully covers the sun, NASA says, the brilliant corona emits only electromagnetic radiation, sometimes with a greenish hue.\n\n\"Being a million times fainter than the light from the sun itself, there is nothing in the coronal light that could cross 150 million kilometers of space ,penetrate our dense atmosphere, and cause blindness,\" the space agency said. \"However, if you watched the sun before totality, you will catch a glimpse of the brilliant solar surface and this can cause (eye) retinal damage.\"\n\nNASA points out that it's human instinct to quickly look away from the sun before any damage is done. But health officials urge people to wear special glasses to look at the sun leading up to the total eclipse.\n\nThe space agency said the electromagnetic radiation from the corona, seen as light, is \"perfectly safe.\"\n\nThere is also another form of radiation that travels to Earth from the sun that is also safe.\n\n\"Deep in the solar interior where nuclear fusion takes place to light the sun, particles called neutrinos are born, and zip unimpeded out of the sun and into space,\" NASA said. \"Every second, your body is pelted by trillions of these neutrinos no matter if the sun is above or below the horizon.\"\n\nThe only consequence, NASA said, is that a few atoms in your body are \"transmuted into a different isotope by absorbing a neutrino.\"\n\n\" This is an entirely harmless effect,\" NASA said.\n\nIt does not harm people, including those who are pregnant, NASA said.\n\nMr. Funs having a good time with eclipse\n\nMr. Funs Costume & Curiosity Emporium on Front Street in Cuyahoga Falls has geared up for eclipse day as if it were a festival.\n\nThe shop received a bunch of eclipse-themed merchandise over the past three week.

If you live in a mobile home, make plans ahead of time to stay with friends or family inside a sturdy building. As a last resort, severe weather experts suggest finding a ditch or ravine where you can lie low and flat on your stomach, keeping your hands over your head for protection.\n\nThose living in an apartment or university dormitory should go to the lowest possible floor of the building and into a central room away the windows.

Please visit our live blog for the latest information.\n\nNews from Friday:\n\nThe effects of Hurricane Helene's rain and winds are causing damage across East Tennessee.\n\nThe steady rain from a typical storm first started saturating East Tennessee this week, then the outer bands of Hurricane Helene, blew into the Southern Appalachians. Now the remnants of the storm have made their way here, bringing the winds that caused damage across a swath of Florida and Georgia.\n\n\"Downed trees and power lines causing power outages are expected. Turn around, don't drown,\" experts at the National Weather Service office in Morristown warned.\n\nSchools are closed and football games are canceled.\n\nHere's what we're seeing around the region. This blog will be updated throughout the day and afternoon.\n\nEmergency flash flood warning issued along Nolichucky River\n\nThe National Weather Service in Morristown issued a flash flood warning at 11:35 p.m. after Nolichucky Dam operators reported \"the failure of Nolichucky Dam causing flash flooding downstream.\"\n\nThe flash flood warning is for north central Cocke County, southwestern Greene County and southeastern Hamblen County in East Tennessee.\n\nPeople are urged to follow any evacuation order and never to drive into floodwaters.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority confirmed the report at 12:13 a.m. in a post on the social media platform X, saying, \"Potentially life-threatening flooding can occur as far downstream as Douglas Reservoir.\"\n\nDouglas Reservoir is about 40 miles west of Nolichucky Dam and about six miles south of the juncture of Interstates 40 and 81.\n\nThe Nolichucky Dam, eight miles southwest of Greeneville, was built in 1913 and is no longer a hydroelectric station. It creates the Davy Crockett Reservoir, a prime location for smallmouth bass fishing.\n\nThe Nolichucky River starts in North Carolina and flows into the French Broad River in East Tennessee. It's a world-class whitewater rafting destination.\n\nEarlier, TVA had announced the Nolichucky Dam in Greene County was nearing its threshold, though the dam had not failed.\n\nThe extreme rainfall is finally making its way through the rivers and dams, causing them to rise even as the rain has stopped.\n\nThe Nolichucky River at the Nolichucky Dam rose from 43.32 feet at 4 p.m. Sept. 25 to 62.57 feet at 10:15 p.m. Sept. 27, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration models. The measurements are qualified, meaning they are combined with local expertise and experience to arrive at true figures.\n\nGov. Bill Lee declares an emergency\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed an executive order for \"critical relief to victims of severe weather and flooding.\"\n\nHe asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide resources as well.\n\nU.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn asked President Joe Biden to approve Lee's request for a disaster declaration.\n\n\"Catastrophic flash flooding has devastated communities across East Tennessee, causing I-40 to collapse and leaving homes destroyed,\" she wrote in the letter.\n\nSevier County asks residents to conserve water\n\nParts of Sevier County are served by Newport Utility District, which is experiencing significant flooding.\n\nCustomers in these areas are asked to only use water if necessary due to critically low levels:\n\nJones Cove Road\n\nRichardson Cove Road\n\nBogard Road\n\nPearl Valley Road\n\nEven though the rain is mostly over for Knoxville, risks from flooding and strong winds continue through at least 8 p.m. Sept. 27, the National Weather Service warns.\n\nFlood watches and flash flood warnings are continuing through today.\n\nHigh wind warnings have been issued essentially for the whole day as well. Gusts will be high in the mountains of course, but even in the valley they will be dangerous.\n\nOfficials in Cocke County urged all of downtown Newport to evacuate immediately just after 3 p.m. Sept. 27 following reports that a North Carolina dam had \"suffered a catastrophic failure,\" though the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said around 4:40 p.m. it was told by Duke Energy the dam had not failed.\n\nRegardless of the specifics of what happened at the dam, dangerous flooding was widespread in Newport, displaying homeowners and city operations and prompting the evacuation of the Cocke County Jail.\n\nSeveral water rescues have taken place. The Newport Community Center at 433 Prospect Ave. is open for people who do not have a safe place to stay.\n\nRain forced the closure of Interstate 40 East in Cocke County at exit 432 as high water from the Pigeon River threatened to overflow onto the interstate, said Tennessee Department of Transportation spokesperson Mark Nagi.\n\nThe Pigeon River at Newport rose to over three times its flood stage by 3 p.m. Sept. 27, blowing past record levels when it reached over 26 feet high. The previous record was 23 feet, 4 inches.\n\nSimilarly, the French Broad at Newport had reached over 18 feet by 2:45 p.m., but was expected to reach 23 feet. The record for the river is 24 feet.\n\nFifty-four people were rescued from the roof of Unicoi County Hospital Sept. 27 after dangerous flooding brought on by Tropical Storm Helene forced their evacuation.\n\nStaff and patients had to be evacuated because of \"unusually high and rising water from the Nolichucky River,\" Ballad Health, which owns the hospital, wrote on social media. Floodwaters and high winds complicated reaching the evacuees by boats or helicopters.\n\nVirginia State Police finished the rescue mission around 4:45 p.m. using two helicopters. The Knox County Sheriff's Office was sending its aviation team, Air Rescue 6, to assist with the rescue.\n\nIn the hours after the rescue, Unicoi County residents gathered near the hospital to take in the jaw-dropping scene of rushing water and floating debris. What now resembles a river, Unicoi County Clerk Patty Treadway told Knox News, used to be a pasture where neighbors saw the occasional horse.\n\n\"It's unbelievable,\" she said. \"It's something I've never seen before, and I've lived here my whole life.\"\n\nWant alerts texted to you in the wake of Helene?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/02/17/springfield-mo-weather-snow-cold-winter-storm-warning/78964269007/", "title": "Springfield, MO weather forecast predicts several inches of snow", "text": "AI-assisted summary The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for southwest Missouri, with heavy snow expected from Tuesday through Wednesday morning.\n\nForecasters predict snowfall amounts of 6-10 inches, with some areas potentially receiving up to 14 inches.\n\nStrong winds, gusting up to 30 mph, could create blizzard-like conditions and significantly reduce visibility, making travel hazardous or impossible.\n\nA winter storm warning for southwest Missouri in place through at least Wednesday morning includes the likelihood of 6-10 inches of heavy snow.\n\n\"We are very confident in that forecast,\" said meteorologist Gene Hatch, who works at the National Weather Service's Springfield office.\n\nHe said forecast models are showing \"at least 5 inches\" of snow will fall in the region but many areas may get more. \"Some of our models are showing upwards of 14 inches,\" he said.\n\nSnowfall amounts of that magnitude are uncommon.
