Here are the highs and lows of his tumultuous premiership:\n\n24 July 2019: Johnson assumes office\n\nAfter becoming prime minister just over three years ago, Johnson promised to defy “the doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters” by delivering Brexit within 99 days.\n\nIn a speech outside 10 Downing Street that was “infused with patriotic pronouncements”, said The Guardian, Johnson declared that “people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts”. Following three years of “unfounded self-doubt”, the PM said, it was “time to change the record”.\n\nBrexit “broke” Theresa May, wrote Alan McGuinness for Sky News, but Johnson’s “unique blend of rhetoric and optimism” was “the perfect tonic for a party that wants to feel good about itself again”.\n\n3 September 2019: he loses his majority\n\nJohnson faced a major showdown with his own MPs as they sought to block the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe “opening gambit” in an “acrimonious” debate was the defection of Phillip Lee, a Conservative MP who crossed the floor to join the benches of the Liberal Democrats as the prime minister addressed the Commons, reported Politico. He accused the government of using “political manipulation, bullying and lies” to push through its plans on Brexit.\n\nJohnson later removed the whip from 21 rebel Tories for voting against the government. The rebels included Ken Clarke, an MP since 1970, and Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill.\n\n13 December 2019: a general election victory\n\nAfter forcing an election over the Commons stalemate on Brexit, Johnson secured a “crushing victory” as voters backed his pledge to “get Brexit done”, reported The Guardian.\n\nThe Conservatives won 364 of the 650 seats up for grabs, in what the paper noted was “the party’s best showing in a parliamentary election since Margaret Thatcher triumphed in 1987”.\n\nEqually “astonishing” were the crushing defeats in the historic Labour heartlands, said the BBC’s political correspondent Nick Eardley. “Labour, by contrast, could hardly be in a worse position,” Eardley wrote.\n\n7 April 2020: Johnson is admitted to intensive care with Covid-19\n\nJust four months after his election victory high, in what The New York Times described as a “cruel reversal” of fortunes, the PM was admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 – the first major world leader reported to have contracted the virus.\n\nThe then foreign secretary Dominic Raab deputised throughout Johnson’s illness, which briefly “plunged the country back into the uncertainty Britons thought they had left behind” after so recently emerging from the “paralysis and polarisation” of Brexit, said the paper.\n\nIn an interview with The Sun on Sunday, the PM later revealed that he needed “litres and litres” of oxygen during his three-day stay in St Thomas’ intensive care unit in London, and that it was “50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe”.\n\n13 November 2020: Dominic Cummings resigns\n\nDominic Cummings “was seen leaving No. 10 a short while ago carrying a box”, reported the BBC, as Johnson’s closest adviser and key ally quit following a dispute that also triggered the resignation of communications director Lee Cain.\n\nTheir departures would “mark the end of the Vote Leave clique’s iron grip on government”, said the Daily Mail. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg described Cummings’ exit as “a political explosion”.\n\nAlthough Cummings would frame his departure as part of a long-term master plan, insiders told the BBC’s political editor that he “jumped because otherwise he would be pushed soon”. Johnson had recently come to see that his former aide’s band of “Brexit Boys” were just “in it for themselves”, the source claimed.\n\n8 December 2020: vaccination programme begins to roll out\n\nOne of the biggest successes for Johnson and his government was the UK’s Covid-19 vaccination programme. Indeed, “Britain soared ahead of every comparable country in the weeks after the vaccines became available, with the one exception being Israel”, said Hugo Gye of the i news site.\n\nBut criticism was not far behind. “Global leadership is an unaccustomed status for a country with one of the highest rates of excess deaths in western Europe,” said the Financial Times. “Multiple missteps”, such as the much-maligned NHS Track and Trace system, meant that “cynicism” remained over the government’s handling of the pandemic, the paper reported.\n\n21 December 2020: Christmas is ‘cancelled’\n\nThe hopes of a Christmas with loved ones were “dashed” for almost 20 million people after Johnson placed London and large parts of the southeast under “draconian” Tier-4 coronavirus restrictions, said PoliticsHome.\n\nJohnson had previously promised that Britons would be allowed to form “bubbles” with two other households over the Christmas period.\n\n“I want to be clear, we don’t want to ban Christmas,” Johnson told a press conference on 16 December. “And I think that would be frankly inhuman and against the instincts of many people in this country.”\n\nBut a few days later, families were told they could not mix after all.\n\n29 May 2021: Johnson marries fiancée Carrie Symonds\n\nAfter a turbulent year, Johnson married Carrie Symonds in a secretly planned Catholic ceremony at Westminster Cathedral.\n\nOnly 30 people attended the Covid-compliant wedding, as Johnson became the first PM to marry in office for “nearly 200 years”, the BBC reported.\n\nSome “disgruntled” congregants questioned how “the twice-divorced prime minister was able to marry in a Catholic church”, said The Telegraph.\n\n19 July 2021: England’s ‘Freedom Day’\n\nAs England prepared for all social distancing rules to be lifted on what some newspapers dubbed “Freedom Day”, both Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were accused of trying to “dodge” self-isolation rules, after being in close contact with health secretary Sajid Javid, who had tested positive for coronavirus, reported the BBC.\n\nNo. 10 initially said that Johnson and Sunak would not isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involved daily testing. But the duo were forced to “perform a full reversal little more than two-and-a-half hours” later, amid widespread anger as opposition parties suggested there was “one rule for them and one for the rest of us”, reported Sky News.\n\n30 November 2021: Partygate allegations\n\nThe first allegations that Boris Johnson and Downing Street staff might have broken the government’s own Covid rules by holding parties and events during the 2020 Christmas holidays were reported by the Mirror.\n\nThe paper said that at least two parties had taken place. The PM was reported to have given a speech at a “packed leaving do” for a senior aide. And at a second event, while the rest of the country was locked down at home, officials were said to have “knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa”.\n\nDowning Street did not deny that the events had taken place, but a spokesperson insisted that “Covid rules have been followed at all times”.\n\nHowever, in a hint that further damaging revelations were to follow, a source told the Mirror that there had been “many social gatherings” in Downing Street over the holiday season.\n\n25 January 2022: Scotland Yard launches probe\n\nThe Metropolitan Police launched an official investigation into alleged Covid rule-breaking by lawmakers and officials, following a string of damaging revelations in the press and an internal government investigation conducted by top civil servant Sue Gray.\n\nNamed Operation Hillman, the police probe focused on 12 alleged incidents on eight dates between May 2020 and April 2021, and examined more than 500 documents and 300 photographs gathered by the Gray investigation.\n\nThe force sent more than 100 questionnaires to those suspected of attending parties at Downing Street and Whitehall, including Johnson, that asked for “an account and explanation of the recipient’s participation”. According to the Mirror, Johnson was thought to have attended at least seven of the parties investigated by the Met.\n\n9 April 2022: Johnson visits Ukraine\n\nIn what No. 10 called a “show of solidarity” with Ukraine amid the Russian invasion, Johnson made an unannounced visit to Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nJohnson paid tribute to “Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people”, adding that “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv”.\n\n“I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run,” the PM said. “We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.”\n\nJohnson pledged new lethal aid to Ukraine in the form of “120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems”, as well as further economic support for the embattled nation, “taking total UK loan guarantees to £770m”, the BBC reported.\n\nIn a televised statement, he said that Ukrainians had shown “the courage of a lion” and that their president had “given the roar of that lion”.\n\n12 April 2022: fined over lockdown parties\n\nJohnson became “the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned” after the Met issued him with a £50 fixed penalty notice for attending a party for his birthday at No. 10 in June 2020, reported The Guardian.\n\nHis wife was also fined for attending the surprise birthday party, as was Rishi Sunak.\n\nAfter Gray’s long-awaited report was published in May, pressure from within the Conservative Party grew on Johnson, with a “drip feed of no confidence letters” being sent to Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee, along with senior Tory MPs publicly calling for the PM to go.\n\n“Veteran Tory” Bob Neill, chairman of the Commons Justice Committee, added his name to that list, “saying he did not regard the PM’s explanations as ‘credible’”, reported Sky News.\n\n6 June 2022: narrowly wins confidence vote\n\nMounting dissatisfaction with Johnson finally boiled over in June when the necessary threshold of Tory MPs submitted letters to the 1922 committee withdrawing their support for the prime minister, triggering a confidence vote.\n\nIn the end, a majority of Tory MPs backed the prime minister. But the margin of victory – 211 votes for to 148 against – was much closer than many had expected.\n\nDespite Johnson describing the vote win as “decisive” and “an opportunity to put behind us all the stuff that the media goes on about”, the BBC said: “The scale of the rebellion against him showed his authority had been weakened.”\n\nNoting the vote share in support of Johnson was lower than the 63% received by former prime minister Theresa May when she won a party confidence vote in 2018 before resigning six months later over a Brexit deadlock, the BBC’s political editor Chris Mason said: “The simple truth is when more than four in ten of your own MPs think the country would be better off without you, you have a problem.”\n\nNevertheless, under existing Tory party rules, the win meant Johnson was immune from a Conservative leadership challenge for a year.\n\n15 June 2022: ethics adviser quits\n\nA week after the confidence vote, Lord Geidt, Johnson’s ethics adviser, quit, saying he had been put in an “impossible and odious position”.\n\nGeidt had threatened to quit the previous month after concluding that there were “legitimate” questions about whether the prime minister broke the ministerial code over the lockdown parties scandal in Downing Street.\n\n30 June: the Chris Pincher affair\n\nWhat started off as a sexual harassment story featuring yet another Tory MP in the end proved to be the final nail in the coffin of Johnson’s political career.\n\nChris Pincher, the MP for Tamworth and the deputy chief whip, resigned from the government on 1 July and was suspended from the Conservative Party a day later in the wake of allegations that he groped two men in the private members’ Carlton Club.\n\nYet as more historic allegations emerged, Johnson was accused of ignoring warnings of inappropriate behaviour by Pincher before appointing him to the role of deputy chief whip in February 2022.\n\n“Under mounting pressure to reveal what he knew” before appointing him to the whips’ office, which oversees discipline within the party, Johnson and his aides repeatedly obfuscated and changed their story, said the BBC.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News’ Kay Burley, education minister Will Quince said he had been given “categorical assurance” from No. 10 that Johnson was “not aware of any serious specific allegations” against Pincher when he was appointed. But within hours, the prime minister’s official spokesman admitted that Johnson had been “aware of media reports that others had seen over the years”.\n\nIn an attempt to put an end to the growing furore Johnson issued a full apology in an interview with the BBC’s Chris Mason but it was too late, with senior cabinet ministers Javid and Sunak announcing their resignations as the interview aired.\n\n7 July: he announces his resignation\n\nJavid’s decision to quit as health secretary on 5 July triggered the deluge of resignations that ultimately toppled Johnson.\n\nIn a seismic 48 hours in Westminster, more than 50 ministers followed Javid in protest at Johnson’s decision to remain in Downing Street.\n\nHaving initially sought to stem the tide by quickly appointing replacements to the cabinet, by the morning of 7 July the game was up after it became clear he had lost the support of almost all his MPs and a flurry of junior ministerial resignations left his government struggling to function.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation outside No. 10 surrounded by his family and closest aides, Johnson delivered what politics lecturer Paula Keaveney described on The Conversation as “a bitter resignation speech” that “was followed by objections over its tone and led to calls for him to depart straight away rather than staying on until his successor is appointed”.\n\n6 September: he finally stands down as PM\n\nHaving taken the dramatic step of calling – and winning - a confidence vote in his own government in the days after his resignation announcement Johnson was able to stay on in No. 10 while a new leader was chosen.\n\nDespite the UK being in the grips of a cost-of-living crisis, the outgoing prime minister was accused of shirking his responsibilities and leading a “zombie government” by his critics, a view not helped by his decision to take numerous holidays abroad over the summer.\n\nHe departed Downing Street with the threat of an ongoing Commons inquiry into whether he deliberately misled Parliament still hanging over him.\n\nYet even with the threat of losing his Uxbridge seat and the unceremonious way he was thrown out by his own MPs, many, including perhaps Johnson himself, see this not as the end but merely a prelude to a second act.\n\n“When it comes to Johnson’s numerous misdemeanours, Conservatives seem eager to forgive and forget as soon as possible, with many not seeming to think there is anything to forgive,” said Prospect.\n\nJohnson suggested as much with his final PMQs, signing off with the phrase “Hasta la vista, baby”.\n\nGiven his extraordinary political career it would be foolish to write off such a dramatic return completely.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/election-2024-live-updates-house-control/76094069007/", "title": "Election 2024 recap: Dozens of House races still not decided", "text": "All eyes were on vote counts in pivotal U.S. House races Thursday as both political parties hoped to seize control of the lower chamber for 2025. It's a last chance at power for Democrats after Donald Trump claimed the White House early Wednesday while Republicans gained a majority in the Senate.\n\nIt will take 218 seats to rule the House, and although neither party has reached the threshold, the numbers appear to favor the GOP. The Associated Press count put Democrats in 197 seats while Republicans had claimed 209. Dozens of races remained too close to call Thursday afternoon.\n\nEarlier in the day, Democrats locked down two seats. Rep. Val Hoyle, a first-term congresswoman seeking reelection in western Oregon, defeated Republican Monique DeSpain, an Air Force veteran. Hoyle succeeded longtime Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio in 2022. And in New York state, Laura Gillen ended the reelection bid of Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry defended his seat.

And I assured him that I would direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That is what the American people deserve.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky, Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump names Susie Wiles as White House Chief of Staff\n\nAs expected, Donald Trump has asked 2024 campaign manager Susie Wiles to be the new White House Chief of Staff.\n\n“Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns,” Trump said in a statement.\n\nTrump described Wiles as \"tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected ... It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history.\"\n\nWiles is the daughter of former pro football player and NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRacist texts about plantations, KKK reported nationwide after and before election: Reports\n\nMultiple people in different states have reported receiving racially motivated texts a day before or after the 2024 election, with messages ranging from threats of the Ku Klux Klan to directives to \"pick cotton at the nearest plantation,\" according to multiple reports and local law enforcement officials.\n\nResidents in at least Georgia, Detroit, Michigan, Virginia, Ohio, Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina spoke to local newspapers or TV stations about the anonymous text messages they received either before or after Election Day. A woman, who Fox 2 in Detroit identified as Renee, shared the text message she received around 9:50 p.m. on Wednesday with the TV station.\n\n\"Good afternoon Renee! You have been chosen to pick cotton at your nearest plantation,\" the text message read, per Fox 2. \"Be ready at 10am with all of your personal items & possessions because you will never see them again. We will pick you up in a white bus. You will be checked for drugs & other substances! Once you make it here you will be brought to your designed area. You are in group 10B\".\n\nUSA TODAY contacted the FBI about the text messages on Thursday but did not immediately receive a response.\n\n– Jonathan Limehouse\n\nRepublican Dave McCormick ousts incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania Senate race\n\nGOP businessman Dave McCormick has ousted Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, toppling a three-term incumbent he’d relentlessly attacked as ineffectual and weak.\n\nHe prevailed by chipping away at his opponent's significant advantages as someone who has campaigned across the commonwealth for decades and whose name has been prominent in Pennsylvania politics for generations.\n\nThe race drew national attention for its potential to flip a seat from blue to red in the Senate, where Democrats have enjoyed a slim majority.\n\n– Bethany Rodgers\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell says he won’t resign if Trump asks him to step down\n\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday he won’t step down if Donald Trump asks him to resign.\n\n“No,” Powell said when posed that question at his first press conference since Trump’s victory this week over Kamala Harris.\n\nPressed whether he believes he would be legally obligated to step down, Powell responded, “No.” He later clarified that he believes that he would not be obligated to leave under federal law.\n\nTrump, who appointed Powell to his first four-year term in 2017, has regularly criticized Powell’s performance as the head of the nation’s central banking system, with the power to lower and raise interest rates. The Fed lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point Thursday, its second straight rate cut amid easing inflation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden reappointed Powell to a second four-year term in 2021.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump pledges to follow through on mass deportations – and doesn't say what it might cost\n\nDonald Trump in an interview with NBC News pledged to follow though with mass deportations of migrants who crossed the border illegally – and denied concerns about the cost of his plan.\n\n\"It’s not a question of a price tag ... we have no choice,\" Trump told NBC, claiming that too many criminals and drug lords are in the country illegally. The president-elect has not elaborated on the details of how such a massive undertaking might work.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance has estimated Trump's actions could result in 1 million people being removed from the country each year, a pace the nonpartisan American Immigration Council estimated would cost about $88 billion annually. To deport all the people in the U.S. without authorization would take about a decade and cost nearly a trillion dollars, the council said.\n\nIn his chat with NBC, Trump said immigration played a major role in his election win. Trump also confirmed that he had \"nice\" and \"very respectful\" calls with Harris and Biden.\n\nHarris \"talked about (the) transition, and she said she’d like it to be smooth as can be,\" Trump said. \"Which I agree with, of course.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden stands by late departure from 2024 race, White House says\n\nJoe Biden stands by his decision to drop out of the race and the timing of his departure, the White House said Thursday, amid criticism from some Democrats that he should have done so earlier.\n\n“He was very proud of when he made that decision to hand over the torch, pass the torch to the vice president,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “He believed it was the right decision to make at that time. He believed that she was ready.”\n\nSome Democrats have criticized Biden for waiting until July 21 before to drop out of the election. Exiting a year earlier would have allowed for an open competitive primary for Democrats to field a nominee.\n\nAsked whether Biden believes he would won had he stayed in the race, Jean-Pierre reiterated the president believes he “made the right decision.”\n\nJean-Pierre would not not say whether Biden accepts any blame for Vice President Kamala Harris’ election loss to Trump.\n\n“He’s going to respect the will of the people,” she said.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nWhite House blames ‘global headwinds’ after Harris election loss\n\nThe White House blamed “global headwinds” facing incumbent political leaders worldwide as an underlying factor in Vice President Kamala Harris’ election loss to President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pointed Thursday to global supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which fueled an increase in inflation in the United States and around the world over the last couple years.\n\n\"What we saw two nights ago was not unusual to what we have seen from the incumbents around the world on the global stage,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak lost reelection this year, French President Emmanuel Macron suffered parliamentary losses, and the parties of prime ministers of Japan and South Korea lost majorities in their respective legislative bodies, among several other setbacks for incumbents.\n\nBiden committed to a peaceful transfer of power in a Rose Garden speech Thursday but has not addressed reporters following Trump’s resounding election victory, which saw Biden’s party lose considerable support among Latino men and working-class voters.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of postmortem analysis of what happened in the coming days, in the coming weeks, even in the coming months,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"And so, I'm going to leave those questions to the election experts. That is certainly not my role today.\"\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump to donors: What should I do on day one?\n\nThe Trump campaign has sent a new text message to donors, but it is asking for advice rather than money.\n\n\"I have one more question to ask you before I take back the White House,\" Trump said in the message. \"WHAT SHOULD BE MY PRIORITY ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY?\"\n\nCheckoff options include: \"Build The Wall,\" \"Stop Skyrocketing Crime,\" \"Save The Economy,\" \"Fix Health Care,\" \"Protection The Second Amendment,\" and \"Other.\" During the campaign, Trump said he wanted to be a \"dictator\" on day one when it came to border security and energy production.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump's win could spell the end of Biden's higher education policies\n\nDonald Trump's sweeping election victory likely signals the undoing of much of President Joe Biden’s efforts to reform higher education in the U.S.\n\nIn his years at the helm of the federal government, Biden approved billions of dollars in student loan forgiveness, cracked down on colleges that rip students off and worked to codify new protections for LGBTQ+ students. Those efforts – some of which sparked controversies and brought setbacks – are among the key Democratic priorities that Trump's win threatens.\n\nThe rhetoric of the former president on the campaign trail, and his actions while in office, offer ample evidence of his goals. He spent much of his first term dismantling higher education regulations set by former President Barack Obama, who was unusually hawkish on the issue of college oversight.\n\nTuesday's election results shined a spotlight on the partisan divide between Americans with college degrees and those without them.\n\nThough it’s unclear what the president-elect will accomplish with another four years in the White House, he will likely capitalize on that mandate from noncollege-educated voters to chart a far different path from Biden for America’s universities, and, by extension, for the millions of people who attend college in hopes of securing the best future for themselves and their families.\n\n– Zachary Schermele\n\nLGBTQ+ hotlines experience influx in crisis calls amid 2024 presidential election\n\nCrisis services for the LGBTQ+ community have seen a sharp uptick in usage during election week, according to a national LGBTQ+ organization.\n\nSince around midnight on Tuesday, The Trevor Project's classic crisis services, which include a lifeline, chat and text, have experienced an approximately 125% increase in contact compared to normal days, The Trevor Project CEO Jaymes Black said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThis influx follows a 200% increase in election-related conversations to The Trevor Project's classic crisis services reported Nov. 3-4. Key words like \"election\" and \"rights\" were used to determine this figure, according to a news release.\n\nIncreased rates of outreach to The Trevor Project come after the LGBTQ+ community was commonly thrust into discourse on the presidential campaign trail and as the community feels anxious about future legislation.\n\n– Greta Cross\n\nBiden congratulates Trump, pledges smooth transition\n\nPresident Joe Biden pledged his administration's full support Thursday for a smooth transition of power, two days after Vice President Kamala Harris's run to replace him was ended by Trump's triumph.\n\n\"In a democracy the will of the people always prevails,\" said Biden, addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden. \"Yesterday I spoke with President-elect Trump to congratulate him on his victory. And I assured him that I would direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That is what the American people deserve.\"\n\nBiden's unifying tone was a sharp contrast to Trump's furious response to defeat four years ago, when Trump alleged baseless claims of fraud in an unrelenting but ultimately failed effort to overturn Biden's victory.\n\nBiden also lauded Harris, saying his \"partner and public servant\" ran an inspiring campaign. Harris, who conceded a day earlier, had claimed the Democratic nomination after Biden dropped out of the race in July amid concerns about his mental acuity.\n\n\"Setbacks are unavoidable but giving up is unforgiveable. We all get knocked down,\" Biden said. \"A defeat does not mean we are defeated.\"\n\nAlso Thursday, Trump's campaign said Biden had invited him to meet at the White House at an unspecified time. The White House said last week that Biden would attend his successor’s inauguration in January regardless of who that successor was.\n\nAll quiet on the Trump front\n\nLittle has been heard from Trump, who hasn't even posted on Truth Social since his victory speech early Wednesday. Trump is reportedly spending a lot of time on the phone, including calls with world leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jinping, French President Emmanuel Macron, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAnother probable reason for the silence: Team Trump is moving from a political campaign to a government transition. During the campaign, Trump said he didn't want to talk about the transition because it would be bad luck to do so before Election Day. Now the transition talk is likely dominating his time.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nTop House Democrat congratulates Trump on victory\n\nHouse Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., released a statement Thursday congratulating Trump on his victory.\n\n“I am proud that the Democratic Party does not believe in election denial. Our Democracy is precious and it involves elevating public trust in our system of free and fair elections, not undermining it,” Jeffries wrote. “We cannot love America only when we win. The American people have spoken. I congratulate President-elect Donald J. Trump.”\n\nHe added that Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are “remarkable public servants who ran an inspired and positive campaign focused on lifting people up.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDefense Secretary Austin says military will stay out of politics\n\nThe Pentagon is committed to an orderly transition to a Trump administration and is ready to carry out \"all lawful orders,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. Austin is a Biden appointee whose stint as secretary will end after Trump selects and wins Senate approval for a new secretary.\n\nTrump, during his campaign, talked about facing an \"enemy from within,\" specifying some Democratic leaders.\n\nAustin, in a memo to U.S. troops sent out on Wednesday night and publicly released Thursday, pledged that the military was ready to \"stand apart from the political arena; to stand guard over our republic with principle and professionalism; and to stand together with the valued allies and partners who deepen our security.\"\n\nWhat role will JD Vance play in the Trump administration?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump hasn't talked much about how his second administration will operate, but Vice President-elect JD Vance appears to have at least two roles locked up: cheerleader and communicator.\n\n\"He is a feisty guy, isn’t he?\" Trump said of his 40-year-old running mate during his victory speech Wednesday.\n\nAfter securing the vice presidential nomination, Vance happily played the role of Trump's attack dog as he barnstormed the 2024 swing states. He maintained an antagonistic presence on social media and called Harris \"trash\" − a nod to President Joe Biden's \"garbage\" gaffe. The freshman Ohio senator also gave more media interviews than anyone at the top of the ticket − 152, according to his campaign − and turned press conferences into part of the show at his rallies.\n\n\"I know the president wants me to be involved in everything, and I certainly hope to be,\" he told USA TODAY in September.\n\n− David Jackson and Haley BeMiller\n\nWhat kind of VP will Vance be? Trump's cheerleader and top fighter\n\nPower 'trifecta' could ease path for Trump, GOP\n\nRepublicans have won the White House and Senate and appear poised to retain their majority in the House. If that happens, what can voters expect from unified Republican control of all three power centers?\n\nFrom swift appointments of Trump's Cabinet choices to major changes in policy, Republicans in Congress are likely to use their leverage to advance Trump‘s priorities and will likely face few roadblocks from the Democratic minority. Trump's policy priorities include curbing immigration and rolling back regulations on everything from home building to energy production.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nWhat do the election results mean for you?Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for breaking news and exclusive analysis.\n\nGOP trifecta?

In a statement shared on social media, the U.S. senator from Vermont said party leadership must have \"serious political discussions\" about Latino and Black workers voting for Republican candidates.\n\n\"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,\" Sanders wrote. \"While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they’re right.\"\n\nSanders, 83, who runs as an independent but routinely aligns with Democrats, won a fourth Senate term on Election Day, defeating Republican challenger Gerald Malloy. He joined the Senate in 2007 after being elected in to the U.S. House in 1991. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in in 2016 and 2020.\n\n− Anthony Robledo\n\nWhat key states did Trump win on Election Day?\n\nTrump won the first swing state called on election night, North Carolina. He also notched victories in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe former president also picked up Republican strongholds across the country on Tuesday, from Texas to Montana and South Carolina.

She has refused to step down and is attempting to build a majority coalition with the support of Northern Ireland's socially conservative Democratic Unionist Party. May's conservatives are eight seats short of a majority in the House of Commons; the DUP holds 10 seats.\n\nSome conservatives want her out, and former high-ranking party member George Osborne on Sunday dismissed her as \"dead woman walking.\" May shrugged off the criticism and said she won't resign.\n\n\"I said during the election campaign that ... I would serve a full term,\" she said Sunday.\n\nThe prime minister soldiered on, announcing a modest Cabinet reshuffle. Former London mayor Boris Johnson remains foreign secretary, and Amber Rudd keeps her job as home secretary. But close May ally Damian Green, who held the post of work and pensions secretary, moves up to first secretary of state — essentially May's second in command.\n\nJohnson was quick to deny rumors that he would lead the effort to remove May. \"I am backing Theresa may. Let's get on with the job,\" he tweeted.\n\nMay faced more controversy Sunday when The Guardian newspaper reported Trump told May in a phone conversation \"in recent weeks\" that he did not want to make a state visit to the United Kingdom if it would prompt large protests. The Guardian cited a May adviser who was in the room when the call was made.\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was delighted, tweeting: \"Cancellation of President Trump's State Visit is welcome, especially after his attack on London's mayor & withdrawal from #ParisClimateDeal.\"\n\nThe Guardian story drew wide coverage, compelling May to address it, although she didn't deny it.\n\n\"We aren’t going to comment on speculation about the contents of private phone conversations,\" May's office said in a statement. \"The Queen extended an invitation to President Trump to visit the U.K and there is no change to those plans.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May vows to stay after Conservatives lose majority\n\nBritish election: What's a 'hung Parliament' and what happens now?\n\nU.K. election: Why it matters to the U.S., and more\n\nThe White House said the visit never came up, and no date was set. Still, the reaffirmed invite sounded markedly less warm than when May extended the invitation from Queen Elizabeth II to Trump days after his election. May's Conservative Party held a majority in Parliament when she became the first foreign leader to visit Trump at the White House and announced she was “delighted\" that Trump agreed to the visit.\n\nNow she is fighting for political survival, and Trump isn't helping her cause. Trump's America-first mantra has never played well in Britain. Then last week the president ignited controversy when he called out London Mayor Sadiq Khan over his response to the recent London terrorist attack that left eight people dead.\n\nKhan said Londoners should not be concerned by an increased police presence on the streets after the attacks on London Bridge and at Borough Market.\n\nTrump's Twitter response: \"Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his 'no reason to be alarmed' statement.\"\n\nKhan then called for Trump's visit to be canceled.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/07/07/british-prime-minister-boris-johnson-agrees-step-down-uk-media-reports/7828134001/", "title": "Boris Johnson to resign as British prime minister as scandals roil UK", "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Thursday that he would resign, ending an unprecedented political crisis that has roiled the United Kingdom.\n\n\"It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore a new prime minister,\" Johnson said outside his office at No. 10 Downing St. in London.\n\nJohnson said the process to select his successor would begin immediately and a timetable for the change in leadership would be announced next week.\n\nHe said it was \"painful\" for him to leave office but conceded he had failed to push back against an onslaught of opposition from his own party ministers urging him to resign.\n\n\"I am sad to be giving up the best job in the world, but them's the breaks,\" Johnson said Thursday.\n\nJohnson said he tried to convince his colleagues over the past few days that it would be “eccentric” to change governments when his administration is delivering and his party is just a few points behind in the polls.\n\n“The herd instinct is powerful,\" he said. \"And when the herd moves, it moves. And, my friends, in politics, no one is remotely indispensable.”\n\nJohnson’s departure will end his three-year turn as Britain's leader. Days of turmoil were triggered by his evolving explanations of what he knew about a sexual misconduct scandal involving one of his allies. Two of Johnson's top Cabinet ministers quit this week, followed by more than 30 others who said they could no longer serve under his leadership and who urged him to step down.\n\nJohnson’s hold on power has weakened for months amid a cost-of-living crisis exacerbated by Britain's departure from the European Union, known as \"Brexit,\" which Johnson championed. Even as he rebuffed calls to quit, his leadership was further shaken by the resignations of treasury chief Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid.\n\nBoth quit Tuesday, saying they could no longer support Johnson because of his handling of ethics scandals, including the case of Chris Pincher, who resigned as deputy chief whip amid complaints that he groped two men at a private club.\n\nTheir announcements opened the floodgates, and by Thursday, more than 40 ministers had abandoned Johnson.\n\nNadhim Zahawi resigned 36 hours after Johnson tapped him to replace Sunak as treasury chief, and another newly appointed Cabinet minister quit her post.\n\nZahawi said Johnson knew “the right thing to do” was to “go now.”\n\nWhat comes next for Britain's leadership?\n\nBritish voters elect a party, not a leader. Johnson's exit will lead to an internal Conservative Party selection process to determine the next prime minister. There are no outright front-runners to replace Johnson, though Sunak could be a favorite.\n\nJohnson vowed to support his successor, who he predicted would be \"equally committed to taking this country forward through tough times.”\n\nThe new prime minister is unlikely to have a major impact on Britain's \"special relationship\" with the United States, its closest ally. The U.S.-U.K. alliance, which encompasses national security, defense, intelligence sharing, trade and close cultural ties, enjoys bipartisan support. Nor is there likely to be any change to Britain's support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Second to the United States, Britain has contributed the most heavy weaponry to Ukraine.\n\n'Desperate' to cling to power?\n\nA group of Johnson’s most trusted Cabinet ministers visited him at his office in Downing Street on Wednesday, telling him to stand down after he lost the trust of his party, according to The Associated Press. Johnson instead fought for his political career and fired one of the Cabinet officials, Michael Gove, British media reported.\n\nIt is rare for a prime minister to cling to office in the face of so much pressure from his Cabinet colleagues. The Guardian’s front page on Thursday called Johnson “Desperate, deluded.”\n\n“He’s breached the trust that was put in him. He needs to recognize that he no longer has the moral authority to lead. And for him, it’s over,” Scottish National Party leader Ian Blackford told The Associated Press.\n\nWho is Boris Johnson?\n\nJohnson, 58, had a knack for wiggling out of tight spots. He remained in power despite allegations that he was too close to party donors, that he protected supporters from bullying and corruption accusations and that he misled Parliament and was dishonest to the public about government office parties that broke pandemic lockdown rules.\n\nA former London mayor with a quirky persona and an unruly mane – who drew comparisons, not all of them accurate, to former President Donald Trump – Johnson rose to power in 2019 after a referendum approved by voters three years earlier that called for the U.K. to leave the European Union.\n\nJohnson, one of the loudest voices behind the so-called Brexit movement, was elevated to prime minister after his predecessor, Theresa May, repeatedly failed to get her Brexit plan through a skeptical Parliament.\n\nJohnson swept into power with a mandate to \"get Brexit done.\" His victory represented the biggest parliamentary majority in the House of Commons since Margaret Thatcher's election victory in 1987.\n\nThursday, Johnson thanked voters for handing him that mandate.\n\n\"The reason I have fought so hard in the last few days to continue to deliver that mandate in person was not just because I wanted to do so but because I felt it was my job, my duty, my obligation to you to continue to do what we promised in 2019,\" he said.\n\nJohnson was wounded by revelations about government employees boozing at No. 10 Downing St. during coronavirus lockdowns. The scandal, which the British media dubbed \"Partygate,\" helped trigger a no-confidence vote against him in June.\n\nSome lawmakers in Johnson’s Conservative Party worried that the leader renowned for his affability could be a liability in elections. Many were concerned about Johnson's ability to govern at a time of increasing economic and social strain. Johnson narrowly survived the no-confidence vote in June, when 41% of lawmakers voted against him.\n\nHis support among Britons eroded. A YouGov poll released Wednesday showed that 69% of Britons, including 54% of Conservative voters, said he should resign. Just 18% said he should remain in office.\n\nBefore he announced he would quit, Johnson’s opponents hoped to change party rules to allow a new no-confidence vote against him. Under current rules, they had to wait a year before mounting another formal leadership challenge.\n\nThe latest scandal\n\nThe latest scandal began June 30, when Pincher resigned, unleashing questions about why Johnson promoted him to a senior job enforcing party discipline.\n\nPincher denied the groping allegations, though there were other accusations of sexual misconduct before the incident at the club in June.\n\nJohnson's office initially said he wasn’t aware of the accusations when he promoted Pincher in February. By Monday, a spokesman said Johnson knew of allegations that were “either resolved or did not progress to a formal complaint.”\n\nThat explanation angered Simon McDonald, the most senior civil servant at the U.K. Foreign Office from 2015 to 2020. In a highly unusual move, McDonald went public with claims that Johnson had been briefed about an official investigation into the allegations.\n\nMcDonald said in a letter to the parliamentary commissioner for standards that he received complaints about Pincher’s behavior in the summer of 2019, shortly after Pincher became a Foreign Office minister. An investigation upheld the complaint, and Pincher apologized for his actions, McDonald said.\n\n“Mr. Johnson was briefed in person about the initiation and outcome of the investigation,\" McDonald wrote.\n\nHours after McDonald’s comments were published, Johnson’s office said the prime minister had forgotten that Pincher was the subject of an official complaint.\n\nJohnson said Pincher should have been fired from the government after an incident in 2019. He said of Pincher's appointment, “I think it was a mistake, and I apologize for it. In hindsight, it was the wrong thing to do.”\n\nSunak and Javid resigned within minutes of each other Tuesday.\n\nThe two Cabinet heavyweights were responsible for tackling two of the biggest issues facing Britain – the cost-of-living crisis and COVID-19.\n\nJavid captured the mood of many lawmakers when he said Johnson’s actions threatened to undermine the integrity of the Conservative Party and the British government.\n\n“At some point, we have to conclude that enough is enough,” he told fellow lawmakers Wednesday. “I believe that point is now.”\n\n'Mood music' but no major changes\n\nRichard Whitman, a professor of politics and international relations at University of Kent, England, said he doesn't expect any significant changes to Britain's domestic or foreign policies as a result of Johnson's departure because the major issues, from Brexit to national security, are largely \"uncontested\" in the Conservative Party.\n\nHe said there will be different \"mood music\" for the next few weeks or months as Conservatives select their new leader because \"for good or ill, Johnson's struck up all sorts of personal relationships, sometimes difficult personal relationships, with international leaders and those will kind of go into a bit of a holding pattern.\"\n\nWhitman identified Penny Mordaunt, a trade minister in Johnson's government, as a possible replacement for Johnson.\n\n\"She's got a nice backstory. She's a reservist in the military, comes from military family,” he said. “She hasn't screwed up in any of the jobs she'd had, especially when she was briefly defense secretary. She's not been drawn up into any of the scandals.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/957366/why-italy-government-is-at-risk-of-collapse", "title": "Why Italy's government is at risk of collapse | The Week", "text": "The president of Italy has refused to accept prime minister Mario Draghi’s resignation, plunging the country into even deeper political uncertainty.\n\nThe development leaves the coalition government “teetering on the brink of collapse”, said The Guardian, and could force early national elections later in the year.\n\n‘Extraordinary developments’\n\nThe BBC said the “extraordinary developments” came on a “day of drama” in Rome, which saw Giuseppe Conte, leader of Draghi’s coalition partners Five Star, refuse to back the government’s €23bn (£19.5bn) cost-of-living package of economic aid.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Last week, Conte handed Draghi a letter saying Five Star had suffered “deep political discomfort” from being part of the coalition.\n\nReuters said Five Star is “struggling for its survival” because it has “haemorrhaged half of its lawmakers to rival groups and seen its popular support fall by around two thirds” since winning 33% of the vote at the last national election in 2018.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nForeign minister Luigi Di Maio, a former Five Star leader who quit the party last month, said his former party’s leaders have been “planning this for months to put an end to the Draghi government”.\n\nIn the wake of the vote, Draghi made two visits to the Quirinale palace yesterday. During the second, he tendered his resignation. The former head of the European Central Bank, who has led a unity government since February 2021, told Italian president Sergio Mattarella that the pact of trust that had sustained the unity government had gone.\n\nHowever, the president refused to accept his resignation and instead called on Draghi to address parliament to provide a clear picture of the political situation.\n\n‘Improbably broad’ coalition\n\nThe day’s drama leaves economist Draghi, who was dubbed “Super Mario” after saving the euro, in a tricky position. The effect of Mattarella’s intervention on the future for Draghi and the nation is “not entirely clear”, said the BBC, and with sufficient support, Draghi “could remain in office”.\n\nElections were already due early in 2023 and, if the government does collapse, a vote is likely to take place this autumn.\n\nThe nation’s political troubles have come as little surprise to many. The Economist described the coalition as “improbably broad”.\n\nNevertheless, the instability comes at an inconvenient time, with Italy’s government attempting to tackle the energy crisis and secure EU funding. If Draghi stands down, Europe will lose “one of its most experienced leaders at a critical time”, said Politico, with “key decisions looming over the Ukraine war and its economic fallout”.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/10/24/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-heal-the-nation/91232200/", "title": "Red blood, blue blood: How do we begin to heal after Clinton vs ...", "text": "Kim Hjelmgaard, Jane Onyanga-Omara, David Agren, Eric J. Lyman, Nikolia Apostolou, Thomas Maresca\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHow is America ever going to begin to heal after this divisive election?\n\nEvery presidential contest leaves scars, especially as the margin of victory has become ever thinner in recent years. The 2000 election, after all, took weeks to decide.\n\nStill, the wounds seem deeper this year. If Donald Trump loses, what happens to his supporters, many of them angry white men who already believe they have been left behind? And if Hillary Clinton loses, what happens to her supporters, including many frustrated minorities who feel under assault and women who had hoped to break a huge glass ceiling?\n\n'SNL' recap: Trump doesn't accept election results there, either\n\nElections don’t cause divisions so much as they focus attention on them and prompt the question: Where as a nation do we go from here?\n\nTo start probing that question, USA TODAY asked reporters on four continents to write about elections that have deeply split their countries, and then to speak to a participant in the political events to offer some suggestions on how a nation heals — or why it doesn't.\n\nIran leader blasts Trump, Clinton, says candidates are 'bad' and 'worse'\n\nIn some cases, they suggested what the U.S. should do, starting the morning after. In others, they suggested what we should not do. Sure, dialogue is great, but action — sometimes painful, such as conceding an election or facing an ugly past — is needed, too. Here is their advice, along with some cautionary tales. One overarching theme: If we don't do something about the chasm, it will get worse, challenging institutions and eating at the basic core of what makes us a nation. The comments have been edited for brevity.\n\nThe United Kingdom's 52%-to-48% vote on June 23 to exit the European Union ripped the nation apart. It pitted regions, communities and even family members against one another. It also created a sharp generational divide between young adults who strongly favored remaining in the EU and seniors who voted overwhelmingly to leave.\n\nThose who voted against Brexit believed the alliance would ensure stability and growth for the U.K.'s economy, protect decades of social justice and welfare reform, and promote British interests on a range of issues from security to trade to influence on the world stage.\n\nMany of those who supported Brexit were motivated by frustration with a partnership that they did not believe understands their concerns about immigration, security and self-determination. They see the EU as a labyrinthine, elitist and remote institution in Brussels that gives ordinary Britons little say on how to regulate their country. \"Take back control\" became the rallying cry of the Brexit campaign and its supporters' growing hostility to the central tenet of the EU: the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services within the 28-nation bloc.\n\nThe vote forced Prime Minister David Cameron, a Brexit opponent, to resign. His successor, Theresa May, appears to be in no hurry to begin the divorce proceedings. And the country remains sharply divided over prospects for its future\n\nTrump gives himself a new nickname: Mr. Brexit\n\nHere are two views from prominent Brexit activists on how the nation can reunite following such a divisive vote.\n\nIain Duncan Smith was leader of the Conservative Party from 2001 to 2003. He served in Prime Minister David Cameron's cabinet as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions from 2010 to 2016. Smith is still a Member of Parliament.\n\n\"The vote to leave the European Union was a great exercise in democracy. It doesn't do any harm to those who got used to running things to be kicked in the pants and told 'not this time.' Those who voted to remain in the EU have been appalled by the idea that the decision was taken by people that they don't ever see or speak to, in places they don't ever go to, and they universally refer to them as too old, too poor, too stupid.\n\n\"What the referendum exposed is that post-2008 — after the financial crisis — there were many issues that got swept under the carpet and still had not been dealt with: People in lower-income groups whose wages have not risen and in some cases have fallen. Migration from countries in Eastern Europe driving wages down and damaging lives and communities. There's whole groups in society who feel that the people who got them into the mess never really faced up to it or paid a penance. The referendum exposed the perception that we're all in this together. Some people got away with it.\n\n\"I think what you're seeing in the United States with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a similar process. Because the referendum was such an important vote, people got very attached to the outcome. They'll move on. Things will settle. They already have. There are some still determined to put a stop to things but amid the general public there is recognition that a decision was made and now we need to get on with it.\n\n\"There is a more important issue that has come out of this, and that was not so apparent before: We need to do something about the level of inequality in this country. This is not about socialism or communism but about making a kind of capitalism that also works for people at the bottom end of society.\"\n\nNigel Farage is the former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, an anti-immigration political group that backed Brexit.\n\n\"After every election, whether it's a general election or a referendum, there is always going to potentially be a bit of a schism in society. What we're finding is that a lot of the 'Remain' voters now accept the result and want the government to make the best job of it. I think the healing process has begun.\n\nBrexit leader Farage has 'lessons' for Trump, GOP\n\n\"In some ways the election in the United Sates is more divisive then our referendum, and the differences are more stark. But the 'project fear' that we saw used against Brexit is now exactly the same tool that is being used against Donald Trump. If Trump were to win, it would be for him to disprove the doubters by showing that he's not the kind of guy that would lead the U.S. into ridiculous foreign wars and that he has a genuine agenda that will put the interests of the American people first. He will have to do that in the first 100 days and if he does that then there will be a consensus behind the fact that he won a democratic election.\n\n\"In the U.K., we were told that Brexit would mean the economy would fall off a cliff, that every single sector would crash and burn. Instead, what we've seen this past summer is the best season for British hotels and restaurants for 20 years. I would suggest that's pretty good data to show that ordinary people are not panicking about this. Of course there's things to sort, the relationship with the European Union and the rest of the world. There will be ups and downs. But the key issue is this: Is there anything to be scared of? No, not really.\n\n\"As Abraham Lincoln said: 'You can't please all the people all the time.' And there are some people who would have been irreconcilable to the result whichever way it went. But now a very significant chunk of 'Remain' voters are accepting the situation, are saying it was a democratic vote, are not asking for a second referendum and are encouraged by the early signs of the economic benefits.\"\n\nSouth Africa’s long racially divided political history made a historic breakthrough when Nelson Mandela became the country’s first black and democratically elected president in 1994, following the dissolution of the white minority-led apartheid state.\n\nToday, the country remains torn by a deep economic gulf between rich and poor. Many residents say the government's promise of better homes and jobs has not materialized amid high unemployment and corruption scandals. Meanwhile, the elite, made up of all races, are flaunting their wealth. And racial divides continue to exist, as was recently seen in headlines around the world after black pupils in the capital Pretoria accused their school of discrimination because they were forced to chemically straighten their hair.\n\nSouth Africa’s ruling party suffering biggest electoral blow\n\nMandela’s party, the ruling African National Congress (ANC), dominated the country's politics for two decades, buoyed by its vital role in securing majority rule. But the tide turned in August, when it lost control of power for the first time in Johannesburg, the country’s largest city, where the opposition Democratic Alliance prevailed in local elections. It was the worst loss ever for Mandela's party.\n\nOne reason for the ANC's setback is public anger that has mounted over President Jacob Zuma’s involvement in various scandals since he came to power in 2009. One of the biggest controversies involves more than $20 million of taxpayers’ money spent to remodel his private home in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal province. Zuma’s office said he recently paid back more than $500,000 of the cost.\n\nAs dissatisfaction with the ANC grows among previous supporters, the country could face another period of bitter political discord leading up to the presidential election in 2019.\n\nKumi Naidoo is a former director at Greenpeace and the launch director of Africans Rising, a pan-African governance, advisory and leadership platform.\n\n\"The U.S. election draws up some unique things that are quite different from some of the challenges others have faced. There are similarities — nativism and narrow nationalism. If Trump is elected, I think that it will be seismic. It’s partly a guess that Hillary’s going to be president and how will she heal all the damage that’s been done by Trump? ... The U.S. is a very divided society.\n\n\"The most important healing is when very many people feel they are being disenfranchised. How do you address that? Of course, this is not easy work but essential to do if the levels of fragmentation in the U.S. are not to continue further.\n\n\"South Africa had to come out of a legacy of institutionalized racism which was enshrined in the governance of our country for many decades. The way we tried to deal with it was we set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the first democratic election which was chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who brought the nation together in a very painful conversation.\n\n\"It was not a perfect process, it did not do the full job but it did actually lay the basis for a very open conversation about how do you place blame, how do you move beyond blame and how do you move toward healing?\n\n\"Having lived (in the United States) I do not believe it has done nearly enough to deal with its legacies of injustice.\n\n\"America must deal with its past in the way that South Africa tried to deal with the legacies of injustice via the Trust and Reconciliation process. The two historical legacies that the U.S. must deal with are its dispossession and genocide of the original peoples of North America. ... The other legacy is that of slavery. Dealing with past injustices with honesty, dignity and compassion is the basis for moving forward.\n\n\"Dealing with historical injustices is a key part of healing and moving forward. Of course, this is not easy work but essential to do if the level of fragmentation in the U.S. is not to continue further.\"\n\nAndrés Manuel López Obrador lost Mexico’s 2006 presidential election by less than 1 percentage point. He alleged electoral fraud, paralyzed central Mexico City with protests and later proclaimed himself the legitimate president. Partisans tried to physically prevent election winner Felipe Calderón from taking the oath of office in Congress.\n\nA decade later, Mexico is still suffering the consequences of an election the left-wing politician never conceded. He often talks of the system being rigged against him, and supporters contend that their opponents — people the two-time presidential candidate calls “the Mafia in power” — poisoned the well by branding him in attack ads “a danger for Mexico.”\n\nAnalysts say López Obrador, who argued Mexico was in need of radical change, was unwilling to put aside personal ambition for the good of the nation, as U.S. presidential candidates Richard Nixon and Al Gore did after losing close elections in 1960 and 2000.\n\n“That was the key to maintaining civility in the U.S. and not maintaining it in Mexico,” said Jorge Castañeda, Mexican foreign minister from 2000 to 2003. “This has always been the main issue in Mexico, not the ideological or political or even personal animosity.”\n\nMore criticism for Mexico's president after Trump visit\n\nThe immediate political fallout was Mexico’s war on drugs, Castañeda said. Calderón sought to increase his incoming government’s legitimacy by cracking down on drug cartels, a rising threat as he took office that dominated his presidency. Today, soldiers are still in the streets and more than 100,000 lives have been lost.\n\nMexico also rewrote its election laws in 2007 to give political parties more power and to avoid another divisive political climate by banning negative ads and limiting the political speech of non-politicians.\n\nCastañeda says candidates should promise to accept any outcome, even an unfavorable one, to avoid a rerun of Mexico’s problems. López Obrador \"didn’t accept the rules after the fact,” he says. “This is what led to the division and bitterness.”\n\nGerardo Priego Tapía was a coordinator for the Calderón campaign in 2006 and subsequently served in Congress from 2006 and 2009.\n\n\"There wasn’t much to celebrate (during President Calderón's inauguration.) The political parties did nothing to show the citizenry that we had to unite. Celebrating did nothing to help or close wounds. To the contrary, it exacerbated the conflict.\n\n“We had six years of permanent conflict in this country. We saw it in Congress. It’s something that got into Mexicans’ heart and it’s still there. The problem is that in the healing process, society, like the political parties, hasn’t been able to agree or find a way to heal.\n\n“The profile of these two candidates caused the tension to continue. They were both stubborn and their close people were the same.\n\n“The U.S. has advantages. There’s a deeply rooted idea of solidarity. It’s an important part of U.S society, but not ours. The United States has strong institutions, while in Mexico, civil society is weak. It’s something that they are going to have to take advantage of now.\n\nMexico City museum takes on Donald Trump\n\n\"The main conflict is between politicians, but what is said between ‘professional’ politicians isn’t translated the same way down below by ordinary people.\n\n“This strong discourse from Donald Trump, how is it interpreted? The interpretation of this message at the grass roots is different from how it’s discussed among politicians on the national level. The strong statements are taken more seriously down below. This discourse of resentment is much more grave. This is what we have seen in Mexico after the (2006) election and so many years of division.”\n\nThe defining moment in post-World War II Italian politics came in the early 1990s, when hundreds of political leaders were indicted in the mani pulite (clean hands) corruption scandal that overturned the existing political structure. The upheaval opened the door for Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire real estate and media tycoon, to rise to power.\n\nBerlusconi became Italy's dominant politician, serving as prime minister for nine of 17 years and serving as a vocal opposition figure when he was out of office. But his governments were increasingly dogged by personal legal problems, scandal, cronyism and inefficiencies. And Italy became increasingly polarized by those who loved and hated him.\n\nBy the time, Berlusconi resigned in 2011, he had become highly unpopular. Italy’s credit rating had been downgraded multiple times, the economy was contracting, the political system had stalled and the country was on the verge of defaulting on its public debt.\n\nThe man Italians finally chose to end the political divisiveness and fix things was Mario Monti, a well-regarded economist and former European commissioner who had until then rejected overtures to get involved in politics. But, he said, “I really didn’t think I could say 'no' because the crisis had grown so dire. If would have said ‘no’ I would have had to leave Italy for the rest of my life because I would have been so ashamed.”\n\nItalians to Americans: Beware of Trump-like candidates\n\nIn an interview, Monti said he was able to leverage the country's financial crisis to get the various sides talking. He doled out what he called an “even degree of unhappiness, well measured” for everyone. “The political parties, the social partners and trade unions were ready to accept temporary sacrifices that would have been otherwise unthinkable.”\n\nThe plan mostly worked. Monti, more a technocrat than a politician, served for nearly 18 months. By the time he left, the economy had stabilized, interest rates were low and the risk of default had been avoided.\n\nFormer prime minister Mario Monti is president of Bocconi University and an Italian senator for life.\n\n“When I took control of the government there were three emergencies, really. One was the financial situation and the risk of default. Another one was the growing gap between public opinion on the one hand and the politicians on the other. And the third — within the political class, within the parties in the parliament — was that there was no compromise.\n\n“The center-right, headed by Mr. Berlusconi, and the center-left, headed by Mr. (Pier Luigi) Bersani wouldn’t even speak to each other. The situation was such that people, from the man on the street to the international financial press, the other capitals, were all worried that the Italian state might not be able to pay salaries and pay pensions. And we had in front of us the devastating example of Greece.\n\nUSA TODAY Quizzes\n\n\"What helped was this financial emergency, the sense of acute emergency, made all the politicians feel powerless. But on the other hand, it made the political parties, the social partners and trade unions ready to accept temporary sacrifices that would have been otherwise unthinkable. And I was leveraging on this basis.\n\n“I am sure I would not have been the one called to do the job (if there were only a political crisis). The country needed somebody who because of past experience — and I hope some accumulated credibility — whose mere appointment would help calm the markets and collect a high degree of (international) support.\n\n“It would have been unimaginable for me to be asked to be only a political healer of the country.”\n\nIn 2003, Turkish voters elected Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the new leadership began moving the country gradually away from its past, one marked by the rule of the secularist Kemalists. Since the 1920s, they tried to homogenize Turkey’s multicultural society by suppressing religious and cultural expression to erase the influence of the country’s Ottoman legacy.\n\nOver the following decade under the AKP, religious conservatism became stamped on Turkey's political and social landscape. Minorities, such as the Kurds, as well as leftists and those leading a secular and liberal lifestyle, were left chafing under increasing restrictions on civil freedoms. By 2013, that group expanded to include activists, journalists, artists — anyone who openly opposed the government's policies. The climax came that year, when protests over the government's construction project at Istanbul's Gezi Park led to a crackdown in which 11 were killed and 8,000 injured.\n\nMany Turks, including conservatives, were shocked. As a result, Turkish voters punished the AKP in 2015 by denying it a majority in parliament. It was a serious blow to the party. Besides concern over the crackdown and earlier edicts restricting basic freedoms, voters were worried about slowing economic growth and the civil war in neighboring Syria that sent a flood of refugees into Turkey. The final straw was Erdoğan's heavy-handed attempt to make himself president for life by amending the constitution.\n\nJust months after the elections, however, a cease-fire with Kurdish separatists fell apart, reigniting fighting in the decades-old conflict. Also, the Islamic State set off bombs in Ankara, the capital, killing 90 young people during a protest. It was the country's worst terror attack.\n\nTurkey extends state of emergency by 3 more months\n\nOn Nov. 1, voters, concerned about the situation, voted overwhelmingly for Erdoğan's party based on its vow to restore peace and stability. Yet, right after that victory Erdoğan and his party resumed their policies that have divided Turks along religious and ethnic lines and pitted urban against rural interests.\n\nToday, the fault lines have only increased in the wake of more than a dozen terror attacks and the summer's attempted coup, which the government blames on U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Tens of thousands of civil servants, military personnel and educators have been arrested, and there has been a crackdown on the media.\n\nLondon-based Elif Shafak is one of the country's most renowned novelists. An advocate for women's rights and free speech, she was prosecuted by the government in 2006 for insulting \"Turkishness\" in one of her novels.\n\n“In a world where there’s so much happening, so fast, where there’s the fear that the next terror attack could happen any time, in a world where you see lots of displacement (of refugees), many people fear that the future is going to be very ambivalent.\n\n\"Where they make a mistake is to think that if they close the doors, if they live in smaller tribal communities, they’ll feel safer. That, I think, is an illusion. But the fear itself is real, and we have to understand that.\n\n\"We are mostly divided into invisible ghettos, islands of people that do not break bread together. In such an environment it's much more difficult to cultivate a culture of coexistence and remind people of our shared values. For me, those shared values have to revolve around democratic values.\n\n\"Because the number of people who are saying 'maybe democracy is not the only way' and 'maybe it's not suitable for our culture' is increasing, those alternative models could be authoritarian models. So we have to renew people's faith in democracy. I think we need to revive a radical humanism that shows people what they have in common and not focus only on the differences.\n\n\"What I’m worried about today is the rise of populism, the rise of tribalism, the rise of a new way of doing politics that is very much based on emotions and people’s fear. We need to understand what people are afraid of and why are they so anxious about the future. We should never belittle fear or anxiety.\n\nPurge of Turkey coup supporters intensifies\n\n\"But also all around the world, I think we see more and more angry white male politicians speaking very loudly, making general statements and appealing to the feelings of the masses. This is a very dangerous trend. Because we are living in a globalized world, the madness happening in one country has repercussions beyond the borders. That's why we need to promote cosmopolitanism. If we learn anything, we learn it from people who are different from us.\n\n\"For extremism to work, (populists) need to dehumanize 'the other.' Fiction rehumanizes. Fiction tells us that the person you saw as 'the other' has a story. If you know that person's story, you can connect with that person's sorrow or hopes. In a world of so much conflict, we need the art of story telling like never before.\"\n\nThe Philippine presidential election in May didn’t create sharp divisions as much as it uncovered them in a population that is fractured along class, cultural and geographic lines.\n\nIn some ways, the political landscape mirrored the United States. Former Vice President Jejomar Binay and Interior Secretary Mar Roxas offered continuity with the policies of outgoing President Benigno Aquino III, whose six-year term saw the Philippines emerge as one of the best-performing economies in Asia.\n\nBy contrast, a desire for radical upheaval was embodied in Rodrigo Duterte, the brash mayor of Davao, a city on the southern island of Mindanao far from the power corridors of the capital, Manila. Duterte, whose nicknames include \"The Punisher\" and \"Duterte Harry,\" ran on a platform of law and order, vowing to tackle crime and drugs and clean up a corrupt and elitist government.\n\nFor Duterte, outrageous comments have become the norm\n\nDuterte made headlines around the world with crude comments and campaign promises to kill tens of thousands of criminals and dump their bodies in Manila Bay. When it came time to vote, the anti-establishment mood carried the day, as Duterte won nearly 40% of the votes, a landslide in a four-candidate race.\n\nDespite a divided electorate, most have been willing to give Duterte a chance to make good on his campaign promises. In a poll taken in July, he received a trust rating of over 80%, the highest in history.\n\nDespite profanity and controversies, Filipinos love foul-mouthed Duterte\n\nHowever, Duterte’s signature accomplishment so far, his war on drugs, is ratcheting up tensions, as more than 3,500 accused pushers and users already have been killed by police and vigilantes. The new president also has repeatedly ruffled feathers on the international stage with vulgar outbursts aimed at other world leaders, including President Obama.\n\nRather than build bridges, Duterte and his allies in Congress, where he enjoys a super-majority, have marginalized vocal critics. Foreign investors have begun showing signs of skittishness, selling off stocks and causing the Philippine peso to slide recently to its lowest mark in seven years.\n\nDuterte’s grip on power and popular support remain solid. But in a country with a history of volatile, personality-driven politics dating back to the Ferdinand Marcos era, whether this will be a lasting period of political peace remains to be seen.\n\nTony La Viña, dean of the Ateneo de Manila University School of Government, was a campaign adviser to candidate Grace Poe in the presidential election. He previously served as undersecretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\n\n“A country is able to move on when the winners are able to reach out to everyone, to bring everyone back together, and if those who lost concede, support the winner. Initially in the Philippines that happened.\n\n\"I think the divisions in the Philippines now are not really because of the elections. They are post-election, because the president is doing some very controversial things, very tough things, very radical things, which includes a disregard of human rights for many people. And so that's creating a divide. And it's very difficult to see how we can unify if there's a fundamental difference on views.\n\n\"So going back to the question: Can a country unify after a divisive election? The answer is actually no, if there is a real division. Because elections don't matter. The division will persist. And so the way forward is dialogue, beyond politics, beyond elections. How do we get nearer to each other? At the very least, do we understand each other’s positions? And that's not yet happening in the Philippines.\n\n\"The effective way of reconciliation after a divisive election is for the winner to deliver an effective government — delivery of services, accomplishing the promises that he or she made. We had that in Fidel V. Ramos in 1992. A very divisive election, there were even allegations of cheating, but in one year’s time he was able to unify the people around his presidency because he was able to deliver government services to the poor, to the people, and able to put up an enabling environment for business, for investments. So having done that, the bitterness in the campaign disappeared.\n\n\"I think if Hillary delivers on health, especially delivers on jobs, delivers on climate change, the big things in the U.S., I think Trump will be forgotten, honestly.\n\n\"It'll be quite challenging for [Trump]. He'll have to really pivot to suddenly be a unifier-in-chief, which he doesn't pretend to be now. But for the good of the country, he might have to do it.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/06/23/iran-crown-prince-calls-for-supreme-leader-exit/84315723007/", "title": "Iran's exiled 'crown prince' calls for supreme leader's exit", "text": "LONDON − The exiled son of Iran's last shah − Persian for \"king\" − before he fled the 1979 Islamic Revolution called for Iran's theocratic regime and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to \"step down\" and \"face justice.\"\n\nReza Pahlavi, 64, was heir to Iran's \"Peacock Throne\" when the dynasty led by his father, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, was ousted. He lives in the United States and his supporters often refer to him as the \"Crown Prince of Iran.\"\n\nPahlavi said during a press conference in Paris on June 23 that he was ready to help lead Iran \"down a road of peace and democratic transition\" and he claimed, without providing specific evidence, that he had seen credible reports that Khamenei and other senior Iranian regime officials were preparing to flee with their families as the United States had joined Israel's bombing campaign on Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\nLive updates: Israel accepts ceasefire with Iran announced by Trump\n\n\"The military is fractured,\" Pahlavi said. \"The people are united. The foundations of this 46-year tyranny are shaking. This is our Berlin Wall moment. But like all moments of great change, it comes with great danger.\"\n\nPahlavi added he had a \"direct message\" for Khamenei: \"Step down, and if you do, you will receive a fair trial and due process of law.\" He said he was setting up a new \"secure platform\" for dissidents and internal opponents of the regime to coordinate their efforts to put the country on the path of a \"free and democratic\" future.\n\nKhamenei's office could not be reached for comment. It was not also clear whether Pahlavi had specific crimes he wanted to see Iran's supreme leader stand trial for or if it was a generalized comment about Iran's leadership.\n\nStill, while Pahlavi has plenty of admirers in the Iranian diaspora who support a return to the monarchy, it is uncertain how popular he is inside the country.\n\nAnd almost everything he said in Paris he has said variations of for several decades. In fact, most Iranians are not old enough to remember life before the 1979 revolution. Among those who do look back, some recall it with nostalgia for the pre-revolutionary era, while others remember it for the deep inequality and oppression.\n\nPahlavi senior was a U.S.-backed dictator who used secret police and torture on his opponents. He died of cancer in Egypt in 1980. According to his official biography, published in 1963, Khamenei himself was tortured by the shah's henchmen at age 24 when he served the first of many prison terms for political activities.\n\nIran's opposition beyond 'crown prince'\n\nApart from Pahlavi's monarchists, the other main opposition group outside Iran is the People's Mujahideen Organization, also known as the MEK. The MEK was founded in the 1970s, led a bloody guerrilla campaign against the shah, but lost a power struggle with Iran's Islamists after the shah was toppled.\n\nMany Iranians have not forgiven the MEK for siding with Iraq during Iran's war with that country from 1980-88. Human rights groups and even a U.S. government research document from 2012 have accused the MEK, which now has its headquarters in Albania, of abuses and displaying cult-like behavior.\n\nThis behavior, which the MEK vigorously denies and its senior leadership told USA TODAY emanates from a vicious \"disinformation campaign\" by Iran's clerical rulers, ranges from torture and forced celibacy to holding members against their will.\n\nThe MEK are the main force behind the so-called National Council of Resistance of Iran, which like Pahlavi has cultivated close ties with some Western politicians and operators including Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and lawyer for Donald Trump. Many have reportedly been paid large sums to make speeches at MEK events.\n\nGiuliani made an appearance at one such MEK rally in Poland in 2019. At a Paris forum on June 20, the council's leader Maryam Rajavi reiterated her opposition to any return of the monarchy, saying \"neither the shah nor the mullahs.\"\n\nRudy Giuliani's side project: bashing Iran, in Poland\n\nWithin Iran, opposition groups are also fragmented and have coalesced around specific issues. Iranian demonstrators in 2009 flooded the streets over what they saw as a stolen presidential election. In 2017, running street protests focused on falling living standards. In 2022, it was women's rights that were the trigger.\n\nIran's mostly Sunni Muslim Kurdish and Baluch minorities have also chafed against rule from the Persian-speaking, Shi'ite government in Tehran. These groups regularly organize protests in western Iran, where they form a majority.\n\nSince the start of Israel's air war on Iran, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has used a string of media appearances to endorse the idea of regime change in Iran. Trump, too, has speculated on the idea.\n\n\"It's not politically correct to use the term, 'Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???\" Trump said in a social media post June 23. (White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that Trump, in his post, was not saying the U.S. would help change Iran's regime militarily, but encouraging the Iranian people to change their regime by themselves.)\n\nGen Z, Iran, misinformation: the mass panic happening on TikTok\n\nStill, some Iranian activists involved in previous bouts of protest inside Iran say they are unwilling to help unleash mass unrest, even against a system they hate, with their nation under attack by the U.S. and Israel.\n\nOne of them even made her feelings clear from an Iranian prison.\n\n\"Do not destroy my city,\" Narges Mohammadi, Iran's most prominent rights activist and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said in a social media post on June 17 as Israel called on Tehran's residents to evacuate parts of Iran's capital.\n\n\"End this war.\"\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/27/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/6960680001/", "title": "Ukraine agrees to meet with Russia; ruble plunges: recaps", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Sunday, Feb. 27. Click here to follow the latest updates and news from Monday, Feb. 28, as Russia's invasion continues.\n\n***\n\nWhile Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s nuclear weapons on high alert, more support poured in for Ukraine in its ongoing effort to fend off Russian forces, which on Sunday reached the second-largest Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.\n\nThe European Union announced unprecedented new actions against Russia, outlining plans to close its airspace to Russian airlines, fund a weapons purchase to assist Ukraine and ban some pro-Kremlin media outlets, while the Associated Press reported the United States approved the delivery of anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine.\n\nWestern powers in support of Ukraine could soon be joined by Switzerland, an oftentimes neutral country that on Monday is set to review potential sanctions and asset freezes against Russia, said President Ignazio Cassis via Reuters. Cassis said it was “very probable” the country would follow suit, the outlet reported.\n\nThe office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday said a delegation would meet with Russian officials for talks near the Belarus border. The discussion was expected to happen Monday morning local time, according to Ukraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin via CNN.\n\nAlso Monday, both the 193-member U.N. General Assembly and the smaller, 15-member Security Council plan to hold emergency meetings on Russia’s invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin’s order to make his nuclear weapons more ready for launch – made Sunday in response to “aggressive statements” by leading NATO powers and economic sanctions by the West – represents an unnecessary and dangerous move, according to the Pentagon.\n\nA senior Defense Department official said Russia is under no threat from the United States and its NATO allies. The Pentagon is confident it can protect the U.S. and its allies, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is heading towards a fifth day of fighting. According to the Associated Press, Russian troops entered Kharkiv on Sunday, where videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across the city and a vehicle burning on the street. Residents were urged to stay inside.\n\nThe troops in Kharkiv arrived after Russia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine, targeting airfields and fuel facilities. Two large explosions rocked an area south of the capital just before 1 a.m. local time. Zelenskyy’s office said one of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport and the other blast hit an oil depot about 25 miles south of the capital, according to the mayor of Vasylkiv via the AP. Russian forces also blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, according to the Ukrainian president's office.\n\nUkrainian officials said Sunday the civilian death toll has reached 352.\n\nA few things to catch you up on:\n\nTHE NEWS COMES TO YOU: Get the latest updates on the situation in Ukraine.

It was unclear exactly what share of Russia’s estimated $640 billion hard currency coffers will be paralyzed by the move, but European officials said that at least half of it will be affected.\n\nThe move will dramatically raise pressure on the ruble by undermining the financial authorities’ ability to conduct hard currency interventions to prevent the ruble from sinking further and triggering high inflation. The ruble has sharply dived in early Monday trading.\n\nThe Central Bank also ordered a slew of measures to help the banks cope with the crisis by infusing more cash into the system and easing restrictions for banking operations. At the same time, it temporarily barred non-residents from selling the government obligations to help ease the pressure on ruble from panicky foreign investors eager to cash out.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nDalai Lama pleas for peace in Ukraine\n\nThe Dalai Lama on Monday pleaded for peace and \"mutual understanding,\" and said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"War is outdated – non-violence is the only way. We need to develop a sense of the oneness of humanity by considering other human beings as brothers and sisters,\" the spiritual leader said on his website. \"This is how we will build a more peaceful world.\"\n\nThe Nobel peace prize winner also said any problems and disagreements are best resolved through dialogue. \"Genuine peace comes about through mutual understanding and respect for each other's well-being,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he hopes peace is swiftly restored.\n\n\"We must not lose hope,\" he said. \"The 20th century was a century of war and bloodshed. The 21st century must be a century of dialogue.\"\n\n-- Terry Collins\n\nTwo United Nations sessions scheduled for Monday\n\nThe U.N.’s two major bodies -- the 193-nation General Assembly and the more powerful 15-member Security Council -- will hold separate meetings Monday on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a reflection of widespread international demands for an immediate cease-fire and escalating concern for the plight of millions of Ukrainians caught up in the war.\n\nThe Security Council gave a green light Sunday for the first emergency session of the General Assembly in decades. It will give all U.N. members an opportunity to speak about the war Monday and vote on a resolution later in the week that U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said would “hold Russia to account for its indefensible actions and for its violations of the U.N. Charter.”\n\nFrench Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere announced that the Security Council will hold a meeting Monday afternoon on the humanitarian impact of Russia’s invasion, a session sought by French President Emmanuel Macron to ensure the delivery of aid to growing numbers of those in need in Ukraine.\n\nBoth meetings follow Russia’s veto Friday of a Security Council resolution demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. The vote was 11-1, with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nU.S. Embassy in Ukraine: departing the country may take up to 30 hours\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ukraine is now urging U.S citizens in Ukraine to try leaving using private transportation options as leaving could in some cases take more than 30 hours.\n\nThe embassy said Sunday “conditions may deteriorate” in various parts of the country without any warning due to the escalating Russian invasion.\n\n“Careful consideration should be made to routes and the risks of travel because Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations have been destroyed. Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some,” the embassy said on its website.\n\nFurthermore, embassy officials say that border crossings into neighboring Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova are overwhelmed.\n\n“Some are experiencing extremely long wait times (well over 30 hours in some cases),” the embassy said. “We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross.”\n\nEmbassy officials also offered a series of tips including bringing enough food, water and warm clothing. They also urge citizens to carry hard copies of important documents as the U.S. government will not be able to evacuate its citizens from Ukraine.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nRussian ruble sinks in early trading\n\nThe ruble sank nearly 26% against the U.S. dollar early Monday after Western nations moved to block Russian banks from the SWIFT global payment system.\n\nThe ruble was trading at a record low 105.27 per dollar, down from about 84 per dollar late Friday.\n\nOver the weekend, Japan joined the moves by the U.S. and other western nations to impose more sanctions against Russia.\n\nRestrictions on the Russian central bank target its access to more than $600 billion in reserves the Kremlin has at its disposal. They hinder Russia’s ability to support the ruble as it plunges in value.\n\nSanctions announced earlier had taken the Russian currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nUS official: Belarus may join Ukraine invasion\n\nA senior U.S. intelligence official says Belarus is expected to send troops into Ukraine as soon as Monday to fight alongside Russian forces that invaded Ukraine last week.\n\nBelarus has been providing support for Russia’s war effort but so far has not taken a direct part in the conflict.\n\nThe American official has direct knowledge of current U.S. intelligence assessments and says the decision by Belarus’ leader on whether to bring Belarus further into the war depends on talks between Russia and Ukraine happening in the coming days. The official spoke anonymously to discuss the sensitive information.\n\nRussian forces have encountered strong resistance from Ukraine defenders, and U.S. officials say they believe the invasion has been more difficult, and slower, than the Kremlin envisioned, though that could change as Moscow adapts.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nRussia rendering Facebook unusable in some places\n\nRussia has apparently rendered Facebook largely unusable across leading Russian telecommunications providers amid rising friction between Moscow and the social media platform.\n\nThe London-based internet monitor NetBlocks reports that Facebook’s network of content-distribution servers in Russia was so badly restricted Sunday that “content no longer loads, or loads extremely slowly making the platforms unusable.”\n\nRussian telecoms regulator Roskomnadzor on Friday announced plans to “partially restrict” access to Facebook. That same day, Facebook’s head of security policy had said the company was barring Russian state media from running ads or otherwise profiting on its platform anywhere in the world.\n\nFacebook says it has also refused a request by the Kremlin not to run fact checks related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the platform for users inside Russia.\n\nNetBlocks reported earlier that access to Twitter was similarly restricted Saturday. That was a day after Twitter said it was temporarily halting ads in both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe Twitter and Facebook restrictions can be circumvented inside Russia using VPN software, just as users do in mainland China.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nCanada will investigate Russian flight violating airspace ban\n\nCanada said it will launch an investigation into a Russian-based Aeroflot flight that entered Canadian airspace on Sunday and violated a ban on all Russian flights due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We are aware that Aeroflot flight 111 violated the prohibition put in place earlier today on Russian flights using Canadian airspace,\" Transport Canada said in a series of tweets. \"We are launching a review of the conduct of Aeroflot and the independent air navigation service provider, NAVCAN, leading up to this violation.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action and other measures to prevent future violations,\" the agency added.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Omar Alghabra, Canada's transport minister, that the country's airspace was closed to all Russian aircraft operators.\n\n\"We will hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked attacks against Ukraine,” Alghabra tweeted.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nBiden to hold a call with U.S. allies to discuss Ukraine, Russia\n\nPresident Joe Biden is scheduled to hold a call with U.S. allies on Monday morning to discuss the latest situation in Ukraine and their coordinated response, the White House said late Sunday.\n\nThe call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. ET. The call comes after Biden ordered the U.S. State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from its stockpile to Ukraine on Friday.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Saturday that this third authorization for weapons shipments to Ukraine in less than a year was \"unprecedented.\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nUkraine radioactive site in Kyiv struck by missiles, UN nuclear watchdog\n\nThe United Nations’ nuclear watchdog says missiles have struck a radioactive waste disposal site in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. So far there are no reports of damage to the buildings or indications of a release of radioactive material.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said Ukrainian authorities informed his office about the overnight strike. Grossi said his agency expects to get the results of on-site radioactive monitoring soon.\n\nThe report comes a day after an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was damaged.\n\nSuch facilities typically hold low-level radioactive materials such as waste from hospitals and industry, but Grossi says the two incidents highlight a “very real risk.” Grossi said if the sites are damaged there could be “potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment.”\n\n– Associated Press\n\nJapanese billionaire to donate over $8 million to Ukraine\n\nJapanese billionaire Hiroshi “Mickey” Mikitani said he will donate over $8 million to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy.”\n\nMikitani, founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten Group Inc., said Sunday in a letter to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the donation of ¥1 billion (roughly $8.7 million) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence,” the Japan Times reported.\n\nMikitani said he met with Zelenskyy during a visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in 2019.\n\n“My thoughts are with you and Ukraine people,” Mikitani wrote in his letter. “I believe that the trampling of a peaceful and democratic Ukraine by unjustified force is a challenge to democracy.\n\n“I sincerely hope that Russia and Ukraine can resolve this issue peacefully and that Ukraine people can have peace again as soon as possible,” Mikitani added.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nRussia-Ukraine talks set for Monday\n\nThe office of Ukraine’s president confirmed that a delegation is set to meet with Russian officials as Moscow’s troops continue to target Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said on the Telegram messaging app that the two sides would meet at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border.\n\nABC and CNN, each citing Ukrainian officials, reported the talks would take place Monday, which matches a report from Russian state-owned news agency TASS that said the discussions would take place in the morning.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday came hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks. Ukrainian officials initially rejected the move, saying any talks should take place elsewhere than Belarus, where Russia has placed a large contingent of troops.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, expressed hope for prospective peace talks.\n\n\"We'll look forward to what comes out of those discussions,\" Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n– Associated Press, Jay Cannon and David Jackson\n\nBorrell: EU countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine\n\nEuropean Union countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine at the Kyiv government’s request to help it counter the Russian air and land assault, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Sunday, according to the AFP news service.\n\n\"We're going to provide even fighting jets. We're not talking about just ammunition. We are providing more important arms to go to a war,\" Borrell said at a news conference.\n\nThe military transfer appeared imminent, according to Alexandre Krauss, a senior advisor to the EU Parliament.\n\n“Flying in #Ukraine skies within the hour,” Krauss tweeted at 3:38 p.m. ET, citing Borrell’s announcement.\n\nAccording to Borrell, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had asked the EU for the planes.\n\nCiting a person familiar with the talks, the Wall Street Journal reported that “discussions are still ongoing” and that any planes would be supplied directly by EU member states and not funded through an arrangement announced earlier for the EU to finance weapons deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the EU Commission, announced earlier in the day, that EU members were “stepping up our support for Ukraine. For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack. We are also strengthening our sanctions against the Kremlin.”\n\nThe announcement came as satellite imagery showed a massive convoy of Russian military vehicles – with some estimates of 3.25 miles long – moving toward Kyiv and about 40 miles away.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy in Kyiv: $54 million in humanitarian assistance on the way\n\nThe U.S. is giving nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance for those affected by the Russian invasion, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv announced Sunday.\n\nThe funding, which comes as thousands of Ukrainians flee Russian invaders, was announced with \"the welfare of ordinary Ukrainians in mind,\" the embassy said in a statement. It includes nearly $26 million from the Department of State and $28 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries and U.N. officials believe up to 4 million people could leave if fighting continues.\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS to send anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine, AP reports\n\nThe U.S. for the first time has approved the direct delivery of Stinger missiles to Ukraine as part of a package approved by the White House on Friday, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe exact timing of delivery is not known, but officials say the U.S. is currently working on the logistics of the shipment. The officials agreed to discuss the development only if not quoted by name.\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of Germany’s announcement that it will send 500 Stinger missiles and other weapons and supplies to Ukraine.\n\nThe high-speed Stingers are very accurate and are used to shoot down helicopters and other aircraft. Ukrainian officials have been asking for more of the powerful weapons.\n\nEstonia has also been providing Ukraine with Stingers since January, and had to get U.S. permission in order to do that.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nNeutral Switzerland 'probable' to hit Russia with financial sanctions, president says\n\nAfter days of fence-sitting, Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said on Sunday it was \"very probable\" that neutral Switzerland would follow the European Union’s lead and sanction Russia and freeze Russian assets in the country.\n\nReuters reported that Cassis, who was interviewed on French-language Swiss public television, said the nation's seven-member Federal Council would meet Monday and review recommendations by finance and economy officials.\n\n\"It is very probable that the government will decide to do so tomorrow, but I cannot anticipate decisions not yet taken,\" Cassis said, via Reuters.\n\nSwitzerland, a global financial hub and commodities trading center – has so far resisted calls for it to levy sanctions and possibly freeze Russian assets, especially after the EU and U.S. announced sanctions.\n\n“The civilized, democratic world has to stand up to the biggest threat to European security and stability since the Second World War,” Peter Stano, lead spokesperson for EU external affairs, said on Friday. “It affects not only Ukraine. It affects Europe. Switzerland is part of Europe. So we expect our partner, our neighbor, our ally to follow suit in standing up for defending the principles on which our communities and countries are based.”\n\nThe oft-neutral country's potential move comes as a surprise to some.\n\n\"Switzerland to sanction Russia! Holy crap. A country that was neutral against the literal Nazis. Neutral no more!\" tweeted Paul Massaro, a counter-corruption advisor to the U.S. Congress.\n\nIt was not known immediately how many wealthy Russian elites, especially oligarchs close to Putin, have stashed money in Swiss banks, known for their strong privacy firewalls. But various leaks of banking documents over the years suggest they have a sizable amount invested in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2018, Swiss banks reportedly frozen $1 billion in the accounts of one oligarch alone – Russian metals tycoon Viktor Vekselberg – over fears that they could be fined for doing business with him after Washington levied sanctions against the businessman, the Moscow Times reported at the time.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy urges Americans in Russia to consider leaving 'immediately'\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow said Sunday that American citizens “should consider departing Russia immediately” because of the dramatic drop-off in airline service in and out of the country.\n\n“An increasing number of airlines are cancelling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines,” a security alert posted to the embassy’s website states. “U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available.”\n\nThe guidance comes after the EU's move to close its airspace to Russian airlines. Russian airline Aeroflot says it cancelled all flights to Europe.\n\nThe State Department had already advised Americans not to travel to Russia because of its aggression against Ukraine, as well as the potential harassment of U.S. citizens in the country and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUN emergency session scheduled for Monday\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has voted for the 193-member General Assembly to hold an emergency session on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Monday.\n\nThe vote on Sunday to authorize an emergency meeting was 11 in favor, Russia opposed, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. That was the exact same vote on a resolution Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. But in that case, Russia used its veto and the resolution was defeated.\n\nUkrainian U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya asked for the General Assembly meeting to be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution, initiated by the U.S. and adopted in November 1950 to circumvent vetoes by the Soviet Union during the Korean War.\n\nThat resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUkraine civilian death toll hits 352, officials say\n\nThe civilian death toll from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has risen to 352, including 14 children, the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal affairs said Sunday. The ministry said 1,684 people had been injured.\n\nThe United Nations had announced the civilian death toll had reached 240 by Saturday, but stressed that the actual figure was potentially \"considerably higher.”\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS urges Americans in Ukraine to find best exit routes\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine issued a new advisory Sunday, telling Americans to choose departure routes very carefully if they are trying to flee.\n\n“Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations has been destroyed,” the embassy said in a notice. “Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some.”\n\nMost border crossings into Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova “are severely backed up,” with extremely long wait times – in some cases, more than 30 hours, the embassy said.\n\n“We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross,” the note says. “Note that conditions at each border can change very quickly and wait times can increase at any time without warning.”\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUPS, FedEx halt services in Russia\n\nShipping giants FedEx and UPS have suspended services to Russia amid the country’s military assault on Ukraine.\n\nUPS said it had halted all international shipments to addresses in Russia as of Feb. 25. FedEx said it was “closely monitoring the situation” and had suspended inbound service to Russia “until further notice.”\n\nBoth companies had already stopped service to Ukraine, after Russian troops invaded the neighboring country. Russian troops have now advanced well into Ukrainian territory, reaching its second largest city and encircling the capital, Kyiv.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nMcMaster: Putin got ‘more than he bargained for’\n\nFormer national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Sunday that Ukrainians are doing a “tremendous job” defending the country against Russian military attacks.\n\n“I think Putin got a lot more than he bargained for. He's in a very difficult position. And I think anything we can do, obviously, financially, going after his international criminal enterprise with sanctions and so forth is important. But the support for Ukraine's ability to defend themselves is also important,” McMaster told Margaret Brennan on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nThe retired lieutenant general also said the seizure of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “not in the cards for the immediate future,” but acknowledged the next 72 hours are going to be “really critical.”\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nKyiv mayor: 'We are encircled'\n\nKYIV, Ukraine – As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv's mayor is both filled with pride over his citizens' spirit and anxious about how long they can hold out.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv.\n\n“We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,” he finally said. “Right now we are encircled.\"\n\nWhen Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters.\n\nThe mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child.\n\nA Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside could be considered a saboteur.\n\n“We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,\" Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian “saboteurs” were killed Saturday night.\n\nIn the last few days, long queues of people — both men and women — were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the capital, after authorities decided to distribute weapons freely to anybody ready to defend the city. There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists.\n\n“To be honest, we don't have 100% control,” said Klitschko. “We built this territorial defense in a short amount of time — but these are patriotic people.\"\n\n“Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,” he added.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nEU closing airspace to Russia\n\nThe top official in the European Union said the bloc will take unprecedented new steps after Russian President Vladimir Putin raised tensions with talk of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe EU will close its airspace to Russian airlines, including \"the private jets of oligarchs,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU,” she said.\n\n\"For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” she added.\n\nThe EU will also ban pro-Kremlin media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, she said.\n\nThe European Commission's plans followed the announcement earlier in the day that Germany was committing 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special armed forces fund and would keep its defense spending above 2% of GDP from now on. The shift underscored how Russia’s war on Ukraine was rewriting Europe’s post-World War II security and defense policy in ways that were unthinkable only a few weeks ago.\n\nThe EU’s plan to fund weapons purchases was unprecedented and would use millions of euros to help buy air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine’s armed forces. It would also supply things like fuel, protective gear, helmets and first aid kits.\n\n– Katie Wadington and AP\n\nBP pulls out of Russian oil company\n\nOil giant BP will walk away from its nearly 20% stake in Russian oil company Rosneft, according to media reports.\n\nBP Chairman Helge Lund issued a statement announcing the exit, as well as the resignation of BP CEO Bernard Looney from the board of the Russian oil firm.\n\nBP has been a shareholder in Rosneft since 2013, according to the BBC.\n\nSen. Mark Warner: Putin’s invasion a major ‘miscalculation'\n\nSen. Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Putin “totally underestimated” the resolve of the Ukrainians and the support building worldwide for the Ukrainian people, describing the Russian invasion so far as a major “miscalculation.”\n\n“Remarkably what he's also been able to do his unify the vast majority of us in the Senate, Democrats, Republicans alike,” Warner said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And he’s going to pay a high price.”\n\nWarner said Putin over the past few years became “more and more isolated.”\n\n“When you are an authoritarian leader, and you’re only hearing from people that want to say to the boss, hey, you're right. I think that leads to miscalculation. I think that is what has happened in the case of this invasion in Ukraine.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUS ambassador: No US 'boots on the ground' in Ukraine\n\nAs she made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made clear that the U.S. response to the invasion of Ukraine will not include American troops or air personnel.\n\n\"The president has made clear that we're not going to put boots on the ground,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nThomas-Greenfield said that mandate includes no patrols of any \"no-fly zone\" in the region.\n\nThe U.S. will provide whatever assistance it can to Ukraine, working with NATO partners, she said, but: \"We're not going to put American troops in danger. So that means we're not going to put American troops in the air as well. But we will work with the Ukrainians to give them the ability to defend themselves.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRussian troops stalled outside Kyiv\n\nThe main force of Russian assault aimed at Kyiv remained stalled Sunday about 18 miles from the city’s center, hindered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and Russia’s own problems providing fuel and supplies for its troops, according to a senior Defense Department official.\n\nThere are indications of some fighting inside Kyiv and that Russian troops in Ukrainian military uniforms have appeared there, said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nThe officials described Ukrainian resistance as stiff and creative around Kyiv and Kharkiv. Meantime, fuel shortages and logistics problems for Russian troops are most acute near Kharkiv.\n\nThe war is a major operation for Russia’s military, a complex mission that it does not have recent experience mounting, the official said. It’s unclear if the shortages in materials represent a failure in planning or execution. However, the official said Russian officers are expected to learn and adapt to its logistical problems.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, there are troubling indications that Russia is encircling the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, and could be planning to besiege it, the official said. There are increasing rocket attacks there, imprecise weapons that can kill civilians and damage infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Russian President Vladimir Putin has committed two-thirds of the combat forces he deployed against Ukraine is now inside the country, the official said.\n\nRussia has launched more 320 ballistic missiles into Ukraine during the four-day war. There are some indications that several ballistic missiles have failed to launch.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nU.S.: Putin ‘can be assured’ of tougher sanctions\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said Sunday the U.S. will continue to apply stiffer economic sanctions against Russia as Putin escalates fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"We are continuing to assess what we can do moving forward,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\" \"And the Russians can be assured that we will continue to put more and more sanctions as they continue to press more on the Ukrainian government.”\n\nU.S. and Western allies have cut some Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial system but stopped short of a complete removal.\n\n“They will feel the pain,” she said, adding there are also actions the U.N. can take.\n\n“We can isolate them. We can isolate them in the United Nations. We can isolate them in U.N. specialized agencies. They are feeling that isolation.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nNATO leader: Russia must make 'serious compromises' in peace talks\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said if peace talks are to succeed, Russia must be willing to make \"serious compromises\" and \"respect the sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nStoltenberg told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Putin's decision to put his nuclear forces on high alert is not a good sign.\n\nIt \"just adds to the very aggressive rhetoric\" of Russia, the NATO leader said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine ambassador: Russia committing ‘war crimes’\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to the United States accused Russia of committing war crimes in its attack on her country.\n\nAmbassador Oksana Markarova said Sunday that Russian troops are using heavy missiles and heavy artillery to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure, as well as hospitals and kindergartens. Many children have been killed, and one entire family was shot in their car, she said.\n\n“Nothing is off limits to them,” Markarova said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “What we see is a full-fledged war, with war crimes on the ground.”’\n\nAsked whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is safe, Markarova offered no information on his whereabouts but added, “He is as safe as our country.”\n\nShe spoke shortly after Zelenskyy’s office confirmed that a delegation will meet with Russian officials. Marakova said Ukraine is ready “for any peace talks that would stop the war and get them out from our country.” But the Ukrainians will not surrender, she said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nCotton: West must stop ‘pussyfooting around’ on sanctions\n\nSen. Tom Cotton on Sunday called on the Biden administration and American businesses to provide “no support whatsoever” to Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“We can do more than prayers and hashtags and lining up building storage,” he said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “It's time for the president and some of our European partners to quit pussyfooting around.”\n\nCotton appealed to the Biden administration to increase its sanctions on Russian banks, arguing that while the administration says it has sanctioned 80% of Russian banks, Russian President Vladimir Putin “controls 100% of banks.”\n\nThe Arkansas Republican also blamed Western nations for underestimating Putin’s ambition.\n\nDespite a strong condemnation of Putin, Cotton stopped short of condemning former President Donald Trump, who has called Putin “smart” and his plan both “savvy” and “genius.” Cotton repeatedly said he does not speak for other politicians.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\n‘This is a different Putin’: Rice says Putin ‘erratic’\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice said Russian President Vladimir Putin recent behavior is a departure from her past encounters with the “cold and calculating” leader.\n\n“This is a different Putin,” Rice, who served under former President George W. Bush, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" “He seems erratic… He has descended into something I have not seen before.”\n\nWhile Rice said the prospect of peace talks was promising, she urged Ukraine to follow the advice of former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n“Trust but verify,” she said. “It’s always a good thing if there is a chance (at peace),” she said.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nPsaki: Putin 'manufacturing threats' to justify attack on Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to put nuclear deterrent forces on high alert is another example of the Russian leader “manufacturing threats” to justify aggression against Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday.\n\n“We’ve seen him do this time and time again,” Psaki said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “At no time has Russia been under threat from NATO.”\n\n“This is all a pattern from President Putin,” Psaki said, “and we’re all going to stand up” to him.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nCondoleeza Rice: Putin faces unexpected reality in Ukraine\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice said Russian President Vladimir Putin may have “bitten off more than he can chew” perhaps forcing early peace talks.\n\nRice, speaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" said Putin likely believed that he could \"waltz\" into Ukraine.\n\n“But the reality has been quite different.”\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nRomney casts the war as a battle of 'good and evil'\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, cast Ukraine's defense against the Russian invasion as a battle of \"good and evil,\" and called for more sanctions on the \"evil regime\" of Vladimir Putin.\n\nSpeaking on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Romney also said he hopes Putin will use potential peace talks with Ukraine as an opportunity to back off.\n\n\"He made a huge error,\" Romney said of Putin. \"This is not going well for him.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\n‘A thug and despot’: Putin to feel pain of new financial sanctions\n\nRemoving Russia from a global banking network as part of a new round of sanctions “will make a big difference” in isolating the Kremlin, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies Saturday cut Russia from the key financial messaging network known as SWIFT, in an escalation of its sanctioning campaign.\n\nKlobuchar called Putin “a thug and a despot,” who misjudged the world’s reaction to Russia aggression.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\n'Unacceptable': Thomas-Greenfield says Putin escalating conflict in Ukraine\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday that Vladimir Putin’s decision to put nuclear deterrent forces on high alert indicates the Russian president is “continuing to escalate” the war in Ukraine in a way that is “unacceptable.”\n\nSpeaking on CBS’ \"Face the Nation,\" Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. is using “every possible lever” to stop Russia’s invasion of its neighbor and that the U.N. Security Council will meet later Sunday.\n\n“I’m not surprised at this information because Putin has tried every means possible to actually put fear in the world in terms of his actions. It just means that we need to ramp up up our actions at the U.N.”\n\nWhen asked whether there’s a threat of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, Thomas-Greenfield responded: “Certainly nothing is off the table with this guy.”\n\n– Sean Rossman\n\nPutin orders nuclear deterrent forces on high alert\n\nRussia President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces Sunday to be on high alert, a dramatic escalation of tensions with the West that brought immediate condemnation from the U.S. as Russia continues its full-scale assault on Ukraine.\n\nPutin, announcing the move on Russian state television, called it a response to “aggressive statements” and tough financial sections from NATO countries. The extraordinary step raises the threat of nuclear warfare entering the conflict in Ukraine, a scenario the White House has previously said it has not assessed.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, condemned the action as “unacceptable\" in an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nPutin directed the Russian defense minister and the chief of the military’s General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a “special regime of combat duty” during a meeting with top officials.\n\n“Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,” Putin said in televised comments.\n\nAt the onset of the conflict with Ukraine, Putin warned that any nation that would “hinder us” will face\" such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,” although he did not elaborate what he meant.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n-- Joey Garrison, Associated Press\n\nKyiv eerily quiet after explosions\n\nThe capital, Kyiv, was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault.\n\n“The past night was tough – more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn’t consider as admissible targets.”\n\nVideos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The images showed Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. In one image, Ukrainian troops were seen firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby.\n\nThe images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine’s bigger cities. Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy asks UN top court to halt Russian invasion, says Moscow 'manipulating the notion of genocide'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of manipulating the notion of genocide to justify invading its neighbor and urged the International Court of Justice to hold trials.\n\nLocated in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICJ is the main judicial arm of the United Nations.\n\n\"Russia must be held accountable for manipulating the notion of genocide to justify aggression. We request an urgent decision ordering Russia to cease military activity now and expect trials to start next week,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe ICJ rules on disputes between states, including responsibility for breaches of international law. It is not linked to the International Criminal Court, also based in The Hague, which holds individuals accountable for atrocities.\n\n– Caren Bohan and Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy is a lion of a leader | Opinion\n\n“I need ammunition, not a ride.” Those are the words proclaimed by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the midst of terrible death and destruction and the most egregious threat to Europe since World War II, Ukrainians are teaching the rest of the world a lesson about freedom, resolve and love of country.\n\nWhen offered an escape from Kyiv, allegedly by the United States, the 44-year-old Ukrainian president immediately rejected the notion and demonstrated selfless leadership and a portrait of courage generally reserved for Hollywood.\n\nMany leaders would have abandoned ship, putting their own personal safety above that of their countrymen. Zelenskyy, on the other hand, is taking a stand for freedom, boldly demonstrating that freedom is worth fighting for; that a government of, by and for the people is worth defending.\n\n– August Pfluger (Read more of August Pfluger's column.)\n\nNHL star Alex Ovechkin called over over stance on war\n\nHockey Hall of Famer Dominik Hasek has called for the NHL to \"immediately suspend contracts for all Russian players\" amidst Russia's deadly invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe 57-year-old Czech also had some choice words for Washington Capitals' Russian-born star Alex Ovechkin, a supporter of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHasek, who played in the NHL for 16-seasons and is widely considered one of the best goaltenders of all time, called Ovechkin an \"alibist,\" a \"liar\" and a \"chicken (expletive)\" after Ovechkin failed to publicly denounce Putin and his country's aggression.\n\n– Cydney Henderson\n\nUkraine rejects location for talks with Russia\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country is ready for peace talks with Russia but not in Belarus.\n\nSpeaking in a video message Sunday, Zelenskyy suggested meeting in Warsaw, Poland; Bratislava, Slovakia; Istanbul; Budapest, Hungary; or Baku, Azerbaijan. He said other locations are also possible but made clear that Ukraine doesn’t accept Russia’s selection of Belarus, which Russia has used as a staging ground for its invasion.\n\nThe Kremlin said Sunday a Russian delegation had arrived in Homel, Belarus, for talks with Ukrainian officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the delegation includes military officials and diplomats.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRussia's cutting off port access\n\nRussia was working Sunday to limit strategic strategic ports along the Ukraine’s coastline stretching from the border with Romania in the west to the border with Russia in the east. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said Russian forces had blocked the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea.\n\nRussia’s military also put increasing pressure on strategic ports in the south of Ukraine, blocking the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea.\n\nCutting Ukraine’s access to its sea ports would deal a major blow to the country’s economy.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nRussia targets Ukraine airfields in next phase\n\nRussia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine targeting airfields and fuel facilities in what appeared to be the next phase of an invasion that has been slowed by fierce resistance. The U.S. and EU responded with weapons and ammunition for the outnumbered Ukrainians and powerful sanctions intended to further isolate Moscow.\n\nHuge explosions lit up the sky early Sunday south of the capital, Kyiv, where people hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale assault by Russian forces.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nWhere are Russian military forces? Tracking the Ukraine invasion\n\n'You cannot defeat a whole nation'\n\nOn Sunday morning, Ukranian writer Illarion Pavliuk plans to set out on a dangerous journey to help his countrymen as explosions rock Kyiv, and outgunned Ukrainian forces continue to maintain control of their capital.\n\nPavliuk is not a solider, but he does have a military background. In 2015, he was an intelligence volunteer in the war in Eastern Ukraine. And yet, this is what Ukraine has become – a country where internationally acclaimed artists are forced to kiss their children goodnight before they go off to defend their homeland from the occupying force. \"We will never give up and we are going to win this war. You cannot defeat the whole nation. And Ukrainians are absolutely united as a nation now.\"\n\nHis words are haunting and powerful, with his children in the background.\n\n\"What can I tell you about this war? It is difficult to say a couple of words,\" he says. \"I would never ever imagine my four children dropping their toys and running to sit in the thickest doorway in the house because of cruise missiles above our city; ballistic missiles.\n\n\"And I would never imagine this and I will never forgive Russia.\"\n\n– Carli Pierson, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/27"}]}

Kennedy Memorial Stadium in the district ‒ unless the Commanders adopt its former name, the Redskins. The team has played in Landover, Maryland, since 1997.\n\nLike any other private company, however, the Commanders organization gets to choose its name. Washington retired the name Redskins in July 2020 amid nationwide protests over race, initially becoming the Washington Football Team for two seasons, and then rebranding as the Washington Commanders in 2022.\n\nTrump can't unilaterally scrap the team's stadium deal for Washington because Congress passed a law in December that transferred ownership of the RFK stadium site from the National Park Service to the District of Columbia. The $3.7 billion stadium deal, which includes $1.1 billion in local taxpayer funds, is in the hands of the D.C. Council, which is nearing a vote on the project.\n\n\"The president can say what he wants, but the law is clear. D.C. has full power over that site,\" said Ankit Jain, who serves as one of the district's two elected shadow U.S. senators. \"There are certain conditions that D.C. has to meet ‒ and none of them are, 'what is the name of the team.'\"\n\nWays Trump could try to impede stadium deal\n\nTrump called for the Commanders to revert to its original name in a July 20 social media post that also pushed for the Cleveland Guardians, formerly the Indians, to bring back its old name. \"There is a big clamoring for this,\" Trump wrote, adding in a subsequent post that he \"may put a restriction on them\" if the Commanders keep their name and \"won’t make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington.\"\n\nTrump has no role in approving the stadium project. But because of Washington's unique status as an enclave of the federal government, the president could potentially find ways to try to impede the deal.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, Congress has authority over the district. Although the 1973 District of Columbia Home Rule Act gave the city local governance with an elected mayor and city council, Congress still has a 30-day review of all legislation passed by the D.C. Council and retains authority over the district's budget.\n\nThat arrangement could give Trump an opportunity to rally Republicans in Congress to block the stadium legislative package during the review period after the deal passes the council.\n\nIn addition, a memorandum of understanding between the district and Trump's Interior Department would be required to address environmental hazards with the RFK site. And the 12-member National Capital Planning Commission ‒ which includes three Trump appointments and three Republican members of Congress ‒ must sign off on final stadium designs. Both hurdles could present Trump moments for intervention.\n\nTrump has also shown a willingness in other political battles to threaten federal funding from states, cities, colleges and universities to get his way. Would he be willing to do the same to the district over the Commanders' name issue?\n\n\"I don't think this is a serious threat,\" Jain said of Trump's demand that the Commanders adopt its old name. Instead, Jain suggested Trump raised the issue as \"a distraction\" from the backlash the president has faced for his handling of the government's files involving wealthy financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\"I don't think it's something that he's going to really follow up on, and there's very limited ability for him to do anything there,\" Jain said.\n\nTrue loyalist in Congress has helped pave way to stadium\n\nThe White House insists Trump isn't kidding around.\n\n“The president was serious,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters July 21, pointing to Trump's reputation as a dealmaker. “As part of the ‘art of the deal,’ part of his negotiating skills, as you know, sports is one of the many passions of this president and he wants to see this team’s name changed.\"\n\nWhen asked to explain Trump's authority to block the Commanders' stadium deal, a White House official directed USA TODAY to the comments from Leavitt, who did not address how Trump could execute his threat.\n\nConvincing Republicans in Congress to block the stadium deal if the council approves the legislation could be a tough sale, even for Trump.\n\nRep. James Comer, R-Kentucky, a Trump ally and chairman of the House Oversight Committee, worked to get the land transfer of the RFK site through Congress and is a vocal supporter of the project. In a July 17 letter to the D.C. Council's chairman, Comer urged the council to approve the stadium deal no later than August and expressed disappointment in delays that have held up a vote.\n\n\"The federal government transferred administrative control of this valuable property with the clear expectation that the D.C. Council would act decisively to maximize its potential,\" Comer wrote.\n\nCommanders, DC mayor stay quiet on Trump\n\nIn 2023, longtime Washington owner Daniel Snyder sold the team to a new ownership group led by billionaire investor Josh Harris, who has elected to keep Commanders as the name and has called the debate settled. The team just completed its most successful season in decades, capped by an appearance in the NFC championship game.\n\nThe Commanders and Harris have not issued a formal statement on Trump's remarks. Commanders General Manager Adam Peters, addressing reporters on the first day of training camp for veteran players on July 22, said the team isn't focused on the stadium situation.\n\n\"We really just try to focus on what's going on in here and getting ready for the season,\" Peters said.\n\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who helped orchestrate the stadium deal, deflected when a reporter asked her July 21 whether she believes Trump has the power to block the Commanders' stadium deal.\n\n\"I think the thing that we should focus on in D.C. is doing our part,\" Bowser said, adding that the council still needs to give the green light. \"We need to complete our part.\"\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has often talked about taking over the governance of the district, a city he has long derided for crime and homelessness. Nevertheless, Trump hosted Bowser and the Commanders' Harris at the White House in May to announce Washington's National Mall would host the 2027 NFL Draft.\n\nTrump never mentioned the Commander's name during the announcement\n\nMore than a decade ago, Trump had a very different take in 2013 when then-President Barack Obama said the Redskins should consider changing the team name to something less offensive.\n\n\"President should not be telling the Washington Redskins to change their name-our country has far bigger problems!\" Trump wrote on Twitter at the time. \"FOCUS on them, not nonsense.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/07/21/commanders-name-change-president-donald-trump/85306843007/", "title": "Why did the Commanders change their name?

On July 20, President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he could block a deal if the team doesn't bring back their old name.\n\n\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nHere's a look at how we got here, including the origin of the Commanders' name change, whether they can change it back and what the President has said about the issue.\n\nWhy did the Commanders change their name?\n\nWashington's NFL franchise introduced the \"Commanders\" moniker in advance of the 2022 season after two years as the Washington Football Team.\n\nThe move was necessitated by the overwhelming pressure that began to mount against the much more controversial namesake.\n\nOriginally born into the NFL in 1932 as the Boston Braves, the franchise changed its name after one season to the version considered offensive to Native Americans in 1933. It was a name that remained through the team's relocation to Washington in 1937 and withstood the test of time until the it couldn't anymore ahead of the 2020 season.\n\nFollowing George Floyd's death in Minnesota, protests broke out across the country in opposition to police brutality and racism. That also put the spotlight on Washington's team, which began feeling the heat from sponsors like FedEx, Nike and PepsiCo.\n\nAdweek reported in 2020 that 87 investment firms worth a collective $620 billion at the time sent a letter to some of the team's biggest sponsors – FedEx, Nike and PepsiCo – asking them to sever ties with the team if they refused the name change.\n\nPrevious owner Dan Snyder was adamant for years that the name would never be changed.\n\n\"We will never change the name of the team,\" Snyder told USA TODAY Sports in 2013. \"As a lifelong (name) fan, and I think that the (name) fans understand the great tradition and what it's all about and what it means, so we feel pretty fortunate to be just working on next season.\"\n\nDespite years of lawsuits and pressure from Native American groups, Snyder vowed he would never cave on the issue.\n\n\"We'll never change the name,\" Snyder said at the time. \"It's that simple. NEVER – you can use caps.\"\n\nHowever, the sponsors threats were more than enough for Snyder to reconsider his position and the old name was removed ahead of the 2020 season, sparking a search for a new one.\n\n\"We are announcing we will be retiring the (former) name and logo upon completion of this review,\" the team said in a statement and that team officials were \"working closely to develop a new name and design approach that will enhance the standing of our proud, tradition rich franchise and inspire our sponsors, fans and community for the next 100 years.\"\n\nWhat Trump has said about Commanders name change\n\nTrump has been a fixture throughout the Commanders recent rebrands and controversy. The pivot away from the controversial name came during the first Trump administration and now the stadium deal has taken centerstage during the second.\n\nThe president has always been opposed to switch, but struck a different chord earlier this month when asked about the team's move back to the RFK site.\n\n“It doesn’t have the same ring to me,” he told reporters on July 7. “But, you know, winning can make everything sound good. So, if they win, all of a sudden, the Commanders sounds good, but I wouldn’t have changed it.”\n\nWhile Trump wasn't in favor of the move, it was a decidedly different tone than the one he took at the time in 2020.\n\n\"They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins & Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct,\" Trump tweeted in response to the initial change.\n\nHe renewed that rhetoric on July 20, when he threatened to block the team's new stadium deal in the district, adding they should immediately bring back the old name.\n\n\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,\" Trump later posted.\n\n\"The Team would be much more valuable, and the Deal would be more exciting for everyone,\" he continued, adding that the Cleveland Guardians should also follow suit.\n\nIt's unclear what power the president has in this case, considering Congress turned over control of the RFK Stadium land to the city with the passage of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act in January.\n\nWill the Commanders change their name?\n\nIt's unlikely a move back to the old controversial nickname will happen, given recent stance from team brass.\n\nIf there was any doubt, team owner Josh Harris seemingly put a return to the old name to bed at a press conference in February.\n\n\"Now, in this building, the name Commanders means something,\" Harris said. \"It's about players who love football, are great at football, hit hard, mentally tough, great teammates. It's really meaningful that that name is growing in meaning.\"\n\nWhile the owner acknowledged that the team will honor its past, he pointed out that the name is here to stay.\n\n\"I think it's now being embraced by our team, by our culture, by our coaching staff. And so we're going with that,\" Harris said.\n\nNot only have the Commanders shown no interest in reverting to their name, but NFL rules dictate that it might not be a possibility at this time either.\n\nAs any name change would also be likely be accompanied with new jerseys, the NFL's uniform rules come into focus. As detailed in 2002 Resolution G-3 under Article 19 of the NFL's constitution, a team cannot change its jerseys more than once every five years.\n\nGiven that the team just unveiled new jerseys ahead of the 2022 season, they cannot make a switch again until 2027.\n\nThere is a clause for \"extenuating circumstances\" built in that would allow for a faster rebrand. It is determined by the commissioner, but relocation and ownership change are considered extenuating.\n\nAny name change would likely need the approval of the league, as was the case in 2020 when Washington first changed its team nickname to the Commanders.\n\nWhat Trump has said about the Cleveland Guardians\n\nThe Commanders aren't the only team that faced controversy surrounding their team name. MLB's Cleveland Guardians also drew the ire of Trump, who suggested they should also bring back their old name.\n\nCleveland didn't make the move until ahead of the 2022 MLB season, three years after they dropped the \"Chief Wahoo\" mascot and logo.\n\nTrump said that it was cancel culture in a 2020 tweet, indicating he was no fan of that decision.\n\nThe Guardians arrived at the conclusion to change their name after team owner Paul Dolan changed his stance on the matter, citing a changing world in the aftermath of the social unrest in 2020.\n\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

They've traded for left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Deebo Samuel to bolster one of the top offenses in the NFL from a year ago. On defense, they added decorated pass rusher Von Miller in free agency.\n\nThere's been news off the field as well with the franchise announcing plans to build a new stadium in Washington D.C. The franchise hopes to build on the site of RFK Memorial Stadium where the team played from 1961 to 1996 and is two miles east of the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nWashington may be facing a challenge as well from the highest-ranking elected official in the country.\n\nPresident Trump posted on Truth Social that he may restrict the team from building on the old RFK Stadium site if it doesn't change its name.\n\n\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington (name),' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,\" Trump posted.\n\nHe continued: \"The Team would be much more valuable, and the Deal would be more exciting for everyone.\" He went on to state that the Cleveland Guardians should do the same and change the franchise name back to its former name.\n\nWashington also faces some question marks with getting that deal with Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser needing to get approval from the D.C. Council.\n\n\"I would put my level of concern – because when you're a big city mayor you're concerned about everything – I'll put it at a four [out of five],\" Bowser said earlier this month.\n\nWashington started out as the Boston Braves back in 1932 before changing its name in 1933. The franchise kept its now-former name when it relocated from Boston to Washington D.C. in 1937 and it remained for decades.\n\nWASHINGTON UNIFORMS: Commanders reveal alternate uniforms that nod to their Super Bowl glory\n\nIn July 2020, the franchise dropped the name and logo.\n\n\"We are announcing we will be retiring the (former) name and logo upon completion of this review,\" the team said in a statement at the time and that team officials were \"working closely to develop a new name and design approach that will enhance the standing of our proud, tradition rich franchise and inspire our sponsors, fans and community for the next 100 years.\"\n\nThe franchise went by the name Washington Football Team for the 2020 and 2021 NFL seasons before rebranding as the Washington Commanders ahead of the 2022 season.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump's voiced his dislike for the Commanders name. When asked about the stadium plans earlier in July, Trump said he wouldn't have changed the name in the first place.\n\n\"It just doesn't have the same, it doesn't have the same ring to me,\" he said. “But, you know, winning can make everything sound good. So if they win, all of a sudden the Commanders sounds good, but I wouldn’t have changed the name.”\n\nA new stadium is one of the top priorities of the Commanders' new ownership group led by Josh Harris. That group finished a deal to buy the team in May 2023 and are hoping to finish construction by the 2030 NFL season.\n\nIn the meantime, the team would continue to play its home games at Northwest Stadium – formerly known as FedEx Field – in Landover, Maryland.\n\nThe team has not released a statement in response to Trump's comments at time of publishing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/commanders/2025/07/21/trump-commanders-rfk-stadium-dc-reacts/85310141007/", "title": "Commanders fans have pointed response for Trump on team name ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — D.C.-area residents have a message for President Donald Trump who is threatening to derail the Commanders' pending football stadium deal unless the team restores its old name: Stay out of the city's business and do your job.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social on July 20 that he may block a deal for the team to build a new stadium on the old RFK Stadium site if the team doesn't switch back to its former name, considered offensive to Native Americans.\n\n\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,\" Trump posted.\n\nSteve Mahoney, 62, said Trump has “bigger fish to fry” than pressuring the Commanders to change the team name. “Focus on lowering prices, everything else that he said he was going to do that he's not doing,” he said.\n\nMahoney, who retired from a career in pharmaceuticals, has held onto his love for his hometown team, the Chicago Bears. Now a Washington resident, he wants Trump to let both the capital city and its football team handle their own affairs, Mahoney said.\n\n“The fans have adopted the new name,\" Mahoney said, \"and there’s no reason to change it back.”\n\nJessica Brown, 48, said she only pays “just enough attention” to the president to “know how he can affect my life.”\n\nThe stadium issue is apparently one of those cases. When it came to Trump’s threats to block the RFK Stadium deal, Brown didn’t hold back. “He should just keep his nose in his own lane,” she said.\n\nBrown, a nurse from Alexandria, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, said she supported the Commanders and other teams changing their names to avoid titles broadly seen as racist.\n\n“You should just choose other names. There are so many others,” she said. Her advice for local leaders involved in the stadium deal – “ignore him.”\n\nTwo new names, and then one stunning season\n\nIn 2013, then-team owner Dan Snyder bluntly told USA TODAY: “We'll never change the name. It's that simple. NEVER — you can use caps.”\n\nBut once major corporate sponsors threatened to pull funding amid the George Floyd protests in 2020, Snyder and the league had little choice. Major League Baseball's Cleveland Guardians also underwent a name change around the same time and have been the subject of Trump's recent nickname crusades.\n\nThe team rid itself of the former nickname in 2020 and went by “Washington Football Team” for two seasons before the “Commanders” rebrand in 2022.\n\nWhen the Commanders were sold in 2023, the potential for another name change became possible, although it was not a priority for the new regime led by managing partner Josh Harris. In a news conference at the conclusion of a stunning season − which saw the often cellar-dweller team come within one game of the Super Bowl − Harris essentially quashed any idea of a name change.\n\nThe organization and players have embraced the “Commanders” name − as have exuberant fans thrilled with the team's turnaround. But any name change would never have resulted in a reversion to the pre-2020 name.\n\nLast year, both parties of Congress worked together to pass a bill that gave the local D.C. government a 99-year lease of the land on which the RFK Stadium site and the surrounding acreage sit on the banks of the Anacostia River near the eastern edge of the city. The Commanders played at RFK Stadium from 1961-1996 and have played at NorthWest Stadium in Landover, Maryland – considered one of the NFL's worst stadiums – since.\n\nThat paved the way for the Commanders and D.C. to hammer out a $3.7 billion stadium deal, which was announced in April. The agreement would cost the District a projected $1.1 billion, while the Commanders are contributing $2.7 billion.\n\nTrump's threat called a move 'to get attention'\n\nGriffin Lafayette, a Raleigh, North Carolina native visiting Washington, called Trump’s threat to block the RFK stadium deal if the Washington Commanders don’t revert their name back to the original nickname “really stupid.”\n\n“It’s just on his laundry list of things to complain about to get attention,” said Lafayette, a 25-year-old football fan.\n\nLafayette said he was “all for” ditching the team’s original name.\n\nGerald Collins, 66, said he doesn’t care about the team name, but he wants Trump to “stay out” of the RFK stadium deal.\n\n“He isn’t a Washingtonian,” said Collins, a lifelong DC resident who works in construction. “What he’s doing is very wrong. He just wants to control things.\"\n\nCollins said he will always support the team no matter its name. He hopes the deal moves forward because it will bring the team back to the area where he watched them play when he was growing up.\n\nMayor confident stadium deal will get done\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a champion of the stadium deal who earlier this year negotiated with the NHL’s Washington Capitals and NBA’s Washington Wizards to remain in the District, was asked about Trump’s power to block the agreement.\n\n“I think the thing that we should focus on in D.C. is doing our part,\" Bowser said. \"I have worked for the better part of 10 years to get our part completed, including getting control of the land, coming to an agreement with the team and advancing a fantastic agreement to the Council. So we need to do our part. Let’s focus on doing our part.”\n\nIt is now up to the D.C. City Council to approve the deal. D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, a skeptic of the proposal, has yet to set a specific date for a vote on it. Public hearings on the matter scheduled for July 29 and 30.\n\n“No, it wouldn’t,” Bowser responded when asked whether the name being changed – even to the former name – would affect her support of the current stadium plan.\n\nThe topic has been of growing interest to Trump. On July 6, Trump told reporters that he wouldn’t have changed the name, although he elaborated that “winning” could make the name for palatable to him personally.\n\nSteven Kiekel, 36, said Trump’s threats to block the stadium came as little surprise – even though Trump announced May 5 in the Oval Office with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, Harris and Bowser standing beside him that the 2027 NFL Draft is being held in D.C.\n\n“Sounds like typical Trump being Trump,” he said. “If they wait long enough, he’ll get distracted, and it’ll go through.”\n\nKiekel, an engineer and Washington native, isn’t an avid sports follower, apart from some soccer. But he lives near the proposed stadium in the shadows of the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“It’s tricky” because of Washington’s unique relationship with the federal government, Kiekel said. Questions over Trump and the federal government's actual oversight of the land, especially under the new law, have emerged.\n\nDon't mess with success and leave the name, fan says\n\nJames Anderson, 47, said he hopes Trump’s threats don’t force the Commanders to revert to their former name, mainly because he wants the team’s good fortune to continue.\n\n“They’ve been playing much better so I don’t want them to change anything again,” he said. Last season, the Commanders advanced to the franchise's first NFC championship in 33 years.\n\nMaureen Brown, 57, said it would be a “huge step back” if the Commanders returned to their former name.\n\n“I don’t want to see them go back,” she said. “The Commanders is a fine name. ‘The Red Wolves’ would be good, too.”\n\nBrown, who has lived in Washington for 18 years, said she has never seen a game because their current stadium is inaccessible without a car. The team moving to Washington − especially to her neighborhood − would give her plenty of chances to see her favorite player, quarterback Jayden Daniels, in the flesh. Daniels was the 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year after a record-setting season in which the Commanders went 12-5 under first-year coach Dan Quinn.\n\nAnderson, who works as security guard for federal buildings, moved to Washington from Texas 15 years ago and promptly dropped the Dallas Cowboys to support his new home team.\n\nHe said if the Commanders leave Maryland for a new stadium in Washington, he would be able to go to their home games.\n\n“I was a Redskins fan much longer than I’ve been a Commanders fan,” he said. “But they have a good thing going now.”\n\nTrump’s threats, he added, are “only about himself” – not the team or its fans.\n\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

Kennedy Memorial Stadium in D.C., which served as Washington's home stadium from 1961 to 1996, before the team's move to Landover, Maryland.\n\nTrump’s ability to unilaterally scrap the team's deal for a new stadium to return to the RFK site appears doubtful after Congress passed a law in December that transferred ownership of the RFK stadium site from the National Park Service to the District of Columbia. The $3.7 billion stadium deal, which includes $1.1 billion in local taxpayer funds, is in the hands of the D.C. Council, which is nearing a vote on the project.\n\nHowever, Trump has shown a willingness in other political battles to threaten federal funding from states, cities, colleges and universities to get his way. Another route could be to lobby Republicans in Congress to rescind the land transfer bill they passed last year.\n\nWhite House doubles down on Trump's threat\n\nLeavitt pointed to Trump's reputation as a dealmaker. “As part of the ‘art of the deal,’ part of his negotiating skills, as you know, sports is one of the many passions of this president and he wants to see this team’s name changed,” she said.\n\nWhen asked to explain Trump's authority to block the Commanders' stadium deal, a White House official directed USA TODAY to Leavitt's remarks.\n\nLongtime Washington owner Daniel Snyder in 2023 sold the team to a new ownership group led by billionaire investor Josh Harris, who has elected to keep Commanders as the name and has called the debate settled.\n\nThe Commanders, which enjoyed its most successful season in decades after making it to the NFC Championship Game last year, have not commented since Trump brought up the team's name in a Truth Social post on Sunday. In the same post, Trump called on another professional sports team that was previously named for native Americans ‒ the Cleveland Guardians, formerly the Indians ‒ to go back to its old name.\n\n\"The Washington 'Whatever’s' should IMMEDIATELY change their name back to the Washington Redskins Football Team. There is a big clamoring for this,\" Trump wrote. \"Times are different now than they were three or four years ago. We are a Country of passion and common sense. OWNERS, GET IT DONE!!!\"\n\nTrump had previously voiced support for the team's former name, but it marked the first time he has used his position to call for a name change. He followed it up with a subsequent post suggesting he might hold up the team's stadium plans if it doesn't ditch Commanders and go back to its former name.\n\n\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don’t change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,'\" Trump wrote. \"I won’t make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington. The Team would be much more valuable, and the Deal would be more exciting for everyone.\"\n\nDC mayor focuses on council, not Trump\n\nUnder the Constitution, Congress has authority over the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act, signed by President Richard Nixon in 1973, gave the city local governance including an elected mayor and city council. However, Congress can still review all legislation passed by the D.C. Council and retains authority over the district's budget.\n\nNo sign off from Trump is required for approval of the Commanders' stadium deal.\n\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who helped orchestrate the stadium deal, deflected when a reporter asked her Monday whether she believes Trump has the power to block the Commanders' stadium deal.\n\n\"I think the thing that we should focus on in D.C. is doing our part,\" Bowser said, adding that the council still needs to approve the stadium deal. \"We need to complete our part.\"\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has often talked about taking over the governance of D.C., a city he has long derided for crime and homelessness. Nevertheless, Trump hosted Bowser and the Commanders' Harris at the White House in May to announce Washington's National Mall would host the 2027 NFL Draft.\n\n“I think you’ve seen the president gets involved in a lot of things that most presidents have not,\" Leavitt said when asked why changing the Commanders' name is a priority for Trump. \"He’s a nontraditional president. He likes to see results on behalf of the American people.”\n\nShe added that Trump is getting behind something most Americans want.\n\n\"If you actually poll this issue with sports fans across the country and even in this city, people actually do support the president’s position on this and the name change,\" Leavitt said.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/07/22/commanders-trumpmalcolm-jamal-warner-heat-dome-ice-immigration-colbert-happy-gilmore/85319192007/", "title": "Commanders, Trump, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, ICE, immigrant, heat ...", "text": "Good morning!🙋🏼‍♀️ I'm Nicole Fallert.

The federal spending plan, among other things, provides funding for 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to help carry out Trump's plan to deport 1 million people annually.

In a process called evapotranspiration, plants release water vapor into the atmosphere. The released water combines with other water molecules and humidifies the air. In the Plains and Midwest regions, where there are millions of acres of corn and soybean crops, it makes a difference, pumping billions of gallons of water into the atmosphere in some states. Extra water can add 5 to 10 degrees to the dew point, a measure of the humidity in the air, on a hot summer day.

C’mon, Roger Goodell. With a new NFL season kicking off as training camps open – and even more notably, with the Commander-in-Chief wrapping his roll back the clock nonsense with a threat to thwart efforts to build a new stadium for Washington’s cherished football team – it’s a perfect time to double down on values.\n\nSo, Donald Trump wants the NFL franchise to reinstate the racial slur as its name?\n\nSomebody – and especially Harris, the franchise’s owner, and Goodell, the league’s commissioner – needs to set the record straight. Publicly. Again. Just because.\n\nIf you’re proud to be called the Washington Commanders and dedicated to moving forward with the name that was instituted in 2022, just say so.\n\nInstead, as of Monday afternoon, the NFL and Commanders have given us crickets.\n\nWhat a shame.\n\nWhen contacted on Monday by USA TODAY Sports, the Commanders had no comment or statement regarding the remarks Trump posted on social media. The NFL did not respond to a request for a response.\n\nTrump also suggested that the Cleveland Guardians go back to their former name and quite nobly, the team had a quick response and reiterated how excited it is to continue building its brand as the Guardians. No confusion there.\n\nBy contrast, the Commanders (and the NFL) have dropped the ball by hiding in silence.\n\nSure, the issue has played out over decades and Harris, who purchased the franchise from Dan Snyder in 2023 for a record price of $6.05 billion, has repeatedly stated that the old name – the “R-word” – isn’t coming back.\n\nAnd no, every time an individual or group demands that they revert back, there’s no need to respond.\n\nThis, however, is a different circumstance that begs for a statement from a franchise that has reinvigorated its fan base with the promise of quality football on top of a new generation of leadership. The don’t-dignify-the-insult-with-a-response option doesn’t cut it here, given the grandstand that reignited the topic.\n\nNever mind that it’s highly questionable, if not doubtful, that Trump could block efforts by the team and D.C. City Council to seal the deal for the proposed $4 billion stadium on the grounds of RFK Stadium.\n\nHe declared, “I may put a restriction on them if they don’t change the name back.”\n\nPerception: You’ve been punked by the playground bully.\n\nGiven the journey of the Commanders and the NFL to change from the previous name and previous ownership regime to restore the value of a signature franchise, there’s something to be said for standing their ground on principle.\n\nIn other words, letting it slide looks rather weak.\n\nThe team deserves for the preseason buzz to focus on expectations attached to the second NFL season with phenomenal quarterback Jayden Daniels, not on whether Trump will try to muck up a deal for a new stadium based on an issue that has come and gone.\n\nOh, the stench of politics. The Commanders and the NFL are better off with Trump in their corner, with the league’s tentpole draft coming to D.C. in 2027 fueling momentum for a new stadium that projects for a 2030 completion.\n\nBy not responding publicly to Trump on the name-change issue, though, the Commanders and NFL have seemingly chosen to try not ticking off the bully who has chosen to scream in your face. Sad.\n\nThen again, this line-in-the-sand stuff from Trump was destined to happen at some point for the NFL. During his last term, Trump disparaged the league – including its owners and players – over the national anthem protests. His venom appealed to his base, predictably, yet also forced the NFL to react.\n\nThis doesn’t compare to the anthem protests, but some of the same racial insensitivity exists. And it’s no surprise that in targeting the NFL again, Trump is stooping so low to dangle the bait.\n\nWhich is exactly why, as a matter of principle. the Commanders and the NFL need to double down on their convictions.\n\nFollow Jarrett Bell on social media: On X: @JarrettBell\n\nOn Bluesky: jarrettbell.bsky.social", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}]}

While the system produced heavy rainfall of up to 12 inches in some areas and strong winds, damage was relatively limited.\n\nThe Philippine military confirmed nearly 1,000 dead but broken communications and transportation links meant that no one was able to assess damage in many villages in need of food, water and medical help.\n\nTacloban resembled a garbage dump from the air and only by a few concrete buildings that remained standing.\n\n\"I don't believe there is a single structure that is not destroyed or severely damaged in some way — every single building, every single house,\" U.S. Marine Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy said after taking a helicopter flight over the city. He spoke on the tarmac at the airport, where two Marine C-130 cargo planes were parked, engines running, unloading supplies.\n\nAuthorities said at least 9.7 million people in 41 provinces were affected by the typhoon. It's one of the most powerful recorded typhoons to ever hit land and likely the deadliest natural disaster to hit the Philippines. Entire villages were destroyed and cities devastated by huge waves and winds of nearly 150 mph.\n\nPhilippine soldiers were distributing food and water in Tacloban, and assessment teams from the United Nations and other international agencies were seen for the first time. The U.S. military dispatched food, water, generators and a contingent of Marines to the city, the first outside help in what will swell into a major international relief mission.\n\n\"This area has been totally ravaged,\" said Sebastien Sujobert, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Tacloban. \"Many lives were lost, a huge number of people are missing, and basic services such as drinking water and electricity have been cut off,\" he said.\n\nA weakened but still powerful Haiyan was churning through the South China Sea and made landfall in northern Vietnam, which evacuated tens of thousands of people.\n\nAt the White House, President Obama said he and his wife Michelle said they are \"deeply saddened'' by the death and damage in the Philippines and said the United States is assisting relief and recovery efforts. He praised the country's people for \"incredible resiliency.''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Philippines, authorities were still trying to get to islands that no one had been able to communicate with since the typhoon struck.\n\nFrantic relatives crowded into the Villamor Air Base in Manila to wait for transport planes that were rescuing people from at least six of the archipelago's more than 7,000 islands that were hit hardest.\n\nMaritess Tayag, in her 40s, and her sister, Maryann, 29, arrived at the airport dizzy, shaken and thirsty but elated to be alive. They came from their home in Tacloban on the island of Leyte, one of the hardest hit.\n\n\"I was in the house — trapped in my room. The water is up to my nose — I cannot breathe anymore. I am trying to save myself,\" said Maritess Tayag, describing the early hours of Saturday when ceaseless wind drove dark seawater mixed with foul-smelling water from canals higher and higher into their homes.\n\nHer brother was in the house, too, trying to keep his head above the rising water, she said. But, \"It reached up over his head. Then a big wave of fast flood reached up higher.\n\n\"I feel I would die at this moment because I can't — I don't know what I will do,\" Tayag said, crying.\n\nHer younger sister and sister-in-law made it to the roof. Her brother and mother did not, she said, and both are probably dead.\n\nMaryann Tayag described their town as looking as if it was a \"World War II city\" and said everyone was trying to flee in fear.\n\n\"It was almost a stampede at the airport in Tacloban,\" she said. \"Everyone was trying to get on the plane. It's really, really terrible.\"\n\nIt was not until Sunday that authorities communicated with Leyte island. The sisters said there was no power or phone service. They said they saw looting everywhere. Food and water are almost non-existent, they said.\n\n\"It's all washed out ... including the hospitals and malls, by the strong winds and floods that came,\" Maritess Tayag said.\n\n\"The hardest thing is ... seeing your mother floating in the flood and you don't know what to do. You just see there and the only thing is you have to save yourself,\" Maryann Tayag said. \"I could not save her because she drowned already, and it was not just water from the sea but mixed with dirty water — color black, like it came from river and smell like canal.\"\n\nRegional Police Chief Elmer Soria said he was briefed by Leyte provincial Gov. Dominic Petilla late Saturday and told there were about 10,000 deaths on the island, mostly by drowning and collapsed buildings. The governor's figure was based on reports from village officials in areas where Typhoon Haiyan hit Friday.\n\nTacloban city administrator Tecson Lim said that the death toll in the city \"could go up to 10,000.\" A mass burial was planned Sunday in Palo town near Tacloban.\n\nAfter two days with no news from her family, elementary teacher Cherry Gonzaga left her home in Manila for Cebu for a late-night ferry to Leyte island.\n\n\"There's no way to get through to them, and my entire family is there, 15 people,\" said Gonzaga, 24, as she waited for tickets at a pier with dozens of other Filipinos desperate to learn their relatives are safe.\n\nIf the typhoon death toll is confirmed, it would be the deadliest natural catastrophe on record in the Philippines, topping both the 5,100 killed by Tropical Storm Thelma in November 1991 and the 5,791 killed after a magnitude-7.9 earthquake triggered a tsunami in the Moro Gulf in the southern Philippines in 1976.\n\nDefense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said President Benigno Aquino III was \"speechless\" when he told him of the devastation in Tacloban.\n\n\"I told him all systems are down,\" Gazmin said. \"There is no power, no water, nothing. People are desperate. They're looting.\"\n\nIn Vietnam, emergency responders are shifting gears as Haiyan's forecasted path has moved northward, leaving residents in the central part of the country breathing a sigh of relief.\n\nFrancis Markus, spokesman for the Red Cross in Vietnam said that the unpredictable trajectory of the storm has stretched the country's emergency response resources thin, creating new challenges as preparations have shifted from the center to the north of the country.\n\nAnd while the central area was spared the brunt of Haiyan, Vietnam remained on high alert as the deadly typhoon neared.\n\n\"We don't really have an idea of the severity with which this northern region is going to be hit,\" Markus said. \"I think everybody's been very shocked by the horror of the impact of Haiyan in the Philippines and it means we really have to do the maximum to prepare for it in Vietnam and in China and certainly not be complacent.\"\n\nContributing: Tom Maresca from Ho Chi Minh City; Doyle Rice from McLean, Va.; and theAssociated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/asia/vietnam-typhoon-noru-da-nang-intl-hnk", "title": "Typhoon Noru: Karding makes landfall in Vietnam's Da Nang | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nTyphoon Noru made landfall near Vietnam’s popular beach resort city of Da Nang on Wednesday morning, bringing powerful winds and heavy rain as hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated.\n\nNoru hit Vietnam at 5 a.m. Wednesday local time, according to CNN Weather, less than 36 hours hours after it left a trail of destruction in the Philippines – where it was known as Karding.\n\n\n\nThe typhoon weakened a little prior to making landfall, but was still equivalent to a high-end Category 2 hurricane with winds near 175 kph, or about 109 mph.\n\nWinds eased and the storm weakened to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane just before noon, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.

Power was knocked out and there was no cellphone signal, making communication possible only by radio.\n\nReports from the other four islands were still coming in, so far with dozens of fatalities.\n\nIf the typhoon death toll is confirmed, it would be the deadliest natural catastrophe on record in the Philippines. The deadliest typhoon before Haiyan was Tropical Storm Thelma in November 1991, which killed around 5,100 people in the central Philippines. The deadliest disaster so far was the 1976 magnitude-7.9 earthquake that triggered a tsunami in the Moro Gulf in the southern Philippines, killing 5,791 people.\n\nThe storm weakened Sunday to 103 mph with stronger gusts and was forecast to loose strength further when it hits northern Vietnam's Thanh Hoa province early Monday morning.\n\nAs Haiyan heads west toward Vietnam, the Red Cross is at the forefront of an international effort to provide food, water, shelter and other relief to the hundreds of thousands of residents who have lost their homes and livelihood, Gordon said.\n\n\"This is a big, full-court press,\" he said. \"We're pulling out all the stops to help.\"\n\nWith widespread power outages, roads blocked, bridges down and debris strewn everywhere, getting life back to some semblance of normal in the region will take time.\n\n\"The Philippines are always resilient, and we're going to get back up,\" Gordon said.\n\nAnna Lindenfors, Philippines director of Save the Children, said officials in the country were still trying to gather information about the damage caused by Typhoon Haiyan.

A retired engineer, Lopez grew up in Quezon City just outside of Manila. Throughout his childhood, he lived through various typhoons, the damage they leave behind and the rebuilding process that often meant annually replacing roofs of homes.\n\nBut this weekend, Lopez knew Haiyan was not like any typhoon he had experienced. He took pains to warn family members in the Philippines to be ready for the worse. \"I was worried,\" he said. \"I knew this was in a different league.\"\n\nLopez's relatives were spared the brunt of the storm and were left dealing with roofs that had been blown off and downed trees, he said.\n\n\"They are very thankful,\" Lopez said. \"They got ordinary storm damage which they get several times a year so they were all kind of ready for that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter losing strength as it moved over the Philippines and west into the South China Sea on Saturday, Haiyan was expected to maintain typhoon strength and hit Hanoi, Vietnam, late Sunday local time.\n\nPreparations were well underway in the country Saturday ahead of the storm, with nearly 500,000 having been evacuated from high-risk areas across the central region from Phu Yen to Quang Binh provinces, according to state-run local media.\n\nWitnesses in Danang reported empty supermarket shelves by Friday as anxious locals rushed to stock up on supplies in anticipation of the deadly typhoon's arrival.\n\nThe typhoon is expected to hit Vietnam as a Category 2 or 3 typhoon according to the Red Cross, which estimates 6.5 million people will be affected by the storm.\n\nThe storm has already claimed its first victims in Vietnam, with local media reporting two people dead and 30 more injured in Quang Nam province Friday as a result of accidents during storm preparations.\n\nRice, Lackey and Alcindor reported from McLean, Va.; Maresca reported from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/11/08/typhoon-haiyan-philippines/3474169/", "title": "Super Typhoon Haiyan: 3 things to watch", "text": "Doyle Rice, and Jessica Durando\n\nUSATODAY\n\nSuper Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful storms in world history, crashed into the island of Samar Friday morning and sped across the central islands of the Philippines.\n\nHaiyan's strong winds, rains and storm surge are expected to cause widespread devastation throughout the central Philippines.\n\nWe know millions are at risk. Many areas lost power. Hundreds of flights were canceled. But many factors remain unclear.\n\n1.) Death toll: Four people were killed, according to the Associated Press. At least two people were electrocuted in storm-related accidents, one person was killed by a fallen tree, and another was struck by lightning, official reports said. But the death toll could rise as some of the hardest-hit areas remain cut off without power and communication. \"During the actual impact of the typhoon, we have yet to record any fatalities,\" Reynaldo Balido Jr., a spokesman for the Philippines Office of Civil Defense, told USA TODAY.\n\nAt least 748,000 people were evacuated, and many are staying in about 664 evacuation centers, Balido said.\n\n2.)

John Andrews, deputy director general of the Civil Aviation Authority, said.\n\nRegional military commander Lt. Gen. Roy Deveraturda said that the casualty figure \"probably will increase,\" after viewing aerial photographs of the widespread devastation caused by the typhoon.\n\nInitial reports on Philippine television are that dozens of bodies are visible in public areas in Leyte, one of the hardest hit islands, along with Samar and Bohol.\n\nThe Philippine television station GMA reported its news team saw 11 bodies, including that of a child, washed ashore Friday and 20 more bodies at a pier in Tacloban hours after the typhoon ripped through the coastal city.\n\nAt least 20 more bodies were taken to a church in nearby Palo town that was used as an evacuation center but had to be abandoned when its roofs were blown away, the TV network reported.\n\nThere were reports of widespread power outages, flash flood, landslides and scores of buildings that were torn apart. Andrews said civil aviation authorities in Tacloban reported that the seaside airport terminal was \"ruined\" by storm surges, though military planes were still able to land with relief aid.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement that America stood ready to help.\n\nBecause communications in the Philippines were cut-off, it remained difficult to determine the full extent of casualties and damage.\n\n\"We expect the level of destruction caused by Typhoon Haiyan to be extensive and devastating, and sadly we fear that many lives will be lost,\" said Anna Lindenfors, Philippines director of Save the Children.\n\nHaiyan's sustained winds weakened Saturday to 101 mph. The center of the storm was moving away from the Philippines and into the South China Sea, but high winds were still battering the country. It was expected to make landfall Sunday morning in central Vietnam, with winds of about 125 mph, which is the strength of a Category 3 hurricane. Vietnamese authorities in four central provinces began evacuating more than 500,000 people from high risk areas to government buildings, schools and other concrete homes able to withstand strong winds.\n\n\"The evacuation is being conducted with urgency and must be completed before 5 p.m.,\" disaster official Nguyen Thi Yen Linh by telephone from central Danang City, where some 76,000 are being moved to safety.\n\nHundreds of thousands of others were being taken to shelters in the provinces of Quang Ngai, Quang Nam and Thua Thien Hue. Schools were closed and two deputy prime ministers were sent to the region to direct the preparations.\n\nHaiyan, known as Yolanda in the typhoon-prone Philippines, affected a huge sweep of the country. At least two people were electrocuted in storm-related accidents, one person was killed by a fallen tree and another was struck by lightning, official reports said.\n\nSouthern Leyte Gov. Roger Mercado said the typhoon triggered landslides that blocked roads, uprooted trees and ripped roofs off houses around his residence.\n\nThe dense clouds and heavy rains made the day seem almost as dark as night, he said.\n\n\"When you're faced with such a scenario, you can only pray, and pray and pray,\" Mercado said in a telephone interview, adding that mayors in the province had not called in to report any major damage.\n\n\"I hope that means they were spared and not the other way around,\" he said. \"My worst fear is there will be massive loss of lives and property.\"\n\nThe category-5 storm made landfall Friday morning at Guiuan, a small city in Samar province in the eastern Philippines.\n\nOver 12 million people live in the storm's path, including Cebu City, with a population of about 2.5 million, and Bohol island, where a major earthquake last month killed over 200 people and left thousands homeless and highly vulnerable in tents. By Saturday afternoon local time, an estimated 4 million people were affected by the typhoon, AP reported.\n\nPresident Benigno Aquino said Thursday his administration had made war-like preparations, with air force planes, helicopters and navy ships on standby. Over one million people fled their homes ahead of the storm as the government announced evacuation plans in many areas. With at least 20 typhoons hitting the Philippines every year, its people are familiar with nature's power, but none have experienced what some meteorologists have called the most powerful typhoon ever to make landfall.\n\nThe affected areas include islands loved by travelers around the world. Last month, Conde Nast Traveler magazine named Cebu and Bohol in its list of the Top 5 Islands in Asia. In Cebu city Friday evening, the wind and rain had eased, electricity had been restored and residents were emerging to assess the damage, said Sarah Adlawan, a saleswoman at the Cebu Northwinds Hotel.\n\nHaiyan was be the fourth typhoon to hit the Philippines this year and the third Category 5 typhoon to make landfall in the Philippines since 2010, says meteorologist Jeff Masters of the Weather Underground. Just last year, Super Typhoon Bopha killed more than 1,900 people in the Philippines when it hit on Dec. 3, the deadliest typhoon in Philippine history.\n\n\"The Philippines lie in the most tropical cyclone-prone waters on Earth, and rarely escape a year without experiencing a devastating typhoon,\" says Masters A tropical cyclone is an all-encompassing term that includes typhoons, hurricanes, and cyclones, which have different names daepending on where they form.\n\nSince 1970, the Philippines has been hit by more tropical cyclones than any country on earth, except for China, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, about 30 tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean each year, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reports. According to data from the warning center, an October record of seven typhoons developed in the western Pacific Ocean last month.\n\nThat doesn't include Cyclone Phailin, which became the strongest system to make landfall in India since 1999, coming ashore in the eastern state of Odisha in October, killing at least 44 people. Storms that form in the Indian Ocean – a separate \"basin\" from the Western Pacific -- are known as cyclones.\n\nRowena Pinky Jumamoy, a member of the Filipino Association in Richmond, Va. (FAACV) and a native of Inabang, Bohol, one of the provinces hit the hardest by Haiyan, made contact with Tian Cempron, a conservation fellow of the marine sanctuary project. \"As of this morning, the news is that In one coastal village alone at least 30 houses were wiped out,\" Jumamoy said.\n\n\n\nImelda Hofmeister, of Oshkosh, Wis., spent Friday morning on the phone with family in Illinois that had reached her parents in Lianga, a southern Filipino city in Surigao del Sur. They were spared from the typhoon's path, but still had not had any contact from family further north in Tacloban, Cebu and Ormoc which were harder hit.\n\n\"We haven't heard anything – good or bad news from our cousins. Normally we let the family know that status through Facebook messages and we know that my parents and immediate family is OK,\" Hofmeister said. \"But further north and we know there will be a ton of damage since most of the houses are built so close to the water.\"\n\nThough she hoped her family is physically safe, Hofmeister said the lightweight pole buildings and tin roofs are not built to sustain the winds that hit the islands.\n\n\"I checked into our hotel with my family Thursday night as we live by the coast, and were worried because we heard on the radio this would be the strongest ever typhoon,\" she said. \"The winds did not feel too strong today, but I have no idea if my home is okay,\" said Adlawan, who planned to return there Friday night.\n\n\"The government was well-prepared for this typhoon and informed the people,\" so many could evacuate low-lying areas, she said. \"Thank God, all my family are okay.\"\n\nIn this strongly Catholic country, clergy nationwide have been praying to reduce the storm's expected devastation. Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma, also the president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, asked bishops and priests to lead the people in praying the Oratio Imperata, or Obligatory Prayer, used when calamity threatens.\n\nIt paid off, said Hildren Mallete, receptionist at the Casablanca Hotel in Legazpi City, Albay province. While Legazpi suffered a blackout early Friday morning, the wind and rain were not as strong as residents had feared, said Mallete. \"The priests have been saying prayers from yesterday to today, and that helped our city. The power of prayer, it helped a lot.\"\n\nContributing: Korina Lopez, Michael Winter USA TODAY; Nick Penzenstadler, The Post-Crescent in Appleton WI., and Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/08"}]}

Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nPut on your walking shoes and don’t forget your step counter: You can reduce your risk for cancer, heart disease and early death by getting up to 10,000 steps a day, but any amount of walking helps, according to a new study.\n\nHealth benefits rose with every step, the study found, but peaked at 10,000 steps – after that the effects faded. Counting steps may be especially important for people who do unstructured, unplanned physical activity such as house work, gardening and dog walks.\n\n“Notably, we detected an association between incidental steps (steps taken to go about daily life) and a lower risk of both cancer and heart disease,” noted study coauthor Borja del Pozo Cruz, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, Denmark, and senior researcher in health sciences for the University of Cadiz in Spain.\n\n“By and large, I think the study is well done and it certainly continues to add to the foundation of knowledge that tells us exercise is good stuff,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado. He was not involved in the research.\n\n“Physical activity is just absolutely magnificent,” Freeman said. “And when if you blend that with eating a more plant-based diet, de-stressing, sleeping enough and connecting with others – that’s your magic recipe. It’s the fountain of youth, if you will.”\n\nWalking helps dementia too\n\nDel Pozo Cruz and his team recently published a similar study that found walking 10,000 steps a day lowered risk for dementia by 50%. Risk decreased by 25% with as few as 3,800 steps a day, according to the previous study.\n\nHowever, if walking occurred at a brisk pace of 112 steps a minute for 30 minutes, it maximized risk reduction, leading to a 62% reduction in dementia risk. The 30 minutes of fast-paced walking didn’t have to occur all at once, either – it could be spread out over the day.\n\n“Our take is that intensity of stepping matters – over and above volume,” said del Pozo Cruz via email.\n\nThe new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, followed 78,500 people between the ages of 40 and 79 from England, Scotland and Wales who wore wrist step counters for 24 hours a day over a seven day stretch.\n\nAfter counting each person’s total number of steps each day, researchers placed them into two categories: Fewer than 40 steps per minute – which is more of an amble, like when you’re walking from room to room – and more than 40 steps per minute, or so-called “purposeful” walking.\n\nA third category was created for peak performers – those who took the most steps per minute within 30 minutes over the course of a day (although, again, those 30 minutes did not have to occur in sequence).\n\nAbout seven years later, researchers compared that data to medical records and found people who took the most steps per minute – in this case, approximately 80 steps per minute – showed the biggest reduction in risk for cancer, heart disease and early death from any cause.\n\nResearchers found the association between peak 30-minute steps and risk reduction to be dependent on the disease studied.\n\n“We observed a 62% reduction for dementia: This figure was almost 80% for CVD mortality and incidence and much less (approx. 20%) for cancer,” del Pozo Cruz said via email.\n\n“This may be related with specific pathways by which physical activity is beneficial,” he said. “It pushes the body in general: can generate more muscle, a bigger heart and a better fitness, all of which are known protective factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer, and other health issues too.”\n\nGet breathless\n\nWhat’s the takeaway? You don’t have to fixate on the numbers of steps (unless you really want to), Freeman said.\n\n“Does every step count? Absolutely. And we know that brisk walking each day brings on extra benefits in terms of blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular training and so forth,” said Freeman, who was the founding chair of the American College of Cardiology’s Nutrition & Lifestyle workgroup.\n\n“But the truth is, the same goal has always applied: Challenge yourself at whatever fitness level you’re at. Obviously check with your doctor first, but your goal is to become breathless for 30 minutes each day.”\n\nWhat is breathlessness as it applies to exercise? It’s not gasping and panting so hard you can barely breathe. Instead, breathlessness is when you are walking with someone, they talk to you, and you have a bit of trouble talking back, Freeman said.\n\n“Spend 30 minutes being breathless at whatever pace you’re at, and then keep challenging yourself to be slightly unsatisfied at your current level so you can get better and better,” Freeman said.\n\nBeing more physically active often jumpstarts other healthy habits, such as an improved diet, and discourages unhealthy ones, such as smoking, he added.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/health/step-dementia-risk-wellness", "title": "Walk this number of steps each day to cut your risk of dementia | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nWant to reduce your risk for dementia? Slap on a step counter and start tallying your steps – you’ll need between 3,800 and 9,800 each day to reduce your risk of mental decline, according to a new study.\n\nPeople between the ages of 40 and 79 who took 9,826 steps per day were 50% less likely to develop dementia within seven years, the study found. Furthermore, people who walked with “purpose” – at a pace over 40 steps a minute – were able to cut their risk of dementia by 57% with just 6,315 steps a day.\n\n“It is a brisk walking activity, like a power walk,” said study coauthor Borja del Pozo Cruz, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, Denmark, and senior researcher in health sciences for the University of Cadiz in Spain.\n\nEven people who walked approximately 3,800 steps a day at any speed cut their risk of dementia by 25%, the study found.\n\n“That would be enough, at first, for sedentary individuals,” said del Pozo Cruz in an email.\n\n“In fact, it is a message that doctors could use to motivate very sedentary older adults – 4k steps is very doable by many, even those that are less fit or do not feel very motivated,” he added. “Perhaps, more active and fitter individuals should aim for 10k, where we see maximum effects.”\n\nBut there was a even more interesting result buried in the study, according to an editorial entitled “Is 112 the New 10,000?” published Tuesday in JAMA Neurology.\n\nThe largest reduction in dementia risk – 62% – was achieved by people who walked at a very brisk pace of 112 steps per minute for 30 minutes a day, the study found. Prior research has labeled 100 steps a minute (2.7 miles per hour) as a “brisk” or moderate level of intensity.\n\nThe editorial argued that individuals looking to reduce their risk of dementia focus on their walking pace over their walked distance.\n\n“While 112 steps/min is a rather brisk cadence, ’112’ is conceivably a much more tractable and less intimidating number for most individuals than ‘10,000,’ especially if they have been physically inactive or underactive,” wrote Alzheimer’s researchers Ozioma Okonkwo and Elizabeth Planalp in the editorial. Okonkwo is an associate professor in the department of medicine at the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison; Planalp is a research scientist in Okonkwo’s lab.\n\n“We do agree this is a very interesting finding,” said del Pozo Cruz via email. “Our take is that intensity of stepping matters! Over and above volume. Technology could be use to track not only number of steps but also pace and so these types of metrics can also be incorporated in commercial watches. More research is needed on this.”\n\nPeople who walked with \"purpose\" -- at a pace over 40 steps a minute -- were able to cut their risk of dementia by 57% with just 6,315 steps a day, a new study said. West Photo/Adobe Stock\n\nDon’t have a step counter? You can count the number of steps you take in 10 seconds and then multiply it by six – or the number of steps you take in six seconds and multiply it by 10. Either way works. But remember, not everyone’s steps are the same length, nor are their fitness levels. What might be a brisk pace for a 40-year-old may not be sustainable for a 70-year-old.\n\nEditor’s Note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.\n\nInside the study\n\nThe study, also published Tuesday in JAMA Neurology, analyzed data from over 78,000 people between the ages of 40 and 79 who wore wrist accelerometers. Researchers counted each person’s total number of steps per day, and then placed them into two categories: Fewer than 40 steps per minute – which is more of an amble, like when you’re walking from room to room – and more than 40 steps per minute, or so-called “purposeful” walking. The researchers also analyzed peak performers – those who took the most steps within 30 minutes over the course of a day (although those 30 minutes did not have to occur on the same walk).\n\nResearchers then compared that person’s steps against their diagnosis of dementia of any type seven years later. After controlling for age, ethnicity, education, sex, socio-emotional status and how many days they wore an accelerometer, researchers also factored out such lifestyle variables as poor diet, smoking, alcohol use, medication use, sleep issues and a history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe study did have some limitations, its authors point out – it was only observational, so it cannot establish a direct cause and effect between walking and a lower risk of dementia. In addition, “the age range of participants may have resulted in limited dementia cases, meaning our results may not be generalizable to older populations,” the study said.\n\n“Because there are often considerable delays in dementia diagnosis, and this study did not include formal clinical and cognitive assessments of dementia, it is possible that the prevalence of dementia in the community was much higher,” the authors added.\n\nWhile agreeing that the findings cannot be interpreted as a direct cause and effect, “the mounting evidence in support of the benefits of physical activity for maintaining optimal brain health can no longer be disregarded,” wrote Okonkwo and Planalp.\n\n“It is time for the management of physical inactivity to be considered an intrinsic part of routine primary care visits for older adults,” they added.\n\nResearch adds up\n\nIndeed, recent research published in July has found many leisure activities, such as household chores, exercise, adult education classes and visiting with family and friends, affected dementia risk in middle-aged people.\n\nAdults who were highly engaged in physical activity such as frequent exercise had a 35% lower risk of developing dementia compared with people who were the least engaged in these activities, researchers found.\n\nRegularly doing household chores lowered risk by 21% while daily visits with family and friends lowered the risk of dementia by 15%, when compared with people who were less engaged.\n\nEveryone in the study benefited from the protective effect of physical and mental activities, whether or not they had a family history of dementia, researchers found.\n\nAnother study published in January found that exercise may slow dementia in active older people whose brains already showed signs of plaques, tangles and other hallmarks of Alzheimer’s and other cognitive diseases.\n\nThat study found exercise boosts levels of a protein known to strengthen communication between brain cells via synapses, which may be a key factor in keeping dementia at bay.\n\n“Dementia is preventable to a great extent,” said del Pozo Cruz. “Physical activity as well as other lifestyle behaviors such lack of alcohol and smoking, maintaining a healthy diet and weight and sleep can put you on the right track to avoid dementia.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/08/08/4000-steps-per-day-lower-death-risk/70548600007/", "title": "10000 steps?

No, authors say\n\nThe study, which examined results from 17 smaller studies on walking, found all participants, no matter their age or gender, experienced similar health benefits from daily walking. Walking any number of steps per day is associated with positive health impacts, according to Banach.\n\nBanach said some of his patients get discouraged that they can't walk 10,000 steps a day because of busy work schedules. Paluch agreed the 10,000 number that commonly gets thrown around can feel \"far-reaching and defeating\" for most people.\n\n\"Our study shows that it might be an even lower number, it might be 4,000 to 5,000 to see the health benefits and survival improvement and mortality reduction,\" Banach said.\n\nBanach encourages his patients to try to get in 3,000 or 4,000 steps a day. He noted consistently sees his patients improve their step counts after starting at lower numbers.\n\n\"You see the greatest incremental benefits by going from nothing to something. It's really where we see the greatest bang for your buck,\" said Paluch, whose 2022 study on step-counting found similar results. \"If you're starting at very low step levels, you don't have to worry about getting to that 10,000 number.\"\n\nHere's what else researchers found:\n\n◾ Walking about 2,300 steps a day can reduce the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease (disease of the heart and blood vessels).\n\n◾ Increasing the number of steps you walk per day by 1,000 or even 500 steps will lower your chances of death.\n\n◾ It doesn't matter what age someone starts walking daily, Banach said. \"The health benefits still exist even if you start at the age of 60, 65, 70 years of age,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/08"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/961996/10000-steps-and-the-other-health-rules-that-arent-what-they-seem", "title": "10,000 steps and the other health rules that aren't what they seem ...", "text": "When it comes to cardiovascular health, 10,000 steps a day has long been touted as the magic number – until now.\n\nNew research has shown that walking even just a quarter of that amount could reduce our risk of heart disease and stroke.

It recorded the daily activity of 226,889 people across the UK, the US, Norway and Australia.\n\nThe 10,000-a-day step goal is merely an “arbitrary figure conjured up by a Japanese company marketing a pedometer in the 1960s”, said The Times.\n\nHere, The Week takes a look at some other health rules that may need closer examination.\n\n1. You don’t need eight glasses of water a day\n\nThis is a particularly persistent myth that has long been refuted. In a report published by the British Medical Journal in 2011, Margaret McCartney, a Glasgow GP, said the idea that we need to drink eight glasses of water a day was “not only nonsense, but thoroughly debunked nonsense”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAnd more recently, Herman Pontzer, professor of evolutionary anthropology and global health at Duke University, admitted that when it comes to this advice, “people have been kind of making it up”.\n\nOur individual requirements for water depend on factors “such as age, build and physical activity levels” and the arbitrary eight glasses a day goal “doesn’t account for fluid in food such as fruit, veg, soups and sauces, or other drinks including coffee or tea”, said The Times.\n\n2. But five servings of fruit and veg a day is not enough\n\nThe greatest health benefits came from eating ten portions of fruit and vegetables a day – far higher than the government-recommended amount of just five servings – according to a meta-analysis conducted by researchers at Imperial College London.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says that eating five servings of fruit and vegetables a day – roughly 400g – is the minimum amount required to reduce the risk of serious health problems, such as heart disease, stroke and cancer.\n\n3. Sugar-free foods aren’t necessarily better for you\n\nNot everything that’s labelled “sugar-free” is necessarily better for you, according to Louise Pyne, a nutritionist who spoke to The Sun. That’s because sugar-free and low-fat foods are “often replaced with sweeteners and preservatives”. So in many cases opting for full-fat alternatives might actually be a wiser choice. If you’re choosing a yoghurt, for example, “go for a full-fat Greek version and add fresh fruit to sweeten”, she told the paper.\n\n4. And probiotics won’t improve your gut health\n\nProbiotics are beneficial live bacteria and yeast that are found in foods such as yoghurt, kefir, kombucha, kimchi and natto. Probiotic supplements are also sold in many popular health stores, but their benefits are only proven to be effective in limited cases, such as “easing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome”, according to Dr Hazel Wallace, nutritionist and author of “The Female Factor”, who spoke to The Guardian. There is “currently no convincing evidence to suggest that taking a probiotic will benefit healthy people who don’t have gut issues”, she told the paper.\n\nGut health can be better supported by eating a diverse diet, rich in plant-based foods such as nuts, seeds, wholegrains, pulses, herbs and spices, added Wallace.\n\n5. Sitting isn’t ‘the new smoking’ but does carry risks\n\nYou’ve probably heard the saying “sitting is the new smoking”. But the two can’t really be compared, pharmacist Carolina Goncalves told the i news site. The health risks of sitting for extended periods are “generally less severe than those attributed to smoking”, which can cause DNA damage and impaired immune function, among other harms. Being sedentary, however, “becomes a health risk when it is excessive and displaces time that could be spent engaging in physical activity”.\n\nBut if you’re sitting for a long time throughout the day, it’s a good idea to take breaks and stand up frequently. Researchers at Glasgow Caledonian University found that standing up every 30 minutes can help to reduce sitting time by 40 minutes a day. In turn, that can reduce the chances of getting diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/09/16/how-many-steps-should-take-per-day-study-death-risk/8321904002/", "title": "How many steps should you walk per day?

Weight loss is more complicated than that\n\nWhat should your step count goal be?\n\nPeople have been tracking their steps for years, but there hasn't always been a clear daily goal for Americans.\n\nThe conventional goal of 10,000 steps was more of a \"marketing tool\" than anything else, said Dr. I-Min Lee, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a researcher on physical activity. A Japanese company released a step-tracking device in the 1960s called the \"10,000 steps meter,\" encouraging users to reach the milestone, and the number caught on.\n\nA 2019 study written by Lee found that a higher number of steps is linked to lower mortality rates up until about 7,500 a day.\n\nThe latest step count study, published this month, further contradicted the once-heralded 10,000-step mark. It found that crossing the threshold was not associated with a further reduction in premature mortality risk.\n\nThe study provides more insight into what middle-aged adults should be shooting for on a daily basis, but there isn't a singular number recommended by federal health officials just yet.\n\nIn fact, a clear national guidance on daily step counts is needed, said Dr. Nicole Spartano, a research assistant professor at the Boston University School of Medicine.\n\nThere's a common misconception that exercise is limited to moderate-to-intense workout activities like running or biking, Spartano says. Establishing a national barometer of daily steps might help reshape how people view activity while also making the guidelines more accessible to those who can't participate in moderate or intense workouts.\n\nAfter all, doing something as simple as an evening walk is more activity than doing nothing at all.\n\n“It’s important that we can provide achievable goals for people who are doing very little activity,\" Spartano said.\n\nAn effective way to establish more achievable goals, she argues, is for the messaging to come from the top, namely the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' “Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,” a set of health practices issued originally in 2008 and updated in 2018.\n\nThe guidelines tell adults to move more and sit less, reminding them that \"some physical activity is better than none.\" But they fall short of establishing a tangible step count goal.\n\nForming a daily step count milestone for all Americans is the \"ultimate goal,\" especially as more people track health progress using fitness trackers, Paluch said.\n\nReviewed: The best fitness trackers of 2021\n\nPaluch and Spartano said future research on step counts will be helpful and necessary, especially to discover whether or how higher step counts are associated with other health outcomes besides premature mortality, such as diabetes, Alzheimer's and mental health.\n\nIn the meantime, it can't hurt to get more steps in.\n\n“If you’re at 4,000, try to get to 5,000. If you’re at 5,000, try to get to 6,000,\" Paluch says. \"You can find little ways to fit more steps into your life.”\n\nFollow Jay Cannon of USA TODAY on Twitter: @JayTCannon\n\nWhat is the proper treatment for long COVID?

In fact, if you get up and move for 21.43 minutes each day of the week, you cut your risk of dying from all causes by one-third, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAn increase in steps can help with chronic conditions such as diabetes and depression, the study says. SeventyFour/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nCurrent physical activity recommendations for adults are 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, dancing, bicycling, doubles tennis and water aerobics, and two days of muscle-strengthening activity each week.\n\n“Physical activity is just absolutely magnificent,” Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, told CNN in an earlier interview.\n\n“And when if you blend that with eating a more plant-based diet, de-stressing, sleeping enough and connecting with others — that’s your magic recipe,” Freeman said. “It’s the fountain of youth, if you will.”\n\nLower obesity risk with more steps\n\nActivity trackers allow researchers to get more accurate data that can be compared with health records. ricka_kinamoto/Adobe Stock\n\nThe study analyzed an average of four years of activity and health data from more than 6,000 participants in the National Institutes of Health’s All of Us Research Program, dedicated to research on ways to develop individualized health care.\n\nParticipants in the study, published on October 10, 2022, in the journal Nature Medicine, wore activity trackers at least 10 hours a day and allowed researchers access to their electronic health records over multiple years.\n\n“Our study had an average of 4 years of continuous activity monitoring. So, we were able to account for the totality of activity between when monitoring started and when a disease was diagnosed, which is a major advantage because we didn’t have to make assumptions about activity over time, unlike all prior studies,” Brittain said.\n\nPeople in the study ranged in age from 41 to 67 and had body mass index levels from 24.3, which is considered in the healthy weight range, to 32.9, which is considered obese.\n\nResearchers found that people who walked 4 miles a day — about 8,200 steps — were less likely to become obese or suffer from sleep apnea, acid reflux and major depressive disorder. Sleep apnea and acid reflux respond well to weight loss, which can reduce pressure on the throat and stomach, while exercise is a cornerstone treatment for depression.\n\nThe study also found that overweight participants (those with BMIs ranging from 25 to 29) cut their risk of becoming obese by half if they increased their steps to 11,000 steps a day. In fact, “this increase in step counts resulted in a 50% reduction in cumulative incidence of obesity at 5 years,” the study found.\n\nApplying the data to a specific example, the authors said individuals with BMIs of 28 could lower their risk of obesity 64% by increasing steps from about 6,000 to 11,000 steps per day.\n\nWhat about the benefits of 10,000 steps?\n\nThis research echoes results from a recent study in Spain in which researchers found health benefits rose with every step until about 10,000 steps, when the effects began to fade. Counting steps may be especially important for people who do unstructured, unplanned physical activity such as housework, gardening and walking dogs.\n\n“Notably, we detected an association between incidental steps (steps taken to go about daily life) and a lower risk of both cancer and heart disease,” study coauthor Borja del Pozo Cruz told CNN in an earlier interview. Del Pozo Cruz is an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense and senior researcher in health sciences for the University of Cadiz in Spain.\n\nThe same research team also published a similar study in September 2022 that found walking 10,000 steps a day lowered the risk for dementia by 50%; the risk decreased by 25% with as few as 3,800 steps a day.\n\nHowever, if walking occurred at a brisk pace of 112 steps a minute for 30 minutes, it maximized risk reduction, leading to a 62% reduction in dementia risk. The 30 minutes of fast-paced walking didn’t have to occur all at once either — it could be spread out over the day.\n\nResearchers found the association between peak 30-minute steps and risk reduction to be dependent on the disease studied: There was a 62% reduction for dementia, an 80% decline for cardiovascular disease and death, and about a 20% drop in risk for cancer.\n\nThe study also found an association between step intensity and health benefits as well, “although the relationships were less consistent than with step counts,” researchers said.\n\nA major limitation of all studies using step trackers is that people who wear them tend to be more active and healthier than the norm, the researchers said. “Yet the fact that we were able to detect robust associations between steps and incident disease in this active sample suggests even stronger associations may exist in a more sedentary population,” they said.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/wellness/health/2022/10/27/does-too-much-tv-time-increase-your-risk-of-dementia/69569016007/", "title": "Does too much TV time increase your risk of dementia?", "text": "Bryant Stamford\n\nSpecial to the Courier Journal\n\nDementia is increasingly common as people age and as many as one-third of folks 85 or older have some form of dementia. But it’s important to point out that dementia is not a \"normal\" aspect of aging. On the contrary, most who live into their 90s and beyond do so without substantial signs or symptoms of dementia that include the loss of cognitive function, such as a reduced ability to think, remember, reason and problem-solve.\n\nOften these problems are severe enough to interfere with daily life. Other aspects include the possibility of a change in personality and the inability to control emotions.\n\nDementia can be mild with only a modest impact on daily life, or it can range in severity to the point where the sufferer is completely dependent on others. There are several types of dementia, including Alzheimer’s, the one that scares us most and captures so much attention. The cause of dementia arises from problems with nerve cells in the brain. Some nerve cells may stop working effectively, some quit communicating with other brain nerve cells, and some die. Loss of function in brain nerve cells is a natural consequence of aging, and those of us who are up in years recognize glitches and faulty memory, but those with dementia experience far greater losses.\n\nThe causes of dementia can vary widely. For example, cardiovascular disease and stroke can damage the brain by denying oxygen which destroys regions distributed throughout the brain. The brain can be damaged in other ways, including trauma from accidents or sports concussions, from metabolic disorders such as diabetes, and from infections. Although Parkinson’s disease first attacks the part of the brain that controls the coordination of muscular movements, eventually cognition and mood may be negatively impacted.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHow can I prevent dementia?\n\nAlthough some types of dementia cannot be prevented, medical science has made great strides in identifying factors that cause brain nerve cell problems. Attention to sports concussions is a good example, plus other precautions aimed at reducing falls and the impact of motor vehicle accidents. But overall, a very clear message seems to be an emphasis on a healthy lifestyle.\n\nI have written about the value of exercise in this regard, especially as related to the prevention of dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease in particular. Of all the factors currently being studied, regular physical exercise consistently rises to the top as the main way to help avoid the ravages of this horrible disease. To emphasize this point, a recent study concluded that 10,000 steps per day of walking (approximately 2,000 steps per mile) reduces dementia risk by 50%, and 4,000 steps per day reduce it by 25%.\n\nAnother helpful intervention is keeping your brain active, challenging it, and learning new things.\n\nDoes watching TV increase your risk for dementia?\n\nI recently came across another recent study I would like to share. But before doing so, let me give a shout-out to Dr. Fred Benz, a former colleague of mine from the University of Louisville. Benz is a highly accomplished retired professor of Biochemical Pharmacology and Toxicology with years of cutting-edge research under his belt. He regularly sends me intriguing research studies to write about, and I’m very grateful.\n\nThe latest from Benz is a research study about the impact of watching TV on the risk of dementia and comparing it with spending time on a computer. Both are sedentary activities, and being sedentary increases the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes, plus an increased risk of dementia. However, these two sedentary activities differ in an important way when it comes to the brain. TV time is considered \"passive\" while computer time requires \"active engagement.\"\n\nYou may like Here are 3 tips to not gain weight, lose muscle mass as you get older\n\nParticipants in this study were followed long-term until there was a diagnosis of dementia or death. It was found that watching lots of TV increased the risk of dementia, while computer use reduced dementia risk.\n\nIt’s important to note that strict control measures were in place, and these findings were not impacted by lifestyle factors such as regular physical exercise. In other words, if two people exercised regularly, although their risk overall would be less than those who do not exercise, the exerciser who chooses to work on a computer rather than watch TV would have an even lower risk. The same is true for two matched sedentary people.\n\nAre exercises or crossword puzzles better to prevent dementia?\n\nAlthough regular physical exercise has gained momentum as a strong preventive measure when it comes to dementia, and especially Alzheimer’s disease, relatively few of us in the U.S. exercise regularly. As an alternative, many folks like to believe that crossword puzzles and similar challenging mental activities are just as effective as exercise in preserving brain function.\n\nIs this true?\n\nSome research supports the use of crossword puzzles and the like, indicating a delay in the onset of dementia. Researchers speculate that such mental activities develop a protective \"cognitive reserve\" helping to keep the brain healthy and sharp. The present study comparing TV watching with computer time also supports active and creative engagement of the brain.\n\nYou may like Cardio and resistance training workouts you can do at home\n\nHowever, at present, the bulk of evidence indicates that exercise is the superior choice.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you want to increase the odds of preventing dementia, exercise regularly. Short of that, if you hate physical exercise, a good second option is to engage your brain with as many different creative activities as possible. And, of course, the best option appears to be, to do both!\n\nReach Bryant Stamford, a professor of kinesiology and integrative physiology at Hanover College, at stamford@hanover.edu.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/2022/10/16/study-shows-10-000-steps-brisk-pace-decrease-dementia-risk/8083806001/", "title": "New study shows 10,000 steps brisk pace decrease dementia risk", "text": "A buddy of mine spent two weeks on vacation with his family in Ireland this summer.\n\nHe loved the food — and indulged.\n\nHe also sampled the various beers for which the country is famous.\n\nAnd yet he returned home 10 pounds lighter.\n\nHow?\n\nNeed a break?

Here's our guide to Palm Beach County beaches, from attractions to fun facts\n\nGetting in your steps\n\nIn the past decade or so, we’ve all heard health experts’ admonitions to make 10,000 steps our daily goal.\n\nThis magic number has its origins in Japan when the country was preparing to host the 1964 Olympic Games. A campaign to improve the fitness of regular citizens led to the formation of walking clubs nationwide. Pedometers, usually worn on one’s waistband, were also introduced around the same time, enabling walkers to track their steps and overall mileage.\n\nAccording to an article in Medical Life Sciences, “manpo-kei, which literally means 10,000 steps in the Japanese language, became the rallying slogan for dedicated walkers. Manpo-kei was the minimum that they were expected to walk. Gradually the concept of walking 10,000 steps moved from the Japanese public to health-conscious walkers around the world.”\n\nOver the decades, the health benefits of walking at least 10,000 steps daily — which include weight control, stress reduction, improved digestion and increased bone density, among others — have been backed by myriad research.\n\nAnd now comes a new study that suggests hitting the 10,000-step mark daily can cut your risk for developing dementia in half.\n\nWhat’s more, that research also suggests that for those who can’t traverse the cumulative 10,000 daily steps (approximately 5 miles), they can still reduce their dementia risk by up to 25% if they cover around 4,000 cumulative steps daily.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest revelation from the study — which was published last month in JAMA Neurology and analyzed data from more than 78,000 adults between the ages of 40 and 79 — was the finding that a half-hour of walking at a brisk pace was associated with a 62% reduction in the risk of dementia.\n\n“Probably the biggest takeaway is that 10,000 steps may be the optimal number of steps to reduce the risk of dementia, cutting it by 50%,” said one of study’s authors, Borja del Pozo Cruz, an adjunct associate professor at Southern Denmark University and a senior researcher in health at the University of Cadiz in Cadiz, Spain. “Faster steps provide superior results.”\n\nIn other words, both the quantity — and quality — of your daily walking should be prioritized to maximize results.\n\nStepping up your speed\n\nSo what constitutes a “brisk” pace?\n\nThe general rule of thumb has always been around 100 steps per minute — which translates to approximately 2.7 miles per hour.\n\nBut in an editorial entitled “Is 112 the New 10,000?” that ran in the same issue of JAMA Neurology, Alzheimer's researchers Ozioma Okonkwo and Elizabeth Planalp of the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of Wisconsin make the case for a slightly faster pace — 112 steps per minute: “While 112 steps/min is a rather brisk cadence, '112' is conceivably a much more tractable and less intimidating number for most individuals than '10,000,' especially if they have been physically inactive or underactive.”\n\nPozo Cruz surmises that the decrease in dementia risk stems from the how the activity improved the subjects’ vascular health.\n\n“Walking is associated with better vascular profiles, which is probably the clearest pathway through which steps may benefit dementia,” Pozo Cruz told NBC News. “[So] it’s likely that vascular dementia is the most preventable through physical activity.”\n\nThe Mayo Clinic says vascular dementia is “caused by brain damage from impaired blood flow to the brain” and, according to the Alzheimer’s Society, vascular dementia is the second-most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nKeeping count\n\nThere are numerous wristband step-counters available to help you track your daily step count, mileage covered, calories burned, heart rate, etc. If you already own one, you already know how useful they can be.\n\nBut if, like me, you don’t own a step-counter, here's an easy, accurate way to calculate your approximate steps-per-minute: Walk at a brisk (but maintainable) pace for 60 seconds while counting only the steps of your right leg — and then multiply by two.\n\nI've found that this is an easier way to mentally calculate my pace on a given day than trying to count the steps taken by both legs.\n\nThat said, don’t get hung up on exact numbers. The most important thing is to walk at the most brisk pace you can safely maintain based on your current fitness.\n\nAnd as always, before embarking on any new fitness program consult with your physician.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/health/walking-blood-sugar-study-wellness", "title": "Blood sugar may be controlled with short walks after eating | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor centuries, people in the sunny Mediterranean would get up after long, leisurely meals and take a walk, often to the town square to see neighbors and socialize. Walking is so much a part of that lifestyle it is listed as a foundation of the über-healthy Mediterranean diet.\n\nThat may be one of the reasons studies have found the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke and some cancers — all the while strengthening bones, improving brain health, warding off dementia and depression, and helping with healthy weight loss.\n\nNow you can add another reason to take a post-meal stroll — it may lower your blood sugar.\n\nThat excursion doesn’t need to take up a huge amount of your time either: Walking as little as two to five minutes after a meal can do the trick, according to a 2022 study in the journal Sports Medicine.\n\nStanding after a meal can help, too, but not as much as putting one foot in front of the other, said study coauthor Aidan Buffey, a doctoral student in the physical education and sport sciences department at the University of Limerick in Ireland.\n\nGoing for a short walk after eating may help control your blood sugar. Siam Pukkato/Adobe Stock\n\n“Intermittent standing breaks throughout the day and after meals reduced glucose on average by 9.51% compared to prolonged sitting. However, intermittent light-intensity walking throughout the day saw a greater reduction of glucose by an average of 17.01% compared to prolonged sitting,” Buffey told CNN via email.\n\n“This suggests that breaking prolonged sitting with standing and light-walking breaks throughout the day is beneficial for glucose levels,” he added.\n\nA short walk after eating can help blood sugar levels rise and fall more gradually\n\nThe meta-analysis, published in February 2022, analyzed seven studies comparing the impact of sitting, standing and walking on the body’s insulin and blood sugar levels. People in the studies were asked either to stand or walk for two to five minutes every 20 to 30 minutes over the course of a full day.\n\n“Between the seven reviewed studies, the total activity time throughout the observation was roughly 28 minutes with the standing and light walking breaks lasting between 2 to 5 minutes,” Buffey said.\n\nStanding was better than heading straight for the desk or the couch to sit when it came to blood sugar levels, but it didn’t help lower insulin in the bloodstream, the analysis found.\n\nHowever, if people went for a short walk after eating, their blood sugar levels rose and fell more gradually, and their insulin levels were more stable than either standing or sitting, the study noted.\n\nKeeping blood sugars from spiking is good for the body as large spikes and fast falls can raise the risk for diabetes and heart disease, experts say. Studies have shown blood sugar levels will spike within 60 to 90 minutes after eating, so it’s best to get moving soon after finishing a meal.\n\nMovement helps clear sugars from the bloodstream\n\nHow does movement help? Muscles need glucose to function, so movement helps clear sugars from the bloodstream — that’s the reason why many runners rely on carbo loading before a marathon or race, for example.\n\nWant to get more out of your efforts than lower blood sugars? Step up your game to meet the minimum physical activity standards for Americans: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and two days of muscle strengthening activity a week.\n\n“People who are physically active for about 150 minutes a week have a 33% lower risk of all-cause mortality than those who are physically inactive,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes.\n\nTranslated, that means if you get up and move for just 21.43 minutes each day of the week, you cut your risk of dying from anything by one-third.\n\nThat’s worth the effort, right?", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/14/health/exercise-depression-study-wellness", "title": "It doesn't take a lot of exercise to fight depression, study says | CNN", "text": "Subscribe to CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter.

It improves sleep; lowers blood pressure; protects against heart disease, diabetes and cancer; reduces stress; boosts mood; and fights anxiety and depression.\n\nBut in today’s busy world, many people find it difficult to fit in a jog or a visit to the gym. Add depression to the mix, and the motivation for exercise drops even further, experts say.\n\nAbout 1.25 hours of brisk walking per week could yield an 18% lower risk of depression compared with not exercising, according to a new meta-analysis. Adobe Stock\n\nEvery little bit helps\n\nThe meta-analysis, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at 15 studies involving over 190,000 people to determine how much exercise was needed to reduce depression.\n\nAdults who did activities equivalent to 1.25 hours of brisk walking per week had an 18% lower risk of depression compared with those who did not exercise, the study said.\n\nMoving up to an “activity volume equivalent to 2.5 hours of brisk walking per week was associated with 25% lower risk of depression,” the study authors said.\n\nThe benefits were strongest when a person transitioned from being a couch potato to adding movement to the day, the study said. However, exercising over the recommended levels did not provide any additional benefits.\n\n“Our findings therefore have important new implications for health practitioners making lifestyle recommendations, especially to inactive individuals who may perceive the current recommended target (of exercise) as unrealistic,” the authors wrote.\n\nPrior research\n\nA study published in 2018 found similar results: People who exercised had about 43% fewer days of poor mental health.\n\n“Even just walking just three times a week seems to give people better mental health than not exercising at all,” study author Adam Chekroud, an assistant adjunct professor of psychiatry at Yale University, told CNN at the time.\n\nExercising in 45-minute sessions three to five times a week was the most beneficial for improving mental health, the 2018 study found. However, even doing household chores reduced poor mental health days by about 10%, the study said.\n\nA study published in 2020 found that even light exercise helped protect children against developing depression. The 2020 study revealed that 60 minutes of simple movement each day at age 12 was linked to an average 10% reduction in depression at age 18.\n\nThe types of movement included running, biking and walking, as well as activities like doing chores, painting or playing an instrument.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/04/14"}]}

Tennis star originally from Georgia", "text": "As Coco Gauff continues to impress at the 2025 French Open, tennis fans are wondering: where is the star from?\n\nYes, Cori “Coco” Gauff was born in Atlanta, on March 13, 2004. Though she now lives and trains in Florida, her connection to Georgia is more than just a birthplace, it’s part of her legacy.\n\nHere’s what we know about her Georgia roots and who she is.\n\nWho is Coco Gauff?\n\nGauff, 21, is an American professional tennis player with a powerful presence on the global stage. She reached as high as No. 2 in singles and No. 1 in doubles, according to the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA).\n\nShe has already won a major title, including the 2023 US Open and the 2024 French Open in doubles, along with the the 2024 WTA Finals.\n\nGauff first rose to prominence at age 15 during the 2019 Wimbledon Championships, where she defeated Venus Williams.\n\nSince then, she has become a fixture in the top ranks of women’s tennis, known for her speed, powerful baseline game, and composure beyond her years.\n\nCoco Gauff's family\n\nHer parents, Corey and Candi Gauff, both former collegiate athletes, left their careers to support her tennis dreams. Corey played college basketball at Georgia State University and Candi was a track and field athlete at Florida State, according to PEOPLE Magazine.\n\nShe was homeschooled throughout her rise in the sport, which was a decision her family made to support her demanding training schedule.\n\nGauff is the oldest of three children and has two younger brothers, Cody and Cameron.\n\nWhat is the French Open?\n\nAnnually in Paris, the French Open (or the Roland Garros) is one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments, played on clay courts.\n\nThe 2025 matches started May 25 and the women's final is on the 7th and the men's is on the 8th.\n\nGauff has reached quarterfinals.\n\nCoco Gauff 2025 French Open matches\n\nFirst round , May 27: Won 6-2, 6-2 against Olivia Gadecki\n\n, May 27: Won 6-2, 6-2 against Olivia Gadecki Second Round , May 29: Won 6-2, 6-4 against Tereza Valentova\n\n, May 29: Won 6-2, 6-4 against Tereza Valentova Third Round , May 31: Won 6-1, 7-6 against Marie Bouzková\n\n, May 31: Won 6-1, 7-6 against Marie Bouzková Fourth Round, June 2: Won 6-0, 7-5 against Ekaterina Alexandrova\n\nShe will play in the Quarterfinal, Wednesday, June 4, against Madison Keys.\n\nHas Coco Gauff played at the French Opening before?\n\nYes, Gauff has a strong history in the tournament. She reached her first Grand Slam singles final at the French Open in 2022. In 2024, she won the doubles title and is once again a contender this year.\n\nWhere does Coco Gauff live?\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Gauff currently resides in Delray Beach, Florida.\n\nVanessa Countryman is the Trending Topics Reporter for the Deep South Connect Team Georgia.

Gauff is expected to play her first match Wednesday, March 11 or Thursday, March 12 prior to her 16th birthday on Friday, March 13.\n\nIt'll be the first time fans will have a chance to see her play in an American tournament since she won a pair of matches at the U.S. Open last September.\n\n“She’s needed very few tournaments to show that she can play among the best,” tennis commentator and two-time U.S. Open champion Tracy Austin said. “Her talent level is off the charts.”\n\nGauff’s ascent to perhaps the best 15-year-old in tennis in such a short time has already made her one of the most famous players in the world. She’s met former First Lady Michelle Obama, comedian Kevin Hart and NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and often receives the Center Court treatment at events she plays.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for teenagers to shine in professional tennis. Austin also turned pro at 15, and Maria Sharapova and Serena and Venus Williams, for instance, made their pro debuts at 14. None of them, however, won matches at a Grand Slam before turning 16.\n\nGauff, who now ranks 51st in the world, has already won eight Grand Slam matches. She was ranked 313th before her Wimbledon run and moved up to 67th prior to playing in Australia at the start of the year.\n\nIt’s been so long since the sport has seen such a meteoric rise from a player so young that many around the game are marveling at what they are witnessing.\n\n“We haven’t really had that for a number of seasons, maybe a decade or so,” said Mark Woodforde, a Grand Slam doubles champion and tennis commentator who lives in the Coachella Valley. “We haven’t had a really young teenage phenom. It’s great excitement that she has arrived.”\n\nMcNallyand Austin are among those who have suggested that Gauff could be the next great American tennis player.\n\nThe Delray Beach, Fla., native passes the eye test. She’s 5-foot-11 and has the athleticism and physical ability to compete at a very high level. Austin also says that Gauff's mental approach to the game makes her “mature beyond her years.”\n\nTennis analyst Brad Gilbert, a former coach of Andre Agassi, believes that Gauff is already one of the three best “movers” in the game, with the way she can cover ground on the court. He believes that she already thinks her way through matches as well as anyone.\n\n“Her problem-solving in matches, at her age, is just outrageous, in willingness to make adjustments mid-match,” said Gilbert, who covers matches for ESPN. “The way she’s able to turn matches around, that’s an amazing sign for someone her age.”\n\nGauff trained on the same courts in Florida as pro Sloane Stephens. She watched Stephens intently, picking up the big swing, the two-handed backhand and Stephen’s intensity at the net.\n\nAt 13, Gauff followed Stephens as she won her first major at the 2017 U.S. Open. It was then that she began internalizing that with the right approach and a lot of hard work, she could one day be in the same position.\n\nThat belief grew when she beat Venus Williams, a player Gauff grew up idolizing, at Wimbledon, where Williams had won five titles.\n\n“She’s definitely proven that she belongs out here and that she can hang with the top players on the big stage, and that she’s not really afraid of anything,” said McNally, who’ll play doubles with Gauff at Indian Wells. \"She thrives in those moments, and I think every single player, no matter your age, can take something from that.”\n\nGauff began befriending players — such as Osaka, the Williams sisters and German Andrea Petkovic — on tour and solicited their advice. Many told her not to take the game too seriously at her age, but instead focus on constant improvement.\n\nShe also began incorporating parts of her opponents’ games into her own and watched the wins follow and her confidence soar.\n\n“Every match has just been a booster,” said Gauff, who won the Linz Open in October to become the youngest winner of a WTA Tour event since 2004.\n\nFrom her run to the Round of 16 at Wimbledon last year, Gauff’s game grew tremendously. Her forehand is now shored up, and she is playing better closer to the net. Additionally, her serve, which had led to a number of double faults, has become an asset that she believes is the strongest part of her repertoire.\n\nNow, Gauff seems to believe that she can win every match, even when she’s playing from behind.\n\n“I’m a super competitive player and I always fight, no matter what,” Gauff said. “Even if I might not be playing my best, that is definitely something that can help raise my level.”\n\nOne concern Austin and others have for Gauff is that the expectations for her may eventually be heavy and even unrealistic, given her age.\n\nIn the past, several early risers in the sport — including Grand Slam champions Justine Henin, Martina Hingis, Kim Clijsters and Marion Bartoli — have burst onto the stage at an early age only to retire while in their 20s due to reoccurring injuries, burnout or the weight that comes with carrying the game’s vast expectations.\n\n“It’s easy to get lost and I’m hoping that she surrounds herself with good people, which I think she has, and that they give her the time that she needs to make those improvements, so that it’s not a quick thing,” said Rosie Casals, an International Tennis Hall of Famer.\n\nCasals is one who has said that rising too quickly in the sport can be a hindrance if expectations run out of control and a player gets ahead of herself.\n\n“When people are looking at you to do great things and be the next champion, there’s a lot of heavy-duty pressure on you,” Casals said.\n\nCasals and Woodforde believe that it will be important for the Women’s Tennis Association to enforce the restrictions that are in place for players under the age of 18, limiting the number of tournaments they can play each year. That will temper expectations and allow Gauff and other teenagers the ability to take the necessary incremental steps needed for their development.\n\n“I wish her so much success and she is a brilliant young lady on the tennis court,” Woodforde said. “But I am a supporter of longevity in this sport.”\n\nAustin cringes when she hears what Gauff may need to do to take the next step in her young career. She prefers that everyone stop asking that question and just sit back and enjoy watching Gauff play, then let the natural process of trial and error allow her to grow as a player.\n\nShe hopes fans will appreciate just how good Gauff already is this month at Indian Wells and enjoy the thought that she could be around for a couple more decades.\n\n“Coco seems to understand that this is a journey,” Austin said. “It’s not just about next month or the next tournament. Players are playing longer. She could play for the next 20 years if she takes care of her body and the desire holds up.”\n\nGauff said that although she wants to win every match, continued improvement is her priority, and therefore she doesn’t have rigid expectations for herself at the BNP Paribas Open.\n\nSerena Williams won here for the first time as a teenager, in 1999, and then won the U.S. Open the same year. Gauff is well aware that the feat was repeated the last two years by a pair of unseeded teens: Osaka and Bianca Andrescuu.\n\nFor that to happen a third consecutive year would be something. And although she doesn’t want to put too much pressure on herself to make it happen, it doesn’t mean Gauff won’t be trying to pull it off.\n\n“If I win, I guess everyone will start to realize that only teenagers can win Indian Wells,” Gauff joked.\n\n“That definitely gives me a lot of inspiration knowing that it's possible.”\n\nAndrew John covers the BNP Paribas Open for The Desert Sun and the USA TODAY Network.

John\n\nThe Desert Sun\n\nSerena Williams returned to Indian Wells last year for the first time in 14 years to start what she described as the healing process.\n\nAnd in 2016, Venus Williams is expected to finally have her triumphant return, as her name appeared on the entry list to this year's BNP Paribas Open.\n\n“Venus made the decision herself,” said Raymond Moore, the tournament's chief executive and tournament director.\n\nSerena, her sister Venus and father Richard were heavily booed throughout the 2001 final of the desert's annual professional tennis tournament, which Serena eventually won against Kim Clijsters. She later said she wept uncontrollably in the locker room afterward.\n\nRichard Williams told reporters that he and his two daughters were also the recipients of a number of racial slurs hurled from an upset Indian Wells crowd after Venus withdrew with a knee injury just prior to her semifinal match with her sister.\n\nAfter saying she would never return to Indian Wells, Serena Williams eventually did so in 2015, returning to the site of what she described as “the darkest moment of my career.”\n\nSerena Williams puts racial issues from '01 in her past\n\nMoore was instrumental last year in bringing Serena Williams back. A reporter had asked her at the 2014 Australian Open if she’d ever be open to returning to Indian Wells and she wasn’t dismissive. That was a tipping point that helped Moore become proactive about reaching out to Williams and working with Stacey Allaster, the former chief executive of the Women’s Tennis Association.\n\nIt took a year to facilitate, but Serena Williams made good on her promise to return, and was greeted with a 57-second standing ovation just prior to her first match on Stadium Court. After the match, a straight sets win over Romania’s Monica Niculescu, Williams said, “This was easily one of the biggest moments of my career.”\n\nIn retrospect, Serena’s return to Indian Wells on that Friday night was like her match in 2001, in that it will likely be hard to forget.\n\nThat experience apparently made an impression on Venus Williams, and may have influenced her decision to ultimately return to Indian Wells, too.\n\nVenus Williams back at the BNP? Didn't see that coming\n\n“We didn’t have to reach out to her,” Moore said. “She had already made her decision, so obviously seeing her on the entry list this morning was great for us.”\n\nVenus Williams was not immediately available for comment.\n\nShe is currently the No. 10 player in the WTA singles rankings, and lost in the first round of the Australian Open to Madison Keys on Jan. 10. The next time she steps onto the court may be at the BNP Paribas Open, which begins March 7.\n\nSerena about to win Slam, but are you rooting for her?\n\n“I’m glad to see that both Venus and Serena are coming to play in the BNP,” said Rosie Casals, a Coachella Valley resident who’s still a central figure in the sport 30 years after ending her playing career. “I hope they do well and maybe get to the finals. I know they will be welcomed by the tennis community.”\n\nSteve Simon, the new WTA chief executive who was formerly the tournament director at the BNP Paribas Open, echoed those sentiments.\n\n“I’m confident Venus will enjoy playing there again as much as we will enjoy seeing her on court,” he said.\n\nDuring Serena Williams’ first match back in Indian Wells, tournament owner Larry Ellison sat with fellow billionaire Bill Gates, tournament founder Charlie Pasarell and tennis legend John McEnroe. She eventually was forced to withdraw from the event with a knee injury just prior to her semifinal match against Simona Halep, but vowed she would be back for 2016.\n\nIt appeared Venus, on the other hand, might never return.\n\nAfter Serena and Venus Williams left Indian Wells in 2001, some say Venus was the more resolute about never returning. She was adamant that her boycott would never end, and has been very public about that stance.\n\nThough Venus Williams has returned to the area to promote her clothing line in Palm Desert, until last year, it appeared she would never play tennis here again.\n\n“When Serena reported back to big sis, 'I had a great time at Indian Wells, an unbelievable welcome,’ that changed Venus’s opinion,” Moore said.\n\nVenus Williams, 35, has not played in Indian Wells since she was 20. She reached the top ranking in the WTA a year later, on Feb. 25, 2002, and has been among the most consistent players in the sport over the last decade and a half. She finished 2015 ranked No. 7 in singles, and within the top 10 on 11 separate occasions since 1998 and is a nine-time Gland Slam champion.\n\nThough she would appear to be in the final stages of her career, having her in Indian Wells for at least one last time brings to close the chilly relationship between the tournament and the Williams sisters, and again allows the tournament to showcase all of the best players in the world.\n\nMoore said he expects Venus Williams to receive the same hero's welcome back that her sister received a year ago. “It transcended barriers,” Moore said.\n\n“It’s going to be great for us,” Moore said. “We are really pumped.”\n\nSerena Williams withdraws from BNP Paribas Open\n\nThe Williams sisters will be accompanied this year by a number of former BNP Paribas Open Champions, including defending champion and world No. 2 Simona Halep, five-time Grand Slam champion and world No. 5 Maria Sharapova (2006, 2013), and a quartet of former world No. 1 ranked players including two-time Grand Slam champion Victoria Azarenka (2012), 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic (2008), Jelena Jankovic (2010) and Caroline Wozniacki (2011).\n\nThe men’s entry list is led by world No. 1, 10-time Grand Slam Champion and four-time and defending BNP Paribas Open champion Novak Djokovic (2008, 2011, 2014, 2015); world No. 3, 17-time Grand Slam champion and four-time BNP Paribas Open champion Roger Federer (2004-2006, 2012); and world No. 5, 14-time Grand Slam champion and three-time BNP Paribas Open champion Rafael Nadal (2007, 2009, 2013).\n\nThe remaining spots in the draws will be filled by winners of the qualifying tournament (WTA – March 7 & 8, ATP – March 8 & 9) and wildcards, which will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nView the full player entry list, or purchase a ticket and experience Tennis Paradise in March.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/open/2019/08/22/us-open-serena-williams-draws-maria-sharapova-first-round/2084907001/", "title": "US Open: Serena Williams draws Maria Sharapova for first round", "text": "Serena Williams will face a familiar foe in the first round of the U.S. Open this year — former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova.\n\nWilliams, No. 8 in WTA rankings, drew 87th-ranked Sharapova in a blockbuster match slated for Monday at Flushing Meadows as the Open's matchups were announced Thursday.\n\nThe tennis stars have never met in a U.S. Open match.

It was her worst loss in terms of games in a Grand Slam in her career.\n\nPreviously she lost to Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-4 in the 2004 Wimbledon final, to Samantha Stosur 6-2, 6-3 in the 2011 U.S. Open final and 6-2, 6-3 and to Ekaterina Makarova in the 2012 Australian Open in the Round of 16.\n\n\"I don't know anything that actually worked,\" said Williams, who was seeking an 18th major title and third at Roland Garros. \"It was one of those days.\"\n\nIt was not unprecedented: Both Williams sisters lost on the same day in the third round here in 2008.\n\nBut never before in the Open era have the top two women's seeds lost before the third round at a Grand Slam tournament. No. 2 Li Na of China was upset in the first round Tuesday.\n\nVenus, whose best result in Paris was the 2002 final, won the first set and was up an early break before Schmiedlova responded by winning eight of the next nine games.\n\n\"I felt like this was a match that I was most likely going to win,\" said the seven-time major winner, who has not been past the third round of a Grand Slam since 2011 and won her last major at Wimbledon in 2008. \"I don't know how Serena felt, but I'm sure she feels like that every time she goes on the court. So I think our expectation was to play in the next round.\"\n\n\"I see wonderful things for her,\" she said of 56th-ranked Schmiedlova.\n\nSerena, meantime, looked out of sorts from the get-go. She fell behind early and never recovered.\n\nSoon, the telltale signs of a bad day at the office were in full display: Facial contortions, self-recriminations, pleading stares at her box, slaps to her thighs, and inelegant footwork.\n\nMidway through the second set, Serena impatiently chided a ball kid to \"stay focused\" as she waited for a ball to serve.\n\nAnd there were errors. Lots of errors.\n\nThe 32-year-old American made 29 errors to just eight winners and three aces in the 64-minute defeat.\n\nMuguruza, a Venezuelan-born Barcelona resident, is part of a crop of young players making noise on the women's tour.\n\nThe lanky 20-year-old won her first WTA title earlier this year at Hobart and, except for a six-month layoff after ankle surgery last year, has been steadily climbing the ranks.\n\nUnfazed by the potential upset, Muguruza kept firing and attacking to the end, while Serena often appeared off balance and rushed.\n\n\"Most of the players in the draw wouldn't have beaten Serena today,\" said Serena's coach, Frenchman Patrick Mouratoglou, who praised the Spaniard's poise and aggression. \"She did.\"\n\nMouratoglou said Serena was suffering no physical problems and had been practicing well. He said she was simply unable to find any solutions.\n\n\"Usually when she's in trouble she always finds a way but she's a human being,\" he said.\n\nWith half the season gone, Serena has won only three titles and failed to advance past the fourth round at a major after losing at the Australian Open to Ana Ivanovic.\n\nShe heads to Wimbledon's grass with some question marks and a less firm grip on the No. 1 ranking, both on the computer and in the minds of her competitors.\n\nBut she's been there before.\n\nIn 2012, Serena bowed out of the French Open's first round and responded by decimating the tour. She went 31-1 the rest of the year, winning Wimbledon, Olympic gold medals in singles and doubles, and the U.S. Open.\n\n\"It's great because I'm going to go home and work five times as hard to make sure I never lose again,\" Serena said.\n\nMouratoglou agreed that she would be back with something to prove. An angry Serena is a dangerous Serena.\n\n\"It's also a source of motivation for her to come back even stronger,\" he said. \"I have no doubt that very soon she will tell me that she wants to go back to work and win again.\"\n\nSerena can now hole up in her Paris digs, much as she did two years ago, and regroup.

Her family then moved to Atlanta, but when she was 7, they moved back to Delray Beach, about 20 miles south of West Palm Beach and 53 miles north of Miami. The family has roots there: Her grandmother Yvonne Lee was the first Black student to attend Delray's all-White Seacrest High School in 1961.\n\nGauff has shouted out her hometown frequently over the years, including with her signature shoe \"Coco Delray.\" She did not go to high school locally because of her globetrotting tennis career, but she did earn her high school degree in 2022.\n\nHas Coco Gauff won a Grand Slam?\n\nGauff has now made it to three Grand Slam finals, with the previous two being the 2023 U.S. Open and the 2022 French Open. She lost to Iga Swiatek in straight sets in her first French Open final.\n\nGauff's first Grand Slam title came against Sabalenka at the 2023 U.S. Open. The victory helped propel her to become the highest-paid female athlete in the world, according to Sportico.\n\nWhy did Coco Gauff change her name? What is Coco Gauff's real name?\n\nCoco is a nickname: The tennis star's birth name is Cori Gauff, an homage to her father, Corey. Gauff told Sports Illustrated Kids in 2021 that the nickname came about because it would be confusing for people calling their names.\n\n\"I believe it was my aunt who said, 'Oh, we should just call her Coco,'\" she said. \"When my dad was growing up, people used to call him Co and I guess they just said, 'Oh, Coco’s a cool nickname.' Ever since then, I’ve been going by Coco. For sure more people used Coco than Cori.\"\n\nIs Coco Gauff dating? Who is Coco Gauff's boyfriend?\n\nCoco Gauff told Time that she's been dating someone since 2023 but wants to keep his identity private. She has said he's from Atlanta and that her mom was his fourth-grade teacher.\n\n“This is my first real relationship,” Gauff told Time. “To just have someone to talk to who is not involved in tennis at all gives me a fresh perspective.”\n\nWhile she has not confirmed his identity, internet sleuths believe she is dating musician Jalen Sera, who has posted social media reactions to her wins and looks on the red carpet at the 2025 Oscars. Gauff also posted a photo of the two together as part of a group at Tyler, The Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw music festival in November.\n\nGauff has confirmed her boyfriend is not in the tennis world, something she greatly appreciated after seeing the movie \"Challengers,\" which involves Zendaya's character getting into a love triangle with two fellow tennis players. \"I told my boyfriend, 'Thank God you don't play tennis,' because (Tashi Duncan is) right, I would not want to date a scrub on tour,\" Gauff said, according to ESPNW.\n\nWho are Coco Gauff's parents? What do her mom and dad do?\n\nLike many star athletes, Coco Gauff is from an athletic family. Her dad, Corey Gauff, played college basketball at Georgia State from 1990 to 1993. He was Coco's first tennis coach, stepping down in 2023 to take on more of a support role.\n\nHer mom, Candi Gauff, was a track star at Florida State from 1988 to 1992 when she was Candi Odom. She was also the South Florida Sun Sentinel's Athlete of the Year twice. She is now a teacher and home-schooled Coco.\n\nHow many brothers does Coco Gauff have?\n\nCoco has two younger brothers, Codey and Cameron. Codey is a high school baseball player, and the catcher committed to play for Missouri in the recruiting class of 2026. Cameron is in middle school.\n\nCoco Gauff speaks out against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, in support of social causes\n\nGauff has used her fame to give a platform to a variety of causes, namely the importance of mental health. After winning her semifinal match en route to winning the 2023 U.S. Open, she shouted out fellow tennis star Naomi Osaka and thanked her for raising awareness for mental health.\n\nShe has spoken out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against the Florida law critics call \"Don't Say Gay,\" which effectively bans teachers from talking about LGBTQ issues such as gender identity and sexual orientation. Before the 2024 French Open, she called on Florida's youth to vote and criticized Gov. Ron DeSantis, telling the Associated Press it was \"a crazy time to be a Floridian, especially a Black one at that.\"\n\nCoco Gauff started at same tennis facility as Venus and Serena Williams\n\nGauff trained at Pompey Park, the same tennis grounds where Venus and Serena Williams developed into world-class tennis stars after moving to Florida in the 1990s.\n\n“I’ve been playing there since I can remember,” Gauff said in 2018. “My first tennis memory is there. Everyone there, I feel like we’re all a big family. I’m practicing there tomorrow.”\n\nThe Williams sisters ruled the tennis world through most of the 21st century. Serena has 23 major titles, one behind Margaret Court for the most all time, spanning from the 1999 U.S. Open to the 2017 Australian Open. Venus won seven major singles championships, starting with Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2000 and ending with the 2008 Wimbledon title. And the two combined for 14 more Grand Slam doubles titles.\n\nWhen Gauff was awarded the key to the city of Delray Beach in 2018 at 14 years old, she said she dreamt of being \"the next Serena Williams.\" And her breakout win came in 2019 when she beat Venus in the first round at Wimbledon. The 15-year-old made it all the way to the Round of 16 that year.\n\nWhen is Coco Gauff's next match?

It's definitely something well-earned.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old Williams is the third-oldest player to qualify for the finals. Billie Jean King was 39 in 1983 and Martina Navratilova was 38 in 1994.\n\nThe fifth-ranked Williams reached two Grand Slam finals this season. She lost to her sister Serena at the Australian Open and to Muguruza in the final at Wimbledon.\n\nMORE TENNIS: Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza earns WTA Player of the Year honors\n\nWilliams won the 2008 WTA Finals by defeating Vera Zvonareva of Russia.

Williams, who is 32 and world No. 1, started playing professional tennis nearly 20 years ago. Since then she has played 793 singles matches, losing 118 to 60 different players. All of whom she can name … Really?\n\nWilliams paused. \"Probably,\" she continued. \"If I sat down and thought about it, probably.\"\n\nOne of them is Makarova, a 26-year-old Russian with forceful groundstrokes and a calm disposition. In fact if Makarova defeats Williams today, she'll become just the second player to beat her in both singles and doubles at the same tournament. Makarova and Elena Vesnina beat Williams and her sister, Venus, in the doubles quarterfinals. Makarova and Vesnina went on to make the final, where they'll face Flavia Pennetta and Martina Hingis.\n\nHingis, a Hall of Famer who retired from singles years ago but started playing some doubles last year, is currently the only player to accomplish the aforementioned feat. She did it in 2001 in Sydney, where she and partner Monica Seles beat the Williams sisters in the doubles first round and Hingis beat Williams in the quarterfinals.\n\nHingis didn't realize this. Asked to guess the double winner Friday, Hingis came up with Kim Clijsters. Once informed she was the one, Hingis said, \"It was with Monica (Seles), right? We beat them in Sydney. This I know, but I wouldn't know if I beat Serena in singles as well.\"\n\nNow if it were a singles loss, Hingis might remember. That's going by Williams' words and also those of three-time Slam winner Lindsay Davenport. Asked if she too can name the players who beat her, Davenport said, \"I'd get a very high percentage correct. I'd probably miss a few, but not many.\"\n\nThe Numbers\n\nAs expected Davenport is on Williams' list; her head-to-head is 4-10. The only players to beat Williams more than four times are Venus Williams (11-14), Jennifer Capriati (7-10), Hingis (6-7), Justine Henin (6-8) and Elena Dementieva (5-7). None have winning head-to-head records against Serena.\n\nBut there are some who do. Most played Williams just once: There's Annie Miller, Williams' first opponent (1995 Quebec City qualifying); Alexia Dechaume-Balleret (1997 Indian Wells qualifying); Mary Joe Fernandez (1999 French Open); Paola Suárez (2000 Amelia Island); Tiantian Sun (2005 Beijing); Virginie Razzano (2012 French Open, Williams' sole first-round Slam loss) and Jana Cepelova (2014 Charleston).\n\nAmong players who played Williams multiple times, only two have a winning head-to-head against her. That's right – two. Both are retired. One is left-handed Sybille Bammer (2-0). The other is Hall of Famer Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario (4-3).\n\nWhich may explain what Williams said when asked to list a few losses she's learned the most from in her career. \"In 1998 I played Sanchez in the French Open, and I really believe I should have won that match. I was up, and, you know, I didn't take a chance.\" It was a fourth-round match, and Williams lost 4-6, 7-5, 6-3. Sanchez-Vicario was No. 5 and Williams No. 27.\n\nA more recent loss has also stayed with Williams: \"Definitely I learned a lot from one this year. I'm not ready to talk about it yet, but definitely learned a lot from that.\"\n\nShe could be talking about a three-set loss to Alize Cornet in the third round of Wimbledon. Because it was Wimbledon, where Williams often plays her best, and it was her second loss to Cornet this year. Another possibility is a shocking 6-2, 6-2 loss to Garbiñe Muguruza in the second round of the French Open. (Serena lost to three other players this year – Cepelova, Venus Williams and Ana Ivanovic. Walkovers aren't counted toward losses listed on player bios provided by the WTA.)\n\nIn all Serena has 675 career singles victories, more than any active player, but her 118 losses may be more impressive.\n\nThirty-three players in the women's draw have fewer losses. They are all at a different stage in their careers than Williams. Their average age is 20. The most matches won among them is 199 (Maryna Zanevska).\n\nSurprisingly but maybe not so much – since players, seeded ones especially, have to get far enough in a tournament to lose to Williams – many players Williams lost to the most are the same ones she beat the most. Her sister is a good example. Venus beat Serena 11 times, more than any other player. And she lost to Serena 14 times, more than any player but one.\n\n(The one is Maria Sharapova, who's an unhappy 2-16 against Serena. It may comfort Sharapova to know that the players Serena beat most are a who's who of tennis – at least the first 20 have won Slams or held top 10 rankings.)\n\nWilliams' career singles losses break out by surface like this – 67 on hard courts, 32 on clay courts, 12 on grass courts and seven on carpet.\n\nThe Players\n\nIf Serena can list all the players who beat her, many of them won't forget that they did.\n\nRetired player Alina Jidkova is among the elite 60. She lost to Serena once and beat her once. It was at 2004 in Linz, and Jidkova won 7-6 (5), 6-2. Williams was ranked ninth, Jidkova 73rd.\n\n\"It was the biggest win of my career,\" says Jidkova. \"When I tell people they don't believe me, I think. They always ask, 'Really?'And the next thing is, 'But you are so small and skinny.'\"\n\nJidkova recounts it all. Being intimidated during the coin toss, making a concerted effort not to look at Williams, being in the zone to the point where she didn't notice \"some random guy\" kiss her after the match until someone told her.\n\n\"I think when she came out she didn't take me seriously,\" Jidkova says, \"and I found myself up 4-1. Then she caught up fast. After that it was a battle. In first set tiebreaker I had a set point, and she gave me a short ball. I hit approach shot and went to the net praying to God she will miss the passing shot. And she did. I won 7-6. After that she called a trainer, but I stayed focused and won 6-2.\"\n\nMakarova, who is 1-3 against Serena Williams, won her sole match 6-2, 6-3 in the fourth round of the 2012 Australian Open. Where does the win rank? \"I think it ranks high definitely – in top 3,\" says Makarova. \"I leave maybe Fed Cup at the beginning.\"\n\nBeating Serena\n\nThe day before Pennetta's quarterfinal against Williams, an Italian journalist asked Hingis what advice she might give her doubles partner. \"[Serena's] a great champion, but I think Flavia played her many times herself,\" Hingis said.\n\nWhen the journalist noted Pennetta lost every time, it seemed to be news to Hingis. She considered this before continuing. \"Well, she just has to go out there, nothing to lose, play her game. Try to guess the serve obviously. Try to make her play as much as possible. I know it's difficult to dictate… but you have to try to impose your game.\"\n\nJidkova says the main reason Williams is hard to beat is \"because she has so much power and she is feisty\" and that when she's on it's hard for anyone to come close.\n\nAnd that list of players Williams says she can fill out completely doesn't surprise Jidkova in the least. \"No, because she didn't lose much when she really played,\" Jidkova said.\n\n***\n\nPlayers who have defeated Serena, and their records against her:\n\nVenus Williams (11-14)\n\nJennifer Capriati (7-10)\n\nMartina Hingis (6-7)\n\nJustine Henin (6-8)\n\nElena Dementieva (5-7)\n\nArantxa Sanchez-Vicario (4-3)\n\nPatty Schnyder (4-8)\n\nJelena Jankovic (4-10)\n\nLindsay Davenport (4-10)\n\nSandrine Testud (3-5)\n\nNadia Petrova (3-7)\n\nSamantha Stosur (3-8)\n\nVictoria Azarenka (3-14)\n\nSybille Bammer (2-0)\n\nAlizé Cornet (2-3)\n\nFrancesca Schiavone (2-7)\n\nKim Clijsters (2-7)\n\nSvetlana Kuznetsova (2-7)\n\nVera Zvonareva (2-7)\n\nAmélie Mauresmo (2-10)\n\nMaria Sharapova (2-16)\n\nAlexia Dechaume-Balleret (1-0)\n\nAnnie Miller (1-0)\n\nJana Cepelova (1-0)\n\nMary Joe Fernandez (1-0)\n\nPaola Suárez (1-0)\n\nTiantian Sun (1-0)\n\nVirginie Razzano (1-0)\n\nAleksandra Wozniak (1-1)\n\nAlina Jidkova (1-1)\n\nAnna Chakvetadze (1-1)\n\nChanda Rubin (1-1)\n\nDominique Monami (1-1)\n\nGarbiñe Muguruza (1-1)\n\nJoannette Kruger (1-1)\n\nKimberly Po-Messerli (1-1)\n\nSilvia Farina Elia (1-1)\n\nSteffi Graf (1-1)\n\nVirginia Ruano Pascual (1-1)\n\nYung-Jan Chan (1-1)\n\nJill Craybas (1-2)\n\nMeghann Shaughnessy (1-2)\n\nNathalie Tauziat (1-2)\n\nSabine Lisicki (1-2)\n\nSloane Stephens (1-2)\n\nEkaterina Makarova (1-3)\n\nIrina Spirlea (1-3)\n\nKatarina Srebotnik (1-3)\n\nMarion Bartoli (1-3)\n\nElena Likhovtseva (1-4)\n\nKlara Koukalova (1-4)\n\nMagui Serna (1-4)\n\nMonica Seles (1-4)\n\nAngelique Kerber (1-5)\n\nMary Pierce (1-5)\n\nDinara Safina (1-6)\n\nAna Ivanovic (1-7)\n\nCaroline Wozniacki (1-8)\n\nDaniela Hantuchova (1-9)\n\nLi Na (1-11)\n\nPHOTOS: Serena Williams' style on the court", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2013/06/06/serena-williams-maria-sharapova-french-open-womens-final-preview/2397627/", "title": "Serena, Sharapova: Top stars align in French Open final", "text": "By Douglas Robson\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nSerena Williams and Maria Sharapova will face off in the French Open final\n\nWilliams leads the series 13-2 and has won 12 in a row\n\n%22I%27d be lying if it doesn%27t bother me%2C obviously%2C%22 Sharapova said of her lopsided record\n\nPARIS — On an afternoon the WTA celebrated its 40th anniversary with a parade of former champions on Philippe Chatrier Court, its biggest 21st Century stars took center stage Thursday in French Open semifinal matches that would make women's tour founder Billie Jean King proud.\n\nBut if Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova share the spotlight as the sport's top female icons (with the off-court earnings to back up their crossover appeal), their on-court rivalry has been anything but equal.\n\nTop-ranked Williams has not lost to No. 2 Sharapova since 2004 — the year the 17-year-old Russian shocked her in the Wimbledon final, and then won again the season-ending championships — and owns a 13-2 career advantage.\n\n\"I'd be lying if it doesn't bother me, obviously,\" said Sharapova of her lopsided record, which includes three losses in 2013 and 12 in a row.\n\nThursday's semifinals stood in contrast, too.\n\nUp first, Russia's Sharapova, the defending French Open champion, fought off her own inconsistent serving and a 35-minute rain delay to beat No. 3 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus 6-1, 2-6, 6-4.\n\nWilliams crushed last year's runner-up Sara Errani of Italy 6-0, 6-1 in 46 minutes, racking up 40 winners to Errani's 2.\n\nSharapova, 26, now has a chance to stem the tide, but she'll need the performance of a lifetime to upstage Williams, who at 31 might be playing the best tennis of her life.\n\nSince a first-round exit at Roland Garros a year ago, Williams is 73-3. She has played like she's on a mission.\n\nShe won Wimbledon, the London Olympics, the U.S. Open and the WTA year-end championships and currently is on a career-best 30-match winning streak, the longest single-season undefeated run since her sister Venus won 35 in a row in 2000.\n\nParis has taken on special meaning, and not only because it is the only major the 15-time Grand Slam champion has failed to win multiple times.\n\nShe owns an apartment on the city's Left Bank. She is learning French and has tested her improving language skills with on-court interviews in the local tongue after each win here.\n\nShe has spent increasing amounts of time with Patrick Mouratoglou, the French coach she brought into the fold after her loss here last year.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything that can describe how happy I would be,\" said Williams of adding a second French Open trophy to her cache. \"But right now it's still a dream.\"\n\nWhile Williams' power and athleticism are a poor matchup for Sharapova whatever the surface, the Russian suggested she hadn't played her best over an entire match against her in a long time.\n\nShe pointed to the opening set of this year's Miami final in March, where Sharapova won the first set and was up a break before dropping the final 10 games in a 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 whipping.\n\n\"I feel like the first set in Miami was pretty good,\" she said. \"I don't feel like I have taken my chances and opportunities.\"\n\nHer former coach, Michael Joyce, suggested in a recent conversation that Williams' dominance is more than physical.\n\n\"Against other players if things aren't going well deep down she still thinks she can turn it around,\" said Joyce, who traveled with Sharapova full time from 2005-2011. \"That's where it becomes mental against Serena. The problem is that if Serena is playing her best tennis Maria is probably not going to win. That's the truth of the matter. She needs to give herself a better shot, hang in there a bit. Stay close with her. Serena is such a good front-runner.\"\n\nAt least Sharapova can count on this: She has more recent experience at this stage of the tournament.\n\nWilliams hasn't advanced this far in Paris since her sole title in 2002, when she beat Venus in the first of four consecutive majors, the so-called Serena Slam.\n\n\"She's playing some of the best tennis of her career, so it doesn't matter how she performed here 11 years ago or the ones before that,\" Sharapova said.\n\nFour-time major winner Sharapova can't throw her power game out the window. She does plan to add some new wrinkles.\n\n\"Obviously whatever I did in the past hasn't worked, so I'll have to try to do something different and hopefully it will,\" said Sharapova, the only active player along with Williams to complete a career Grand Slam. \"I'm proud of the way that I came through this tournament. I have given myself a chance to face the favorite.\"\n\nBut this is not the same Williams, either.\n\nLike this year, she arrived in Paris 12 months ago undefeated on clay and eager — perhaps too eager — to finally win again.\n\nShe hadn't won a major since 2010 Wimbledon, a period of nearly two years, much of it spent sidelines with a series of injuries and illnesses.\n\n\"It's not the same feeling,\" Mouratoglou said in an interview this week. \"She wants to win it bad, for sure, but she has much more confidence than last year because she's won so many matches, so many tournaments. I think she feels also her game is much stronger because I think her low level is higher.\"\n\nWilliams' take on the difference from 2012? \"I didn't lose in the first round,\" she quipped.\n\nImpatient and distracted in her post-match press conference Thursday, Williams admitted she was locked in and already thinking of Saturday's final.\n\n\"Like these questions are just so redundant right now,\" she snapped at reporters. \"Do we have anything else we want to ask?\"\n\nForty decades since the founding of modern women's tennis, you couldn't ask for much more than Williams and Sharapova with hardware on the line.\n\nHead to head\n\nNo. 1 Serena Williams vs. No. 2 Maria Sharapova\n\nWilliams leads 13-2\n\n2004 Miami, R16, hard-outdoor, Williams, 6-4, 6-3.\n\n2004 Wimbledon, F, grass-outdoor, Sharapova, 6-1, 6-4.\n\n2004 WTA Championships-Los Angeles, F, hard-indoor, Sharapova, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4.\n\n2005 Australian Open, SF, hard-outdoor, Williams, 2-6, 7-5, 8-6.\n\n2007 Australian Open, F, hard-outdoor, Williams, 6-1, 6-2.\n\n2007 Miami, R16, hard-outdoor, Williams, 6-1, 6-1.\n\n2008 Charleston, QF, green clay-outdoor, Williams, 7-5, 4-6, 6-1.\n\n2010 Wimbledon, R16, grass-outdoor, Williams, 7-6 (9), 6-4.\n\n2011 Stanford, QF, hard-outdoor, Williams, 6-1, 6-3.\n\n2012 Madrid, QF, clay-outdoor, Williams, 6-1, 6-3.\n\n2012 Olympics-London, F, grass-outdoor, Williams, 6-0, 6-1.\n\n2012 WTA Championships-Istanbul, F, hard-indoor, Williams, 6-4, 6-3.\n\n2013 Doha, SF, hard-outdoor, Williams, 6-3, 6-2.\n\n2013 Miami, F, hard-outdoor, Williams, 4-6, 6-3, 6-0.\n\n2013 Madrid, F, clay-outdoor, Williams, 6-1, 6-4.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2014/06/29/big-4-around-wimbledons-week-2-not-so-for-women/11704109/", "title": "Big 4 around Wimbledon's Week 2, not so for women", "text": "AP\n\nLONDON (AP) — The so-called \"Big 4\" who have won 35 of 37 of the past Grand Slam singles titles — Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Roger Federer — are all around for the second week at Wimbledon, joined by the new major winner on the block, Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka.\n\nThe same can't be said on the women's side, where top-seeded and five-time champion Serena Williams won't see any action at the All England Club in Week 2 except in doubles with her sister Venus, another five-time Wimbledon winner who is also out of singles.\n\nWith Serena out and second-seeded Li Na also a third-round loser, it marks the first time in the Open era that the top two women's seeds haven't advanced to Wimbledon's fourth round.\n\nWilliams, who has 17 Grand Slam singles titles, hadn't been knocked out of Wimbledon so soon since 2005, but has departed before the quarterfinals at four of the past five majors.\n\nWTA founder Billie Jean King, winner of eight Grand Slam singles titles in the Open era, says she recalls going through a similar streak in her career.\n\n\"Most definitely,\" King said Sunday near Wimbledon when announcing Singapore as the new site of the WTA season-ending championships in October.\n\n\"Everybody does. But I think there might be some underlying things happening to her, some things off the court, that are affecting her. I'm sure she will work them out.\"\n\nOn a sunny but blustery middle Sunday — traditionally an off-day at Wimbledon — most of the players remaining in the singles draw held sessions at the nearby Aorangi Park practice courts.\n\nFederer and Murray were there at the same time, although due to rain delays on Friday, Federer, like Nadal, won't play his fourth-round match until Tuesday.\n\nFederer says he's amazed as anyone about the Big 4's ability to maintain such a stellar record in Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n\"I came through the ranks where it was normal for top guys to have a bad Slam, have maybe two bad Slams from time to time, but it barely happens anymore,\" Federer said. \"It's like such a shock when it does.\n\n\"I think I've been surprised how consistent I've been personally, but even more so by everybody else who is just like normal to get to quarters, get to semis.

Sign up here.\n\nLondon and Abu Dhabi CNN —\n\nA grisly drug-induced homicide captivated the media in Saudi Arabia this April, when a man in the country’s Eastern Province set his family house on fire before iftar, the meal that ends the Ramadan fast. Four members of his family were killed.\n\nPolice said he was under the influence of shabu, a methamphetamine, according to local papers.\n\nSaudi media has been sounding the alarm lately over the rise in drug use, with one columnist describing shipments of narcotics to the kingdom as an “open war against us, more dangerous than any other war.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Saudi authorities announced the largest seizure of illicit drugs in the country’s history after nearly 47 million amphetamine pills were hidden in a flour shipment and seized at a warehouse in the capital Riyadh.\n\nThe record seizure demonstrates what experts say is Saudi Arabia’s growing role as the drug capital of the Middle East, driving demand and becoming the primary destination for smugglers from Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe kingdom, they say, is one of the largest and most lucrative regional destinations for drugs, and that status is only intensifying.\n\nWednesday’s operation was the biggest single smuggling attempt in terms of narcotics seized, according to the General Directorate of Narcotics Control. While authorities didn’t name the drug seized or where it came from, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has previously said that “reports of amphetamine seizures from countries in the Middle East continue to refer predominantly to tablets bearing the Captagon logo.”\n\nCaptagon was originally the brand name for a medicinal product containing the synthetic stimulant fenethylline. Though it is no longer produced legally, counterfeit drugs carrying the captagon name are regularly seized in the Middle East, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.\n\nDrug busts of captagon in Saudi Arabia and around the region have grown over time. Earlier this week, A US Coast Guard boat seized 320 kilograms of amphetamine tablets and almost 3,000 kilograms of hashish worth millions of dollars from a fishing boat in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nThe drug was popularized in the kingdom some 15 years ago but has taken off more intensely in the past five years, “perhaps becoming on par with cannabis,” according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, who has written on the topic.\n\nOne of the reasons captagon is spreading in use is “because there is a supply flood now coming mostly from Syria” where it is produced “on an industrial scale in the chemical factories inherited from the [Assad] regime” and supplied by warlords and affiliates of the regime.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Center for International Communication didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nCaptagon can be sold for between $10 and $25 a pill, meaning the latest Saudi haul, if it was the same drug, has a street value of up to $1.1 billion, based on figures from the International Addiction Review journal.\n\n“Captagon’s amphetamine-type properties are sought out as a coping mechanism that can aid users facing food insecurity in staving hunger, and inducing a euphoric ‘rush’ that users have said to help with traumatic stress,” said Caroline Rose, a senior analyst at the New Lines Institute in Washington, D.C. who has studied the captagon trade. “It’s also been said that these same traits for captagon have been sought out by foreign workers in wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, seen to aid work performance.”\n\nWhile hashish and khat are also common drugs in the kingdom, amphetamines are popular among Saudi youth. A 2021 study in the journal of Crime, Law and Social Change cited a user as saying, “captagon is small. My school mates and I like it more than hashish. Not like hashish, we can buy in tablet……Once we get 25 riyals from [our] parents, we can buy one tablet and enjoy it.”\n\n“In wealthier consumer markets, the drug has a different appeal, serving as a recreational activity amongst its growing youth population that, despite social reforms… have reportedly struggled with boredom amidst widespread youth unemployment and a lack of opportunities for leisurely activities,” said Rose. “Some consumers have justified captagon as less of a taboo substance, compared to ‘harder’ drugs like opiates and cocaine.”\n\nSince many young people in Saudi Arabia have been taking drugs as a result of boredom and lack of social opportunities, the increased freedoms introduced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman could help reduce some of that use, said Felbab-Brown.\n\n“The important thing is neither to curtail the freedoms, nor to turn concerts into places of dragnets and raids, but rather to educate young people,” she told CNN.\n\nOver the past few years, a number of drug rehabilitation centers have popped up across the kingdom after the government began licensing private establishments.\n\nKhalid Al Mashari, the CEO of Qaweem, one of the first such centers to open, says around four or five have opened in the past two years. That’s a testament to the government’s recognition of the importance of rehabilitation, he says, but it also shows that the problem is on the rise.\n\n“We’re in high demand, unfortunately,” he told CNN. “But at least people have an option now, instead of having to go to neighboring countries to seek treatment.”\n\nDespite the presence of rehabilitation centers, Rose says there is little public health messaging or campaigning to raise awareness about captagon.\n\n“While this taboo regarding drug consumption in the kingdom is not going anywhere, the government’s tendency to exclusively securitize this issue and downplay its role as a destination market will be harder to ignore,” she said.\n\nFelbab-Brown says drug policies in the Middle East have focused on the harshest of responses.\n\n“Unlike large parts of the world [that] have walked away from such rigid and mostly ineffective or outright counterproductive policies, the Middle East has often doubled down on them,” she said. “Imprisoning users is ineffective and counterproductive.”\n\nThe digest\n\nUS says Iran reply on EU proposal for revival of nuclear deal is “not constructive”\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the US has received Iran’s reply to the US’ response an EU proposal for the revival of the nuclear deal on Thursday. “We are studying it and will respond through the EU, but unfortunately it is not constructive,” said the spokesperson. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani earlier said Tehran’s response was sent after “carefully” examining it and “with the aim of finalizing the negotiations,” according to a statement.\n\nBackground: Earlier this week during a press conference in Russia, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Iran needs guarantees that the US will not withdraw from the nuclear accord and reapply sanctions as happened under the Trump administration.\n\nWhy it matters: The US and Iran have been trading responses to a “final” EU text aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said he hopes the talks can be concluded in a matter of days. French President Macron also said on Thursday he hopes to conclude the talks in the next few days. It’s unclear how the talks will move forward from here as Iran continues to increase its uranium enrichment and break commitments under the nuclear deal.\n\nFour killed during Shiite clashes in Iraq’s Basra\n\nClashes between rival Shiite groups killed four people in Iraq’s Basra on Thursday, as the fallout from the country’s worst political violence in years continues, Reuters reported. Basra is the main oil-producing city in Iraq and now violence has spread from Baghdad to the south.\n\nBackground: The violence began earlier this week in Baghdad when powerful Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr announced his resignation from political life. That move set off an intense round of political infighting between Iran-backed Shiite groups and al-Sadr’s supporters. Both sides have been trying to exert control since parliamentary elections in October 2021 saw Iran-backed blocs lose seats to Sadrists. Despite his win, al-Sadr failed to form a government amid opposition from his rivals.\n\nWhy it matters: The episode served as a reminder of the fragility of the government in Baghdad, which remained largely neutral in the crisis, as well as the competing players at home and abroad that seek to control the country’s politics.\n\nTurkish pop star could face up to 3 years in prison for joking about religious schools\n\nSinger Gulsen Bayraktar Colakoglu, known as Gulsen, could face a prison sentence of up to three years over comments made during a concert in April, according to a 48-page indictment. The Istanbul chief prosecutors office brought charges of “inciting the public to hatred and enmity,” the indictment said.\n\nBackground: Last week, Gulsen was jailed pending trial after a video circulating on social media showed her making a comment about religious schools in Turkey, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. During a concert in April, Gulsen said, “[He] graduated from Imam Hatip [religious schools.] That’s where his pervert side comes from,” referring to a person on stage. The singer denied the charge, saying it was a joke, and apologized to those offended by her remarks. She has since been released from custody but placed under house arrest. An Istanbul criminal court will assess the indictment and decide to accept or refuse it. If accepted, the hearings will start and Gulsen will be brought before court.\n\nWhy it matters: Gulsen has previously been targeted by Turkish conservative groups for her revealing stage outfits and support for the LGBTQ community. Her recent arrest sparked outrage and support from fans on social media. Some critics say it’s part of a move by Turkish officials to gain support from their religious and conservative base ahead of elections next year.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Adam Pourahmadi Abbas Al Lawati", "Adam Pourahmadi", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/06/02/diddy-trial-live-updates-day-18/83979375007/", "title": "Diddy trial recap: Mia says Diddy grabbed Cassie at Brad Pitt premiere", "text": "This page reflects the news from Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' trial on Monday, June 2. For the latest updates from Diddy's trial, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Tuesday, June 3.\n\nThis story contains graphic descriptions that some readers may find disturbing.\n\nAs Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex-crimes trial continues, his lawyers pushed back against sweeping abuse allegations and grilled the rapper's former assistant.\n\nThe woman, going by the pseudonym \"Mia,\" spent days last week telling jurors about his alleged physical and sexual abuse. But Combs' attorneys pressed her on warm text messages she sent in recent years and social media posts she shared about her former boss.\n\n\"I was still brainwashed,\" Mia explained on the stand in Manhattan court on June 2, saying she was \"constantly seeking\" Combs' approval.\n\nSimilar to other former employees, Mia has described a workplace dynamic in which Combs allegedly made repeated threats to maintain control. The ex-assistant, who worked for Combs from 2009-2017, also claims the Bad Boy Records founder sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions.\n\nDiddy on trial newsletter: Step inside the courtroom as music mogul faces sex-crimes charges.\n\nCombs, 55, was arrested in September 2024 and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMia talked to Cassie around the time she sued Diddy\n\nMia said she spoke to Cassie Ventura Fine, Combs' ex-girlfriend, around the time of her bombshell 2023 lawsuit, in which she accused Combs of sex trafficking and abuse. Mia never mentioned to Ventura Fine that Combs had also allegedly sexually assaulted her, she said.\n\n\"I was still deeply ashamed and wanted to die. I didn't want to tell anybody,\" she testified.\n\n\"Why did it take seven to eight months for you to tell the U.S. Attorney's Office about Sean Combs supposedly sexually assaulting you?\" Combs' defense attorney Brian Steel asked.\n\nIt is not uncommon for sexual assault survivors to wait some time before revealing their experiences to loved ones or law enforcement.\n\n'The worst thing I've ever had to talk about'\n\nMia's testimony turned emotional as she was asked whether she was able to speak about Combs allegedly assaulting her without looking down while she addressed the court. Mia said she couldn't: \"It’s the worst thing I've ever had to talk about in my life,\" she shared.\n\nMia was then asked why she chose to speak out now. She explained that she felt she couldn't help her loved ones, including her niece and goddaughters, if they were ever sexually assaulted and she had never raised her accusations against Combs.\n\nThe former assistant alleged during her testimony last week that the first time Combs sexually assaulted her was at the Plaza Hotel, when they were in New York City celebrating his 40th birthday in 2009.\n\nIn later years, Combs allegedly assaulted her several additional times, including at his Los Angeles home and on a private plane. Mia cried as she described the alleged attacks.\n\nDefense attorneys accuse Mia of 'MeToo money grab'\n\nSteel continued to ask Mia why she never told family or friends about the assaults. She said she had to be in constant communication with Combs 24/7, and even when she was away, \"I was never out of his grip.\"\n\n\"You joined the MeToo money grab against Mr. Combs, is that true?\" Steel added, asking whether she knew that Ventura Fine had received settlement money in her lawsuit against Combs. Mia said she was aware of the settlement, but she doesn't want to sue Combs for monetary gain.\n\n\"No, that is not my intention,\" she replied. He pressed, \"You want money from Mr. Combs based on your testimony, is that right?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mia said.\n\nMia describes R. Kelly 'nightmare' in texts to Diddy\n\nJurors saw texts from 2019, in which Mia wrote to Combs: \"I had a nightmare. I was trapped in an elevator with R. Kelly and you came to rescue me.\" Kelly, a fellow hip-hop artist, is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence after being convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering in 2022. Combs is currently facing both charges.\n\n\"Why are you reaching out to Mr. Combs, telling him this?\" Steel asked Mia, pressing her on why, if Combs allegedly terrorized her, she would write to him in such a way.\n\n\"Puff used to be my protector,\" she replied, adding that Combs, sometimes referred to as \"Puff Daddy,\" had recently lost longtime partner Kim Porter. \"Kim had just passed away, and I felt horrible for him,\" she said. Porter died in 2018 from pneumonia.\n\nNoting that the text came months after Porter's death, Steel said: \"It's five months later, and you are having thoughts that he's your savior, and you're sending him all the love in the world?\" She replied that she didn’t think five months was a long time frame, explaining that Combs would grieve Porter, with whom he shares four children, for a lifetime.\n\nMia says Diddy put tracking device on Cassie's car\n\nMia testified that Combs had stolen both her and Ventura Fine's devices on multiple occasions, and he put tracking devices on Ventura Fine's car. \"I'm not sure what he's capable of,\" she said.\n\nBut Steel quickly pressed Mia on an instance in which Ventura Fine had come to her, saying that Combs was acting \"jerky.\" Mia responded by saying his \"brain needed to be rewired,\" comparing him to a child throwing tantrums who needs his mother.\n\n\"Why would you stick up for Mr. Combs?\" Steel asked, but Mia denied wanting to defend her former boss.\n\n\"One of the worst parts\" of her job was being put in the middle of Ventura Fine and Combs’ relationship, she said, which Cassie has alleged was fraught with physical and sexual abuse. \"I wouldn’t lie to her about anything I wasn't forced to,\" she added.\n\nMia defends texting Combs about 'good times' together: 'I was still brainwashed'\n\nSteel questioned Mia about a friendly text message exchange with Combs from 2020, years after her employment with him ended.\n\nAt the time, Mia texted Combs that she had \"so many funny\" memories, as well as videos and notes on her phone depicting warm moments. Combs replied, \"I love it. Glad you're well,\" adding, \"I only remember the good times.\" Mia wrote back, \"Love you too, and the only things to remember are the good times, and those are the only ones I have.\"\n\nSteel asked Mia why she did not respond to Combs by saying, \"Well, I remember the bad times.\" Steel argued she should have told the rapper that he \"should remember what you did to me,\" in light of her violent allegations against him.\n\nBut Mia said on the stand, \"No, I would never respond that way.\" Steel shot back that this is \"because it’s not true,\" but Mia maintained that she has \"never lied in this courtroom, and I will never lie in this courtroom.\" She continued, \"I was still brainwashed,\" noting that she was \"constantly seeking\" Combs' approval.\n\nMia also testified that Combs \"threatened to tell Cassie everything,\" referring to Combs' allegedly sexually assaulting her. The former assistant said the threats \"made me feel like I had done something wrong. I can't explain what that does to a person.\"\n\nMia mourns Chadwick Boseman and other stars, recalls 'hilarious' moments with Jennifer Lopez in Diddy texts\n\nIn a May 14, 2020, text, Mia told Combs: \"Puff, my heart is broken about Dre,\" seemingly about the late Uptown Records founder Andre Harrell.\n\nIn a message from August 2020, Mia texted Combs, \"Thinking of you with Chadwick Boseman,\" following the actor's death. Mia said on the stand that Combs was \"auditioning for the role\" of James Brown in the \"Get On Up\" biopic that Boseman ended up playing, and she said she texted Combs saying that she had his audition tape and would send it to him.\n\nIn other texts to Combs, Mia went on to describe some of their \"magical, hilarious\" and \"hysterical\" memories together: One was of a night in Paris when Mick Jagger apparently flirted with her; another was of a night when Jennifer Lopez wouldn't stay out with them; yet another was of a high-stakes poker game between Combs and Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nIn the text message, she wrote that Combs said, while cursing: \"That 'Titanic' (guy) doesn't know (anything). He won $10,000, I won $650,000.\"\n\nMia says Diddy assaulted Cassie at Brad Pitt movie premiere at Cannes\n\nAs former assistant Mia's testimony continued on June 2, she alleged that in 2012, she witnessed a discussion between Combs and Ventura Fine escalate at the premiere of the Brad Pitt film \"Killing Them Softly,\" during the Cannes Film Festival in France.\n\nShe claimed she saw Combs grit his teeth while digging his nails into Ventura Fine's arm, and eventually insisted that Ventura Fine leave, which she did.\n\nEnrique Santos, others expected to testify in Diddy trial\n\nAs Combs' trial stretches into another week, several new names will take the stand.\n\nAmong the expected witnesses are Enrique Santos and Frank Piazza, whose connection to Combs remains unclear.\n\nTwo employees of the InterContinental Hotel, where video captured the music mogul assaulting Ventura Fine, are also expected to take the stand. Hotel security supervisor Eddie Garcia will testify under immunity, and hotel custodian Sylvia Okun is also expected to speak out.\n\nDiddy's lawyer Brian Steel presses Mia on loving social media posts\n\nDuring cross-examination on May 30, Steel showed Mia a number of old social media posts. One was a tribute for Combs' 45th birthday, where she wrote, \"Happy birthday, Puff Daddy. Thank you for being the good kind of crazy,\" adding that she loved him with all her heart. Steel remarked that this was five years after Combs first allegedly sexually assaulted her.\n\n\"When the highs were high and the goods were good, you tried so hard to stay in that,\" Mia said. Steel pressed her multiple times, saying, \"Haven't you said you've been sexually assaulted so many times that you can't even remember?\" Mia responded: \"I don't remember phrasing it that way.\"\n\n50 Cent says he'll reach out to Trump to prevent a Diddy pardon\n\n50 Cent is looking to give President Donald Trump his two cents about Combs. In an Instagram post on May 30, the \"In da Club\" rapper said he'll reach out to Trump after the president said he would \"look at the facts\" in Combs' case, suggesting a pardon could be on the table.\n\n50 Cent shared a clip of the president's comments in his post and wrote that Combs \"said some really bad things about Trump,\" adding that he will \"reach out so he knows how I feel about this guy.\"\n\nIn a follow-up post, 50 Cent suggested Combs' past comments about Trump could prevent a potential pardon. \"Donald doesn't take well to disrespect, and doesn't forget who chooses to go against him,\" he wrote. He also shared a screenshot of an article suggesting he was trying to \"nuke\" Combs' chances of pardon, clarifying, \"I didn't say I would nuke anything, I simply said I will make sure Trump is aware.\"\n\nDid Trump pardon Diddy?\n\nNo, despite recently handing down a flurry of pardons, including one for reality stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, Trump did not include Combs on that list. But that doesn't mean he can't. According to Michigan State law professor Brian Kalt, Trump would be within his presidential rights to extend a preemptive pardon to Combs.\n\n\"These are federal charges so that's the main limit,\" Kalt tells USA TODAY. \"The matter has (to) be federal, it has to be criminal vs. civil, and related to something that's already been done. But the person doesn't have to even be charged yet or convicted. The Supreme Court has said preemptive pardons are OK.\"\n\nWhen asked about a possible pardon during an Oval Office press conference on May 30, Trump said he hadn't been approached about the legal matter but added, \"I know people are thinking about it.\"\n\nWhat are the charges against Diddy?\n\nCombs is facing federal sex-crimes and trafficking charges in a sprawling lawsuit that has eroded his status as a power player and kingmaker in the entertainment industry.\n\nHe was arrested in September 2024 and later charged with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The rapper has pleaded not guilty to all five counts against him.\n\nWhat is racketeering?\n\nRacketeering is the participation in an illegal scheme under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Statute, or RICO, as a way for the U.S. government to prosecute organizations that contribute to criminal activity.\n\nUsing RICO law, which is typically aimed at targeting multi-person criminal organizations, prosecutors allege that Combs coerced victims, some of whom they say were sex workers, through intimidation and narcotics to participate in \"freak offs\" — sometimes dayslong sex performances that federal prosecutors allege they have video of.\n\nWhere can I watch the Diddy trial?\n\nThe trial will not be televised, as cameras are typically not allowed in federal criminal trial proceedings.\n\nUSA TODAY will be reporting live from the courtroom.

For the latest updates from Diddy's trial, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Friday, June 13.\n\nThis story contains graphic descriptions that some readers may find disturbing.\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs' ex-girlfriend described a violent 2024 fight between the couple as she testified in his sex-crimes trial for the last time, saying she'd punched the former hip-hop mogul and he'd allegedly held her in a chokehold until she couldn't breathe.\n\nThe woman, who is testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" returned to Manhattan court on June 12 to wrap up her cross-examination. She told the jury more details about a brutal altercation in which she threw candles at him and called him disgusting, and he allegedly kicked and choked her in response.\n\nWhile Jane admitted to the fight, she's denied some arguments from Combs' attorneys. That includes questions about whether she freely participated in, and even encouraged, alleged sexual performances during her on-and-off relationship with Combs.\n\nDiddy on trial newsletter: Step inside the courtroom as music mogul faces sex-crimes charges.\n\nOn June 11, Jane was asked to explain messages from the Grammy-winning rapper that appeared to give his then-girlfriend options when it came to their \"hotel nights,\" or sexual encounters Combs allegedly orchestrated between Jane and various sex workers.\n\n\"I was just adapting to my circumstances and my environment,\" and adjusting to \"the pressures of my lover,\" Jane told the court, responding to messages where she'd agreed to sex acts. \"I was going along with something I really didn't feel I could say no to.\"\n\n\"I resent him for all of it,\" she told Combs' attorney Teny Geragos.\n\nCombs, 55, was arrested in September and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nJane asks if $150,000 Diddy sent her is 'all I'm worth'\n\nDuring redirect, Geragos asked Jane about her financial stake in her testimony.\n\nJane confirmed she hadn't tried to solicit money from or sue Combs.\n\nGeragos asked, \"Did he wire you around $150,000 over three years?\" Jane retorted, \"Is that all I’m worth in three years?\"\n\nAfter Geragos asked, \"Did you want more than that?\" Jane replied, \"Does he think I’m worth more than that?\"\n\nJane sees texts between Diddy and an escort for the first time\n\nEarlier in the day, as more of Jane's and Combs' communications were read to the court, one message from the rapper, sent to a sex worker, indicated he was looking for someone to convince Jane to do a \"hotel night.\"\n\nAfter Jane had texted Combs to turn down a night of sex – \"I know what you want, baby, but I'm not really in the mood for that part. I don't want to make you mad,\" she wrote – Combs seemingly texted the male escort, \"Imma need you to persuade her. If she heard from you we're in.\"\n\nWhen Geragos asked Jane if seeing that message had made her upset, Jane replied, \"Wouldn't that make you upset?\"\n\n'How could you go to another man's freak-off?'\n\nGeragos again asked Jane about the events of June 18-19, 2024, when Combs was allegedly first violent toward his then-girlfriend. The witness was more explicit with her feelings about her encounter with an escort after their blowout fight.\n\nAfter the alleged violent altercation, Jane testified, Combs saw she'd been texting an adult entertainer called Anton. Combs allegedly invited him over to the Los Angeles home and instructed her to take ecstasy and perform sex acts with Anton, even though she said she didn't \"want to.\"\n\nJane recalled the days following the incident, saying, \"I was home recovering with a black eye after being forced to have sex with Anton.\" Geragos then clarified, \"But you didn't have intercourse, right?\"\n\n\"No, but that's a form of sex,\" Jane countered. \"Forced oral sex.\"\n\nThe morning after the alleged attacks and sex acts, Jane said, Combs confronted her about going to another rapper's birthday party in Las Vegas months earlier. \"How could you go to another man's freak off?\" said Combs allegedly angrily. But Jane told him nothing happened, that she was merely there with a friend.\n\nThrowing candles, pedophile accusations: Jane details violent fight with Diddy\n\nAs her cross-examination continued, Geragos asked Jane about the physical fight she and Combs had at her Los Angeles home in June 2024.\n\nJane testified that she had a \"weird feeling\" about him allegedly bringing a younger woman on a family trip at the time. As the couple argued, Jane said \"there was just a ball of emotions that night, just resentment for so many things.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it's weird to date someone who can't buy their own alcohol?\" Jane said she asked Combs as the fight brewed. At one point, when Combs bent down to tie his shoe, Jane admitted that she pushed the embattled record executive's head into the counter and threw a glass and two candles at him.\n\nWhile the candles didn't hit him, wax splattered on him. She also called him disgusting, a monster and a pedophile. Jane previously said on the stand that she now knows the woman in question was younger than her, but not a minor. Combs has not been formally accused of assaulting a child.\n\nAfter pushing Combs, Jane said she tried to lock herself in different rooms, but he kicked in the door each time. She was telling him to leave and that she hated him, and he allegedly kicked her in the leg. She fell, but Combs allegedly lifted her into a chokehold until she couldn't breathe.\n\nJane says Diddy accused her of trying to keep him away from his kids\n\nJane testified that she hid in her home after the altercation quieted for about two hours. Later, she recalled that Combs was outside on the street, and she yelled at him again. She punched him in the back of the head, and he allegedly punched her in the eye and the head.\n\nAfter she ran to the backyard of the home and curled into a ball on the grass, Jane testified that Combs punched and kicked her. During the altercation, Jane said he told her, \"You're trying to make sure I don't see\" his children. She responded, \"No I'm not,\" and \"leave me alone.\"\n\nThe fight seemingly occurred at the Los Angeles area home that Combs paid for – and still does to this very day. Combs is dad to stepson Quincy Brown and biological children Justin Combs, Christian Combs, Chance Combs, twins Jessie and D'Lila and youngest daughter Love.\n\nJane recalls flying on rapper's private jet to attend birthday party, him asking about her 'lifestyle'\n\nAs court proceedings continued, it became clear that an earlier disagreement between Combs' lawyers and prosecutors pertained to whether the defense could reveal the names of people who went to a birthday party Jane attended in Las Vegas in January 2024.\n\nJane later said that while she and Diddy were on a break from their relationship, she went with a friend on another rapper's private jet for the party. While they were there, Jane alleged she was once in a hotel room with seven or eight people watching while a sex worker she had previously interacted with, Anton, had sex with another woman on the bed.\n\nThe judge ruled that the defense could not reveal the names of the people at the party. When cross-examination resumed, defense attorney Geragos described this person as a very successful rapper at the top of the music industry, and an icon who was close with Combs and previously recorded with him.\n\nCombs did not know that Jane had been at the party until he later saw a message on her phone from Anton about their \"mutual friends.\"\n\nJane addresses 2016 video of Diddy assaulting Cassie\n\nAfter CNN published surveillance footage of Combs beating his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura Fine, at a Los Angeles hotel, Jane said she lost her appetite and was sick.\n\nShe said Combs had never laid a hand on her at that point in their relationship. \"That was just not the man that you knew?\" Geragos asked. \"Right,\" Jane said.\n\nJane's friends told her to break up with him amid the public outcry over the video, but Jane said she wanted to support Combs at the time. \"You felt this was another example of how complicated he was?\" Geragos said.\n\n\"Like in his past?\" Jane answered. \"Yes.\"\n\nJane says Combs called himself polyamorous before Cassie lawsuit\n\nIn the final hours of Jane's cross-examination, Combs' lawyers asked the anonymous witness about her relationship with the rapper after Ventura Fine filed a bombshell 2023 lawsuit accusing him of sweeping abuse.\n\nGeragos said Jane previously found Combs \"egotistical and cold,\" but \"you felt much more love from him\" after the lawsuit. He \"listened better,\" \"spent more time at the house\" and \"didn't disappear for days.\"\n\nJane agreed with all of these sentiments, responding \"yes\" and \"right\" to Geragos' comments.\n\nGeragos added that after Cassie's lawsuit, Combs changed the terminology of how he spoke about his relationship with Jane. While he used to say he was \"single and polyamorous,\" he started saying \"we're in a relationship and you're my girlfriend.\" Combs was \"more loving and made it seem more like a relationship,\" she said.\n\nOverall, \"I felt that I could assert myself a little bit more,\" Jane said on the stand. \"I felt we had some growth in our relationship.\"\n\nJane on the stand after long court delay over mysterious 'behind closed door' event\n\nJane finally took the stand on June 12 after a lengthy delay. In the morning, Judge Arun Subramanian called the defense, prosecution and Jane's lawyer into his chambers for a private meeting that lasted nearly two hours.\n\nAfterward, Combs' lawyer Marc Agnifolo addressed the court in cryptic terms, alluding to an event that happened \"behind closed doors\" in a hotel room in January 2024. \"Many other people were there,\" he said, adding that while the defense had agreed to the use of a pseudonym for Jane, they objected to some other names and events not being made \"fully public.\"\n\n\"Other people might have information about the event,\" Agnifolo said. \"The public can do what it does in all issues of importance.\"\n\nIt's not clear what Agnifilo meant, but remember that the public has provided some evidence in Combs' trial. For example, one of Combs' former assistants, who testified using the pseudonym Mia, made a birthday video for him, and it was provided and used in her cross-examination.\n\nThe defense may be trying to call on the public to potentially corroborate whatever this mystery event is.\n\nTeny Geragos, Nicole Westmoreland: Who are Diddy's lawyers? Meet Sean Combs' legal team amid sex trafficking trial\n\nA team of experienced lawyers is helping Combs defend himself against sex crimes charges.\n\nNicole Westmoreland of Westmoreland Law LLC, filed a notice of attorney appearance with the court last month.\n\nCombs' defense team was already being led by attorneys Agnifilo and Geragos. Agnifilo is a founding partner at Agnifilo Intrater and, according to the firm's website, has tried more than 200 cases in his 30-year career. He is a former Manhattan Assistant District Attorney.\n\nGeragos is also a founding partner at Agnifilo Intrater and is \"particularly experienced in defending and investigating allegations of sexual misconduct,\" according to the firm's website.\n\nProsecutors try to have juror removed over 'lack of candor'\n\nReports have emerged that the prosecution is moving to have a juror removed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey told Subramanian there \"appeared to be a lack of candor with the court\" from Juror No. 6, according to CNN and NBC News.\n\nAlexandra Shapiro from Combs' team reportedly accused the prosecution of trying to get a Black juror dismissed. Both sides are expected to file letters detailing their respective arguments. The issue was first brought to the judge's attention while court was in session on June 10.\n\nJane says she resents Diddy for 'freak offs'\n\nReviewing a text exchange between Jane and Combs ahead of their 2023 \"sobriety party\" — a \"hotel night\" at L'Ermitage Beverly Hills that allegedly lasted 12 to 18 hours and involved having sex with three escorts — Geragos asked whether she'd agreed to do this.\n\n\"Unfortunately, yes,\" Jane testified. Geragos replied, \"You keep saying 'Unfortunately', but didn't you agree to it?\" to which Jane clarified, \"I resent him for knowing how much I loved him and knowing I couldn't say no to him.\"\n\nAsked whether she regrets doing that \"freak off,\" Jane said, \"I believe resent and regret lie in the same feelings.\"\n\nJane says Diddy took Yung Miami on a trip after she was allegedly 'made to have sex with three men'\n\nJane told the court she was jealous of Yung Miami, a rapper Combs started dating around the same time he was seeing Jane.\n\nShe said Combs took Yung Miami on her \"dream vacation\" to Turks and Caicos, days after Jane had spent her birthday having an alleged \"freak off.\"\n\n\"I think after being made to have sex with three men on my birthday,\" it was \"very hurtful\" to see him taking a \"beautiful\" trip with another woman, Jane said. \"I was extremely heartbroken.\"\n\nIn a message Jane read aloud in court, she alleged she was forced to participate in the sexual performance. \"I didn't wanna do all that on my birthday. I was tired and put on a good face,\" she said.\n\nJane says escort named Sly Williams threatened to sell sex tape\n\nJane previously testified that she recruited sex worker Sly Williams to join their alleged hotel nights after watching him in adult films.\n\nDuring the June 10 hearing, she explained that she and Combs watched Williams on a pornography site in October 2021. When Jane messaged Williams, Combs was \"surprised and really happy because he had never had a girl pick the guy before,\" she said. Jane also found another sex worker named Anton through the same site.\n\nShe alleged Williams later threatened to sell a tape of the two of them having sex and extorted her not to release it. Jane said Combs was \"livid\" and told her to call the police, but she didn't out of fear.\n\nNo, Eddie Murphy did not testify in the Diddy trial\n\nDespite videos circulating online, which appear to show artificially generated court sketches of Eddie Murphy testifying at the Combs trial, the actor hasn't been in the courtroom and isn't expected to be called as a witness.\n\nThe same goes for members of the Kardashian family – who have been publicly friendly with Combs but aren't expected to be called into the courtroom.\n\nWhile a specter of celebrity hangs heavy over the proceedings, many of the big names roped in have merely been name-drops from the standby lesser-known witnesses from Combs' inner circle.\n\nThe only true \"celebrities\" to testify thus far have been Ventura Fine and Kid Cudi. Ventura Fine alleged that Combs physically, sexually and psychologically abused her for years of their relationship.\n\nKid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, old the court that Combs allegedly broke into his home and locked his dog in a bathroom when he found out his fellow rapper was dating Ventura Fine. He also alleged Combs was behind an explosion that destroyed his car around the same time.\n\nHave Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio come up in Diddy's trial?\n\nYou may have seen major celebs like Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio named during Combs' trial. But the A-list actors aren't accused of anything — they've only been mentioned in the background of events Combs attended.\n\nFor example, trial witness \"Mia\" alleged that she witnessed a 2012 discussion between Combs and Ventura Fine escalate at the premiere of a Pitt film during the Cannes Film Festival in France. She claimed she saw Combs grit his teeth while digging his nails into Ventura Fine's arm, and he eventually insisted that Ventura Fine leave.\n\nMia also referenced a high-stakes poker game between Combs and DiCaprio in texts she sent him around 2020. In one message, she wrote that Combs said, while cursing: \"That 'Titanic' (guy) doesn't know (anything). He won $10,000, I won $650,000.\"\n\nWhat is Diddy on trial for?\n\nCombs is facing federal sex-crimes and trafficking charges in a sprawling case that has eroded his status as a power player and kingmaker in the entertainment industry.\n\nHe was arrested in September 2024 and later charged with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The rapper has pleaded not guilty to the five counts against him.\n\nWhat is racketeering? Meaning of RICO charges\n\nRacketeering is the participation in an illegal scheme under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Statute, or RICO, as a way for the U.S. government to prosecute organizations that contribute to criminal activity.\n\nUsing RICO law, which is typically aimed at targeting multi-person criminal organizations, prosecutors allege that Combs coerced victims, some of whom they say were sex workers, through intimidation and narcotics to participate in \"freak offs\" — sometimes dayslong sex performances that federal prosecutors allege they have video of.\n\nHow to stream the Diddy trial\n\nThe trial will not be televised, as cameras are typically not allowed in federal criminal trial proceedings.\n\nUSA TODAY will be reporting live from the courtroom.

For the latest updates from Diddy's trial, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Thursday, June 12.\n\nThis story contains graphic descriptions that some readers may find disturbing.\n\nAttorneys for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs returned to the courtroom June 11 to elicit testimony from his ex-lover, \"Jane,\" that indicates she'd freely participated in, and even encouraged, the sexual performances for Combs that she'd previously said made her feel \"disgusted with myself.\"\n\nOn the fifth day of testimony for Jane, who's testifying under a pseudonym, was again cross-examined by Combs' lawyer, Teny Geragos. Jane explained messages from the Grammy-winning rapper that appeared to give his then-girlfriend options when it came to their \"hotel nights,\" or sexual performances Combs allegedly orchestrated between Jane and various sex workers.\n\nBut Jane has repeatedly testified she didn't feel she had a choice but to do what she knew would make Combs happy if she wanted to keep their relationship alive.\n\n\"I was just adapting to my circumstances and my environment,\" and adjusting to \"the pressures of my lover,\" Jane told the court, responding to messages where she'd agreed to sex acts. \"I was going along with something I really didn’t feel I could say no to.\"\n\nDiddy on trial newsletter: Step inside the courtroom as music mogul faces sex-crimes charges.\n\nThe online content creator, who previously said she still loves Combs to this day, admitted she also harbors negative feelings: \"I resent him for all of it,\" she told Geragos.\n\nThe testimony comes after Jane confirmed that when she moved homes in April 2023, Combs paid approximately $40,000 to cover rent and other costs. When Geragos asked Jane if she believed Combs would stop paying her rent, she alleged he used the payments as a control tactic.\n\nOn June 11, the possibility of a shake-up within the 12-person jury arose as prosecutors reportedly asked Judge Arun Subramanian to oust one of the jurors.\n\nCombs, 55, was arrested in September and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nDiddy trial is still on track to finish around July 4\n\nBefore jurors were dismissed for the day, the prosecution and defense discussed the upcoming schedule.\n\nProsecutors expect to rest their case, or finish going through their witnesses, by Friday, June 20 – or June 18 at the earliest. The defense doesn't yet know how long their witnesses will take once it's their turn to present their case on Combs' behalf.\n\nJane cries as her texts are read aloud: 'My friend, my lover, my boyfriend'\n\nAs Geragos presented more texts between Jane and Combs from 2023, the witness was visibly emotional and started crying on the stand.\n\n\"The feeling you are the reason for my child’s joy\" means more than she could explain, one of Jane's messages read. She'd added, \"You are my friend, my lover, my boyfriend – even though you don’t like that word – LOL but you are LOL.\"\n\nIt was during the reading of this message that Jane began crying, with Geragos going on to read more of Jane's texts that expressed her affection for the music mogul.\n\nJane confirms Diddy called Cassie Ventura Fine 'one of his greatest loves'\n\nAt one point, Geragos asked Jane whether Combs ever talked about his former longtime partner, Cassie Ventura Fine. Jane replied, \"Here and there.\"\n\nGeragos then asked Jane whether she remembers Combs calling Ventura Fine \"one of his greatest loves\" and also writing Ventura Fine love letters while he was high. Jane replied \"yes\" to both questions.\n\nJane mentioned that Gina and Combs \"constantly had a lot of problems\" – \"a lot of public problems,\" she added – and that it caused Combs a lot of stress.\n\nGeragos asked, \"‘Hotel nights’ really put him at peace?\" Jane replied, \"Yes.\" Geragos then asked, \"That’s part of why you did them with him? To bring him that peace?\"\n\n\"Yes, Jane replied.\n\nJane: 'I resent' Diddy\n\nReviewing a text exchange between Jane and Combs ahead of their 2023 \"sobriety party\" – a \"hotel night\" at L'Ermitage Beverly Hills that allegedly lasted 12 to 18 hours and involved having sex with three escorts – Geragos asked whether she'd agreed to do this.\n\n\"Unfortunately, yes,\" Jane testified. Geragos replied, \"You keep saying 'Unfortunately', but didn't you agree to it?\"\n\nJane clarified, \"I resent him for knowing how much I loved him and knowing I couldn’t say no to him.\" She added, \"I resent him for all of it.\"\n\nAsked whether she regrets doing that freak-off, Jane said, “I believe resent and regret lie in the same feelings.”\n\nJane says Diddy took Yung Miami on a trip after she was allegedly 'made to have sex with three men'\n\nJane told the court she was jealous of Yung Miami, a rapper Combs started dating around the same time he was seeing Jane.\n\nShe said Combs took Yung Miami on her \"dream vacation\" to Turks and Caicos, days after Jane had spent her birthday having an alleged freak-off.\n\n\"I think after being made to have sex with three men on my birthday,\" it was \"very hurtful\" to see him taking a \"beautiful\" trip with another woman, Jane said. \"I was extremely heartbroken.\"\n\nIn a message Jane read aloud in court, she alleged she was forced to participate in the sexual performance.\n\n\"I didn’t wanna do all that on my birthday. I was tired and put on a good face,\" she said.\n\nJane was responding to 'the pressures of my lover' throughout the relationship\n\nGeragos continued to press Jane for testimony about the time she spent with Combs outside of the alleged freak-offs at \"hotel nights.\"\n\nAfter the defense pulled up text threads in which Combs appeared to give Jane a choice of escorts – or ask whether she even wanted to have a \"hotel night\" – Jane indicated her actions were still not entirely voluntary.\n\n\"I was just adapting to my circumstances and my environment,\" and adjusting to \"the pressures of my lover,\" Jane said. \"I was going along with something I really didn’t feel I could say no to.\"\n\nWhen reminded by Geragos that Combs had gifted her a bracelet and necklace from the luxury brand Van Cleef & Arpels for her 2023 birthday in Miami, Jane claimed she’d do things to earn Combs’ favor.\n\n\"I’m receiving my gift, I’ve taken a pill and I’m waiting for the entertainer,\" Jane said. \"Any type of affection at this point in my life that I get from Sean, I welcome with open arms.\"\n\nDiddy rarely took their relationship beyond alleged freak-offs at hotels\n\nJane testified that she tried to take their relationship outside of alleged escapades with escorts.\n\nIn 2023, during their stop in Miami for a make-up birthday trip for Jane, she recalled Combs made a dinner reservation at the Japanese restaurant Nobu. It was \"conveniently\" downstairs from the room where they were staying.\n\n\"I asked if he can please romance me outside of hotel rooms,\" Jane said on the stand. She asked him to consider other swanky restaurants like Carbone or Papi Steak, but he insisted on Nobu.\n\n\"Papi Steak is a good restaurant, right?\" Geragos asked. \"I wouldn’t know,\" Jane said flatly. \"I’m sure it is.\"\n\nProsecutors try to have juror removed over 'lack of candor'\n\nReports have emerged that the prosecution is moving to have a juror removed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey told Judge Arun Subramanian there \"appeared to be a lack of candor with the court\" from Juror No. 6, according to CNN and NBC News.\n\nAlexandra Shapiro from Combs' team reportedly accused the prosecution of trying to get a Black juror dismissed. Both sides are expected to file letters detailing their respective arguments.\n\nThe issue was first brought to the judge's attention while court was in session on June 10.\n\nKevin Hart roasts Diddy at BET Awards\n\nBET Awards host Kevin Hart alluded to the music mogul during his opening monologue as he joked about why the show was happening on a Monday night. Hart called for \"no afterparties\" on a work night and said those are were things get \"slippery, at them god damn afterparties.\"\n\nAfter dropping the reference to Combs' propensity for baby oil, Hart added, \"We're learning a lot about people, ain't we?\"\n\nWhat's a Bottega bag? Jane's cross-examination turns tense\n\nAs Combs' lawyers have questioned Jane in recent days, their cross-examination has been markedly different from Mia's cross-examination, even borderline friendly. Mia was the first woman who testified using a pseudonym in Combs' trial and also alleged sweeping abuse.\n\nTo note, Jane met with Combs' attorneys prior to the trial starting, as recently as April.\n\nHowever, Jane's testimony did turn sharp at one point, when she shared she felt Combs gave other women more gifts and quality time during their relationships.\n\nCombs' lawyer, Geragos, asked Jane how much a purse from the luxury brand Bottega Veneta costs – an apparent reference to the thousands of dollars Combs gave Jane during their relationship – and Jane shot back \"How much does my body cost?\"\n\n50 Cent says he'll reach out to Trump to prevent a Diddy pardon\n\n50 Cent is looking to give President Donald Trump his two cents about Combs. In an Instagram post on May 30, the \"In da Club\" emcee said he would reach out to Trump after the president said he would \"look at the facts\" in Combs' case, suggesting a pardon could be on the table.\n\nThe rapper shared a clip of the president's comments in his post and wrote that Combs \"said some really bad things about Trump,\" adding that he will \"reach out so he knows how I feel about this guy.\"\n\nTeny Geragos, Nicole Westmoreland: Who are Diddy's lawyers? Meet Sean Combs' legal team amid sex trafficking trial\n\nA team of experienced lawyers is helping Combs defend himself against sex crimes charges.\n\nNicole Westmoreland of Westmoreland Law LLC, filed a notice of attorney appearance with the court last month.\n\nCombs' defense team was already being led by attorneys Marc Agnifilo and Geragos. Agnifilo is a founding partner at Agnifilo Intrater and, according to the firm's website, has tried more than 200 cases in his 30-year career. He is a former Manhattan Assistant District Attorney.\n\nGeragos is also a founding partner at Agnifilo Intrater and is \"particularly experienced in defending and investigating allegations of sexual misconduct,\" according to the firm's website.\n\nNo, Eddie Murphy did not testify in the Diddy trial\n\nDespite videos circulating online, which appear to show artificially generated court sketches of Eddie Murphy testifying at the Combs trial, the actor hasn't been in the courtroom and isn't expected to be called as a witness.\n\nWhile a specter of celebrity hangs heavy over the proceedings, many of the big names roped in have merely been name-drops from the stand by lesser-known witnesses from Combs’ inner circle.\n\nThe only true \"celebrities\" to testify thus far have been Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura Fine and Kid Cudi.\n\nHave Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio come up in Diddy's trial?\n\nYou may have seen major celebs like Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio named during Combs' trial.

I wanted to see my lover, so I was accepting that.\"\n\nJane says escort named Sly Williams threatened to sell sex tape\n\nJane previously testified that she recruited sex worker Sly Williams to join their alleged hotel nights after watching him in adult films.\n\nDuring the June 10 hearing, she explained that she and Combs watched Williams on a pornography site in October 2021.

Jane said Combs was \"livid\" and told her to call the police, but she didn't out of fear.\n\nJane says she and Diddy used Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal nicknames\n\nOn June 10, Jane said she, Combs and one of the escorts they allegedly hired used the nickname \"trifecta\" when they had sex.\n\nJane claimed she was Kobe Bryant; Paul, the entertainer, was Shaquille O'Neal; and Combs was Michael Jordan. Jane said she frequently called Paul, the escort, her \"boyfriend\" and called Paul and Combs her \"boys.\"\n\nJane says she became concerned Diddy was addicted to drugs\n\nWhile being cross-examined on June 10, Jane said she became worried Combs was struggling with substance use early in their relationship while they were on a trip to Turks and Caicos. She said Combs' eyes were jaundiced, his gums were gray from alleged drug use and his hands were shaking from what she believed was alcohol withdrawal.\n\nJane said she suggested they go to Thailand, where there was a facility with a 30-day program, to which Combs allegedly responded, \"What the hell, you think I need rehab?\"\n\n\"I felt that I encountered somebody that was overdoing the partying,\" Jane said, adding she would now call Combs a drug addict. She said she wanted \"him to get back to his natural form and natural state.\"\n\nJudge denies Combs' lawyers' push for another mistrial over Bongolan testimony\n\nCombs' attorneys have once again had their push for a mistrial in his sex-crimes case denied.\n\nThe embattled music mogul's legal team's latest request for a mistrial has been rejected by Judge Arun Subramanian. Combs' lawyers had renewed a motion for a mistrial due to alleged prosecutorial misconduct in a letter to the judge dated June 7.\n\nCombs' lawyers' latest push for a mistrial centered around testimony from Bryana \"Bana\" Bongolan, a friend of Ventura Fine. Bongolan testified about an incident where Combs allegedly held her up on a balcony in Ventura Fine's Los Angeles apartment in September 2016.\n\nWhat is Diddy on trial for?\n\nCombs is facing federal sex-crimes and trafficking charges in a sprawling case that has eroded his status as a power player and kingmaker in the entertainment industry.\n\nHe was arrested in September 2024 and later charged with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.

The men believed participating in the events would lead to modeling opportunities and further their careers.\n\n“To anyone who thinks they can exploit and coerce others by using this so-called casting couch system this case should serve as a warning, prepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison,” Peace said.\n\nBrian Bieber, Jeffries' attorney said in a statement to USA TODAY that they will respond to the allegations \"after the Indictment is unsealed, and when appropriate, but plan to do so in the courthouse – not the media.\"\n\nLegal representation for Jeffries, 80, has previously \"vehemently denied\" any wrongdoing, according to the BBC.\n\nAbercrombie said last year it was \"appalled and disgusted\" and hired a law firm to investigate allegations in a BBC report that Jeffries recruited young men for sex. The company declined to comment on Jeffries' arrest and did not immediately respond to questions about the status of the independent investigation into the allegations against him.\n\nJeffries and Smith appeared in federal court in West Palm Beach on Tuesday and face extradition to the Eastern District of New York. U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart apprised them of the charges and potential penalties they face.\n\nPer an agreement between federal prosecutors and Jeffries’ attorneys, Reinhart set Jeffries' bond at $10 million, secured by a New York property he owns with his wife, Susan Hansen Jeffries. The bond secured, Jeffries will remain under house arrest in his property in Palm Beach. The judge ordered Jeffries to wear a GPS monitor and limit his travel strictly to South Florida and eastern New York.\n\nProsecutors made no such bond agreement with Smith, referred to once during the hearing as Jeffries’ “life partner.” Reinhart instead ordered Smith to remain in custody, a decision the judge said can be revisited later by attorneys in New York. Neither Smith nor his lawyers objected. Peace noted at his news conference that Smith is a dual citizen of the United States and the United Kingdom, making the risk of flight \"particularly acute\" with him.\n\nJacobson, who was taken into custody in Minnesota, was released on a $500,000 bond. Jacobson also will be arraigned in New York on Friday.\n\nIf convicted of the sex trafficking charge, the defendants each face a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, according to a John Marzulli, a spokesperson for Peace's office. The interstate prostitution charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment.\n\nJeffries sex trafficked men around the world, indictment alleges\n\nPeace said the indictment alleges in graphic and disturbing detail that while Jeffries was CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch he used “his power, his wealth and his influence to traffic men for his own sexual pleasure and that of his romantic partner, Smith.” The 16-count indictment lays out a sprawling investigation and charges the three defendants with exploiting young men in New York City, the Hamptons and at hotels around the world, including in England, France, Italy, Morocco and St. Barts.\n\nJeffries and Smith employed Jacobson as a “recruiter” to find men and pay them to engage in sex acts, Peace said. Smith would personally select men to be flown to the couple’s homes or hotels “to engage in commercial sex,” Peace said.\n\nHeterosexual men were intentionally recruited, some of whom had previously worked for Abercrombie, according to the indictment. The indictment alleges the defendants tricked some of the men into believing they were meeting Jeffries and Smith for the purpose of receiving a modeling opportunity with Abercrombie.\n\n\"Many of the victims, at least one of whom was as young as 19 years old, were financially vulnerable and aspired to become models in the fashion industry, a notoriously cutthroat world,\" the indictment said.\n\nPeace said there was no indication that Jeffries used Abercrombie resources for his alleged crimes and the incidents did not occur on company grounds.\n\nThe defendants allegedly employed a “secret staff” to operate events where victims would be supplied with drugs and alcohol and coerced into sexual activity. The staff allegedly helped keep the events secret by ensuring the men handed over their phones and signed nondisclosure agreements.\n\nPeace said they led the men to believe not complying with their demands would hurt their careers, and when they did not or could not consent, Jeffries and Smith would forcefully subject them to violent sexual contact.\n\nPeace said the illegal operation lasted from at least from 2008 to 2015 and required millions of dollars to support its massive infrastructure and maintain secrecy. In addition to paying the men for sex, they allegedly spent prolific amounts on the staff to run it.\n\nThough only 15 men are identified in the indictment as John Does, Peace said prosecutors believe “dozens and dozens” of victims were involved. He thanked the victims for coming forward and encouraged any others to contact the FBI.\n\n“Prosecutions like this are really impossible without the bravery of victims who are willing to report what happened to them to law enforcement,” Peace said.\n\nJeffries, Abercrombie also facing lawsuit\n\nThe news comes after a group of once-aspiring Abercrombie & Fitch male models filed a class-action lawsuit last year against Jeffries and Abercrombie alleging the retailer looked the other way while Jeffries ran a sex-trafficking ring and sexually assaulted numerous young men.\n\nBrad Edwards, an attorney who represents the men in the case, said \"all four of the defendants, including Abercrombie and Fitch, have tried everything possible to delay our lawsuit from proceeding, presumably because they knew it would lead to criminal arrests.\"\n\nThe proposed class action filed by former model David Bradberry in Manhattan federal court claims Jeffries forced models to take drugs and engage in sexual acts with him and others for the chance to be featured in Abercrombie's provocative catalogs. The lawsuit alleged that company officers knew about the conduct and Abercrombie paid settlements to people who accused Jeffries of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\n\"In exchange for providing the position of power and unfettered access to corporate funds necessary for Jeffries to sexually terrorize aspiring male models, Abercrombie knowingly and intentionally benefited and received things of value from Jeffries and his sex-trafficking operation, including the value Jeffries himself brought to the brand,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nBrittany Henderson, another attorney representing some of the aspiring models, called Tuesday's arrests \"monumental\" in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\n\"Their fight for justice does not end here,\" Henderson said. \"In addition to supporting the criminal prosecution, our clients look forward to holding Abercrombie and Fitch liable for facilitating this terrible conduct and ensuring that this cannot happen again.\"\n\nLate last year, Jeffries sued his former employer because it refused to cover his costs from the lawsuit. A judge earlier this year ruled that the allegations were tied to Jeffries' corporate role and the retailer must cover the cost of his legal defense, the BBC reported.\n\nWho is Michael Jeffries?\n\nJeffries became president and CEO of Abercrombie in 1992 when the small, money-losing chain formerly known for selling sporting equipment and clothes was part of Leslie H. Wexner's retail empire called The Limited at the time. Jeffries became chairman in 1996 and The Limited spun off the chain into an independent company in 1998.\n\nJeffries was credited with turning around the retailer into a successful teen apparel maker known for its cologne-filled stores and ads featuring semi-nude models. Jeffries became one of the highest paid CEOs in the U.S., earning a pay package estimated at more than $140 million at one point.\n\nBut the company stirred up controversy under his leadership.\n\nAbercrombie produced a hybrid magazine-catalog with partially nude models that featured articles such as \"Drinking 101,\" made T-shirts with phrases that insulted various groups, and went years without selling larger-size clothes as a way to cultivate an image.\n\nAn age-discrimination lawsuit in 2012 revealed the existence of an aircraft-standards manual dictating how the models and actors serving Jeffries on the company jet were to dress and behave. The men were to be clean-shaven and wear boxer briefs, flip-flops and a spritz of the chain’s signature cologne.\n\nHe abruptly retired in 2014 at the age of 70, after seemingly losing his touch with the retailer's teen audience amid several years of weakening sales.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/23/stay-home-orders-spiking-numbers-liquor-boom-news-around-states/111459836/", "title": "Stay-at-home orders, spiking numbers: News from around our 50 ..."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/06/10/diddy-trial-live-updates-day-24/84122720007/", "title": "Diddy trial recap: 'Jane' on Sean Combs as a 'cuck,' Bottega bags", "text": "This page reflects the news from Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' trial on Tuesday, June 10. For the latest updates from Diddy's trial, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Wednesday, June 11.\n\nThis story contains graphic descriptions that some readers may find disturbing.\n\nA former girlfriend of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs said she felt pressured to please the hip-hop mogul through means that included demeaning sexual performances, even as his lawyers encouraged her to describe the loving and vulnerable moments during their nearly four-year relationship.\n\nCombs' federal trial resumed in Manhattan court on June 10 with the rapper's attorneys cross-examining a woman testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane.\" They asked her about money Combs gave her, warm moments between the couple and the alleged \"hotel nights\" they held with male escorts.\n\nWhile Combs' lawyers showed explicit messages Jane sent fantasizing about the sex acts, she told the jury she \"resented\" Combs \"for leading me into the lifestyle.\"\n\n\"I felt pressured to perform these things my lover desired,\" Jane told jurors. Her testimony comes after she alleged her ex-boyfriend physically, sexually and psychologically abused her during their on-and-off relationship.\n\nCombs, 55, was arrested in September and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nDiddy lawyers try to paint Jane as willing participant in alleged sex performances\n\nDuring their cross-examination, Combs' lawyers asked Jane about times she appeared to willingly participate in hotel nights and other alleged sexual performances.\n\nIn one text exchange, Jane offered up her house for a \"freak off\" because she wanted to \"spend time with my favorite person.\" In response, Combs offered for him and Paul, an escort, to \"stop by.\"\n\nOn the stand, Jane said she wanted alone time with Combs, but \"that's the only option I was given. I wanted to see my lover, so I was accepting that.\"\n\nJane continued to read several explicit texts between her and Combs. In one message, Combs suggested that \"we don't have to go crazy for the rest of the year. Let's switch it up.\" Jane responded, \"I'll believe it when I see it,\" before telling him, \"I don't mind it.\"\n\nOn the stand, Jane testified that there was an undertone of rejection to some of Combs' texts, making her feel insecure. She said she suggested freak offs to make him feel better. \"I know my partner and what he likes,\" Jane explained.\n\nJane says Sly Williams threatened to sell sex tape\n\nJane previously testified that she recruited sex worker Sly Williams to join their alleged hotel nights after watching him in adult films.\n\nShe explained that she and Combs watched Williams on a pornography site in October 2021. When Jane messaged Williams, Combs was \"surprised and really happy because he had never had a girl pick the guy before,\" she said. Jane also found another sex worker named Anton through the same site.\n\nShe alleged Williams later threatened to sell a tape of the two of them having sex and extorted her not to release it. Jane said Combs was \"livid\" and told her to call the police, but she didn't out of fear.\n\nWhat is a cuckold? Jane said she researched the term\n\nCombs' attorney Teny Geragos asked Jane about a time in 2022 when she researched a lifestyle she believed fit her and Combs' situation.\n\n\"I came upon a word because I was trying to figure out my relationship, that was called a cuckolder: a man who was turned on by watching his woman having sex with another man,\" Jane said on the stand.\n\nJane added when she read that definition, she thought \"that was spot on.\" She explained that she found two possible reasons for this: \"The cuck derives pleasure from seeing his woman receive pleasure from another man,\" Jane said, or they could be curious about bisexuality but ashamed to express themselves.\n\nCombs has not publicly defined his sexual preferences, and experts prescribe different definitions and motivations for cuckolding. U.S. attorneys say he engaged in sex trafficking and transported sex workers for the purpose of prostitution.\n\nJane says she and Combs used Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal nicknames\n\nJane said she, Combs and one of the escorts they allegedly hired used the nickname \"trifecta\" when they had sex.\n\nJane claimed she was Kobe Bryant; Paul, the entertainer, was Shaquille O'Neal; and Combs was Michael Jordan. Jane said she frequently called Paul, the escort, her \"boyfriend\" and called Paul and Combs her \"boys.\"\n\nKevin Hart roasts Diddy at BET Awards\n\nBET Awards host Kevin Hart alluded to the music mogul during his opening monologue as he joked about why the show was happening on a Monday night. Hart called for \"no afterparties\" on a work night and said those are were things get \"slippery, at them god damn afterparties.\" After dropping the reference to Combs' propensity for baby oil, Hart added, \"We're learning a lot about people, ain't we?\"\n\nHave Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio come up in Diddy's trial?\n\nYou may have seen major celebs like Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio named during Combs' trial. But the A-list actors aren't accused of anything − they've only been mentioned in the background of events Combs attended.\n\nFor example, a former assistant identified as Mia alleged that she witnessed a 2012 discussion between Combs and Cassie Ventura Fine escalate at the premiere of a Pitt film during the Cannes Film Festival in France.\n\nShe claimed she saw Combs grit his teeth while digging his nails into Ventura Fine's arm, and he eventually insisted that Ventura Fine leave.\n\nMia also referenced a high-stakes poker game between Combs and DiCaprio in texts she sent him around 2020.\n\nIn one message, she wrote that Combs said, while cursing: \"That 'Titanic' (guy) doesn't know (anything). He won $10,000, I won $650,000.\"\n\nJane says she became concerned Diddy was addicted to drugs\n\nJane said she became worried Combs was struggling with substance use early in their relationship while they were on a trip to Turks and Caicos. She said Combs’ eyes were jaundiced, his gums were gray from alleged drug use and his hands were shaking from what she believed was alcohol withdrawal.\n\nJane said she suggested they go to Thailand, where there was a facility with a 30-day program, to which Combs allegedly responded, \"What the hell, you think I need rehab?\"\n\n\"I felt that I encountered somebody that was overdoing the partying,\" Jane said, adding she would now call Combs a drug addict. She said she wanted \"him to get back to his natural form and natural state.\"\n\nJane described jealousy over Yung Miami relationship, told Combs 'I'm not Cassie, and I'll make your life hell'\n\nIn a text sent toward the end of their relationship that was shown in court, Jane wrote to Combs: \"I'm not Cassie, and I'll make your life hell.\"\n\n\"I had hit my wall and I was depressed over these nights,\" she said on the stand, referring to the alleged sexual performances Combs and Jane had with male escorts.\n\nJane also discussed Combs' relationship with rapper Yung Miami, whom he started dating about a year after he started seeing Jane.\n\n\"What was hard for me was the imbalance in treatment,\" she said, describing what publicly looked like a monogamous relationship with Yung Miami. \"That was hard to watch,\" she said. \"I didn't sign up to date a man that was in a public relationship.\"\n\nJane's cross-examination has different tone\n\nIn Jane's cross-examination, Combs' lawyer Geragos has argued the witness voluntarily participated in her relationship with the rapper.\n\nFor example, Jane had a rule for the alleged escorts they hired that they couldn't use drugs, and three different entertainers were eventually dismissed because she wasn't attracted to them.\n\nBut even as Combs' lawyers have questioned Jane, keep in mind that the cross-examination has been markedly different from Mia's cross-examination, even borderline friendly. Mia was the first woman who testified using a pseudonym in Combs' trial and also alleged sweeping abuse.\n\nTo note, Jane met with Combs' attorneys prior to the trial starting, as recently as April.\n\nJane's testimony did turn sharp at one point, when she shared she felt Combs gave other women more gifts and quality time during their relationships.\n\nGeragos asked Jane how much a bag from the brand Bottega costs – an apparent reference to the thousands of dollars Combs gave Jane during their relationship – and Jane shot back \"How much does my body cost?\"\n\nCombs' balked at Jane's OnlyFans account\n\nJane, who previously revealed she had a successful OnlyFans account, said Combs didn't want her to share content on the paid platform because he didn't want her to be part of something some view as taboo.\n\nBut she still joined in 2024, telling jurors \"I joined it because it was something I needed. If I could get off of it, I would.\" Jane again referred to her work and income slowing while she was in a relationship with Combs.\n\nCombs called Jane 'crack pipe' as a nickname\n\nOne curious moment stood out to reporters in Jane's cross-examination: The court heard a voice note from Combs to Jane after a trip they took to Turks and Caicos in 2023.\n\nCombs can be heard saying \"You are the crack pipe. That's my new name for you: crack pipe,\" and then making kissing noises. Combs' lawyers asked if the nickname was a reference to him \"being addicted to you,\" and Jane said it was a sexual reference.\n\nJane says she only made 10% of her earning potential during relationship with Combs – but he wired her over $150,000\n\nJane and Combs' finances have taken center stage during her cross-examination. Jane told the court that she was making money from influencing online, but she felt she couldn't devote time to her career online once they started dating.\n\nShe said she didn't typically ask her then-boyfriend for money, but she estimated he wired her more than $150,000 over the course of their relationship.\n\n\"I never really counted, but I would assume yeah, that would be close,\" Jane said, explaining that she felt she only met about 10% of her potential earnings through influencing during their relationship.\n\nThat's not the only money Jane addressed on the stand. Jane said Combs invested about $20,000 in a fashion line she started, centered around dresses and swimwear.\n\nShe also confirmed that when she moved into a rental home in April 2023, Combs paid approximately $40,000 to cover the security deposit and rent for her first and last month.\n\nWhen Combs' lawyer, Geragos, asked Jane if she believed Combs would stop paying her rent, she alleged he used the payments as a control tactic.\n\n\"There were some times that I definitely felt that he would do that,\" Jane said. \"And he used it kind of as a little tool. The rent was always just like a little reminder.\"\n\nDiddy accuser Jane suggests she isn't testifying 'against him'\n\nGeragos confirmed that Jane received immunity from prosecutors in exchange for testifying.\n\nThe lawyer also questioned why Combs is still paying for Jane's lawyer even though she was \"testifying against\" him. But Jane paused when Geragos said that before the jury, looking confused and asking \"against him?\"\n\nJane says Diddy 'would uplift me,' spoke with her about religion\n\nAs Combs' lawyers continued to focus on the positive times between Jane and the rapper, she told the court that he \"beamed a very bright light\" when they met. She also said he encouraged her to be more confident, saying \"he would uplift me.\"\n\nJane said they often talked about God and religion, and he introduced her to gospel music.\n\n\"He had a favorite pastor, and he would often put a lot of sermons on the television, and we would watch it together and we would talk about it,\" she shared. \"We would have really insightful conversations.\"\n\nDiddy's ex-girlfriend testifies that his favorite show is NBC's 'Dateline'\n\nUnder cross-examination by Combs' lawyer Geragos, Jane testified that she still loves Combs to this day.\n\nJane said she \"endured\" nights in hotels with escorts because she wanted to spend time with Combs – including watching his favorite TV show, NBC's true crime hit franchise \"Dateline,\" until he fell asleep.\n\n\"I felt loved by him because we experienced these things together,\" Jane said on the stand.\n\nDiddy's lawyers ask Jane about good times in their relationship: 'He was my baby'\n\nJane has maintained on the stand that she felt pressured into participating in alleged sex acts that Combs wanted. But the rapper's lawyers have also asked her about good times between the couple.\n\nThe anonymous witness told the court \"he was my baby\" as she described how she'd take care of Combs after an alleged \"hotel night\" in which she had sex with a male escort.\n\nShe said she'd give her then-boyfriend foot massages and buy food for them.\n\n\"I felt that my partner was trusting me in a very vulnerable moment and, well, so, he made me believe that this was something really special. This was something only he and I did, and I really took that on very strongly,\" she said.\n\nB2K's 'Bump Bump Bump' performance at BET Awards has Diddy, R. Kelly connections\n\nSunday night's BET Awards hit heavy on the nostalgia, bringing back hip-hop and R&B stars from the early aughts to revive a sound not quite like any other.\n\nTo honor the \"TRL\"-style music video countdown show \"106 & Park,\" a slate of big-name performers took the stage for a 20-minute beat-pounding medley.\n\nAmid mini-sets from Ashanti and Keyshia Cole, boy band B2K treated the audience to a rendition of their 2002 club anthem \"Bump Bump Bump.\" Complete with synchronized dance moves and all white 'fits, the four-man music group leaned heavily into their classic boy band appeal.\n\nEagle-eyed fans were quick to tease out a more sordid history of the track. \"Bump Bump Bump\" was originally released with a feature from Combs. His influence on hip-hop, especially in the early 2000s, was so far-reaching that it's hard to hit shuffle without running into one of his projects.\n\nThe story goes deeper, though. The track was also originally written by R. Kelly, who, like Combs, faced sex trafficking and racketeering charges, and is now serving time in prison after being convicted on all counts.\n\nJudge's new ruling could have major impact on Diddy trial\n\nWas Combs' ex-girlfriend forced into having sex with male escorts while he made videos, or was she a willing participant?\n\nWhich version a jury believes could be key for prosecutors in the wake of a ruling by U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian over expert testimony earlier in Combs' criminal trial, which began in May in federal court in Manhattan and is expected to last through at least the first week of July.\n\nThe expert testified about some of the dynamics of abusive relationships, but the judge didn't let her talk about \"coercive control,\" in which abusers use physical, sexual and psychological abuse to maintain power over victims.\n\nProsecutors asked the judge to reconsider his earlier decision, but on June 10 he ruled he would not allow the additional testimony.\n\nWhat is racketeering? Meaning of RICO charges\n\nRacketeering is the participation in an illegal scheme under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Statute, or RICO, as a way for the U.S. government to prosecute organizations that contribute to criminal activity.\n\nUsing RICO law, which is typically aimed at targeting multi-person criminal organizations, prosecutors allege that Combs coerced victims, some of whom they say were sex workers, through intimidation and narcotics to participate in \"freak offs\" — sometimes dayslong sex performances that federal prosecutors allege they have video of.\n\nJudge denies Combs' lawyers' push for another mistrial, jokes about 'Perry Mason' moment\n\nCombs' attorneys have once again had their push for a mistrial in his sex-crimes case denied.\n\nThe embattled music mogul's legal team's latest request for a mistrial has been rejected by Subramanian. Combs' lawyers had renewed a motion for a mistrial due to alleged prosecutorial misconduct in a letter to Subramanian dated June 7.\n\nDiddy on trial newsletter: Step inside the courtroom as music mogul faces sex-crimes charges.\n\nCombs' lawyers' latest push for a mistrial centered around testimony from Bryana \"Bana\" Bongolan, a friend of Ventura Fine. Bongolan testified about an incident where Combs allegedly held her up on a balcony in Ventura Fine's Los Angeles apartment in September 2016.\n\nAs Subramanian rejected the request, he joked that Combs' lawyer Nicole Westmoreland's cross-examination of Bongolan was like a moment from the dramatic television show \"Perry Mason.\"\n\nDiddy choked, kicked Jane months before arrest, she testifies\n\nNear the end of June 9's testimony, Jane detailed an allegedly violent incident with Combs that left her with visible injuries. She described being choked, punched, kicked and dragged by the hair – an alleged beating resembling how he'd assaulted Ventura Fine at the InterContinental Hotel in 2016.\n\nOn June 18, 2024, Jane said she and Combs got into an argument during a date night at home. She'd accused him of being with another woman during his Utah family vacation from which he'd just returned.\n\nAlthough Jane allegedly fled the altercation and hid, she said Combs continued to attack her when she returned home two hours later. The woman testified she punched Combs in his forehead before the rapper punched her twice in the head. Later, as she showered, he started smacking her in the face and then instructed her to \"put some ice on\" her injuries \"and put an outfit on\" of high heels and lingerie.\n\nJudge's upcoming ruling could have big impact on trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs\n\nWhat are the charges against Diddy?\n\nCombs is facing federal sex-crimes and trafficking charges in a sprawling case that has eroded his status as a power player and kingmaker in the entertainment industry.\n\nHe was arrested in September and later charged with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The rapper has pleaded not guilty to the five counts against him.\n\nHow to stream the Diddy trial\n\nThe trial will not be televised, as cameras are typically not allowed in federal criminal trial proceedings.\n\nUSA TODAY will be reporting live from the courtroom.

For the latest updates from Diddy's trial, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Wednesday, June 4.\n\nThis story contains graphic descriptions that some readers may find disturbing.\n\nThe 2016 video of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura Fine in a Los Angeles hotel is again taking center stage in the former hip-hop mogul's federal sex trafficking trial.\n\nEddy Garcia, a former security officer at the hotel where Combs and Ventura Fine were captured on tape, told the court that Combs paid $100,000 for a copy of the video, which showed him kicking, hitting and dragging Cassie.\n\nThe attack was first described in the bombshell lawsuit she filed in 2023 accusing him of sexual assault, trafficking and more. CNN last year published the security footage from the hotel.\n\nCombs \"was concerned that this video would get out and ruin his career,\" Garcia said on the stand in Manhattan court on June 3.\n\nThe account comes after emotional testimony from a former assistant, a woman going by the pseudonym \"Mia,\" who said she was \"brainwashed\" by her ex-boss amid his constant threats and assaults.\n\nDiddy on trial newsletter: Step inside the courtroom as music mogul faces sex-crimes charges.\n\nDerek Ferguson, who worked for Bad Boy Entertainment from 1998 to 2017, largely as Combs' chief financial officer, also testified June 3. However, he appeared to shrug off several questions from prosecutors about how Combs spent money and managed his businesses.\n\nCombs, 55, was arrested in September 2024 and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBank statements appear to confirm Cassie’s mom wired Diddy $20,000\n\nThe court saw bank statements that appear to confirm Ventura Fine’s parents wired money to Bad Boy in December 2011 to prevent Combs from leaking tapes of her having sex in his alleged freak offs.\n\nThe statements showed an outgoing wire transfer to Ventura Fine on Dec. 14, 2011, followed by a transfer from Ventura Fine to Bad Boy on Dec. 23, 2011. Days later, those funds were returned to sender from Bad Boy.\n\nVentura Fine’s mother, Regina Ventura, previously testified that she was told she needed to wire Combs $20,000 after he threatened to release the tapes of Ventura Fine. She said she \"was scared for my daughter’s safety\" and was ordered to \"pay Sean Combs because he demanded it.\"\n\nDiddy lawyer presses Combs' former financial officer\n\nCombs’ defense attorney Marc Agnifilo largely asked Ferguson about behavior he witnessed during his employment.\n\nWhen asked if he ever saw anyone help Combs commit crimes, Ferguson said he hadn't. Agnifilo also asked whether Ferguson ever witnessed \"acts of violence\" or saw anyone \"make the company stronger through acts of violence.\" The former financial officer again said no.\n\nFerguson also said he hasn't seen anyone \"enhance Mr. Combs’ reputation through emotional, physical or sexual abuse,\" as well as \"acts of prostitution\" or \"forced labor.\" When asked if he thinks highly of Combs, Ferguson took a long pause before answering, \"I don’t know how to respond to that.\"\n\nIs Diddy still in jail?\n\nThe disgraced music mogul is already in custody, and, despite repeated attempts at bail, has remained confined to the Special Housing Unit in Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center. He has been in jail since his arrest on Sept. 16, 2024.\n\nWhen will the Diddy trial end?\n\nCombs' trial is expected to last for approximately eight weeks in total.\n\nJudge Arun Subramanian, who's presiding over the sex-crimes trial in New York, has said he's hopeful proceedings will wrap up by the July 4 holiday.\n\nSecurity officer Eddy Garcia says Diddy was initially asked for $50K for hotel assault video\n\nEddy Garcia recalled working as a security officer for the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was captured on surveillance video in March 2016 assaulting Ventura Fine.\n\nGarcia told the court that he received a call from Combs' chief of staff, Kristina \"KK\" Khorram, asking if he had heard about an incident and \"if there was any possible way to get a copy of the video.\"\n\nKhorram said she and Combs wanted to know \"what exactly they were dealing with.\" Garcia said he told the chief of staff, \"Off the record, it's bad.\"\n\nLater that day, Khorram put Garcia on the phone with Combs, who \"sounded very nervous. He was talking really fast,\" the former officer said. Combs allegedly explained to Garcia that he \"had a little too much to drink\" and that \"you know how it is with women,\" adding that if the video got out \"it could ruin him,\" Garcia testified.\n\nCombs pressed further, allegedly saying he would \"take care of\" Garcia. The witness then went to his boss, Bill Medrano, and told him that Combs was offering to pay for the video. Medrano paused and said he would do it for $50,000, Garcia testified.\n\nThe former officer recalled that Combs \"sounded excited\" over the offer and said, \"Eddy, my angel. I knew you could help.\"\n\nMedrano went to the server room of the hotel, came back and handed Garcia a black USB, and said \"done.\"\n\nSecurity guard says Combs didn't want hotel surveillance video 'getting out'\n\nGarcia testified he told Combs and Khorram he had the tape on March 7, 2016. Combs allegedly directed him to bring it to a \"a big high-rise building\" in the area, where he walked into the lobby and was met by one of Combs' bodyguards, the former security officer said.\n\nAs they went up the elevator, Combs' bodyguard said he had known Combs for a long time, and \"he was a good guy, and I was doing a good thing,\" Garcia recalled. When Garcia arrived at the suite, Combs and Khorram were waiting there.\n\n\"I was very nervous and my voice kept cracking,\" Garcia said on the stand.\n\nCombs allegedly asked if he had the tape, and Garcia handed him a USB. The former security officer said Combs reiterated that \"he didn't want it getting out\" to the public.\n\nEddy Garcia says Diddy gave him paper bag with $100,000\n\nGarcia testified that he was concerned about being in legal trouble for giving the video to Combs, particularly if Ventura Fine filed a police report. But the former security guard said Combs told him he \"didn’t have to worry about it\" because she \"wanted it gone too.\"\n\nCombs then called Ventura Fine, who said she \"had a movie coming out\" and wanted the situation to go away, Garcia said.\n\nGarcia recalled that Combs asked for his ID, along with information from other security officers on the scene. He also asked Garcia to sign a non-disclosure agreement and another document stating he'd provided the only copy of the video.\n\nThe courtroom saw an image of the NDA, which said Garcia agreed to pay $1 million if there was a breach of the agreement.\n\nAfter Garcia signed the documents, he said Combs brought him $100,000 in a paper bag. Combs asked how he would spend the money – and allegedly advised him not to \"make any big purchases.\" Garcia said he gave $50,000 to Medrano, $22,000 to the other officer and kept $30,000 for himself. He said he bought a used vehicle in cash and didn’t deposit the money in a bank account or report it on taxes.\n\nProsecutors want to use Diddy's jail phone calls\n\nProsecutors are trying to use some of the phone calls that Combs has made from jail as evidence. That includes audio in which Combs allegedly planned an extensive social media campaign around his birthday in November 2024 to generate publicity and \"shift the narrative.\"\n\nLawyers for the government say they want to use the calls as evidence to help corroborate Mia's testimony that Diddy used his birthday for public approval – and that was the aim when she recorded a video wishing her former boss a happy birthday.\n\nProsecutors are likely hitting back at an argument that Combs' lawyers made on June 2: Mia still had a warm relationship with Combs after he allegedly physically and sexually assaulted her.\n\nIndividual banned from court after revealing Mia's identity\n\nAt the top of the day, prosecutors told the judge that somebody, who had been in the courthouse June 2, had used his phone to broadcast from the trial and used Mia's real name. The former assistant testified under a pseudonym to protect her privacy and safeguard against retaliation.\n\nThe individual went on his YouTube channel and used Mia’s real name there as well, prosecutors said. The person has been banned from the courthouse.\n\n'Laughing at you': Woman taunts Diddy in courtroom\n\nBefore the jury entered the courtroom for the day, there was an outburst from an onlooker.\n\nA woman stood up and shouted \"Diddy!\" and Combs turned around and looked at her. As she taunted him in an expletive-filled rant, the woman said that it's not a \"game,\" and people are \"laughing at you.\"\n\nThe judge asked for the woman, who has been at the courthouse for multiple days of the trial, to be escorted out of the room.\n\nDiddy team admits to violence, but not sex trafficking. Why that defense is tricky\n\nCombs' defense team is having to walk a tightrope in his sex-trafficking trial after admitting in opening statements that he committed domestic violence.\n\nThat's because sex trafficking involves compelling someone to participate in a commercial sex act through force, fraud or coercion. If Combs admits he used physical violence in his relationship with Ventura Fine, some jurors could believe he's admitting he forced her into the alleged \"freak offs.\"\n\n\"If somebody is being beaten before or after sexual encounters, and knows that that is just a consistent part of their relationship, that really extinguishes any concept of consent,\" Moira Penza, a litigator who in 2019 successfully prosecuted the so-called NXIVM \"sex cult\" leader Keith Raniere for sex trafficking, told USA TODAY.\n\nCombs' defense team didn't respond to a request for comment on whether it believes it is having to thread a needle by conceding domestic violence while denying he trafficked anyone. But it has tried to demonstrate that alleged victims had agency.\n\nWho is Mia in Diddy trial? Ex-assistant alleges sex assault at Combs' birthday party\n\nMia, a former personal assistant who worked for Combs from 2009 to 2017, testified on May 29 that he sexually assaulted her on \"more than one\" occasion. The woman alleged that the first time Combs assaulted her was at the Plaza Hotel in New York City when they were celebrating his 40th birthday in 2009.\n\nIn later years, the music mogul allegedly assaulted her several additional times, including at his Los Angeles home and on a private plane.\n\nMia says Diddy assaulted Cassie at Brad Pitt movie premiere\n\nDuring her June 2 testimony, Mia alleged that in 2012 she witnessed a discussion between Combs and Ventura Fine escalate at the premiere of the Brad Pitt film \"Killing Them Softly,\" during the Cannes Film Festival in France.\n\nShe claimed she saw Combs grit his teeth while digging his nails into Ventura Fine's arm, and eventually insisted that Ventura Fine leave, which she did.\n\nDiddy team admits to violence, but not sex trafficking. Will the jury see a difference?\n\nMia describes R. Kelly 'nightmare' in texts to Diddy\n\nOn June 2, jurors saw texts from 2019, in which Mia wrote to Combs: \"I had a nightmare. I was trapped in an elevator with R. Kelly, and you came to rescue me.\" Kelly, a fellow hip-hop artist, is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence after being convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering in 2022.\n\nWhen asked by Combs' defense attorney Brian Steel why she reached out to Combs, Mia said, \"Puff used to be my protector,\" adding that she also \"felt horrible\" for him after the 2018 death of his longtime partner Kim Porter.\n\nDid Trump pardon Diddy?\n\nNo, despite recently handing down a flurry of pardons, including one for reality stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, Trump did not include Combs on that list. But that doesn't mean he can't. According to Michigan State law professor Brian Kalt, Trump would be within his presidential rights to extend a preemptive pardon to Combs.\n\n\"These are federal charges so that's the main limit,\" Kalt tells USA TODAY. \"The matter has (to) be federal, it has to be criminal vs. civil, and related to something that's already been done. But the person doesn't have to even be charged yet or convicted. The Supreme Court has said preemptive pardons are OK.\"\n\nWhen asked about a possible pardon during an Oval Office press conference on May 30, Trump said he hadn't been approached about the legal matter but added, \"I know people are thinking about it.\"\n\nWhat are the charges against Diddy?\n\nCombs is facing federal sex-crimes and trafficking charges in a sprawling lawsuit that has eroded his status as a power player and kingmaker in the entertainment industry.\n\nHe was arrested in September 2024 and later charged with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The rapper has pleaded not guilty to all five counts against him.\n\nWhat is racketeering?\n\nRacketeering is the participation in an illegal scheme under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Statute, or RICO, as a way for the U.S. government to prosecute organizations that contribute to criminal activity.\n\nUsing RICO law, which is typically aimed at targeting multi-person criminal organizations, prosecutors allege that Combs coerced victims, some of whom they say were sex workers, through intimidation and narcotics to participate in \"freak offs\" — sometimes dayslong sex performances that federal prosecutors allege they have video of.\n\nWhere can I watch the Diddy trial?\n\nThe trial will not be televised, as cameras are typically not allowed in federal criminal trial proceedings.\n\nUSA TODAY will be reporting live from the courtroom.

Ousted Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely addressed the news media Tuesday in his most extensive public comments since being convicted in August. Free on bond while appealing, Blakely maintained his innocence but had no complaints about doing time in the Limestone County jail in Athens. “Best jail in the state of Alabama – that’s another thing I’m proud of,” he said outside his attorney’s office in Huntsville. “The food was real good; the staff took very good care of me.” Blakely, 70, was convicted in August of taking no-interest loans from a jail fund that held prisoners’ money and of stealing $4,000 from his campaign account. He was in his 10th straight term when he was removed from office, making him Alabama’s longest-serving sheriff at the time. Wearing his trademark cowboy hat and boots, Blakely said he had fewer privileges than jail trusties and denied receiving special treatment from his former staff, saying he “couldn’t ask for better treatment from the inmates,” and some even offered to have him food delivered to the jail. “I said, ‘No, I eat the jail food ’cause I love it because I’ve been eating it for the last 38 years,” he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A man faces federal charges after authorities allege he threatened to hire an assassin to kill U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday. In a separate threat left in a voice message at Murkowski’s Washington, D.C., office, the caller asked if the Alaska Republican knew what a .50-caliber shell does to a human head, according to court records unsealed Wednesday. Jay Allen Johnson, 65, of Delta Junction, was scheduled to make his first appearance in U.S. District Court in Fairbanks Wednesday over allegedly making threats against two senators, but the hearing was continued until Friday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. The two senators were not named by the U.S. Attorney’s Office or in an affidavit outlining the investigation filed by Matthew Patrick Allen Oudbier, an FBI special agent. However, Karina Borger, a spokesperson for Murkowski, confirmed in an email that the senator was one of the targets and was listed in the affidavit as “Senator 1.” “Threats should be taken seriously and our laws should be enforced to ensure accountability,” Borger said in a follow-up . “Senator Murkowski is thankful for the hard work of the federal law enforcement and for all they do to keep us safe.” Alaska’s other U.S. senator, Dan Sullivan, was “Senator 2” in the affidavit, his senior adviser Amanda Coyne said in an email.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An appellate court decision says the state’s constitutional protections for crime victims don’t prevent prosecutors from conducting pretrial interviews of victims who object. The Court of Appeals’ ruling Tuesday said the Arizona Constitution’s Victim’s Bill of Rights allows victims to refuse pretrial interviews with defendants or defense lawyers, but the court said that right of refusal does not extend to interviews or depositions with the prosecution. The court issued its ruling in a Yavapai County case involving a woman who is awaiting trial on a charge of luring a minor for sexual exploitation after allegedly sending a “suggestive photo” to a boy who was 14 years old at the time. The boy initially told prosecutors that he and the woman exchanged sexually explicit texts and photos, but he later declined to meet with prosecutors to prepare for his trial testimony. According to the ruling, the boy also said through his attorney that he would characterize certain evidence in a way more favorable to the woman than previously reported.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers gave final approval Wednesday to legislation requiring employers to let their workers opt out of getting COVID-19 vaccines – a move opposed by the state’s Republican governor, business groups and hospitals. But the proposal faces uncertainty on whether it’ll take effect immediately or early next year if it’s enacted. The proposal is among several attempts to limit or prohibit vaccine requirements that have dominated the Legislature’s attention during a session that was supposed to focus on congressional redistricting. The bill’s sponsor portrayed it as a way to protect people on the verge of losing their jobs because they refuse to get vaccinated. “You want to take people that are willing to show up to work, you want to take people that have stuck with you through this entire mess called COVID, and now you want to put them out on the streets?” Republican Sen. Kim Hammer said. The proposal requires a process for employees to opt out if they are tested weekly or can prove they have COVID-19 antibodies. Health officials say antibody testing should not be used to assess immunity against the coronavirus. Gov. Asa Hutchinson and the state Chamber of Commerce opposed the bill, calling the proposal in itself a mandate that would prevent businesses from setting their own vaccination policies.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state is encouraging more use of fire to fight fire, such as when deliberately set burns were recently used to protect giant sequoias from a raging wildfire. But sometimes what are known as prescribed fires spread out of control, causing their own extensive damage. A bill that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Wednesday adds legal protections for private landowners and those who manage the blazes by raising the legal standard for seeking wildfire suppression costs from simple negligence to gross negligence. Such costs can include not only fighting the fire but also related rescues and investigations. Entities such as Native American tribes and community fire safe councils must generally use professional, certified “burn bosses” or government forestry officers to plan and manage the controlled blazes. While government employees are generally already protected from liability, the new law makes it more difficult to sue private burn bosses. The burns must be for wildfire hazard reduction, ecological maintenance and restoration, cultural burning, forest management or agriculture. Opponents said the liability change leaves wildfire victims “with a more difficult and less efficient cost recovery process.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A health system is requiring “almost all” organ transplant patients to get vaccinated against COVID-19 before they receive their transplants. State Rep. Tim Geitner said in a Facebook Live video Tuesday that a woman shared a letter with him from UCHealth saying it would not perform a kidney transplant on her until she received a vaccine. The Republican state lawmaker tweeted a copy of the letter, which states that “if your decision is to refuse COVID vaccination you will be removed from the kidney transplant list.” It also says the woman has 30 days to start a COVID-19 vaccination series. UCHealth confirmed to USA TODAY that “in almost all situations, transplant recipients and living donors” within the system “are now required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in addition to meeting other health requirements.” The health system noted that transplant centers and medical providers often have requirements for transplant patients, such as receiving other kinds of vaccinations or avoiding alcohol. “These requirements increase the likelihood that a transplant will be successful and the patient will avoid rejection,” UCHealth said in a statement. The health system said for transplant patients who contract COVID-19, the mortality rate can be 20% to more than 30%, far higher than the general population.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Antisemitic and racist graffiti have been found twice in less than three weeks in a Yale University building that is under renovation, police said. In the first case, a construction crew working on the site found graffiti sprayed inside Kline Biology Towers on Sept. 20. The crew reported it to Yale police. The renovation company increased security, installing additional cameras and restricting access. Then late Saturday, video footage recorded vandals scaling a fence and breaking into the construction site to spray-paint antisemitic and racist rhetoric. Yale police said they are investigating both episodes, which they think are related. Yale President Peter Salovey said in a statement that the school condemns the vandalism and “will continue to stand united against acts of hate.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Government employees in bright vests are beginning to visit every home and business in the state that is taxed by local government as part of a sweeping reform to Delaware’s property taxing systems. Home-visit surveys began in New Castle County last month and will begin this month in Kent and Sussex counties. They are an early step of public interaction in what will be a multiyear process for government to reassess property valuations used for taxing, the first such reassessment in decades. The inspections are meant to provide an updated and accurate view of the layout, size and improvements for each taxed property. For residential properties, the interaction will likely begin with a knock on the door from a government contractor. Their bright-colored vests will bear the name “Tyler” for Tyler Technologies Inc., the Texas-headquartered firm hired to conduct the reassessment. The data collector will show identification and ask property owners about the characteristics of the inside of the home and collect measurements and observations of the outside of the home. Property owners do not set up appointments, and they do not need to be home for the assessment. The inspectors will not enter the home unless invited by the property owner to view something specific inside.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Actor Woody Harrelson punched a man in the neck after a verbal dispute at the Watergate Hotel, WUSA-TV reports. An incident report obtained by the station says a man and tried to grab Harrelson’s neck, and Harrelson told police he punched the man in the neck in defense. A nearby witness also told police that the man lunged at Harrelson and tried to put his hand around his neck. According to the police report, there were no arrests or charges. The identity of the man involved had not been released. Harrelson is in the D.C. area filming an upcoming HBO series called “The White House Plumbers” about the famed Watergate hotel investigation that revealed abuse of power by the Nixon administration. The five-part series will depict E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy as the political masterminds behind the Watergate scandal. Harrelson stars as Hunt and Justin Theroux as Liddy.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The preliminary stage of jury selection in the trial of a school massacre suspect on charges that he attacked a jail guard concluded Wednesday, but not before attorneys clashed over whether Nikolas Cruz should be allowed to draw using colored pencils to avoid getting upset. Prosecutor Maria Schneider accused Cruz’s attorneys of giving him the colored pencils to make the suspected killer of 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in February 2018 appear sympathetic before the prospective jurors. Cruz’s attorneys gave him the pencils after the 23-year-old became visibly upset when a woman in Wednesday’s first group of 32 prospects began crying after seeing him – the third time that happened over two days of preliminary screening. “They are doing (that) so the jury perceives that he is a child, that his mentality is somehow challenged,” Schneider told Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer. Cruz’s lead attorney on the brawl case, Gabe Ermine, told Scherer the defense only wanted to soothe his emotions. Throughout Tuesday’s groups, Cruz had been alert, took notes and conversed with his attorneys – a sharp contrast from Wednesday, when he mostly stared glumly downward. Ermine said Cruz had not actually done any drawing. Scherer ruled Cruz cannot be given colored pencils, citing safety concerns.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A state agency says the number of highway chases involving state law enforcement officers jumped dramatically in 2020, resulting in hundreds of injuries and a few deaths. According to a report by the Department of Public Safety, the Georgia State Patrol and officers from other state agencies took part in more than 1,200 pursuits statewide last year. That’s almost double the number of chases in 2019 and the highest total in the past five years, WTOC-TV reports. “It seems like people run more and more from the police,” said Lt. Mark Riley, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety. “I really don’t know what the catalyst is for that.” Officials say the increase has put more people in danger. The department’s report showed there were crashes in nearly 70% of highway chases last year. A total of 486 state troopers and officers were injured, as were 67 innocent bystanders. No law officers got killed, but four bystanders died. Most of the chases tracked by the state involved troopers with the Georgia State Patrol. A small number of pursuits also involved state Capitol police and the Georgia Motor Carrier Division. According to the department’s report, less than 1 in 3 Georgia highway chases last year resulted in no injuries or property damage.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The city’s bike-share service stopped losing money after tourists returned in large numbers this summer. Even so, Biki faces challenges because residents changed their bike riding patterns during the coronavirus pandemic, and tourism remains below pre-COVID-19 levels, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “We’re stabilized,” said Bikeshare Hawaii Executive Director Todd Boulanger. “The summer boost in ride revenue basically ended the 12 months of losses. It doesn’t make us whole, but we are no longer bleeding.” Last year Bikeshare Hawaii, the nonprofit that manages Biki, experienced a 50% drop in trips because of the pandemic. To deal with losses, it decommissioned seven stations and reduced services. Bikeshare faces an uphill battle given that visitor numbers have waned again after the delta variant fueled a spike in coronaviruscases. Also, additional bikes and bike parts are a challenge to obtain due to ongoing global supply chain issues. Demand from residents has declined somewhat, too. Workers who used to drive into town and then ride a Biki to meetings have not returned fully and are not necessarily meeting in person anymore. Also, university crowds have not returned to the same level and are not using Biki at previously top stations, for instance, by Puck’s Alley in Moiliili.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Even before his return from an overnight trip to Texas, the governor issued an executive order Wednesday repealing his political rival’s executive order from the previous day involving COVID-19 vaccine and coronavirus testing requirements. Republican Gov. Brad Little issued the order while still in Texas, a move that challenges the state’s long-standing practice of making the lieutenant governor acting governor when the governor is out of state. Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, a far-right Republican who is running to take Little’s job, issued her order Tuesday and also sought to activate the Idaho National Guard to send soldiers to the U.S.-Mexico border. Little was in Texas meeting with nine other Republican governors about border issues. Little’s executive order appears to lay the groundwork for a court challenge to determine who is in charge when governor leaves the state. His order says he did not authorize McGeachin to act, and it cites Idaho law. “Nor does my temporary presence in Texas on official business impair my ability to represent the people of Idaho thus necessitating action by another executive to ensure the continuity of state government,” the order says, charging that McGeachin’s order prohibiting mandatory coronavirus testing in schools would harm the state’s ability to curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nPingree Grove: Two zebras that escaped from a suburban Chicago pumpkin farm had travelers on a state highway doing double takes as the exotic animals hit the road during their brief taste of freedom. The young male and female zebras escaped Sunday from a pen inside an indoor zoo at Goebbert’s Pumpkin Patch and Apple Orchard in Pingree Grove. They crossed Route 47 several times and wandered through farm fields in the northwest Chicago suburb. Illinois State Police were called because the ensuring chase was near Interstate 90, The Daily Herald reports. Other police agencies also joined the pursuit of the striped escapees. A passenger in a car filmed the animals running into a field and posted the video on TikTok. “They look like zebras. They got stripes. They are!” the driver exclaims in the video. Kane County Undersheriff Pat Gengler said police blocked traffic several times in the area, worried that cars would strike the zebras or gawking motorists would get in accidents. After about two hours, workers with the pumpkin patch and the zoo tracked down the animals on all-terrain vehicles and captured both of them. The zebras, which are supplied to the pumpkin patch by another business, were not injured during the pursuit. “It was pretty exciting for a while. It was all hands on deck,” said Jacob Goebbert, a farm employee.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana filed a federal court complaint Wednesday night against one of the largest banks in the state, Old National Bank, alleging that it unlawfully discriminated in residential mortgage lending based on race. The allegations were based on a fair housing investigation into the practices of area lenders that FHCCI launched in 2016. The center said it found that Old National Bank made more than 2,250 mortgage loans in the Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson metropolitan area in 2019 and 2020, but only 37 were to Black borrowers. It also identified the borrower’s race for more than 91% of these loans, the complaint alleges. The bank deliberately engaged in housing discrimination against Blacks, it alleges – conduct that FHCCI said constitutes redlining and is in violation of the federal Fair Housing Act. Redlining was outlawed by the 1968 act, but it continues to persist today in the form of racially discriminatory lending practices and the undervaluing of homes owned by Black Americans, according to housing advocates and researchers. The complaint alleges Old National Bank structured its business to avoid providing access to mortgage credit to Black residents and neighborhoods in the Indianapolis area and made many fewer loans to Black applicants than its peers did.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The second of two white men who brutally beat a Black man during what the victim said was a racist attack has been sentenced to probation. Jesse James Downs, 29, was sentenced Wednesday to a year of probation after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct. A judge also ordered Downs to complete 150 hours of community service. An accomplice, 29-year-old Dale Lee Millard, was sentenced to three years of probation in March after he entered an Alford plea to a count of willful injury. The pleas came in the May 2020 attack on 23-year-old DarQuan Jones, who said the two men attacked him and shouted racial slurs at him after he knocked on his girlfriend’s door in Des Moines. Jones said the men also dragged him to a nearby creek and held his head underwater. Jones said the attack only ended after two women who heard his screams intervened. The attack left him with broken bones in his face and wrist and required 10 stitches. He said his medical bills topped $10,000. Jones said after the attack that he thought the men were going to kill him. “When they started dragging me to the creek, I thought it was over for me,” he said. The NAACP of Des Moines said the day the attack should be considered a hate crime, but Des Moines police said there was no evidence to firmly establish race as the primary motive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Health officials are frustrated that many school boards remain reluctant to adopt mask mandates, even though most COVID-19 outbreaks in Kansas schools are occurring in districts without such requirements. The state has 68 active school clusters, down from 79 a week ago, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment announced Wednesday. And those clusters have been connected to 596 cases, one hospitalization and one death. Of the active outbreaks from last week, only 29% occurred in districts that reported having a mask requirement. The outbreaks at schools without mask mandates and those that did not report what their mask policies were had clusters with about five to six times as many cases per capita, according to health department data. “It’s important to help parents understand that having your child wear masks in school keeps them there in school, and it keeps the schools operating and functioning,” said Stephanie Kuhlmann, a pediatric hospitalist at Wesley Children’s Hospital, during a Wednesday meeting of the governor’s Safer Classrooms Workgroup. Without universal masking, teachers become preoccupied with contact tracing and structuring classrooms to avoid close contacts, said Kevin Riemann, executive director of the Kansas National Education Association.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s Republican attorney general laid out his strategy Wednesday to champion Kentucky’s embattled abortion law in court, calling his office the “last line of defense” for the measure that would block a second-trimester procedure to end pregnancies. Attorney General Daniel Cameron said his first goal is to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to let him defend the 2018 law, which was previously struck down by lower courts. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the procedural dispute and scheduled a hearing next Tuesday. Addressing anti-abortion advocates outside the state Capitol, Cameron said he should have the opportunity to “make sure that we exhaust all avenues in defending our laws.” The disputed Kentucky law took aim at an abortion procedure known as “dilation and evacuation,” in which the fetus is removed with instruments. Opponents call it “barbaric and gruesome.” Abortion rights supporters say it’s a safe method for terminating a pregnancy. The procedure accounted for about 300 of the 3,200 abortions performed in Kentucky in 2018, the year the law was passed. The law’s opponents include the American Civil Liberties Union. Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, declared “enough is enough” in pushing back against Cameron’s efforts to defend it.\n\nLouisiana\n\nRabbit Island: Restoration of an island in the state’s fragile coastal area is proving wildly popular with the birds for which it was rebuilt, their numbers exploding on the recently added land, authorities said Wednesday. Pelicans, egrets, herons, ibis, terns and other colonial water birds built about 6,100 nests on Rabbit Island – more than 16 times the number biologists had expected, a news release from the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority said. The island supports the only brown pelican colony in southwest Louisiana, and about 1,500 pairs of pelicans were among the nesting birds. They included many of the 322 pelicans banded there this year and last, the agency said. Rabbit Island had eroded from nearly 290 acres to about 200 acres – with most of that either underwater or so low that high tides regularly covered nests. Dredging began last fall, adding 102 acres rather than the 88 planned and creating an expanse up to 3.5 feet above sea level. “We’re thrilled to see our state bird come home to a new and improved habitat,” authority chairman Chip Kline said. Settlement money from a devastating 2010 oil spill by energy giant BP estimated to have killed tens of thousands of pelicans in the Gulf area funded the $16.4 million project run by the coastal authority and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.\n\nMaine\n\nBrunswick: A program that lets state employers reduce worker hours instead of laying workers off entirely has been a “phenomenal tool” during the pandemic, U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said Tuesday. The Workshare Program was used only by one or two employers before the pandemic hit in 2020, but that number has grown to more than 240, Gov. Janet Mills said. The programs prevented 3,044 layoffs, she said. “That is more than 3,000 people in Maine who were able to keep their jobs and keep going to work,” she said. The program lets employers voluntarily reduce hours to avoid layoffs while employees collect partial unemployment benefits. The program prevents downsizing and helps keep workers connected to their jobs, the governor’s office said. It also helps them maintain their job skills, the office said. It was supported by a $382,579 grant from the U.S. Department of Labor to strengthen and promote the program. “Not only is work sharing a phenomenal tool for employers to retain their experienced workforce, but it is a lifesaver for workers,” Walsh said. Mills and Walsh attended a roundtable along with Maine Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman and several businesses including L.L. Bean, American Roots and Darlings at Bowdoin College.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A state board approved more than $421,000 in supplemental compensation Wednesday for the first person in the United States who was sentenced to death and later freed from prison because of DNA evidence. The Board of Public Works also approved $31,343 in attorneys’ fees in the case. Kirk Bloodsworth was sentenced to death and spent nearly nine years in prison for a Baltimore County murder he did not commit. He was exonerated in 1993. A year later, Maryland approved $300,000 to compensate him for the time he was wrongly incarcerated. Earlier this year, Maryland updated the law for compensating the wrongly convicted to create a standard process to determine how much compensation should be paid. The amount approved Wednesday brought the compensation for Bloodsworth up to what’s now set in law. The board has approved millions of dollars in the past two years for wrongly incarcerated people. In 2019, the board approved $9 million for five men who were wrongly imprisoned for a combined 120 years. It was the first time the board had approved such compensation in 15 years. Maryland banned the death penalty in 2013. Bloodsworth was a leading advocate for repeal.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bill that would permanently write into state law early voting options that were temporarily adopted at the height of the coronavirus pandemic last year was approved overwhelmingly Wednesday by the Massachusetts Senate. The bill would also enact same-day voter registration and make other changes to the commonwealth’s election process, including allowing no-excuse voting by mail. The Senate passed the bill by a 36-3 vote. Supporters say the proposal incorporates lessons learned during the pandemic and takes critical steps to expand the right to vote in Massachusetts at a time when many states are tightening access to the ballot box. State lawmakers previously enacted legislation to temporarily extend vote-by-mail and early voting options through Dec. 15. “One of the few silver linings of the COVID-19 pandemic is that we had the chance to prove that the voting reforms that so many have advocated for can and do work,” Democratic Senate President Karen Spilka said in a statement when the bill was unveiled. Many of the measures included in the legislation helped produce record voter turnout last fall, according to Patricia Comfort, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Massachusetts.\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: The state on Wednesday urged the city’s residents to use only bottled water for cooking and drinking, a major shift in response to elevated levels of lead. The state recently said it would distribute free water and filters in the southwestern Michigan city. But federal regulators now are reviewing how effective the filters are in removing lead from water at certain levels, according to the health department. The state said more than 15,000 cases of water will be delivered in coming days to the predominantly Black and mostly low-income community. “We think they probably are effective,” state health department Director Elizabeth Hertel said of the filters. But “right now don’t use the water for cooking or drinking, even the filtered water, until we can guarantee the efficacy of those filters.” She didn’t know how long it would take. Filters so far have been given to more than 2,600 homes, the department said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it’s evaluating how filters perform specifically on Benton Harbor’s water chemistry. A local activist, the Rev. Edward Pinkney, said he’s pleased with the state’s emphasis on bottled water but said residents need to hear a stronger message. “The water is unsafe to use. Period. Any use. That will get more attention around here,” Pinkney said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state Supreme Court on Wednesday denied former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin’s request to have a public defender represent him as he appeals his murder conviction and sentence in the death of George Floyd. The state’s high court said Chauvin has not established that he is entitled to a public defender. The justices made that decision after reviewing information about Chauvin’s debts and assets, as well as the Office of the Minnesota Appellate Public Defender’s prior determination that Chauvin was ineligible, Chief Justice Lorie Gildea wrote. Chauvin may seek a public defender in the future if he’s unable to pay for a lawyer, the Supreme Court said. Chauvin filed documents last month saying he intends to appeal his conviction and sentence on 14 grounds, including that his trial should have been moved from Hennepin County and that the jury should have been sequestered. Chauvin also filed an affidavit saying he has no attorney in the appeals process and has no income aside from nominal prison wages. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association’s legal defense fund paid for his case before Judge Peter Cahill. Chauvin wrote: “I have been informed that their obligation to pay for my representation terminated upon my conviction and sentencing.”\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A chancery court has dismissed a lawsuit aimed at blocking construction of a public pier, ruling that the city is within its rights to build the pier without a state tidelands lease. The Secretary of State’s Office had sued over a plan by Biloxi and Harrison County to lease the property to RW Development for construction of a municipal pier for public use, claiming that the city needed a tidelands lease, WLOX-TV reports. The chancery judge’s ruling Monday said municipal piers and harbors have been built in Biloxi for decades without requiring a tidelands lease. “This is outstanding news for Biloxi and all the cities and counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast,” Biloxi Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich said. “This is about public access and enjoyment of the waterfront, and the cities and counties have been building piers, harbors and other amenities on the waterfront for more than a hundred years.” A public pier had been at the Veterans Avenue site for years before being destroyed by a hurricane. RW Development plans to finalize the design of the pier and begin the permitting process with the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources. The lease between RW and the city and county states that the company is responsible for constructing and maintaining the public pier.\n\nMissouri\n\nLee’s Summit: Hundreds of students at a suburban Kansas City high school walked out of class this week over allegations of LGBTQ students facing repeated harassment and bullying. The walkout happened Monday at Lee’s Summit High School after some students said administrators there have done nothing to protect bullied students, even after receiving repeated reports of the bullying, the Kansas City Star reports. The mother of one student told the Star her daughter was punched in the face last week by a boy after confronting him in a school hallway about harassing and bullying her gay friend. The mother, Melanie Davies, said the incident led to a fight between bullying students and the students allegedly being bullied. “No teachers were around,” Davies said. “Students broke it up.” Davies later took her daughter to the emergency room, where they learned she had a broken nose. The students who were being bullied and defended themselves in the fight were suspended from school along with the bullies, Davies said. Her daughter and friends also were not allowed to attend their senior homecoming dance because of the suspension, she said. District spokeswoman Katy Bergen told the Star the district prohibits all forms of bullying and investigates all complaints of bullying administrators receive.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A law firm is suing the state over a rule that bans businesses from requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees. This is the second lawsuit challenging the only law in the U.S. that prevents employers from mandating workers get vaccinated. Netzer Law Office, which has five employees and locations in Sidney and Billings, said the law passed earlier this year by the Republican-controlled Legislature interferes with the business’s “choice in determining how best to provide a safe and healthy environment.” The law office is represented in the suit by Joel Krautter, a former Republican state lawmaker. The law – which applies to all vaccinations – says requiring vaccines as a condition of employment is discriminatory and violates the state’s human rights laws. The suit filed Tuesday in district court in Richland County says the new law violates the Montana Constitution, which guarantees the right to “a clean and healthful environment.” In addition to asking for the law to be deemed unconstitutional, the plaintiffs are asking for a preliminary injunction staying the enforcement of the law while the legal challenge is underway. The suit names state Republican State Attorney General Austin Knudsen and Commissioner of Labor and Industry Laurie Esau as defendants.\n\nNebraska\n\nHoldrege: BD has completed an expansion at one of its plants that will help the company continue providing hundreds of millions of needles and syringes to the U.S. government to help with the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The company said Thursday that the $70 million expansion of production lines at its plant in Holdrege was completed with the help of a $42 million investment from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “As the fight against COVID-19 continues, we are steadfast in our commitment to securing the nation’s supply continuity of these critical injection devices,” said Rick Byrd, president of Medication Delivery Solutions for BD. Dawn O’Connell, HHS’s assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said having a ready supply of domestically manufactured needles and syringes has been critical to the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. “Taking action now to increase U.S.-based manufacturing capacity will allow us to meet the needs of patients and health care providers while also creating valuable U.S. jobs,” O’Connell said. In addition to the Holdrege plant, BD has manufacturing plants in Broken Bow and Columbus, Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casino industry leaders and vendors riding a resurgence of gambling following coronavirus closures are gathering in person for an annual conference this week – amid strict mask and vaccination rules – after meeting virtually a year ago. “We are thrilled to be back here, live, in Las Vegas,” American Gaming Association chief Bill Miller said Tuesday as he greeted about 500 people in a ballroom. Chairs were spaced apart in groups of two, three and four at the Global Gaming Expo at The Venetian resort on the Las Vegas Strip. “I mean, there’s nothing like getting back together in person,” Miller said, calling four days featuring an expansive trade show, breakout meetings and keynote speeches “a lot better than being on a Zoom (videoconference) call.” The event at The Venetian Expo center has drawn up to 27,000 attendees in recent years. Gaming association spokeswoman Allison Nielsen said current attendance figures wouldn’t be known until later this week. Attendees submitted proof of COVID-19 vaccination, many through the cellphone app Clear Health Pass, and were issued green wristbands to show they complied. Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat who ordered Nevada casinos and most other businesses closed from mid-March to June 2020, was among featured speakers.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A civil rights complaint was filed against a woman accused of telling a Black child who accidentally broke her son’s toy that she would “kneel on his neck” and calling him a racial slur, the state attorney general’s office said Thursday. Kristina Graper threatened the 9-year-old boy who was playing in a neighborhood park with her son May 10, according to the complaint filed in Strafford County Superior Court. Graper’s son pushed the boy, and that push resulted in the boy “breaking a foam missile or foam bullet” that belonged to Graper’s son, who ran home to tell her what happened. Graper then went back to the park and found the other child, threatening him that she’d “kneel on his neck,” according to the complaint. A witness told Graper her behavior was unnecessary, and then Graper started yelling at that person. She called the child a racial slur before returning home, the complaint said. The child’s mother later called police. When she met with them June 1, Graper denied saying she would kneel on the boy’s neck but instead said words to the effect of “you wonder why you guys get (expletive) kneeled on,” according to the complaint. The complaint said the encounter distressed the child, who understood the comments to be a reference to the murder of George Floyd. He began to cry when he heard her words and has been afraid to return to the park, which he will only do “when other children are there to help keep him safe,” the complaint said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold: Building relationships with the LGBTQ community and enrolling local businesses to act as shelters where victims of bias crimes can seek immediate help are parts of a new program rolled out Wednesday by a prosecutor’s office. Acting Monmouth County Prosecutor Lori Linskey introduced the program to assign liaisons to members of the gay, lesbian, transgender and other communities to chip away at decades of distrust between them and law enforcement. She enlisted the help of three Jersey Shore cities to conduct the pilot program called “Safe Place,” modeled after a similar initiative in Seattle. The program works with local businesses to display the rainbow-colored “Safe Place” logo in their windows to let victims of bias or hate crimes know their establishment is somewhere they can enter to seek shelter while authorities are called. “It’s a goal of our program to build bridges and collaborate with the LGBTQ community, some of whom have a distrust of law enforcement,” Linskey said. Christian Fuscarino, executive director of Garden State Equality, New Jersey’s largest gay rights organization, welcomed the outreach. He said years of mistrust have built up between law enforcement, dating back to years when authorities would raid and close establishments catering to a gay clientele.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Top officials with the largest Native American tribe in the U.S. are renewing a request for congressional leaders to hold a field hearing before deciding on federal legislation aimed at limiting oil and gas development around Chaco Culture National Historical Park. The Navajo Nation has struggled for years with high poverty rates and joblessness, and the tribe’s legislative leaders say individual Navajo allottees stand to lose an important source of income if a 10-mile buffer is created around the park as proposed. They’re calling for a smaller area of federal land holdings to be made off limits to oil and gas development as a compromise to protect Navajo interests. A World Heritage site, Chaco is thought to be the center of what was once a hub of Indigenous civilization. Within the park, walls of stacked stone jut up from the bottom of the canyon, some perfectly aligned with the seasonal movements of the sun and moon. Circular subterranean rooms called kivas are cut into the desert floor. Outside the park, archaeologists say there are discoveries still to be made. Other tribes, environmental groups and archaeologists have been pushing to stop drilling across an expansive area of northwestern New Mexico, saying sites beyond Chaco’s boundaries need protection, and the federal government’s leasing program needs an overhaul.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio misused city resources by taking his police security detail with him on trips around the U.S. during his ill-fated presidential run, at a cost of roughly $320,000, and by letting his adult son use the detail as a free taxi service, investigators concluded in a report released Thursday. The city’s Department of Investigation, an independent agency that acts as a inspector general, also said a police van was improperly used to carry a futon when de Blasio’s daughter, Chiara, moved from a Brooklyn apartment back to Gracie Mansion, the mayor’s official residence, in August 2018. Members of the mayor’s security team drove his son, Dante, around town and to and from Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut. The Department of Investigation laid much of the blame for the misuse of the detail on the police department, saying it had no written procedures defining when and how the detail should be used. Members of the security detail also at times transported the mayor’s staff members and guests including his brother, the report said. De Blasio said at a virtual news briefing that the report contained “many inconsistencies and inaccuracies” and said decisions about providing security during his presidential campaign and transportation for his family were made by police officials based on safety concerns.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: A teacher has resigned from a charter school after telling Black students that if not for the Constitution, they would be her “field slaves,” a comment that one parent said brought attention to other racist incidents at the school. Winterville Charter Academy sent a memo that also referred to “racially insensitive words” being used by children in the class without any action from the teacher, who Principal Annastasia Ryan said in the memo “was supported in turning in her resignation and will not be returning on campus,” WITN-TV reports. Kanisha Tillman, who has an eighth grader at the school, said a parent sent her a text message Sept. 20 suggesting a particular teacher treated Black and white students differently. Her son later that day described one such incident in which he said a white student had called him a racist term. “When the Black student educated him on that being racist and him not liking it and not to call him that and asked the teacher for support, the teacher turned around and said to him, ‘Oh, it’s OK. We’re all a little bit racist,’ ” Tillman said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A state trooper who fatally shot a man along an interstate last month has been cleared of any wrongdoing. The Morton County State’s Attorney’s Office determined Trooper Steve Mayer was justified in his use of deadly force against 45-year-old Craig Knutson, of Billings, Montana. Mayer was assisting Morton County sheriff’s deputies who attempted to stop Knutson on Interstate 94 west of Mandan on Sept. 7. Knutson, accused of reckless driving, failed to pull over. Mayer used his patrol vehicle to force Knutson to stop. His father, Jerry Knutson, also of Billings, told The Bismarck Tribune he had no issues with Mayer being cleared because “he did what he had to do.” He said he was thankful his son did not get into a wreck on the highway or shoot an officer. He said there are law officers in the family. “Why he would think to not stop, I don’t understand,” he said of his son. The elder Knutson said his son was “a good man, a good father, a good son,” and what people saw in September was the “bad side of Craig,” whose drinking intensified after he was divorced in the last two years. A dispatcher can be heard in Highway Patrol video telling officers that Knutson was threatening to shoot himself. Knutson confirmed to the dispatcher that he had a gun but had no intention of harming any officers.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Cincinnati Reds legend Pete Rose will help officially open the Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati for business. The casino’s grand reopening will begin at 11 a.m. Oct. 29, with Rose making the first table game bet. There will also be a live performance by Earth, Wind & Fire. In 2019, Hard Rock announced plans to overhaul the former Jack Casino, complete with a Hard Rock Cafe and eventual plans for a hotel, though it has been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Hard Rock Cafe opened in July. The reopening will include a guitar smash “led by celebrities and members of the Seminole Tribe of Florida,” as well as executives from the Hard Rock Casino, a news release said. Rose is expected to autograph the official Hard Rock Casino guitar, specially made for the casino’s memorabilia collection. Tickets went on sale Thursday for the Earth, Wind & Fire concert and can be purchased at HardRockCasinoCincinnati.com.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Superintendent Joy Hofmeister, who has clashed repeatedly with Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and his appointees over the state’s response to COVID-19 in schools, said Thursday that she will switch parties and run as a Democrat against him next year. A longtime Republican first elected in 2014, Hofmeister said the decision to switch parties and run for governor was a difficult one, but “Kevin Stitt has hijacked the Republican Party here in Oklahoma.” She said in a statement that “with partisanship and ineffective leadership, Governor Stitt is running our state into the ground.” A former schoolteacher, Hofmeister was elected in 2014 after she won a GOP primary against incumbent Janet Barresi and then defeated Democrat John Cox in the general election. Hofmeister was reelected in 2018. She can’t run for the post again because of term limits. She oversaw Oklahoma schools during a tumultuous time that included massive protests and walkouts over teacher pay and school funding. Hofmeister broke with four of Stitt’s appointees to the state school board last year over whether to require schools to follow coronavirus protocols, including mask-wearing. Stitt’s appointees voted to make complying with the protocols optional.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state Supreme Court struck down the death sentence of an inmate in a ruling Thursday that found lawmakers had fundamentally altered “prevailing societal standards” for executions with a 2019 law change. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports experts believe the decision could eliminate the death sentence for all inmates facing the penalty. State lawmakers passed a bill in 2019 that narrowed what crimes qualify as aggravated murder – the only charge that carries capital punishment in Oregon – to murders of children younger than 14 years old, murders of law enforcement officers, terrorist attacks that kill at least two people, and prison killings carried out by someone who’d previously been convicted of murder. That’s a narrower scope than what formerly constituted aggravated murder. While the law change included a provision that did not make it retroactive, the court’s ruling appears to do that, relying on a section of the state’s Constitution that prohibits disproportionate punishments. “My expectation is that every death sentence that is currently in place will be overturned as a result of this,” said Jeffrey Ellis, co-director of the Oregon Capital Resource Center.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: The Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board has ruled that graduate assistants at the University of Pittsburgh fell short in a 2019 effort to unionize. University officials disclosed the ruling involving graduate student employees Tuesday and said it effectively ends the drive to organize assistants who teach, do research and engage in other endeavors, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Union organizers, however, say they are appealing the decision. The United Steelworkers several years ago petitioned the labor board for an election, citing card campaign numbers indicating that at least 30% of the potential bargaining unit supported the idea of a union. But the bid fell more than three dozen votes short of approval in an election held over four days in 2019. The union and student organizers appealed, accusing university officials of tactics discouraging the vote. University officials said they did nothing inappropriate. The board ultimately concluded that management actions weren’t enough to affect the election result. The board’s final ruling upheld that decision. The Steelworkers said Wednesday that they are “already in the process” of appealing.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee disclosed his plans Thursday to spend about $113 million of the state’s more than $1.1 billion in federal relief funds on essential needs including affordable housing, support for small businesses, and bonuses for child care workers. The goal of the midyear budget amendment and spending a portion of the state’s American Rescue Plan funds is to accelerate the post-pandemic economy, he said. “We’re writing Rhode Island’s next chapter now,” the Democratic governor said at a State House news conference. “National assessments show that Rhode Island is, for once, a leading state as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. If we invest soon and invest wisely, we can continue to lead rather than follow, creating opportunities for Rhode Islanders as a result.” Of $45 million proposed for small businesses, $12.5 million would be used for immediate financial support, with the goal of spending 20% on minority-owned businesses. Another $10.5 million would go to technical assistance and for upgrading technical infrastructure. He also proposed spending an additional $15 million for affordable housing construction.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A utility executive who repeatedly lied to keep investors pumping money into the state’s $9 billion nuclear reactor debacle will spend two years in prison for fraud, a federal judge decided Thursday. Former SCANA Corp. CEO Kevin Marsh agreed with prosecutors that he should serve the sentence, and the judge approved the deal, making him the first executive put behind bars for misleading the public on the project, which failed without ever generating a watt of power. Marsh said he wants to serve his time now because his wife of 46 years has incurable breast cancer, and he hopes to care for her after leaving prison. U.S. District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis cited Marsh’s remorse and expansive cooperation with federal authorities as she reluctantly accepted the plea deal, which is well below the federal sentencing guidelines of five years. She said the prosecution and defense depiction of the crime Marsh committed is a “vanilla way to describe it,” adding that it understates “the seriousness of this nondisclosure.” “Your crime was committed with a little more elegance and sophistication than many I see,” Geiger told Marsh. “But you don’t get credit for that.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A veterinarian at the Great Plains Zoo said the zoo’s resident Amur tiger has tested positive for the coronavirus. Last week, zookeepers observed coughing and lethargy in the tiger, Keesa. A sample was taken and sent in for lab testing, and the zoo received the results Tuesday. The tiger has been off exhibit since Sunday as it is being treated for the virus. The zoo remains open during its regular hours, 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., seven days a week. Several other big cats, including two Amur tigers and two snow leopards, have since exhibited symptoms. All are being tested for and managed under the assumption of a positive result, according to a press release by the zoo. The Great Plains Zoo cares for three endangered Amur tigers named Callie, Yuri and Keesa, said Louden Wright, a veterinarian at the zoo. Transmission from cats to humans has not been shown to occur, although all big cats have been removed from public exhibit spaces for ongoing treatment and observation, a release said. “It’s unfortunate that, in spite of the precautions taken, we are seeing this disease in several of our large cats. The speed with which it has moved between these tigers and leopards really speaks to the insidious nature of this virus,” Wright in the release.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The metropolitan government has asked a judge to temporarily shut down a hot tub on wheels, claiming in a lawsuit that the party vehicle is operating without a public swimming pool permit. The suit was filed in Davidson County Chancery Court last week. Music City Party Tub, the vehicle operator, was informed of the violation in an Aug. 11 letter from the Metro Public Health Department. A temporary injunction hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. According to the lawsuit, the business – which debuted in Nashville’s downtown entertainment district in April 2019 – also isn’t currently registered with the state and doesn’t have a business license in the county. The health department says that when owner Guy Williams came to its office in April 2019, staff told him to submit design plans for the mobile hot tub and apply for a public pool permit. The agency inspected the vehicle and told Williams what to fix to be approved, but the suit says he never returned. Health department workers told Williams in September 2020 that he was operating without a permit, according to the lawsuit. He said he was exempt because the hot tub is 50 gallons short of the “minimum capacity” for a public pool. Such an exemption doesn’t exist, the suit says.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A Bexar County judge denied an attorney’s motion to remove a 5-year-old boy from his foster home because his foster parents aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19. Senior Judge Susan Reed initially ruled that the boy should be removed from Richard and Barbara Bernhardt’s home, but she reversed her decision this week after learning that they have a medical condition, celiac disease, that they say prevents them from taking the vaccine, the San Antonio Express-News reports. William “Bill” Keiler, the attorney representing the boy, said he’s considering whether to appeal Reed’s ruling because he feels moving the boy would be the best way to protect his health and safety. Gaby Moreno, a conservatorship specialist for Texas Child Protective Services who handles the boy’s case, said she hasn’t received any training from her agency about COVID-19 protocols or policies for Texas foster parents. Richard and Barbara Bernhardt, the boy’s foster parents, said they haven’t been vaccinated because they have celiac disease, an autoimmune condition in which people can’t eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine. There is no gluten in any of the three vaccines in use in the U.S., according to the Society for the Study of Celiac Disease.\n\nUtah\n\nRockville: A man who is suspected of shooting at vehicles and causing a lockdown of a tourist town outside Zion National Park was apprehended Wednesday night, authorities said. At least one injury was reported. The Washington County Critical Incident Task Force said in a statement that officers responded Wednesday about 3:40 p.m. to a report of a man who brandished a handgun during an argument in the city of Hurricane, about 20 miles southwest of the national park, then drove off in a silver pickup truck. Officers attempted a traffic stop, but the suspect continued along State Route 9 and shot at multiple vehicles, authorities said. Residents of Rockville, which has about 220 residents, were told to take shelter at 4:30 p.m. in response to gunfire on the highway, KSL-TV reports. State Route 9 was closed for a period of time in both directions through Rockville, according to the Utah Department of Transportation. Shuttle buses inside the park were briefly stopped as emergency vehicles sped through the park Wednesday evening. Authorities said that officers deployed spike sticks and exchanged gunfire as the suspect continued driving through the area. The vehicle crashed in Rockville, and the suspect fled into a nearby neighborhood, where he was found with a gunshot wound about 6:15 p.m.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A program started during the pandemic that distributes free restaurant-made meals for people in need and directs revenues to local eateries has been extended for the rest of the year. Vermont Everyone Eats operates statewide, with the goal of addressing people’s food needs and supporting local eateries and farms. Restaurants are expected to get many ingredients, such as produce, locally. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is covering the meals $10 at a time, NECN reports. “Hunger is an emergency and a crisis every single day someone is experiencing it,” Jean Hamilton, the program’s statewide coordinator, told the news outlet. She expects recipients’ food needs to increase as their home heating bills start coming in and said restaurants have also been challenged. “A lot of restaurants had a very challenging summer and made significantly less money than they needed to to survive this winter,” Hamilton said. “So we’re really happy to be able to support both the restaurants and the folks that are seeking support from the meals. And then, of course, also the local farms that are helping make those meals local and farm-fresh.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: The brick foundation of one of the nation’s oldest Black churches has been unearthed at Colonial Williamsburg, a living history museum that continues to reckon with its past storytelling about the country’s origins and the role of Black Americans. The First Baptist Church was formed in 1776 by free and enslaved Black people. They initially met secretly in fields and under trees in defiance of laws that prevented African Americans from congregating. By 1818, the church had its first building in the former colonial capital. The 16-by-20-foot structure was destroyed by a tornado in 1834. First Baptist’s second structure, built in 1856, stood there for a century. But an expanding Colonial Williamsburg bought the property in 1956 and turned it into a parking lot. First Baptist Pastor Reginald F. Davis, whose church now stands elsewhere in Williamsburg, said the uncovering of the church’s first home is “a rediscovery of the humanity of a people.” “This helps to erase the historical and social amnesia that has afflicted this country for so many years,” he said. Colonial Williamsburg on Thursday announced that it had located the foundation after analyzing layers of soil and artifacts such as a one-cent coin. More than half of the 2,000 people who lived in Williamsburg in the late 18th century were Black, and many were enslaved.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The number of city police officers who have turned in required proof showing they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19 is increasing. The department’s counts as of Wednesday showed 292 sworn officers still need to verify they’ve been fully vaccinated before the Oct. 18 deadline facing city employees, The Seattle Times reports. That 292 makes up 27% of all cops available to respond to calls in the city, according to the newspaper. The latest counts mean the department had received vaccination records for an additional 62 officers since Tuesday, when the Seattle Police Department for the first time publicly released specific numbers. The latest figures from the Seattle Police Department showed 782 sworn officers, or 73%, have submitted vaccination records. But at least 111 of those are seeking exemptions from the city’s mandate, department spokesman Sgt. Randy Huserik said. Nearly all of the police department’s civilian police employees – 98% – also have verified they’ve been fully vaccinated, the figures showed.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: NAACP West Virginia chapter President Owens Brown will be the first Black man to serve in the state Senate, Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday. Justice announced Brown’s appointment to the seat vacated by the resignation of Democratic former state Sen. Bill Ihlenfeld, who was confirmed Tuesday as the U.S. attorney for the state’s northern district. “I congratulate Owens beyond belief. He will do an incredible job,” Justice said in a statement. “I am so proud of this because we need diversity. We need other opinions.” Brown is a Wheeling resident. The Senate seat covers Brooke, Hancock and Ohio counties as well as part of Marshall County. Marie Redd of Huntington was the first Black person elected to the state Senate, in 1998.\n\nWisconsin\n\nLa Crosse: State environmental regulators are prepared to spend more than a half-million dollars a year to provide bottled water to nearly 1,200 households on French Island because of concerns about contaminated drinking water. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and Department of Health Services have issued a drinking water advisory indefinitely and plan to continue to make bottled water available to as many as 4,300 residents on the island near La Crosse amid concerns about PFAS contamination from testing or use of firefighting foam containing the chemical at the La Crosse Regional Airport on French Island. The so-called forever chemical raised concern because it’s among substances that have been linked to an increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, thyroid disease and fertility issues. The chemicals, found in firefighting foam and everyday products like nonstick cookware, don’t break down easily in the environment. The DNR is providing bottled water to 1,162 households with money from the agency’s environmental repair fund. The agency has spent just under $96,000 for services invoiced through the end of May, but it expects to spend $550,000 to $600,000 a year on French Island, Wisconsin Public Radio reports.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A judge has sentenced a woman to four days in jail for not moving away while a grizzly bear with two cubs came dangerously close and bluff-charged her in Yellowstone National Park. Samantha R. Dehring, 25, of Carol Stream, Illinois, pleaded guilty Wednesday to willfully remaining, approaching and photographing wildlife within 100 yards. In addition to sentencing Dehring to jail, U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark L. Carman in Mammoth Hot Springs banned her from Yellowstone for a year and ordered her to pay a $1,000 fine and $1,000 to a wildlife protection fund. Dehring’s attorney, Ethan Morris, didn’t immediately return a phone message Thursday seeking comment. She encountered the bear May 10 at Roaring Mountain, a hillside with numerous noisy steam vents called fumaroles. As the grizzly approached much closer than the football-field-length limit for people to approach bears and wolves in Yellowstone, other visitors backed away and got in their cars. Dehring stayed put and kept taking photos, federal prosecutors said in a statement Thursday. The grizzly eventually bluff-charged, running at Dehring but turning away without attacking her. “Approaching a sow grizzly with cubs is absolutely foolish,” acting Wyoming U.S. Attorney Bob Murray said in the statement.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/06/25/diddy-trial-live-updates-day-34/84338440007/", "title": "Diddy trial updates: Latest on charges, Kid Cudi evidence, verdict", "text": "This page reflects the news from Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' trial on Wednesday, June 25. For the latest updates from Diddy's trial, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Thursday, June 26.\n\nThis story contains graphic descriptions that some readers may find disturbing.\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs' legal fate hangs in the balance as the music mogul's landmark criminal trial nears a close.\n\nOn Wednesday, June 25, prosecutors, defense attorneys and the judge met during a charge conference to determine instructions for jurors before they begin deliberating either at the end of the week or beginning June 30. U.S. attorneys indicated they would \"streamline\" instructions for jury deliberation by dropping some of their racketeering theories related to attempted arson and kidnapping.\n\nThe back-and-forth arrived a day after prosecutors rested their case on June 24. Over the course of nearly seven weeks, several individuals in Combs' personal and professional orbit – from ex-girlfriends Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura Fine and \"Jane\" to Danity Kane alum Dawn Richard and rap peer Kid Cudi – testified during Combs' trial. In total, prosecutors called forward more than 30 witnesses.\n\nAs testimony came to an end, attorneys for the U.S. government zeroed in on graphic evidence from Combs' alleged \"freak off\" sex parties, which included video footage, text messages and financial records. Prosecutors painted a picture of Combs and his employees being personally involved with organizing the elaborate sexual performances, working with escorts, Combs' partners and others.\n\nMeanwhile, Combs' attorneys rested their case in less than half an hour, with the defense opting not to call any witnesses to the stand. Their arguments mainly focused on romantic – and occasionally explicit – texts between Combs and Ventura Fine.\n\nAlthough Combs' alleged abuse is at the center of the trial, the Grammy-winning rapper told the court he would not be testifying. Judge Arun Subramanian asked Combs' lead lawyer Marc Agnifilo if he spoke with his client about his right to testify, and Agnifilo said they discussed it at length.\n\nCombs, 55, was arrested in September and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nDiddy on trial newsletter: Step inside the courtroom as music mogul faces sex-crimes charges.\n\nJudge allows Diddy defense extra night before giving its closing argument\n\nAs the June 25 hearing over jury instructions came to a close at about 7:30 p.m. ET, Judge Arun Subramanian granted a request from Combs' team to wait until Friday morning, June 27, to begin its closing argument.\n\nProsecutor Maurene Comey said the defense should have to start Thursday afternoon, June 26, after the prosecution's closing argument. She expressed concern that delaying it would waste the jury's time and that the defense was engaging in gamesmanship in order to sit with the prosecution's closing argument overnight and map out its response.\n\nHowever, Subramanian said he thought the arrangement would be fine, given that the defense is no longer expressing a concern about pushing the case beyond the July 4 holiday.\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs' trial is ending, closing arguments to begin: What to expect\n\nProsecution told jury sex trafficking can happen without completed commercial sex act\n\nInto the evening on June 25, lawyers for Combs and the prosecution continue to make their cases to the judge on how he should instruct the jury about the charges the music mogul faces.\n\nProsecutor Madison Smyser said it's important for jurors to understand that sex trafficking may sometimes have occurred without a completed commercial sex act. She gave the example of when Combs was seen on hotel security camera footage throwing Ventura Fine to the ground near an elevator and then dragging her.\n\nVentura Fine testified this took place during a freak off, after Combs hit her and she attempted to leave. Smyser said the prosecution may argue in its closing that the alleged incident demonstrated sex trafficking, even if a commercial sex act didn’t follow.\n\nHave Diddy's charges been dropped? What we know about prosecutors' ditched theories\n\nCombs' lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, argued that Combs would be \"severely prejudiced\" by that instruction, even if it's consistent with existing law, because the prosecution has repeatedly tried its case against Combs as if a commercial sex act is required. Smyser replied that Combs' defense team has been on notice since the beginning of the case that some commercial sex acts may not have been completed.\n\nThe judge said he was leaning towards the prosecution on the issue, but would consider the matter further.\n\nProsecutors drop some kidnapping, arson and sex trafficking claims 'to streamline'\n\nIn a June 24 court filing obtained by USA TODAY, prosecutors indicated they are dropping some of their claims about Combs' alleged criminal acts ahead of June 26 closing arguments. The details were included in U.S. attorneys' letter to a judge about jury instructions for deliberation.\n\nSpecifically, they no longer want jurors to consider allegations that Combs engaged in criminal racketeering by attempting kidnapping in California and New York and attempting arson in California – both of which were related to an alleged break-in at Kid Cudi's house and explosion in his car. They are similarly dropping a claim that Combs aided and abetted sex trafficking.\n\nThat doesn’t necessarily mean Combs is in the clear on all related allegations. The indictment he faces accused him not just of attempting arson and kidnapping, but also of committing arson and kidnapping outright, as part of a criminal conspiracy. Combs also still faces multiple charges related to sex trafficking.\n\nProsecutors said they were dropping the charges in light of the judge’s desire \"to streamline\" the instructions he will give to jurors after closing arguments.\n\nWhat's going on in the Diddy trial today?\n\nSubramanian is holding what's known as a charging conference with prosecutors and Combs' lawyers. That's where both sides discuss − and debate − the instructions that will be given to the jury.\n\nCombs has seemed interested at times as lawyers have poured through the instructions page by page, nodding as his attorneys have called for technical changes or additions.\n\nWhat is Diddy's net worth? Still wealthy, but now worth almost half as much: Forbes\n\nIn 2024, Forbes magazine estimated Combs’ net worth at $400 million – a significant drop from its 2019 figure of $740 million. Both Combs and his team later claimed he was a billionaire, Forbes said, despite offering no documentation to back up the claim.\n\nAccording to publicly available documents and news reports, Combs' most valuable personal possession is likely his 17,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom mansion, appraised at more than $61 million, in the tony Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. It was raided as part of a criminal probe and listed for sale last September.\n\nIs Diddy in jail?\n\nThe disgraced music mogul is in custody, and, despite repeated attempts at bail, has remained confined to the Special Housing Unit in Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center. He has been in jail since his arrest on Sept. 16, 2024.\n\nWhy didn't Diddy's lawyers call any witnesses?\n\nProsecutors spent weeks calling dozens of witnesses in their arguments against Combs. The jury heard from his former girlfriends and business associates, federal agents, security officers and others.\n\nBut his lawyers wrapped up their case in less than 30 minutes without calling anyone to the stand. Why?\n\nOne factor to note: Defendants in criminal cases aren't required to present evidence, and judges instruct juries not to hold that against defendants. To win a guilty verdict, prosecutors have to prove their cases beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCombs' lawyers haven't explained why they didn't call any witnesses. But they may think prosecutors haven't cleared that bar, or they don't want to risk calling a witness who could sway the jury against their client.\n\nBaby oil, Cialis: Diddy demands laundry list of supplies for 'freak off'\n\nAs prosecutors wrapped up their argument, jurors saw and heard messages from Combs demanding supplies for an alleged \"freak off.\"\n\n\"There's no more baby oil,\" Combs said in one audio message to his chief of staff Kristina \"KK\" Khorram, chuckling. \"I can’t believe I’m out of baby oil.\" He thought he had 20 bottles at the time.\n\nIn a separate message to Khorram, Combs said he needed \"five more bottles of everything.\" Later, his team responded that they were bringing him baby oil, lubricant from the brand Astroglide, his Apple TV and multiple lattes.\n\nCombs continued to send audio messages, one asking for vegetable soup and another in which he said, \"Can security bring me some money? I need $5,000.\"\n\nIn another message he asked for \"a Cialis, please,\" joking \"See? I'm going to keep on calling you to make sure you have everything I need.\" Cialis is a prescription medication used to treat erectile dysfunction.\n\nDiddy says he doesn't want to testify during trial\n\nThe rapper verbally confirmed on June 24 he did not want to take the stand – one of the only times Combs spoke out loud during his weekslong trial.\n\nCombs exchanged a few remarks with the judge, saying he was doing \"great\" and that he thought the judge was managing the trial well. He said it was \"solely my decision\" not to to testify, and he \"thoroughly\" discussed it with his legal team.\n\nHas the Diddy trial reached a verdict?\n\nNo, a verdict has not yet been reached in Combs' criminal case.\n\nFollowing presentations from prosecutors and Combs' attorneys, which wrapped June 24, the trial will now enter closing arguments before the jury is sent into deliberations. Closing arguments are expected to begin Thursday, June 26 and stretch into the following day.\n\nDefense attorney Teny Geragos said both prosecutors and defense lawyers estimate their arguments will last four hours each.\n\nRegarding jury deliberations, a meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, June 25, in which prosecutors and Combs' attorneys will talk about jury instructions with Judge Subramanian. Jurors won't be present for the discussion.\n\nDiddy's eerie favorite TV show revealed by ex-girlfriend\n\nCombs' ex-girlfriend, who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" revealed on June 10 the eerie TV show Combs reportedly counts as his favorite.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Jane said she \"endured\" nights in hotels with escorts because she wanted to spend time with Combs – bathing him, rubbing his feet, cuddling with him and watching the NBC true crime series \"Dateline\" until he fell asleep.\n\nA centerpiece of \"Dateline\" programming is highlighting injustices and crimes perpetrated by men against women.\n\nFormer Diddy aide Mia says rapper assaulted Cassie at Brad Pitt movie premiere\n\nCombs' former assistant, a woman who went by the pseudonym \"Mia,\" testified on June 2 that she witnessed a 2012 discussion between Combs and Ventura Fine escalate into physical violence at the premiere of the Brad Pitt film \"Killing Them Softly,\" which took place at the Cannes Film Festival in France.\n\nShe claimed she saw Combs grit his teeth while digging his nails into Ventura Fine's arm, and eventually insisted that Ventura Fine leave, which she did.\n\nDiddy's ex-assistant talks 50 Cent feud\n\nCapricorn Clark, another former assistant of Combs who took the stand, recalled an incident concerning the rapper's longtime feud with fellow emcee 50 Cent.\n\nOn May 27, Clark testified she was accompanying Combs to an MTV office to speak to reporters when she overheard him tell his security guard that he didn't like \"nonsense\" in his work, but he did \"like guns.\" Clark noted that 50 Cent was at the MTV offices that day, and \"he had an issue with\" the rapper.\n\nCombs and 50 Cent's rivalry dates back nearly 20 years. The \"Get Rich or Die Tryin\" rapper, born Curtis Jackson, is producing a docuseries to premiere on Netflix about the allegations against Combs.\n\nBritney Spears, Michael B. Jordan, Rihanna: Diddy trial filled with celebrity name-drops\n\nAlthough Ventura Fine and Kid Cudi have arguably been the biggest names to testify at Combs' trial, several Hollywood A-listers were name-dropped throughout the rapper's high-profile case.\n\nSome of these stars included pop singers Rihanna, Beyoncé and Britney Spears; R&B singer-songwriter Usher; music executive Jimmy Iovine; and actor Michael B. Jordan.\n\nDuring her May 15 testimony, Ventura Fine said Combs suspected that she was in a relationship with Jordan after the pair broke up in 2015, alleging the rapper attempted to get in contact with her afterward.\n\nFormer Diddy aide Capricorn Clark alleges physical violence, Kid Cudi break-in\n\nIn emotional testimony, Clark alleged the hip-hop mogul kidnapped her and threatened to kill her multiple times while she worked for him.\n\nWhile on the stand May 27, Clark claimed she was once held against her will for five days after several pieces of jewelry went missing at the rapper's home. She said she was \"petrified\" and forced to take polygraph tests over and over again.\n\nShe also described an alleged break-in carried out by Combs, during which he rushed to Kid Cudi's Los Angeles home with a gun after he learned the fellow rapper, born Scott Mescudi, was dating Combs' ex-girlfriend Ventura Fine.\n\nWhy was baby oil found at Diddy's home?\n\nDuring a September 2024 press conference, U.S. attorney Damian Williams detailed the paraphernalia discovered during the federal raids of Combs' homes. The items included multiple AR-15 guns, large-capacity magazines, \"evidence\" of Combs' alleged sex crimes and over 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.\n\nAccording to Combs' original indictment, the baby oil bottles were used during the hip-hop mogul's alleged \"freak-off\" parties, which were described as \"elaborate and produced sex performances\" that involved sex workers.\n\nCombs and his employees conducted \"freak offs\" by booking hotel rooms and stocking them with supplies such as baby oil, lube, extra bedsheets and lighting, per the indictment. The rapper allegedly \"arranged, directed\" and \"masturbated\" during these sometimes dayslong \"performances,\" and drugs were reportedly distributed to victims, in part, to keep them \"obedient and compliant.\"\n\nWhat is Diddy charged with?\n\nCombs is facing federal sex-crimes and trafficking charges in a sprawling case that has eroded his status as a power player and kingmaker in the entertainment industry.\n\nHe was arrested in September 2024 and later charged with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The rapper has pleaded not guilty to the five counts against him.\n\nWhat is a RICO? Racketeering meaning\n\nRacketeering is the participation in an illegal scheme under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Statute, or RICO, as a way for the U.S. government to prosecute organizations that contribute to criminal activity.\n\nUsing RICO law, which is typically aimed at targeting multi-person criminal organizations, prosecutors allege that Combs coerced victims, some of whom they say were sex workers, through intimidation and narcotics to participate in \"freak offs\" – sometimes dayslong sex performances that federal prosecutors allege they have on video.\n\nHow to stream the Diddy trial\n\nThe trial will not be televised, as cameras are typically not allowed in federal criminal trial proceedings.\n\nUSA TODAY will be reporting live from the courtroom.

The latest news is at the top.\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and breathing trouble. Most develop only mild symptoms. But some people, usually those with other medical complications, develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, which can be fatal.\n\nTuesday, July 21, 2020\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial outlook for the Burlington International Airport is stable, the airport announced Tuesday.\n\nMoody's Investors Service affirmed the airport's Baa2 credit rating with the stable outlook earlier this month. The rating, according to Moody's, means the airport's obligations are medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk, but that it has a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\n\n________________\n\nProperty taxes for Williston residents will be a bit higher than expected this year due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic delayed construction in the town, which impacted property values, the town stated in a news release. As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15. The other two deadlines will remain the same.\n\n________________\n\nMonday, July 20, 2020\n\nThree full-time staff were laid off at Colchester Parks and Recreation due to diminished demand for camps and recreation programs during the pandemic, Town Manager Aaron Frank announced last week.\n\n\"Please do what you can to help towards positive changes in COVID outcomes that will allow us to bring back these valuable programs and staff that help make Colchester a great place to live, work and play,\" Frank wrote in a newsletter.\n\nOn a more upbeat note, the town announced that rehabilitation work on the Colchester Causeway is moving along ahead of schedule. If the trend holds, the breathtaking walk/bike trail across a portion of Lake Champlain will re-open by early September.\n\n________________\n\nTen new cases of COVID-19 were reported to the state's health department Monday morning, bringing the cumulative state total to 1,360.\n\nThree people are currently hospitalized with the virus, the same number as yesterday.

The change also affects the numbers in the 'Total People Tested' graph and 'People Tested by Day' graph. A new map on the dashboard, 'Percent of Population Tested by County,' shows the percent of residents by county that have been tested.\"\n\n___________\n\nTakeaways from Gov. Scott's Friday news conference include the following:\n\nVermont's Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine gave an update on the Manchester situation (with 59 people who had positive antigen tests): 17 had PCR tests, \"which is recommended to confirm the positive antigen result.\" Of this group, two tested positive .\n\nSchool re-openings: Scott said he expects Vermont will use a hybrid model featuring remote and in-person learning.

Eight hospitalizations are under investigation. Deaths remain at 56.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,099 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease, with a total of 77,624 people have been tested.\n\n_________\n\nA preliminary outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Windham County was announced by state officials Tuesday during Gov. Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15. The second round is expected to launch in October, and will cover between June 16 to Sept. 30.\n\n_________\n\nBurlington School District will host a series of town hall meetings this week, inviting community members to learn about and participate in the district's plans to reopen schools this fall.\n\nThe meetings will be conducted virtually via Zoom and split between two days to allow both families and staff the opportunity to ask questions and hear from school administrators about the reopening.\n\nThe town hall meeting for families will meet 7 p.m. on July 15, whereas a meeting for staff will be conducted the following day, at 7 p.m. on July 16.\n\n“This is a key moment in our planning process,\" said Tom Flanagan, the new superintendent for Burlington School District when began his tenure on July 1st.\n\n\"We need to hear from the community in order to finalize our plans and inform our families so they can start planning their lives.\"\n\nFor more information, those interested can visit the district's website via this link. The meeting will also be aired live through the district's YouTube and Facebook pages.

There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,096 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n76,581 people have been tested for the virus.\n\nNOTE: The Free Press noticed the numbers regarding new and total case counts didn't align from July 11 to July 13 and subsequently reached out to the Health Department. Ben Truman with the department said in an email that this is why there is a notice that this data is preliminary. He provided an example: A person who tested positive might no longer get counted if it is learned that they don't live in Vermont.\n\n_________\n\nSunday, July 12, 2020\n\nFourteen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,296.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day.

Phil Scott announced at a press conference Friday. Individuals from counties in these states that have less than 400 cases per million people can travel to Vermont without the 14 day quarantine mandate required of other travelers.\n\nThese states are:\n\nOhio\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDelaware\n\nMaryland\n\nWest Virginia\n\nVirginia\n\nThe District of Columbia\n\nThis accounts for about 19 million people across 216 counties, a population which Scott hopes will support the struggling hospitality industry in the state. Travelers must travel by personal vehicle, and cannot fly or take a bus or train.\n\nVermont has already allowed travel without quarantine from low-risk counties in New York, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.\n\n__________\n\nThursday, June 25, 2020\n\nSeven new cases of COVID-19 reported in Vermont on Thursday brought the total number of positive cases to 1,191, according to Health Department data.\n\nThree people are hospitalized with COVID-19, while 12 people are hospitalized and under investigation for the virus.

According to Levine we are \"clearly on a downward and stable slope.\" He said it takes time for numbers to peter out because of the 7 to 14 day incubation perid.\n\nRutland County cluster: A Rutland County employer in the Fair Haven area has 12 cases within its population. Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro. Levine said the number of cases there is less than 10 but would not give an exact number as to not inadvertently identify the family.\n\nLevine said a cluster is when cases are confined to one main source such as a family, household or business and not distributed across the population. The term outbreak is used when transmission is beyond one particular source, he said.\n\n__________\n\nThere were 20 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state cumulative total to 1,184. Hospitalizations increased to four (from two) and those hospitalized under investigation decreased from 17 to 9 over the last 24 hours.\n\nDeaths remained at 56.

This rule applies to students living on and off campus.\n\n_____________\n\nState officials said Monday that recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in other states came after residents started to be lax in their compliance with guidelines for health and safety from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nVermont’s Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said 12 states recently set records for the number of new cases in a single day. The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

The grant comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. COVID-19 has disrupted many services of support and recovery for Vermonters struggling with mental health issues and substance abuse.\n\n________\n\nStarting tomorrow, June 19, Vermont will begin the opening of long-term care facilities, according to the Vermont Department of Health. These facilities can allow two guests per resident per day, so long as those visits occur outside and follow social distancing protocols.\n\nVermonters over 65 will no longer be required to stay home. The Health Commissioner suggests that those individuals do continue to take safety precautions if they choose to leave their homes.\n\n________\n\nOne new death related to COVID-19 was reported Thursday by the Vermont Department of Health. The state's total fatalities related to the coronavirus now stand at 56.\n\nSix new cases of the disease were reported in the department's mid-morning update, for a cumulative total of 1,135. Three of the cases are in Chittenden County. Addison, Bennington and Rutland counties each had one new case.\n\nStatewide, about 917 people have recovered from the virus and 54,745 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are hospitalized for the disease, the department said; nine people are hospitalized and under investigation as possible cases.\n\n________\n\nU.S. and state flags will be lowered to half-staff on Friday at all state facilities as part of a monthly observance of Vermonters who have died due to COVID-19, Governor Phil Scott announced.\n\nVermont's first fatality from the new coronavirus took place March 19, 2020. A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

Among those with annual incomes of less than $20,000, in the biggest change, a three-point Trump edge over Biden in June has become a 23-point Harris advantage over Trump in August.\n\nShe has succeeded in doing what Biden never could this year: lead Trump. Her advantage is within the survey's margin of error, and the poll was taken after the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which rallied party spirits.\n\nAt least for the moment, though, the findings reflect momentum in Harris' direction as the sprint to the general election is poised to begin.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 likely voters, taken by landline and cellphone Sunday through Wednesday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. With the election approaching, the survey is now measuring likely voters; previous polls were of registered voters.\n\nWithout the customary rounding of results, her edge would be closer to four points than five, 47.6%-43.3%.\n\nThe success of 'Brat Summer' and targeted appeals\n\nThe findings underscore the success of the targeted appeals at the Democratic convention last week.\n\n\"With the 'Brat Summer' of Kamala Harris emojis winding down, young people, persons of color, and low-income households have swung dramatically toward the vice president,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"These same demographics were emphasized and woven together by numerous speakers at the convention.\"\n\nAmong the biggest shifts since June, all outside the poll's margin of error:\n\nVoters 18 to 34 years old moved from supporting Trump by 11 points to supporting Harris by 13 points, 49%-36%.\n\nHispanics, a group the Republican campaign has been cultivating, moved from supporting Trump by two points to supporting Harris by 16 points, 53%-37%.\n\nBlack voters, traditionally one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic groups, moved from supporting Biden by 47 points to supporting Harris by 64 points, 76%-12%.\n\nLower-income voters now support Harris 58%-35%. She has emphasized her commitment to creating an \"opportunity economy\" that makes housing more affordable and tackles price-gouging on food, although she hasn't released detailed policy plans.\n\nKeeping up with Washington? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\n'I'm very excited to vote for a woman'\n\nVoters of all stripes say the election has been transformed. Harris is the first woman of color and the first person of South Asian descent to be nominated for president by a major party. At 59, she is a generation younger than Trump, the former president, who is 78, and Biden, who is 81.\n\n\"I think people are cautiously optimistic that they're going to have a lot better chance with Harris than they would have had with Biden going head-to-head with Trump,\" said Amy Hendrix, 46, of Fort Worth, Texas. An independent who usually votes Democratic, she was among those called in the poll. \"I'm very excited to vote for a woman, and that's just the truth.\"\n\nBut Jason Streem, also 46, a dentist from the Cleveland suburbs who supports Trump, objected to the way Harris became the nominee.\n\n\"She was never part of the running process,\" he said in a follow-up interview. \"She never received the primary votes.\" He called it \"the most undemocratic way of picking a nominee.\"\n\nBiden stepped back from his reelection race a little more than a month ago, under pressure by party leaders and donors who feared he could not win. That opened the door for an unprecedented quick switch to Harris for the nomination.\n\nIn the USA TODAY/Suffolk poll, Biden's vote share this year never topped 37.5%, and he trailed Trump from as little as half a percentage point last spring − basically, a tie − to nearly four points immediately after the Biden-Trump debate in early summer.\n\nThis was the first survey since independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump. Independent Cornel West is now at 2%. Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are at 1% each.\n\nWhen voters supporting third-party candidates were asked for their second choice, 32% said Harris, 24% West and 15% Trump.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/03/iowa-swing-state-trump-harris-election/76029143007/", "title": "Iowa as a swing state? Iowa Poll shows Harris and Trump in tight race", "text": "From staff reports\n\nDes Moines Register\n\nCould red-state Iowa be shifting back to purple as a presidential swing state?\n\nThe new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by 3 percentage points in the state, 47% to 44% – a result that suggests Iowa is in play with Election Day fast approaching.\n\nYet neither campaign has treated Iowa and its six Electoral College delegates as up for grabs.\n\nHarris and Trump have made repeated visits to this cycle’s seven swing states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – where campaigns and political experts have thought for months that either candidate has a chance to win each state.\n\n7 Counties in 7 Days: A cross-country road trip to 7 key places in the battle for president\n\nNeither Harris nor Trump has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state, according to Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.\n\nWhy haven't the campaigns targeted Iowa?\n\nIt was widely believed that Trump would coast to victory. He won the state over U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton in 2016 by 9 percentage points and defeated national winner Joe Biden in Iowa by 8 points in 2020.\n\nHis campaign also spent 2023 amassing a juggernaut structure in the state that delivered a 30-percentage point win in the Iowa Caucuses in January, the largest margin in the Republican presidential caucuses’ 48-year history.\n\nHow close are the contests in the battleground states compared with Iowa?\n\nAmong the seven battleground states, the largest spread in the Real Clear Politics rolling poll average is Trump's lead of 2.7 percentage points in Arizona. The smallest spread is Harris' lead of a mere one-tenth of 1 percent in Wisconsin.\n\nThe 3 percentage-point Harris lead in the new Iowa Poll is within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. The poll of 808 likely Iowa voters was conducted by Selzer & Co. from Oct. 28-31.\n\nWhat's putting Iowa in play now?\n\nWomen, especially those who are 65 and older and those who self-identify as independents, are spearheading the shift to Harris, the poll shows. Senior women support Harris over Trump 63% to 28%, and women who are political independents favor Harris by 57% to 29%.\n\nTrump maintains large margins with groups that are core to his base: men, rural Iowans and those who describe themselves as evangelical.\n\nWas Iowa a swing state before Trump's repeat wins?\n\nYes. It cemented that reputation with the 2000 and 2004 races, which saw whisker-thin margins and reversals between the two parties.\n\nDemocratic Vice President Al Gore won Iowa in 2000 over the eventual national winner, Republican George W. Bush, by about 4,000 votes, or 0.3%. Then four years later in another squeaker, Bush got his payback, defeating his Democratic rival, U.S. Sen. John Kerry, by 10,000 votes, or 0.7%.\n\nBut the state flipped back again in 2008, when Democrat Barack Obama took Iowa by storm. The freshman U.S. senator from neighboring Illinois had built a robust ground game on his way to winning the Iowa Caucuses over former U.S. Sen. John Edwards and Clinton, the early favorite. Obama coasted to a 10 percentage-point win over Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain.\n\nThen Obama won Iowa again in 2012, defeating Republican Mitch Romney, by 6 percentage points. But that was followed by Trump’s win, flipping Iowa back into the Republicans’ column.\n\nSo is Iowa's red-state status shading back to purple?\n\nEven if Harris were to pull off a surprising win on Tuesday and Democrats did well down the ballot, it would be hard to argue that Iowa is anything but Republican red.\n\nRepublican Gov. Kim Reynolds won her second full term in 2022 by 19 percentage points. Republicans hold large majorities in the Iowa Senate and Iowa House.\n\nA good night by Democrats Tuesday could shrink the margins but isn't expected to change control. And Iowa heads into Election Day with an entirely Republican congressional delegation: both U.S. senators, neither of whom is up for reelection this year, and all four U.S. House members.\n\nAnalysts at Cook Political Report have rated the 1st and 3rd districts as \"toss-ups\" but expect Republicans to be reelected in the 2nd and 4th districts.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/07/marquette-poll-shows-harris-trump-in-a-dead-heat-in-wisconsin/74639125007/", "title": "New Marquette poll shows Kamala Harris, Donald Trump in a dead ...", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are in a statistical dead heat in Wisconsin, according to a Marquette University Law School poll that for the first time measures the updated head-to-head matchup.\n\nAmong registered voters, 50% supported Trump and 49% supported Harris. Among likely voters, 50% supported Harris and 49% supported Trump, according to the poll released Wednesday. When polling for President Joe Biden and Trump, Biden was at 42% and Trump at 47% among registered voters.\n\n\"Harris, by replacing Biden, has really made up this deficit that had been created with Biden's problem with the debate,\" poll director Charles Franklin said. \"The party obviously just really quickly coalesced around (Harris), and that has boosted people's perceptions of her in terms of favorability.\"\n\nWhen factoring in third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Harris led Trump by two percentage points, 45% to 43%. Kennedy is polling at 8% among registered voters in Wisconsin, the same as he polled in June and down from 13% and 17% in earlier months.\n\nThe new poll surveyed 877 registered voters, between July 24 and Aug. 1. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.6 percentage points. There were 801 likely voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 points. Starting next month, the poll will emphasize likely voters as the November election draws closer, Franklin said.\n\nThe results released Wednesday are the first installment of the poll since Biden dropped out of the race July 21 and Harris became the Democratic nominee. The June poll before his exit showed Biden essentially tied with Trump in Wisconsin, but with lagging voter enthusiasm for Biden.\n\n\"Democrats had been unenthusiastic about Biden all year. After the debate, a lack of enthusiasm, I think, turned to near depression. When he made that decision, it opened the door to a fresh campaign,\" Franklin said.\n\nIn the new poll, respondents who considered themselves \"very enthusiastic\" to vote still leaned toward Trump 52% to Harris' 47%. That narrows the numbers from June, when that group leaned 61% for Trump to 39% for Biden. Harris has a slight lead among \"somewhat enthusiastic\" voters.\n\n\"Now, we're seeing nearly equal levels of enthusiasm within Republicans and Democrats. Republicans have a small edge still, but it's a very small edge,\" Franklin said.\n\nNearly 80% of Wisconsin registered voters thought Biden made the right decision to withdraw from the race, including 91% of Democrats. A third of voters said Biden should resign before the end of his term, and 58% said he should serve out the remainder of his presidency.\n\nJD Vance viewed more unfavorably than favorably\n\nThe survey was released just an hour before Harris was set to speak at a rally in Eau Claire, her second stop in a tour of battleground states with running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance was also expected to make remarks in the same city.\n\nIn the poll, 31% of Wisconsin voters viewed Vance favorably and 41% unfavorably, while 29% did not give an opinion. More than three-quarters of Republicans considered Vance an \"excellent\" or \"good\" pick for vice president. Independents were more mixed, and two-thirds of Democrats considered Vance a \"poor\" choice.\n\nWalz was announced as Harris' running mate after the poll was conducted, so Marquette has not yet asked voters about their perceptions of him. Trump named Vance as his VP pick at the Republican National Convention, before the poll was in the field.\n\nLack of concern about Harris' age could switch the problem to Trump\n\nOn the issues, voters viewed Trump as stronger on immigration and border security, the Israel-Hamas war, the economy and foreign relations. Voters considered Harris better at handling abortion policy, health care, ensuring fair and accurate elections, and Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThose were the same issues that Biden led on, but Harris had higher margins that gave her an advantage compared to Biden. And while age was one of the biggest issues for the 81-year-old Biden, only 12% said the same about the 59-year-old Harris. Trump is 78.\n\n\"This is obviously not an issue for her, but it flips the script because 59% say Trump is too old to be president,\" Franklin said. \"Trump has gone from the not-quite-so-old guy who didn't have as much of a problem, to now clearly being much more perceived as too old compared to Harris.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/01/12/8-talking-points-new-iowa-poll-gop-caucus-race/78695088/", "title": "8 talking points from new Iowa Poll on GOP caucus race", "text": "Jennifer Jacobs\n\njejacobs@dmreg.com\n\n© COPYRIGHT 2016, DES MOINES REGISTER AND TRIBUNE COMPANY\n\nHere are eight nuggets from the new Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll:\n\n1.

In mid-October, retired doctor Ben Carson temporarily took over as the GOP favorite.\n\nTrump’s favorability rating with women is upside-down, and the percentage of caucusgoers who view him negatively has climbed 7 points in the last month.\n\nMore of Trump’s supporters (64 percent) are concrete in their decision on whom to vote for on Feb. 1 than any other candidate’s voters.\n\nBut a majority of front-runner Ted Cruz’s supporters (51 percent) also say their minds are made up, noted Iowa Poll pollster J.

Carson has gone in the wrong direction.\n\nHe had 28 percent support in October, and is now at 11 percent.\n\n“That’s bad movement,” Stevens said. “And given the chaos of this campaign, you have to ask what reverses it?”\n\nA majority of Carson supporters say they could still be persuaded to support another candidate — and that’s an opportunity for Cruz, the poll shows.\n\nAnother worry for Carson: More of his backers are first-time caucusgoers, considered less reliable to actually turn out on caucus night.\n\nOverall, 29 percent of respondents say they're first-timers. In the 2012 GOP caucuses, 38 percent were first-timers, according to entrance polling.\n\n3. Marco Rubio isn’t benefiting much from his increased emphasis on Iowa, but the Florida U.S. senator is settling in as the “establishment” candidate in a year when an anti-establishment strain runs deep.\n\nIf Rubio can deliver a third-place finish on Feb. 1, he would be well-poised to go into New Hampshire with some momentum, strategists said.\n\n“He could fare very well if it is him versus the ‘outsiders’ — Trump and Cruz,” said GOP operative Jeff Miller, campaign manager for Rick Perry’s 2016 presidential effort.\n\nRubio inched up just 2 percentage points from 10 percent last month, but he now leads narrowly among those who say they support an “establishment” candidate.\n\n“That is solidifying as his identity,” Selzer said. “Rubio sits in a distant third place (in the horse race), so if he leads anywhere, that’s meaningful.”\n\nBut Rubio’s Iowa support is soft. A majority could still be persuaded to change their minds about him, Selzer noted.\n\nThat opens a window for Cruz; a plurality of Rubio backers say Cruz is their second choice.\n\nRubio's soft support also opens a small window for the more seasoned Bush and Christie, who could dislodge some Rubio voters if they exert maximum pressure in the next couple weeks, strategists said.\n\nMORE ON CAUCUSES:\n\n4. Religious conservatives like Cruz best.\n\nThe son of a conservative preacher takes 37 percent of the support of voters who see themselves as primarily evangelical conservatives (rather than mainstream or tea party Republicans), followed by Trump and Carson.\n\nAmong those who attend religious services at least once a week, Cruz also leads, Selzer said.\n\n5. The most determined caucusgoers like Trump, Cruz and Carson best.\n\nAmong caucusgoers overall who say their minds are made up, the race goes to Trump with 34 percent, Cruz at 30 percent and Carson at 10 percent. All others are in single digits, Selzer said.\n\n6. Who are these folks who haven't made a choice or say they could still change their minds? They make up 56 percent of likely Republican caucusgoers.\n\nThese caucusgoers are more likely to say they don’t support the tea party movement; they report household income of $70,000 or more; or they have a college degree or postgraduate education, Selzer said.\n\nBig question 4 weeks out: What will caucus avoiders do?\n\n7. A majority of Cruz’s supporters (56 percent) like his opposition to the Renewable Fuel Standard.\n\nEthanol advocates, led by the son of Iowa’s powerful Republican governor, are pounding Cruz for it, wallpapering the state with mailers warning that Cruz would be a “danger” to Iowa’s agricultural economy.\n\nAmong the overall caucus electorate, a 42 percent plurality don’t like his stance, and 37 percent find it attractive.\n\nFar more of a problem are Cruz's votes to cut the military and his lack of foreign policy experience.\n\n“It will be interesting to see if that pops up in the debate,” Selzer said, referring to the Fox Business Network debate Thursday night in South Carolina.\n\n8. Cruz has more potential for growing his support than anyone else in the race, including Trump.\n\nCruz is second choice of almost half of Trump supporters (47 percent), Selzer said. The reverse isn’t true for Trump: Only 25 percent of Cruz backers pick Trump second.\n\nAmong those who voted for Romney in 2012, a plurality are now with Cruz (26 percent). Trump is next (22 percent), pretty much mirroring the overall horse race numbers, Selzer said.\n\nAnd Cruz leads Trump by the highest margins with some of the caucuses’ most faithful voters: very conservative voters, seniors, tea party supporters, evangelical conservatives and churchgoers, and residents of Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, which is represented by U.S. Rep. Steve King, who endowed his endorsement on Cruz in November.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/21/poll-abortion-recreational-marijuana-poised-to-pass-in-florida-amendments-statewide-ballot/75770996007/", "title": "Poll: Abortion, recreational marijuana poised may pass in Florida", "text": "A new opinion poll suggests Florida voters are primed to pass two of the most contentious questions on the November ballot, approving recreational marijuana and a right to abortion.\n\nThe survey from the University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab (PORL), released early Monday, shows 66% approval for Amendment 3 on adult-use pot and the bare minimum 60% for Amendment 4 on abortion access.\n\nProposed amendments need no less than 60% approval statewide to be added to the Florida Constitution; the poll's margin of error was plus or minus roughly 3½ points.\n\n“After years of polling on marijuana in Florida, both medical and recreational, it is clear that the majority is in favor of legalization,” PORL faculty director and political science professor Michael Binder said in a statement. “Closing in on Election Day, despite some heavy campaigning, we’re seeing support for this amendment and is on track to exceed the 60% supermajority required to pass.”\n\nIn fact, Binder added, support \"has increased by two points since the last PORL statewide poll in July of this year, in which 64% of likely voters indicated a vote of 'yes.' ”\n\nOn the other hand, support for the abortion amendment \"just reached the threshold for a supermajority,\" Binder said, with another 32% opposed and 8% undecided.\n\nAmendment 4 would overturn current Florida law prohibiting most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, bringing the state back to where it had been for the 49 years that Roe v. Wade was the nation’s law, allowing most abortions until \"fetal viability,\" or about 24 weeks.\n\n“Since campaigning has picked up against the amendment, support for abortion protection has dropped from 69% of likely voters back in July,” Binder said. “Now, just barely reaching the 60% it needs to pass, it looks like the fate of abortion in Florida will come down to turnout on Election Day.”\n\nThe latest poll results come as Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration has put on a full-court press against both measures. For example, he’s used taxpayer funds to pay for public service announcements issued by state agencies attacking both amendments. That's drawn several legal actions to block them, most of which have so far failed.\n\nMoreover, his Department of State released a report last week alleging widespread fraud in the petition process that enabled the abortion measure to get on the ballot. The petition gathering group denies any wrongdoing. The report led an anti-abortion rights group to file a lawsuit attempting to get the results of vote on Amendment 4 thrown out, even if it passes.\n\nIn other poll numbers:\n\nDonald Trump up by 10 in Florida over Kamala Harris\n\n∎ Former President Donald Trump is now ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris by 10 percentage points in Florida in the race for the White House, the poll shows.\n\nOf those polled, 53% of respondents said they'd vote for Trump, 43% for Harris, 2% said they would vote for another candidate and 2% were undecided.\n\nNo clear winner in US Senate race\n\n∎ No one received a majority in the race for U.S. Senate. Republican incumbent Rick Scott received 49% support in the poll, Democratic challenger and former member of Congress Debbie Mucarsel-Powell got 46%. Also, 1% said they would vote for someone else and 4% were undecided.\n\nIn both races for president and Senate, \"undecided respondents were then asked in a follow-up question who they lean toward if they had to choose between the candidates. In addition, responses were recorded from those who refused to take the survey, but volunteered who they would vote for before hanging up the phone. These 'leaners' and 'blurters' are included,\" the news release for the poll explained.\n\nHere's why: “Hurricane Milton making landfall smack dab in the middle of our field period for this poll proved a big challenge, so we made some methodological choices to increase our coverage and ensure a representative sample,” Binder said.\n\n“Prior research tells us that the folks who blurt out their candidate vote choice and then hang up are very likely to vote, and most of those ‘blurters’ are Trump supporters. This might help explain why his lead widened to 10 points, up from 7 in our last poll back in July.”\n\nSchool board amendment appears doomed\n\n∎ Amendment 1, which would allow partisan elections for county school boards, seems poised to fail, the poll suggests.\n\nOf those polled, 41% were in favor, 30% opposed and another 30% said they did not know. “The large number of folks who said they don’t know may be partially due to the confusing legal language, especially when read over the phone, more than people being truly undecided on the issue,” Binder said.\n\nIf enacted, candidates' political parties would be listed with their names on ballots, the way they were before voters decided to make them nonpartisan in 1998.\n\nHow the poll was performed\n\nAccording to the news release, the poll consisted of a random sample of 977 likely Florida voters across Florida's 10 major media markets, was conducted Oct. 7-18, and was sourced from the September 2024 Florida voter file, using a mix of landline and cell phone numbers.\n\n\"A voter was included in the sampling frame if they had voted in any of the 2016, 2018, 2020, or 2022 general elections, or the 2020, 2022, or 2024 primary elections. ... Respondents who said they would 'probably' or 'definitely' not vote in the upcoming election, or refused to answer, were screened out.\"\n\nThis story contains previously reported information.

They suppress,” Trump said. “And it actually should be illegal.”\n\nJ. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., the firm that conducts the Iowa Poll, said in a statement Sunday that it’s common for candidates to question unfavorable polling.\n\n“I think this poll stands a good chance of motivating Republicans to get out and vote,” Selzer said. “They may have thought they’d win easily. So, it's hard to think it’s suppression.”\n\nThe Iowa Poll showed Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely Iowa voters ― those who have already voted or who say they will \"definitely\" vote. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\n\nIt was a surprising result in a state that Trump previously carried twice. The poll set the internet ablaze Saturday night and provided fodder for Sunday talk shows as analysts picked apart the results and observers churned out social media memes.\n\nOn Truth Social Sunday morning, Trump touted his support for Iowa farmers and denigrated the poll for being conducted by \"a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time.\"\n\nBut the Iowa Poll has a long history of accurately assessing the state of the race on the weekend before a general election, including the last two presidential races.\n\nIn 2016 and 2020, the Iowa Poll was one of few polls that picked up on Trump’s unexpected strength going into Election Day.\n\nIn 2016, the Iowa Poll showed Trump up 7 percentage points over Democrat Hillary Clinton before he ultimately won the state by 9 percentage points.\n\nAnd in 2020, it showed him leading Democrat Joe Biden by 7 points before he won the state by 8 percentage points.\n\nEarlier this year, the Iowa Poll showed Trump leading Biden by 18 percentage points.\n\nDespite that, the former president discounted the results Sunday. His team pointed to a separate poll conducted by Emerson College that shows him leading in Iowa.\n\n“And we even have the polls up,\" Trump said at his rally in Pennsylvania. \"But I think it’s much more than the polls. You know the polls, I’m telling you, you can make those suckers sing. You get the right pollster you can do — and you do — you really do inflict damage. You know when you do like this person from Iowa. Today, the election essentially is really, we’re talking turkey, comes out with a poll — different from every other poll. Because it wasn’t even in question. It’s really the opposite way. I’m way up.”\n\nIowa’s Republican leaders joined his dismissals, calling the Iowa Poll an outlier.\n\n“Iowa Republicans are leading in early voting for the first time in decades, and have increased our voter registration advantage by 130,000+,” Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds tweeted Saturday night. “President Trump will win Iowa if we vote and turnout our friends. Let’s prove the Des Moines Register wrong again!”\n\nThe final Iowa Poll of the 2018 governor’s race showed Reynolds down 2 percentage points against her Democratic challenger — a result that also was within the poll’s margin of error. She ended up winning by about 3 percentage points.\n\nDemocrats in Iowa cheered the result while cautioning their supporters that they need to continue volunteering, knocking doors and turning out to vote.\n\n“The fact that Vice President Harris now leads Donald Trump in the latest Des Moines Register poll is obviously very exciting for us,” Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a Saturday night news conference. “But I recognize that the folks here in Iowa are smart, and they know the difference between a poll and the results of an election. We have three more days before this election. So remember, this is just a poll, and what really matters is that Iowans show up and make their voices heard.”\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, said she is “pleasantly surprised, but not shocked” by the results.\n\nShe said the results match what she’s hearing on the ground from women across the political spectrum after the state's GOP-backed six-week abortion ban took effect earlier this summer.\n\n“They are sick and tired of politicians interfering in their doctor's offices and are looking for people up and down the ballot who are going to actually fight for their freedoms,” Konfrst said. “And this issue is salient and real, and the fact that Vice President Harris all the way down to candidates for the Iowa House are talking about the same rights and freedoms, shows that this is what Iowans are looking for.”\n\nElection Day is Tuesday, and polls are open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Des Moines Register.

They are snapshots in time that help news outlets and the general public better understand what likely voters are thinking and what issues are important to them at that moment.\n\nBut many look to polls conducted shortly before an election to get a better sense of how Election Day might go.\n\nIn Iowa, The Des Moines Register has been conducting the Iowa Poll since 1943, when it first had pollsters fan out across the state to interview Iowans on their doorsteps. Since 1987, J. Ann Selzer has led the Iowa Poll, first as a Register staffer and on a contract basis since 1997 with her firm Selzer & Co.\n\nWhen an Iowa Poll is released, readers often wonder how close past polls have tracked to the eventual election results. Here's a look at Iowa Polls ahead of U.S. presidential elections for the last 20 years.\n\n2020: Final Iowa Poll shows Donald Trump with lead over Joe Biden\n\nThe final 2020 Des Moines Register/Mediacom Poll was conducted Oct. 26-29, 2020, just days ahead of the Nov. 3, 2020 election. The results showed then-President Donald Trump leading in the state: 48% to Joe Biden's 41%.\n\nThe 7-point lead was a shift from a September 2020 Iowa Poll that showed the race in the state was tied.\n\nIt aligned closely with the final results when Trump won Iowa by 8 points (53% to 45%).\n\n2016: Final Iowa Poll shows Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton\n\nAfter voting for President Barack Obama in back-to-back elections, Iowa saw plenty of campaigning from both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe final Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed Trump with a 7-point lead over Clinton (46% to 39%). The poll was conducted Nov. 1-4, 2016, ahead of the Nov. 8, 2016, election.\n\nIt took until 1:30 a.m. the next day for the Associated Press to call the race for Trump. Trump finished with a 9.4-point lead over Clinton (51.1% to 41.7%).\n\n2012: Final Iowa Poll has Barack Obama ahead of Mitt Romney\n\nPresident Barack Obama faced challenger Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nThe final Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll had Obama with a 5-point lead over Romney (47% to 42%).\n\nOn Election night, Obama carried the state by 6 points (52% to 46%).\n\n2008: Barack Obama has a dominant lead over John McCain in final Iowa Poll\n\nIowa helped launch Barack Obama as a presidential candidate when he won the 2008 Iowa Caucuses.\n\nHeading into Election Day, the final Iowa Poll looked like Obama would easily carry the state over challenger John McCain. The poll showed him with a 17-point lead (54% to 37%).\n\nWhen the polls closed, Obama won the state by a narrower margin: 10 points. He earned 54% of the vote, but McCain got 44%.\n\n2004: John Kerry has lead over President George W. Bush\n\nIowa was seen as a battleground state in 2004 after President George W. Bush was dogged by low job approval ratings. Iowa did not vote for Bush in 2000, instead picking former Vice President Al Gore.\n\nThe final Iowa Poll, showed U.S. Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic challenger, with a 5-point lead (48% to 43%).\n\nOn Election Night, Bush eked out a narrow win getting 49.9% of the vote compared with Kerry's 49.2%. Bush was the first Republican to win the state since Ronald Reagan in 1984.\n\nBrian Smith is the Register's audience growth strategist.

Check Freep.com for the latest.\n\nAn exclusive new Free Press poll of likely Michigan voters that showed former President Donald Trump with a notable 7-percentage-point lead over incumbent President Joe Biden in the state was released Sunday just hours before Biden, beset by questions about his age and fitness, abandoned his reelection bid.\n\nIt was not known if the poll played any role in Biden's decision to step down as the Democratic Party's nominee and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him. But without question, it added to the drumbeat of bad news for the Biden campaign in Michigan and other battleground states that had some Democrats skeptical of his chances of beating Trump and calling on him to step aside.\n\n\"It's only going to add to the pressure on Biden to step aside and have someone replace him,\" Bernie Porn, the pollster for EPIC-MRA in Lansing, which conducted the survey of 600 voters for the Free Press and its media partners, told the Free Press when the poll was released. \"The Democrats are in a difficult position.\"\n\nIn a message posted on social media shortly before 2 p.m., Biden said, \"I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nThe poll showed Trump, who held a rally in Grand Rapids on Saturday evening, leading Biden 49%-42% in a head-to-head matchup, with 9% undecided, saying they would vote for neither or refusing to answer. In a five-way race, Trump led with 43% to 36% for Biden, 8% for independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and 2% each for Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West. Again 9% said they either would not vote for president, pick someone else or were undecided.\n\nTrump led in every region of the state, including in metro Detroit — defined as Macomb, Oakland and Wayne counties and seen as the most predominantly Democratic region in Michigan — where he held a slim but remarkable 46%-44% edge in the head-to-head matchup with Biden and a 43%-38% margin in the five-way race.\n\nTrump's lead in metro Detroit was a significant indicator of how the political winds have changed for Biden, who four years ago, beat Trump 56%-40% in the region.\n\nThe poll, which came after a disastrous debate performance by Biden in late June when he struggled to form coherent answers and followed last Saturday's assassination attempt against Trump in Pennsylvania, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. EPIC-MRA began the survey the same day Trump was wounded in that assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which a spectator was killed and two other people were seriously injured. Secret Service shot and killed the gunman. The polling ended Wednesday, the third day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump accepted his party's nomination for the third time.\n\nIts result showed Trump had more than doubled his lead in Michigan, a pivotal swing state, since EPIC-MRA's last poll, done just before the June 27 presidential debate in Atlanta. In that poll, Trump led by 3 points in the head-to-head matchup.\n\nPorn, who has been doing polling in Michigan for decades, said he couldn't remember a survey he'd done showing a Republican presidential candidate in such a strong position in the state since then-Vice President George H.W. Bush ran successfully for president in 1988. Bush was the last Republican to win Michigan until Trump eked out a narrow win over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 by two-tenths of a percentage point.\n\nBiden took Michigan by about 3 percentage points over Trump four years ago on his way to winning the White House.\n\nThe new poll added to other recent ones showing growing levels of support for Trump in other swing states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, further calling into question Biden's chances of winning reelection amid questions about his age — at 81, he's already the oldest president ever — and mental fitness. Tellingly, the poll found a majority of respondents, 52%, believed Biden should step aside and not run, compared with 36% who believed he should remain the Democratic nominee. Twelve percent were undecided.\n\nMore than 30 Democratic members of Congress had called for Biden to step aside as the nominee, including one from Michigan, U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Grand Rapids.\n\nIn the poll, Democrats were split on the question of whether Biden should step aside, with 46% saying he should to 43% saying he shouldn't and 11% undecided. Independents and Republicans were more certain, with 55% of each bloc saying he should step down and 32% saying he shouldn't, with the rest undecided.\n\nImportantly, 51% of Black voters — a key Democratic constituency — said Biden should remain the nominee compared with 39% who said he should step down.\n\nThe poll found that if Biden were to step aside, 19% believed Harris should replace him as the nominee; 17% said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and 11% said former first lady Michelle Obama. Of five other names tested — California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker — none did better than single digits. Twenty percent of respondents mentioned some other name altogether.\n\nThe poll did not test any head-to-head matchups between Trump and any other potential Democratic nominee.\n\nMeanwhile, it did not appear that criticisms of Trump, either as a danger to democracy because of his actions in trying to overturn the result of the 2020 election or his criminal indictments and conviction on charges he falsified business records to hide payments to an adult film actress, were hurting him with voters: Fifty-three percent said his legal problems would have no bearing on their decision in November's general election.\n\nForty-seven percent of respondents said they feared Biden continuing as president more than they did Trump returning, compared with 43% who said they feared Trump returning more. Five percent said they feared neither more and 5% were undecided or refused to answer.\n\nThe poll also showed more voters taking a better view of Trump: 45% said they viewed him favorably, compared with 48% who viewed him unfavorably. In EPIC-MRA's last poll in June, that view was split 41% favorable, 54% unfavorable.\n\nBiden's numbers were far worse, with just 36% viewing him favorably and 57% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nVoters unfamiliar with Project 2025, reject EV efforts\n\nThe poll also showed that in at least one potential down ballot race, Democrats were outperforming Biden: In a head-to-head matchup for Michigan's open U.S. Senate seat, it had U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly, who is considered by many observers the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, leading the Republican front-runner, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, of Brighton, 43%-40%, with 17% undecided.\n\nBut those numbers still were within the margin of error in a state where no Republican has won a U.S. Senate seat in 30 years.\n\nThere also were indications that efforts by the Biden campaign to rile up voters by trying to tie Trump to the so-called Project 2025 — a vision of a conservative upending of the federal bureaucracy written by some of his former aides and advisers — hadn't had much success yet in Michigan: 57% said they knew little about it or hadn't heard of it before the pollster asked them about it; 27% said they were somewhat familiar with it; and just 15% said they were very familiar with it.\n\nAfter the pollster read a description of some of Project 2025's recommendations, including reducing taxes on corporations, eliminating the Affordable Care Act and giving the White House more control of Justice Department decisions, 65% of respondents said they disapproved of the program compared with just 25% who approved.\n\nTrump and his campaign, however, have repeatedly said that he has not endorsed Project 2025 or said he intends to implement its recommendations if reelected.\n\nMeanwhile, 55% of voters also said they disapproved of the Biden administration's push to have automakers produce and sell more electric vehicles, an effort Republicans have labeled a \"mandate.\" Forty percent said they approve of the push and 5% were undecided.\n\nOn the issues, 31% cited inflation and the high cost of living as their biggest concern and 17% noted immigration along the Southern border; both are topics Trump and the Republicans have used against Biden and the Democrats. And when it comes to one of the biggest issues of the 2022 midterm elections, abortion, 12% said protecting abortion rights was most important. Democrats have continued to hammer Trump and the rest of the GOP this election cycle on the issue of reproductive rights, but it may have less of an effect this year in Michigan after voters decided overwhelmingly to add reproductive rights' protections to the state constitution two years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nMen, white voters largely supporting Trump\n\nThe poll found that among Black voters overall, Biden had a commanding lead of 64% to 11% for Trump in the five-way race, with 15% going to third party candidates and 10% undecided, though that was less support than exit polls showed him getting from that voting bloc four years ago. Among the larger number of white voters, 48% supported Trump, compared with just 33% for Biden and 10% going to third-party candidates.\n\nAmong different age groups, Biden only won with one: voters 65 and older, 50% of whom supported him compared with 41% for Trump, 3% for third party candidates and 6% undecided or refusing to answer. Younger voters age 18-34, who are considered an important bloc for Democrats, were split 33%-33% between Biden and Trump, with 22% selecting a third-party option.\n\nMale voters overwhelmingly supported Trump, 47% to 31% for Biden. While women favored Biden, 41%-39%, it wasn't nearly strong enough to overwhelm men's support for the Republican nominee.\n\nTrump led with 84% support among Republicans, just 3% of whom said they would support Biden. Among Democrats, 77% supported Biden compared with 4% who backed Trump. The key bloc of self-described independents split 33% for Trump, 27% for Biden and 22% for a third-party candidate, with much of that support — 14% — going to Kennedy. Another 14% were undecided, refused to answer or said they would vote for someone else or not at all.\n\nThere also continued to be a education gap among voter choices: Among voters with a high school degree or less, 51% preferred Trump compared with 29% for Biden, 14% for third-party candidates and 6% undecided. Voters with some college or post-high school education favored Trump over Biden 44%-31%. Voters with college degrees supported Biden 43% to 38% for Trump, with 9% going to third-party candidates.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co. “She has clearly leaped into a leading position.”\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., who has abandoned his independent presidential campaign to support Trump but remains on the Iowa ballot, gets 3% of the vote. That’s down from 6% in September and 9% in June.\n\nFewer than 1% say they would vote for Libertarian presidential candidate Chase Oliver, 1% would vote for someone else, 3% aren’t sure and 2% don’t want to say for whom they already cast a ballot.\n\n'It's called suppression:' Trump criticizes Iowa Poll that has him trailing Kamala Harris\n\nThe poll of 808 likely Iowa voters, which include those who have already voted as well as those who say they definitely plan to vote, was conducted by Selzer & Co. from Oct. 28-31. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\n\nThe results come as Trump and Harris have focused their attention almost exclusively on seven battleground states that are expected to shape the outcome of the election. Neither has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries ended, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state.\n\nA victory for Harris would be a surprising development after Iowa has swung aggressively to the right in recent elections, delivering Trump solid victories in 2016 and 2020.\n\nThe poll shows that women — particularly those who are older or who are politically independent — are driving the late shift toward Harris.\n\n“Age and gender are the two most dynamic factors that are explaining these numbers,” Selzer said.\n\nIndependent voters, who had consistently supported Trump in the leadup to this election, now break for Harris. That’s driven by the strength of independent women, who back Harris by a 28-point margin, while independent men support Trump, but by a smaller margin.\n\nPollster Ann Selzer: We’ll look at data to try to understand Iowa Poll miss\n\nSimilarly, senior voters who are 65 and older favor Harris. But senior women support her by a more than 2-to-1 margin, 63% to 28%, while senior men favor her by just 2 percentage points, 47% to 45%.\n\n“I like her policies on reproductive health and having women choosing their own health care, and the fact that I think that she will save our democracy and follow the rule of law,” said Linda Marshall, a 79-year-old poll respondent from Cascade who has already cast her absentee ballot for Harris.\n\nThe registered Democrat said she identifies as pro-life but doesn’t think anyone should make that choice for somebody else.\n\n“I just believe that if the Republicans can decide what you do with your body, what else are they going to do to limit your choice, for women?” she said.\n\nOne aspect where Trump does better than Harris: A greater share of his supporters than hers say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about their pick.\n\nSeventy-six percent of Trump supporters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about their choice, while another 23% say they are mildly or not that enthusiastic.\n\nFor Harris, 71% are extremely or very enthusiastic — down from 80% in September — while 29% are mildly or not that enthusiastic.\n\nThe poll shows few likely Iowa voters remain undecided, with 91% saying their minds are made up, compared with 80% in September.\n\nThat includes 96% of Harris supporters who are firm in their choice and 95% of Trump supporters.\n\nIndependents swing to Kamala Harris, but there’s a gender gap, Iowa Poll shows\n\nIn 2020, the Register’s Iowa Poll showed that Biden and Trump were tied among all likely voters in September. But the final poll before Election Day that year showed independents breaking for Trump, and he ultimately won by 8 percentage points over Biden.\n\nThis year, independents appear to be turning the other way toward Harris — a move fueled by a growing support among independent women.\n\nIndependent likely voters, who have supported Trump in every other Iowa Poll this year, now favor Harris, 46% to 39%.\n\nNow, independent women choose Harris over Trump 57% to 29%. That’s up from September, when independent women gave her just a 5-point lead, 40% to 35%.\n\nIndependent men still favor Trump 47% to 37% — numbers that are largely unchanged from September, when independent men supported him 46% to 33%.\n\nOverall, Harris holds a 20-point lead with women, 56% to 36%, similar to where she was in September.\n\nBut Trump’s lead with men has shrunk from 27 points in September (59% to 32%) to 14 points today (52% to 38%).\n\nMya Williams, an 18-year-old college freshman and poll respondent, said she doesn’t identify with either the Democratic or Republican parties. But she’s excited to be part of the effort to elect the country’s first Black female president.\n\n“I like what she stands for and that she's a female and the opposite of what Trump stands for,” Williams said. “She's something new.”\n\nShe said she likes Harris’ stance on abortion rights, and she dislikes changes Trump made to overtime rules while he was in office.\n\nHarris holds a small lead with likely Iowa voters who are younger than 35, 46% to 44% over Trump.\n\nHarris’ larger support among likely voters 65 and older, who prefer her 55% to 36%, could be a boon, because older Iowans tend to be more reliable voters and show up at disproportionately higher rates.\n\nThe poll shows 62% of Iowans younger than 35 are likely voters, down from 73% in September.\n\nBut 93% of seniors say they are likely voters — even higher than the 84% who said so in September.\n\n“If you want a horse to ride on, you want seniors, because they vote,” Selzer said.\n\nDonald Trump holds on to base voters: Evangelicals, rural Iowans, men\n\nTrump continues to lead with his core base of support: men, evangelicals, rural residents and those without a college degree.\n\nHe carries Iowa men 52% to 38% and evangelicals 73% to 20%.\n\nJoel Funk, a 26-year-old poll respondent and Garden Grove resident, said he’s excited to cast an early ballot for Trump. The registered Republican said the economy is the biggest issue facing the country right now.\n\n“We’ve lived through four years of him (Trump) being president, and I would say they are four of the best years economically that I have lived through,” he said. “Then we’ve gotten to see four years of the opposition, and we’ve had a lot of inflation and a lot of illegal immigration — a lot of things I would say aren’t the best for America.”\n\nTrump leads with those living in rural areas (55% to 35%) and those living in towns (49% to 40%). But Harris carries those in cities (61% to 33%) and suburbs (59% to 36%).\n\nAmong those without a college degree, Trump leads 51% to 39%. And Harris gets those with a college degree, 61% to 31%.\n\nFunk, an automation engineer, dislikes that Harris was nominated without going through the usual primary process.\n\n“They kind of put her in place of Joe Biden after the actual primary polls,” he said. “So, I don’t think she was actually chosen by the people. … And based off of interviews both of them have done, she said she would maintain the same style of policies (as Biden). Which I don’t think have been that great for us.”\n\nDifferent issues drive Democrats, Republicans\n\nThe issues driving Trump supporters are very different than those driving Harris supporters, the Iowa Poll finds.\n\nTrump voters say the issue of inflation and the economy is what they’ve been thinking about most in their decision to support him. Forty-nine percent of his supporters cite it as their most important issue.\n\nAnother 25% say immigration is driving their decision.\n\nThe top issue for Harris supporters is “the future of democracy,” with 51% citing it as their most important issue. Another 22% say it’s abortion.\n\n“The voting agenda is different for each of those groups of supporters,” Selzer said.\n\nSome former Donald Trump supporters move away from him in 2024\n\nHarris holds on to the support of nearly all Democrats, with 97% saying they will support her and 0% saying they will support Trump.\n\nBut she also gets 5% of Republicans who say they will vote for her over Trump. Trump holds 89% of Republicans.\n\nThe poll shows a small universe of people who say they previously supported Trump and have now switched their vote to someone else.\n\nAmong those not supporting Trump, 16% say there was a time when they supported him, while 81% say they have never supported him. Another 3% are not sure.\n\nRalph Newbanks, a 63-year-old poll respondent from Solon, said he is a lifelong Republican who plans to vote for Harris this year.\n\n“It's not what I like about her, it's what I dislike about Trump,” he said. “Since 2020 and the Capitol riots, I couldn't vote for Trump if he paid me, not for love nor money.”\n\nHe thought about casting a ballot for a third-party candidate, but he didn’t want to lodge a protest vote. He wants to make sure Trump doesn’t return to the White House.\n\n“To me, the biggest part of democracy is the ability to compromise,” he said. “And with Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, there is no compromise, even within their own party.”\n\nOf those not supporting Trump, 67% consider themselves “never Trumpers.” Another 26% say they are not “never Trumpers,” and 8% are not sure.\n\nAmong those who say they voted for Trump in 2020, 89% say they will do so again this year, and 4% will vote for Harris.\n\nAmong those who say they voted for Biden, 93% say they will now vote for Harris, and 4% will vote for Trump.\n\nAmong those who did not vote, Harris leads 47% to 44%.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Des Moines Register.

Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex, and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent census data.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 808 Iowa likely voters have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit and, on digital platforms, links to originating content on The Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.\n\nThis story was updated to add a video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/02"}]}

In Singapore, a series of extensive tunnels are being bored into the soil some 60 meters down – below subterranean shopping malls and even the city’s metro.\n\nOriginally envisioned in the mid-1990s, the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) is an underground “superhighway” that could provide a blueprint for other cities around the world. It’s all part of a masterplan to conserve two precious resources: space and water.\n\n“We were faced with the challenges of a rising population and also increasing developments for industries,” said Woo Lai Lynn, chief engineer for the project, which is run by PUB, the national water agency. “With this added demand, we couldn’t keep on relying on expanding the existing wastewater infrastructure. We had to find a solution that was more sustainable and gave us greater resilience for our water supply.”\n\nThe first phase, which finished in 2008 and cost an estimated 3.4 billion Singapore dollars ($2.5 billion), included 48 kilometers of deep sewer tunnels and a new centralized water reclamation plant. Phase two broke ground in November 2017 and is expected to be complete by 2026, said Woo.\n\nLarge tunnel boring machines are digging a massive underground network beneath Singapore. Dan Hodge/CNN\n\nOnce finished, roughly 200 kilometers of tunnels will transport wastewater to underground treatment plants. Using massive tunnel boring machines, crews are descending underground to drill the tunnels and install a network of pipes.\n\n“The uncertainties excite me the most with this project,” said Woo. “You can’t quite tell what you’re going to encounter underground.”\n\nThe complete DTSS project will free up around 150 hectares of land above ground, according to PUB. The agency has implemented new technology based on what it learned during the first phase – including a special type of concrete that is resistant to microbiological-induced corrosion, Woo said, and embedding fiber optic cables within the tunnel linings to monitor structural integrity without needing to send as many crews underground.\n\nNot only will it help with the water supply by treating up to two million cubic meters of wastewater per day, according to Woo, but it will continue to provide critical information and lessons about subterranean development for Singapore and beyond.\n\nA valuable resource\n\nWith limited land available, the country has started utilizing its underground space for more than just transport over the last decade.\n\nJTC, a government agency responsible for industrial development, is storing liquid hydrocarbons such as crude oil in five massive underground caverns. Known as the Jurong Rock Caverns, they hold the equivalent of 600 Olympic-sized swimming pools, according to JTC – all to free up precious land above.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This massive underground project will conserve two precious resources: land and water 01:47 - Source: CNN This massive underground project will conserve two precious resources: land and water 01:47\n\nAs part of the underground master plan, Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) commissioned Arup, an independent firm of engineers, designers and planners, to evaluate and create a benchmarking study of underground space development. One of the key takeaways was a focus on sustainability “very early” in these projects, said Peter Stones, associate engineer at Arup and one of the authors of the report.\n\n“Space is a resource, and in our urban cities, it’s a scarce resource, so we need to manage and consume that resource in a sustainable way,” he said. “That means having established practices around planning and managing those spaces,” versus the “ad hoc” way underground space has been developed in most cities around the world.\n\nBy getting engineers crucial information before starting a project, Stones added, they can mitigate risks and improve the longevity and sustainability of subterranean development. That knowledge can also be applied to urban planning and development above ground.\n\nAn underground future inspired by the past\n\nSingapore is not the first place to explore using its underground space.\n\nHelsinki, the Finnish capital, has an expansive underground development – complete with subterranean church and swimming pool – originally intended as a space to house the city’s entire population in the event of a nuclear attack. In Canada, Montreal has one of the world’s largest underground pedestrian networks, spanning more than 30 kilometers.\n\nA design firm in Mexico City even developed the concept of “The Earthscraper,” an inverted, underground skyscraper.\n\nThough there is historical precedent, with ancient subterranean cities in places such as Spain and Turkey, getting humans to actually live underground today remains a tougher sell.\n\n“We see an interesting layer cake of the underground space development,” said Stones, “where those human-centered uses are really prioritized at the shallowest levels, and the deeper levels are reserved for those uses which require less human contact.”\n\n“Globally as our cities grow in terms of population (and) density … we are going to see more underground space development,” he added. “I envisage a future where the topside is prioritized for people, for ecology, for nature – and underground space can service that topside through infrastructure and through other uses.”", "authors": ["Samantha Bresnahan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/01/20/florida-winter-storm-updates-ice-snow-impacts-forecasts/77833269007/", "title": "Florida winter storm updates: Ice, snow, impacts, forecasts", "text": "Tuesday winter storm updates: Tallahassee snow chances rising but ice threat persists\n\nThe Tallahassee area is under a rare Winter Storm Warning for a potential weather event that would be remembered for generations.\n\nFreezing rain, sleet, snow and rain are expected Tuesday night into Wednesday to combine for a wintry mix that could disrupt daily life. The latest models suggest Florida's capital city could see a snowfall for the records books; others call for a debilitating ice storm.\n\nA cascade of closures, delays and postponements are underway.\n\nHere are the latest updates from the path of a storm that could make for a historic winter day in Florida.\n\nPreparing for the worst: How to keep warm if ice storm takes out power\n\nFreezing rain during an ice storm can weigh down a stretch of power lines by 500 pounds. The National Weather Service offered these tips to keeping warm if freezing rain and ice take out the power and leave you in the dark – and the cold.\n\nClose blinds or curtains to keep in some heat.\n\nClose off rooms to avoid wasting heat.\n\nWear layers of loose-fitting, lightweight, warm clothing.\n\nEat and drink.

Check on neighbors: Once your family is safe, check on your neighbors and vulnerable individuals to ensure they are okay.\n\nNational Weather Service ups snow potential in evening forecast\n\nIn its evening update, the National Weather Service is urging residents to be prepared for a \"widespread winter-weather event\" Tuesday evening into Wednesday.\n\nWhile the area will likely see a mix of rain, sleet, freezing rain and snow, forecasters bumped the possible snow accumulation for the Tallahassee area to 1 to 2 inches. Even the coastal areas near St. Marks could see about an inch of snow. Models have suggested values as high as 6 inches.\n\nBut forecasters warn that if there is warmer air aloft any frozen precipitation could tilt more toward freezing rain. Already forecasters warn that Leon and Wakulla counties could see up to a quarter of an inch of ice. That would be enough to make roads very dangerous and potentially bring down powerlines and tree limbs.\n\nAreas around St. Marks and Perry are expected to see more freezing rain than Tallahassee in the latest forecast.\n\nForecasters also brought the impact timeline forward. The earliest onset of a wintry mix for Tallahassee now could begin as early as 3-5 p.m. Tuesday with accumulation beginning at 6 p.m. and concluding at 6 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"Once snow/ice accumulations begin, travel will begin to become hazardous,\" forecasters write. \"Travel is not recommended after the onset of accumulations.\"\n\nGovernor declares a state of emergency ahead of winter storm\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency ahead of this week's hazardous winter weather that's expected to bring snow to the Florida Panhandle. For the first time in seven years, winter storm warnings are in effect from Pensacola to Jacksonville and as south as Gainesville.\n\n\"Dangerously cold wind chills and prolonged freezing and sub-freezing temperatures are expected for North and North-Central Florida for the next several days,\" the executive order says.\n\nThe order activates the National Guard and Florida Guard as needed to respond to the emergency and allows the governor to \"suspend the effect of any statute, rule, or order that would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay any mitigation, response, or recovery action necessary to cope with this emergency.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nGovernment offices, facilities shutting down Wednesday\n\nLeon County Government is battening down the hatches and closing on Wednesday. Public-facing offices, community centers, libraries and the solid waste management facility will be closed.\n\nIn their emailed briefing, the county noted that the cold night shelter continues to operate nightly from Sunday through Friday morning, \"with shelters prepared to accommodate an increased number of clients.\"\n\nModels locked in on Tallahassee snow as FDOT mobilizes\n\nThe European model has become something of the gold standard when it comes to hurricane and weather forecasting. What about when it comes to snow? Well, now we have a Tallahassee test of its accuracy.\n\nIn its afternoon run, each one of its 50 separate models that make up its ensemble declared that Florida's capital city would see at least .5 inches of snow. Such conformity is rare for a system designed to show different probabilities. In fact, total accumulations vary widely with some models calling for as much as 6 inches of snow.\n\nIn advance of whatever kind of winter weather materializes, the Florida Department of Transportation has deployed crews across North Florida and nearly 200 pieces of heavy equipment, including snow plows, de-icing equipment, and spray rigs, in anticipation of icy conditions.\n\n\"FDOT will conduct winter weather operations beginning today at 2 pm across NW Florida in preparation for freezing temperatures and precipitation forecast in the area,\" the agency wrote on X. \"Crews will deploy various tankers and bridge deck sprayers to apply anti-icing products on bridges & overpasses.\"\n\nTallahassee, Big Bend under a Winter Storm Warning\n\nIt's becoming real. National Weather Service forecasters issued a Winter Storm Warning for Tallahassee, the first such warning since 2018 when a short-lived dusting of snow with large flakes thrilled the capital city.\n\nThis time around, things could be more serious.\n\n\"Heavy mixed precipitation expected,\" the forecasters wrote in the alert. \"Total snow accumulations up to one inch and ice accumulations up to two tenths of an inch.\"\n\nThe warning means there is an 80% to 90% chance of a winter storm impacting the region.\n\n\"Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning commutes. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.\"\n\nCity of Tallahassee prepping for icy roads\n\nThe city of Tallahassee said it is working with its government agency partners to prepare roadways for the possibility of sleet, freezing rain and snow.\n\n“Hazardous travel conditions are likely,” the city said in a news release. “The city of Tallahassee is coordinating with local and state partners to prepare, including spreading sand and deicer on bridges and roadways as necessary. As winter precipitation arrives, motorists are advised to use extra caution and only be on the roads if necessary.”\n\nThe city also said it was trickling water from spigots in area parks and other public spaces as a precaution.\n\n“Signs should be posted nearby, but if you see water running lightly from a pipe when arctic air threatens, please do not turn it off,” the city said. “This is intentional. City crews are on standby to respond to service issues should they arise.”\n\nFAMU and TSC will close Tuesday as well as Wednesday\n\nFlorida A&M University and Tallahassee State College said they will close on Tuesday as well as Wednesday in anticipation of Winter Storm Enzo. The university earlier announced it would close on Wednesday.\n\nFSU cancels classes, suspends operations Tuesday and Wednesday\n\nFlorida State University announced that it will cancel classes and suspended normal business operations on Tuesday and Wednesday \"due to anticipated wintry precipitation and ice and their impact on roadways and critical services in the region.\"\n\nFSU said in a news release that the closure includes the Florida A&M University-FSU College of Engineering. The university said it will resume classes and normal operations at 5 a.m. on Thursday.\n\n\"Students are strongly encouraged to return to the Tallahassee area before road conditions are anticipated to deteriorate Tuesday evening,\" FSU said. \"There is a potential for road closures around the region, that could include Interstates, Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Residential housing operations will continue throughout the closure.\"\n\nThe university added that essential business operations will continue on both days.\n\n\"Employees designated by their department as essential personnel should consult with their supervisors,\" FSU said.\n\nSeminole Dining locations will operate on an adjusted schedule.

Full story here.\n\nEmail us at news@tallahassee.com if you'd like to announce a closure, delay or cancellation.\n\nA brief history of snow and ice in Tallahassee\n\nCould we be on the frozen precipice of history?\n\nTallahassee gets a trace of snow every now and again — in 2018, 2010 and 2004, for instance. But measurable snow has fallen only eight times since 1891, according to the Weather Service in Tallahassee.\n\nIt has snowed in Tallahassee 34 times since then, according to the University of Florida Extension Office. In general, the return period for measurable snow has been just once every 17 years in Florida’s capital city.\n\nFreezing rain is also a rarity in these parts. The last ice storm recorded in Tallahassee occurred Jan. 28-29 in 2014. Even though the city only recorded a trace amount of ice, it sill briefly shut down much of the city.\n\nFull story here.\n\nA ‘crazy’ for Florida snowpack could send temperatures into a ‘freefall’\n\nA snowpack — highly unusual for the North Florida area — could send subfreezing low temperatures plunging even further.\n\nLows are expected to drop to the mid to upper 20s over the next few nights. But the National Weather Service in Tallahassee said that could change with the total accumulation of snow and ice on the ground.\n\n“In fact, Wednesday night`s temperatures could be a little tricky depending on if there is a snowpack (crazy to say for this area!). If there is, temperatures could freefall into the 10s,” wrote NWS senior meteorologist Molly Merrifield in a morning forecast discussion.\n\nOtherwise, Merrifield said, most locations should “bottom out” in the low to mid 20s. She said a warming trend will begin Thursday afternoon with highs climbing to the upper 40s by the end of the work week and the 60s by Sunday.\n\n‘Quick burst of snow’ possible before ice in the Tallahassee area\n\nThe National Weather Service says the winter storm expected to hit the area Tuesday or Wednesday could bring an initial round of snow before changing into a wintry mix closer to the Tallahassee area.\n\nNWS Tallahassee forecasters said in their Monday morning discussion that widespread snow totals of 1-2 inches are expected along and northwest of the Flint and Apalachicola Rivers, with less than 1 inch expected south and east, which would include Tallahassee.\n\nAnd while higher snowfall totals are expected to the west, the Big Bend and south-central Georgia could see higher ice totals between a tenth and a quarter of an inch.\n\nForecasters said, however, that uncertainty remains about what kind of precipitation will fall, from rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow, and how long each type may last.\n\nNWS said ample moisture aloft will allow snowflakes to form, though they won’t hit the ground at first because they’ll go through a drier layer of air in the lowest part of the atmosphere.\n\n“It`ll take a few hours for the lower levels to saturate and allow the precipitation to reach the ground, cooling the lower-levels of the atmosphere as it does so, or wet-bulbing, to near or below freezing for most of the region,” forecasters wrote. “This should allow for a quick burst of snow at the onset for most everyone before transitioning toa wintry mix of snow, sleet, and/or freezing rain along the southern edge of the precipitation while remaining predominantly snow on the northern side.”\n\nTallahassee could get under an inch of snow, quarter inch of ice\n\nTallahassee could get a quarter of an inch of ice — enough to make roads impassable and knock out power lines — and less than an inch of snow from the winter storm forecast to hit the area.\n\n“Confidence continues to increase on the potential for an impactful winter weather event late Tuesday afternoon-Wednesday morning.,” the National Weather Service in Tallahassee said.\n\nThe storm could bring higher snowfall amounts of up to 3 inches to parts of the far western Florida Panhandle and up to 2 inches in places like Marianna and Thomasville, Georgia. A winter storm watch remains in effect for the entire area for Tuesday afternoon through early Wednesday morning.\n\nNWS said an area of low pressure moving across the Gulf of Mexico will interact with an arctic air mass that began filtering into the Deep South on Sunday. Snow, sleet and freezing rain could hit parts of North Florida, Georgia and Alabama.\n\n“The first batch of wintry precipitation is forecast to arrive as soon as Tuesday afternoon across Southeast AL and the FL Panhandle, initially as cold liquid rain before transitioning to snow or sleet,” the Weather Service said. “Precipitation chances notably increase Tuesday night and spread east to the FL Big Bend and Southwest GA where freezing rain/sleet come into play.”\n\nExactly where the low goes will play a role in how much snow or ice falls in the Tallahassee area.\n\nIt appears increasingly likely (60 to 90%) that the region experiences at least minor winter storm impacts with a low to medium (20 to 40%) chance of moderate winter storm impacts,” NWS said.\n\nWhy an ice storm can be such a weighty problem\n\nThe National Weather Service says Florida's capital city and Big Bend, already expecting a week of freezing temperatures, could be in line for as much as an inch of snow overnight Tuesday into Wednesday. Much more dire, a quarter inch of ice accumulation is also possible.\n\nIn addition to making roads hazardous, freezing rain and the ice that forms can weigh down a stretch of powerlines by 500 pounds. It can also increase the weight of a tree limb by 30 times.\n\n\"Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will likely become slick and hazardous by Tuesday night,\" forecasters wrote in the Winter Storm Warning. \"The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday morning commute. Persons should consider delaying all travel.\"\n\nHow to prepare for a winter storm\n\nFloridians are far more accustomed to preparing for squall lines and hurricanes than a winter storm.\n\nJasmine Montgomery, meteorologist at the National Weather Service, noted that residents can prepare now in much of the same way they prepare for tropical trouble: have flashlights ready, be stocked up on staples and charge your electronic devices.\n\nShe said to prepare for the possibility of power outages, have extra blankets to keep warm, and be ready to use the fireplace safely if you have one.\n\n\"This is by no means a hurricane, but do have a plan to keep your home safe during adverse weather,\" she said.\n\nThe Leon County Sheriff's Office also has you covered with a checklist for before and after the storm.\n\nClick here for the full story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2013/09/15/how-detroit-went-broke-the-answers-may-surprise-you-and/77152028/", "title": "How Detroit went broke: The answers may surprise you — and don't ...", "text": "Nathan Bomey and John Gallagher\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nOriginally published Sept. 15, 2013\n\nDetroit is broke, but it didn’t have to be. An in-depth Free Press analysis of the city’s financial history back to the 1950s shows that its elected officials and others charged with managing its finances repeatedly failed — or refused — to make the tough economic and political decisions that might have saved the city from financial ruin.\n\nInstead, amid a huge exodus of residents, plummeting tax revenues and skyrocketing home abandonment, Detroit’s leaders engaged in a billion-dollar borrowing binge, created new taxes and failed to cut expenses when they needed to. Simultaneously, they gifted workers and retirees with generous bonuses. And under pressure from unions and, sometimes, arbitrators, they failed to cut health care benefits — saddling the city with staggering costs that today threaten the safety and quality of life of people who live here.\n\nThe numbers, most from records deeply buried in the public library, lay waste to misconceptions about the roots of Detroit’s economic crisis. For critics who want to blame Mayor Coleman Young for starting this mess, think again. The mayor’s sometimes fiery rhetoric may have contributed to metro Detroit’s racial divide, but he was an astute money manager who recognized, early on, the challenges the city faced and began slashing staff and spending to address them.\n\nAnd Wall Street types who applauded Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick’s financial acumen following his 2005 deal to restructure city pension debt should consider this: The numbers prove that his plan devastated the city’s finances and was a key factor that drove Detroit to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in July.\n\nThe State of Michigan also bears some blame. Lansing politicians reduced Detroit’s state-shared revenue by 48% from 1998 to 2012, withholding $172 million from the city, according to state records.\n\nDecades of mismanagement added to Detroit’s fiscal woes. The city notoriously bungled multiple federal aid programs and overpaid outrageously to incentivize projects such as the Chrysler Jefferson North plant. Bureaucracy bogged down even the simplest deals and contracts. In a city that needed urgency, major city functions often seemed rudderless.\n\nWhen all the numbers are crunched, one fact is crystal clear: Yes, a disaster was looming for Detroit. But there were ample opportunities when decisive action by city leaders might have fended off bankruptcy.\n\nIf Mayors Jerome Cavanagh and Roman Gribbs had cut the workforce in the 1960s and early 1970s as the population and property values dropped. If Mayor Dennis Archer hadn’t added more than 1,100 employees in the 1990s when the city was flush but still losing population. If Kilpatrick had shown more fiscal discipline and not launched a borrowing spree to cover operating expenses that continued into Mayor Dave Bing’s tenure. Over five decades, there were many ‘if only’ moments.\n\n“Detroit got into a trap of doing a lot of borrowing for cash flow purposes and then trying to figure out how to push costs (out) as much as possible,” said Bettie Buss, a former city budget staffer who spent years analyzing city finances for the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan. “That was the whole culture — how do we get what we want and not pay for it until tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow?”\n\nUltimately, Detroit ended up with $18 billion to $20 billion in debt and unfunded pension and health care liabilities. Gov. Rick Snyder appointed bankruptcy attorney Kevyn Orr as the city’s emergency manager, and Orr filed for Chapter 9 on July 18.\n\nFor this report, the Free Press examined about 10,000 pages of documents gathering dust in the public library’s archives. Since most of those documents have never been digitized, the Free Press created its own database of 50 years of Detroit’s financial history. Reporters also conducted dozens of interviews with participants from the last six mayoral administrations as well as city bureaucrats and outside experts. Among the highlights from the review:\n\n■ Taxing higher and higher: City leaders tried repeatedly to reverse sliding revenue through new taxes. Despite a new income tax in 1962, a new utility tax in 1971 and a new casino revenue tax in 1999 — not to mention several tax increases along the way — revenue in today’s dollars fell 40% from 1962 to 2012. Higher taxes helped drive residents to the suburbs and drove away business. Today, Detroit still doesn’t take in as much tax revenue as it did just from property taxes in 1963.\n\n■ Reconsidering Coleman Young: Serving from 1974-1994, Young was the most austere Detroit mayor since World War II, reducing the workforce, department budgets and debt during a particularly nasty national recession in the early 1980s. Young was the only Detroit mayor since 1950 to preside over a city with more income than debt, although he relied heavily on tax increases to pay for services.\n\n■ Downsizing — too little, too late: The total assessed value of Detroit property — a good gauge of the city’s tax base and its ability to pay bills — fell a staggering 77% over the past 50 years in today’s dollars. But through 2004, the city cut only 28% of its workers, even though the money to pay them was drying up. Not until the last decade did Detroit, in desperation, cut half its workforce. The city also failed to take advantage of efficiencies, such as new technology, that enabled enormous productivity gains in the broader economy.\n\n■ Skyrocketing employee benefits: City leaders allowed legacy costs — the tab for retiree pensions and health care — to spiral out of control even as the State of Michigan and private industry were pushing workers into less costly plans. That placed major stress on the budget and diverted money from services such as streetlights and public safety. Detroit’s spending on retiree health care soared 46% from 2000 to 2012, even as its general fund revenue fell 20%.\n\n■ Gifting a billion in bonuses: Pension officials handed out about $1 billion in bonuses from the city’s two pension funds to retirees and active city workers from 1985 to 2008. That money — mostly in the form of so-called 13th checks — could have shored up the funds and possibly prevented the city from filing for bankruptcy. If that money had been saved, it would have been worth more than $1.9 billion today to the city and pension funds, by one expert’s estimate.\n\n■ Missing chance after chance: Contrary to myth, the city has not been in free fall since the 1960s. There have been periods of economic growth and hope, such as in the 1990s when the population decline slowed, income-tax revenue increased and city leaders balanced the budget. But leaders failed to take advantage of those moments of calm to reform city government, reduce expenses and protect the city and its residents from another downturn.\n\n■ Borrowing more and more: Detroit went on a binge starting around 2000 to close budget holes and to build infrastructure, more than doubling debt to $8 billion by 2012. Under Archer, Detroit sold water and sewer bonds. Kilpatrick, who took office in 2002, used borrowing as his stock answer to budget issues, and Bing borrowed more than $250 million.\n\n■ Adding the last straw — Kilpatrick’s gamble: He’s best known around the globe for a sex and perjury scandal that sent him to jail and massive corruption that threatens to send him to prison next month for more than 20 years. The corruption cases further eroded Detroit’s image and distracted the city from its fiscal storm. But perhaps the greatest damage Kilpatrick did to the city’s long-term stability was with Wall Street’s help when he borrowed $1.44 billion in a flashy high-finance deal to restructure pension fund debt. That deal, which could cost $2.8 billion over the next 22 years, now represents nearly one-fifth of the city’s debt.\n\nWith all the lost opportunities over decades, with Detroit’s debt mounting, with the housing crash and Great Recession just over the horizon, 2005 turned out to be the watershed year.\n\nAlthough no one could see it at the time, Detroit’s insolvency was guaranteed.\n\nPostwar boom, then ugly first signs of urban decline\n\nComing out of World War II, American industry was triumphant, and few centers of industry were riding higher than Detroit. The Arsenal of Democracy had built the planes and tanks that carried the war effort and was ready to return to producing cars and trucks for peacetime.\n\nThe fruits of victory were everywhere. Detroit’s population was growing toward 2 million. The cityscape was crowded — 14,000 people per square mile. With almost one-third of Michigan’s population living within its borders, Detroit exercised an outsized influence on the state’s politics and economy.\n\nBut the 1950s brought the first sobering inklings of crisis, and Detroit mayors for two decades made halting attempts to get ahead of it. Albert Cobo (1950-1957) formed the Dodge Committee to recommend diversifying the city’s tax base as wartime contracts dried up. Jerome Cavanagh (1962-1970) responded to falling revenue by instituting Detroit’s first income tax. Roman Gribbs (1970-1974) spearheaded an effort to revitalize downtown and Detroit’s tax base.\n\nBut two trends were undermining Detroit and the nation’s industrial centers like no foreign enemy had been able to do.\n\nSuburbanization: All cities spread out postwar into the farmland at their perimeters. Automakers and road builders eager to sell cars, home builders eager to sell new houses, village mayors eager for new taxes — all promoted suburban growth. So did the federal government with its subsidies and tax incentives. Eager for elbow room, families in crowded cities like Detroit and Cleveland and St. Louis began moving to the new communities. The process of spreading out hasn’t stopped yet.\n\nDiscriminatory practices, such as redlining — denying minority buyers mortgages and access to homes in white neighborhoods — made the process in Detroit and many other cities an ugly one. Unscrupulous real estate agents encouraged white flight by stoking some whites’ fears of black people moving in next door. Rancor ran deep. Experts warned of two Americas: one privileged, suburban and white; the other poor, urban and black.\n\nDeindustrialization: Cities like Detroit and Flint that rose to power in the first half of the 20th Century were shocked to find in the second half how many factory jobs would be lost to foreign competition. Detroit auto executive Lee Iacocca once boasted that U.S. carmakers would kick their Japanese competitors back into the Pacific Ocean. He was wrong. American steelmakers learned the same hard lessons.\n\nEven by the late 1950s, the signs of strain were showing in industrial cities. Population and housing values peaked in Detroit in the 1950s and began their long and seemingly unstoppable decline. The urban riots of the 1960s, including Detroit’s, accelerated the process.\n\nBy the 1960s, in Detroit as in city after city, the process was well under way. And mayors and civic leaders, here and elsewhere, began their long, anguished battle against decline.\n\nToday, the revivals of downtown and Midtown are drawing young professionals of diverse race and ethnicity back to the city. But the overall population is still dropping as people leave, looking for safer neighborhoods, better schools, lower taxes and reliable city services. Detroit’s population now is about 700,000.\n\nOther cities also have profound problems today — Chicago, Providence, R.I., Baltimore. But only Detroit is in bankruptcy court.\n\nCause and effect: People leave, taxes go up, more people leave\n\nAs the post-World War II manufacturing expansion leveled off and Detroit started to lose population and revenue, the city turned for the first time in 1962 to an income tax: 1% for residents, nonresidents and corporations. Only six years later, the rate for residents would double.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a nasty national recession pummeled the auto industry, and Detroit’s finances spiraled downward. Mayor Young convened a blue-ribbon panel to recommend action. They said the city would be bankrupt by summer if it did not raise taxes and reduce costs again.\n\nWithin months of a heated primary election, Young achieved the politically unthinkable: He persuaded Detroit voters to increase their own income taxes from 2% to 3%. He got Republican Gov. William Milliken to sign off, too. And he coupled it with deals to freeze wages for thousands of workers and lay off several hundred police officers.\n\n“He could pull a lot of this off because he had such political capital in the community that a lot of folks would say, ‘If Coleman Young said it, it must be OK,’” said Tim Kiska, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.\n\nTo continue paying for city services and to pay for union benefits awarded by outside arbitrators, the city also instituted a new utility tax in 1971 and a wagering tax when casinos began operating here in 1999. As population declined, the city instituted new taxes or raised existing ones to try and keep up with falling revenues.\n\nThe total property tax burden for city homeowners, including county and school taxes, rose from 44.79 mills per thousand dollars of value in the mid-’60s to 88.178 per thousand by 1991.\n\n“It’s almost like every decade we got a new source of income to keep our ass on the ground,” said Ed Rago, Young’s budget director.\n\nBut the problem with using taxes to raise revenue was that it made the city a more expensive — and less attractive — place to live and do business. People and corporations kept leaving.\n\n“So, very quickly, you had a situation where the city residents were taxed far higher than anywhere else,” Buss said.\n\nColeman Young’s legacy: Divisive — but fiscally sound\n\nWhen Coleman Young was elected mayor in 1973, Detroit had lived through one of the worst race riots in U.S. history and had lost about half a million people from its peak population years. Young has been alternately blamed for fanning the flames of racial tension, dealing out sweetheart deals to unions, expanding the city’s budget and setting Detroit on a path toward financial destruction.\n\nIndeed, he did raise taxes, but he also recognized fiscal realities by cutting costs aggressively to shore up the budget. Contrary to the typical portrait of him, Young may have been Detroit’s most conservative modern mayor, attacking fiscal problems by shrinking government and forging new relationships with corporate America to build new Detroit auto factories during his tenure.\n\n“Coleman Young was a fiscal conservative,” said Buss. “Not many people appreciate that about him. He knew politics, and he was also desperately afraid that his community would lose control.”\n\nHe even reduced its recreation infrastructure. For example, when Young took office in 1974, the city had 117 skating rinks, 18 city pools and five “swim-mobiles,” portable metal tanks that were filled with water and traveled to neighborhoods so kids could take a dip.\n\nWhen Young left office, the city had four skating rinks and 12 city pools. The swim-mobiles were still around.\n\nUnder Young, Detroit cut about 6,000 workers from 1978 to 1984, according to financial records reviewed by the Free Press. During his two decades as mayor, he also cut about 2,000 Police Department employees and about 500 Fire Department employees.\n\n“He did a number of things to bring costs down,” said Bob Berg, Young’s former press secretary. “He kept a pretty tight rein ... in some very difficult economic times.”\n\nOne reason Young cut public safety officers: The city lost an arbitration ruling during a bitter dispute early in his tenure in favor of hefty union compensation.\n\nRoger Short, a budget analyst who later became one of the city’s top fiscal officials in the Archer and Kilpatrick administrations, recalled that Young also slashed the Police Department’s equipment.\n\n“We got rid of the planes and the helicopters,” Short said. “We couldn’t afford them.”\n\nStill, Young cannot be altogether exonerated in his role in Detroit’s financial demise. In fact, when he was serving in the state Legislature, Young wrote Public Act 312, which required binding arbitration in union compensation fights, the very same law that came back to haunt the city years later when the city lost arbitrations.\n\n“He always said it was the worst mistake he ever made in public life,” Berg said.\n\nYoung embraced taxes, too. Raising taxes helped him keep the budget balanced. The city’s income tax revenue for residents doubled from 1981 to 1986, according to the Free Press analysis.\n\nWith the public safety cuts, Young stabilized the budget. In 1985, the city’s debt-to-revenue ratio in today’s dollars hit an all-time low of 0.66, according to the Free Press analysis. Today, the ratio is 7.1 — more than 10 times greater.\n\nKiska, who covered Young’s administration for the Free Press in the early 1980s and wrote a book about the city’s power brokers, said Young was responding to a “sense of terror” as the auto industry languished.\n\n“If you look at what he’s done, he was behaving — and this is just my opinion — totally responsibly,” Kiska said.\n\nWall Street apparently agreed. In June 1986, Standard & Poor’s increased Detroit’s bond rating to investment-grade, ending a six-year stretch in which Detroit’s ability to borrow was limited.\n\nThat kicked off a spree that continued through the end of Young’s administration. From 1987 to 1994, the city’s debt load soared 72% in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a Free Press analysis.\n\nIn 1990, for example, the city sold $130 million in limited-tax general obligation bonds, which voters had not approved, to help finance Chrysler’s Jefferson North Assembly Plant. At the time, analysts projected the deal would cost the city a total of $245 million in principal and interest over 20 years.\n\nStill, Detroit’s debt was relatively under control under the Young administration and through the Dennis Archer years. It wasn’t until the early 2000s that it started to become unmanageable.\n\nMissed chances to rightsize staff as population falls\n\nOne running theme in the Free Press’ review is that city leaders failed, again and again, to come to grips with the looming crisis. Young downsized the bureaucracy, but not as much as he should have in view of the city’s declining population and revenue.\n\nAnd in 1994, when the Clinton-era financial boom took hold and the city’s finances appeared to be stabilizing, the city started hiring again.\n\nFlush with new tax revenue, Archer increased the city workforce from 1994 to 2001, even as the population contracted. Those new employees added to the city’s legacy costs. By the end of the 2001 fiscal year, the city had 18,132 employees, about one worker for every 51 residents.\n\nArcher told the Free Press that cuts were not politically palatable then, in part because the U.S. economy was booming. He defended adding employees, saying the city could afford it and budgets were balanced during his tenure.\n\n“We wouldn’t buy things unless we could afford to,” he said. “That’s how we were able to, frankly, balance our budget and have a modest surplus, because we watched what we were doing.”\n\nBut as Detroit’s economic problems intensified, Kilpatrick, mayor from 2002 until he resigned amid a sex and perjury scandal in 2008, presided over one of the largest purges of municipal workers in the city’s history — cutting more than 4,000 employees.\n\nWhen Bing, the current mayor, inherited a red-ink budget in 2009, he resorted to more cuts in an attempt to keep the city solvent, slashing another 4,000 employees in four years. In just a few years, Bing laid off nearly one of every three city workers.\n\nToday, the city has about one employee for every 73 residents.\n\nCosts for health care, retiree benefits soar — city fails to act\n\nIt has been obvious for at least a quarter-century that governments and industry were going to face massive legacy costs as more workers aged and retired. In fact, Detroit had about 18,000 retirees in the late 1980s, only about 3,000 fewer than today.\n\nBut Archer said the red flags weren’t obvious in the 1980s and 1990s. “During the eight years I was in office, there was some discussion that was starting to be held, quietly,” he said. It eventually became clear that “cities needed to watch out; states needed to watch out.”\n\nEd Hannan, one of his budget directors, agreed: “If you go way, way back, health care was not an expensive add-on,” he said. “As years went on, health care became very big.... We did go to council. We showed projections and what would happen and difficult times ahead. We were met with skepticism.”\n\nEven in recent years, when no one questioned that the health care tab had been ballooning, city leaders failed to cut costs because of intense pressure from unions. Adverse court and arbitration rulings also stymied the city’s best efforts to cut. The city’s spending on retiree health care soared 46% from 2000 to 2012, even as general fund revenue fell by 20%.\n\nMeanwhile, the city’s total unfunded retiree health care liabilities rose 19% from 2007 to 2011. Those numbers are critical because they show how costs have increased even though the number of employees was decreasing.\n\nToday, the city’s retiree health care obligations continue to drain the budget and are central to its insolvency.\n\nThe city also missed opportunities to rightsize retirement benefits. For instance, when the State of Michigan switched from pensions to 401(k)-style plans in 1997, Detroit failed to follow suit.\n\nArcher negotiated with the pensions funds to create a new plan for city workers, but it was never implemented.\n\nIn 2000, the city spent about $99 million on retiree health care benefits. That rose by almost half to about $145 million in 2012.\n\nBonuses to workers, retirees add up to more budget trouble\n\nIn 1994, Archer convened a meeting of his top officials the first week he took office to inspect the city’s books. Rago, Young’s budget director who stayed on during Archer’s first year, told the new mayor how the city’s pension system distributed excess earnings each year to retirees and active employees, instead of reinvesting it. The practice of distributing 13th checks and annuity bonuses dated to at least the mid-1980s.\n\nAlarmed, Archer vowed to kill the practice. But the city doesn’t control its pension funds, which have been largely administered by union officials serving on two independent pension boards.\n\nSo Archer backed an effort to block the payments through a proposed new city charter, which actually passed in August 1996. Enraged, several city unions and a retiree group sued and won. Archer tried again to block payments through a ballot initiative, called Proposal T, but it failed.\n\n“That’s a whole lot of money that, if it was in the pension fund, may have made a difference,” Archer told the Free Press.\n\nMilliman, an accounting firm conducting an analysis for Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr, this year pegged the unfunded pension liabilities at $3.5 billion. Pension fund trustees dispute that figure, saying the funds are healthy despite the 13th check practice and a string of poor investments over the last decade.\n\nOne of the city’s two pension funds, the General Retirement System board, which represents nonuniform employees, doled out $951 million in excess earnings, mostly to retirees and active employees, from 1985 to 2008, according to a report conducted for City Council in 2011 by independent actuary Joseph Esuchanko.\n\nHe estimated that the total accumulated cost to the city from the distributions, including lost interest, was $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2008.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how much extra money was distributed from the city’s other pension fund, which covers police and fire department employees. Officials have told the Free Press, however, it was a much less frequent practice and that it happened in earnest for only a few years. With the stock market booming under Archer’s tenure, the city agreed in negotiations with its police and firefighter unions in October 2000 to hand out $190.4 million in bonus pension payments to current and future retirees.\n\nThere were clear signs of strain in Detroit’s two pension funds going back to the 1970s. The level of benefits paid each year was rising dramatically, in actual dollar amounts and as a percentage of the city’s active payrolls.\n\nThe funds also raised benefits year after year for decades through a cost-of-living allowance and through higher benefits negotiated by unions.\n\nDon Fuerst, a senior pension fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, calls those rising costs “a serious red flag” for a pension fund.\n\n“When you see costs increasing as a percentage of payroll, as a percentage of revenues, as a percentage of assets, and you see a clear trend of increasing costs, that should be a red flag of concern, no question,” he said.\n\nShirley Lightsey, president of the Detroit Retired City Employees Association, said many retirees have accepted that times have changed.\n\n“We’ve told our people there’s no more 13th check, so don’t even talk about it anymore,” she said.\n\nThe pension board claims of safety and solvency were exaggerated over time in part because of a common but controversial accounting practice called “smoothing,” according to a Free Press analysis of pension reports.\n\nThat concept was used by Detroit trustees to assign a predicted annual return on assets over a seven-year period to “smooth” out the up-and-down market gyrations. But in Detroit’s case, the predicted return was too high and the reality of poor investments and falling contributions sapped the funds too quickly for the “smoothed” out numbers to remain accurate.\n\nDetroit’s pension boards also had another problem, experts say: Seven years is too long a period for smoothing. Three to five years is a more responsible time frame for predicting market returns.\n\nAs a result, the actual value of assets for Detroit’s two pension funds is really about $5.4 billion — not the $6.77 billion claimed by the pension boards. That’s 20% off — and “really substantial,” Fuerst said.\n\nKilpatrick’s award-winning deal turns into a financial disaster\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2005, Kwame Kilpatrick strode to the stage of a New York City ballroom to applause. Decked out in a black tuxedo, Kilpatrick accepted a gleaming trophy for engineering a complex $1.44-billion pension deal designed to eliminate the city’s unfunded pension liabilities.\n\nHe cracked a joke on stage, and Wall Street chuckled. Photographs from the event show laughing faces, a high-priced evening, a night to envy.\n\nThe transaction — which earned Detroit the Midwest Regional Deal of the Year honors from the Bond Buyer, Wall Street’s bible for municipal investments — was hailed for its intricate legal framework and creativity. City officials openly bragged that they had to construct a byzantine legal structure to justify the deal.\n\nThe deal hailed by Wall Street was a disaster. The borrowing scheme now represents close to one-fifth of the city’s debt and stands as a key reason the city filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy on July 18.\n\nMany said it seemed like a good idea at the time, but the financial machination now stands as a prime example of the city’s willingness to borrow huge sums — and how Kilpatrick took borrowing to new heights.\n\nFor a year, Kilpatrick had lobbied the City Council to approve the idea of borrowing to fund pensions. The mayor said the city’s pension obligation, left unaddressed, would force him to lay off 2,000 employees.\n\nBut his new deal was designed to fix all that. He estimated the city would shave $277 million a year from its pension contribution obligation and prevent layoffs. It worked like this: Detroit sold pension obligation certificates of participation and shoved the money into its pension funds, making them nearly 100% funded. Separately, the city also bought so-called swaps, or derivatives, a complex Wall Street financial deal to permanently lock in steady interest rates in the range of 6%, a comparatively good rate at the time.\n\nCouncil members at the time — Maryann Mahaffey, Barbara-Rose Collins, Sharon McPhail and JoAnn Watson — blocked the original pension certificates deal for months. They warned it was too risky because of the stock market’s volatility and accused Kilpatrick of political gamesmanship.\n\nThe Free Press editorial page in February 2005 also applied pressure, calling the reluctant council members “heads-in-the-sand” politicians who “have become a threat to the stability of the community.” The editorial described the transaction as a “sound deal” that was “akin to refinancing a mortgage.”\n\nEventually, the council members capitulated under pressure from Kilpatrick and criticism from unions, including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represented city workers. The deal eventually passed council unanimously.\n\n“Kilpatrick had to know or to believe he wasn’t going to be around at the time those payments were going to be due,” said Joseph Harris, Detroit’s auditor general from 1995 to 2005.\n\nThree years later, interest rates tanked and the stock market collapsed. Detroit’s credit rating was downgraded. In desperation, the city pledged its casino tax revenue as collateral to creditors to avoid a payment of up to $400 million that, back then, would have pushed Detroit into a bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe city now owes $2.8 billion for principal, interest and insurance payments over the next 22 years, according to a Free Press review of the city’s records. The bill soared in part because the city made only interest payments for about five years.\n\n“Things really got ugly as a result of that,” said Rago, the former budget director. “In the end, as you look back on it, it was the worst thing they could have done.”\n\nBankruptcy avoidable — until decadelong borrowing binge\n\nDespite the city’s huge tax burden, big spending and large bureaucracy, the Free Press analysis suggests that when Archer left office in 2001, the city still could have avoided disaster. Bankruptcy was not inevitable.\n\nBut under the Kilpatrick and Bing administrations, the city started borrowing aggressively to cover its operating expenses, enabled by Wall Street’s irresponsible lending of the 2000s.\n\n“It just makes me ill. Almost cry,” said former Mayor Gribbs, now 87, who served from 1970 to 1974. “You can’t continually borrow money and use it for operating expenses and expect never to have the trouble of paying it back. That’s where you end up going bankrupt.”\n\nShortly after Kilpatrick took office, his administration issued $61.07 million in “fiscal stabilization bonds.” It was the first of several bond issues championed by Kilpatrick to keep the city budget afloat.\n\nKilpatrick was full of ideas — like turning the crumbling Michigan Central Station into police headquarters — but was never able to build realistic budgets. He added city workers, then had to cut them. His stock answer to budget issues was to borrow. And chronic annual deficit spending started under him.\n\nIn 2009, at Bing’s urging, the city issued $250 million in fiscal stabilization bonds. He told the Free Press last week that the city was almost out of cash and that he couldn’t avoid borrowing.\n\n“I think too many of us looked at Detroit through rose-colored glasses and thought the revenue was going to increase and therefore we didn’t have to do anything on the expenditure side,” he said. “But I knew early on that my revenue wasn’t going to increase and my only option was to cut.… I had to make sure that there was enough money in our system to carry us through the next fiscal year and maybe the next.”\n\nThe borrowing also was aided by Wall Street. As recently as the middle of the last decade, bond rating agencies, including Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, were rating Detroit debt as investment grade.\n\nBut even after eventual downgrades, investors continued to scoop up each new city bond issue. That’s because the lower the credit rating, the higher the interest paid to investors.\n\nThe demand was also fueled by Wall Street’s mistaken impression that the State of Michigan would never allow the city to file for bankruptcy.\n\nIn 2009, Harris — who became chief financial officer for Mayor Kenneth Cockrel Jr. during his single year in office 2008-09 — met with Wall Street firms and rating agencies to help the water department issue revenue bonds. At one stop with a credit agency, he discussed the city’s tenuous financial circumstances with an analyst.\n\n“She says, ‘Well, what happens if Detroit goes bankrupt?’” Harris recalled in a Free Press interview. “I said, ‘We don’t. The state will step in and ensure that they right the ship and that the bonds are paid.’”\n\nFinally: What would Frank do?\n\nAn echo of Detroit’s current distress can be found in memories of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Then, too, Detroit suffered overwhelming unemployment, chronic budget deficits, rampant crime.\n\nBut the city government managed to avoid a financial collapse, led by charismatic Mayor Frank Murphy, later Michigan’s governor, U.S. attorney general and associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn a report to citizens, Murphy bemoaned the “unsatisfactory governmental administration in the near past,” the “racketeers” who were plaguing the community and the “acute” joblessness that undercut the city.\n\nDespite an imploding economy, he called for a “stubborn stand against the allowance of deficits.” He pledged to cut the city’s budget “to the bone” and he declared war on “financial acrobatics” in a letter attached to the city’s 1930 annual report, which the Free Press uncovered in the Detroit Public Library.\n\nHis efforts helped the city survive the nation’s worst economic times.\n\nAlong the way, he made a vow.\n\n“This is a great, rich city,” he proclaimed in the letter. “It never has repudiated an obligation nor defaulted upon a debt — and it never will.”\n\nContact Nathan Bomey: nbomey@usatoday.com.

Staff writer Kristi Tanner contributed to this report.\n\nHow this report was done\n\n\n\nDigital information about Detroit’s financial history is sorely lacking. In pursuit of historical context on the city’s finances, the Free Press spent weeks conducting research at the Detroit Public Library’s Burton Historical Collection and Department of Sociology and Economics.\n\n\n\nThe Free Press created its own database of 50 years of Detroit’s financial history by reviewing the city’s annual financial audits for 1960-2012, reading a half century of pension fund reports and combing through many other city records.\n\n\n\nCity financial audits before 2002 were available in print only. Reports from 1964 and 1971 were not available.\n\n\n\nThe Free Press also conducted dozens of interviews with outside experts and leaders from the last six mayoral administrations to provide context and additional information.\n\n\n\nThe Free Press uses general fund revenue figures, which are the best reflection of the city’s financial health. For some years, the city’s audited figures were later slightly adjusted because of new accounting principles, delinquent receipts or additional spending.\n\n\n\nMany news reports have relied on Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr’s assertion that the city has about $18 billion in debt. However, those figures include disputed estimates of the city’s long-term liabilities, including pension funds and retiree health care. In all references to the city’s debt, the Free Press is referring to the value of general obligation bonds, pension obligation certificates of participation and secured bonds, such as water and sewer debt.\n\n\n\nIn references to inflation-adjusted figures, the Free Press uses the recommended conversion method from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/09/25/helene-updates-florida-hurricane-threat-without-precedent-unfolding/75371740007/", "title": "Helene updates: Florida hurricane threat without precedent unfolding", "text": "A strengthening Helene in the Gulf of Mexico is the latest tropical terror to grip Florida.\n\nThe expected Category 4 hurricane closing in on Florida's Big Bend has already prompted three coastal counties – Franklin, Wakulla and Taylor – to order all residents to evacuate in the face of a projected and \"not survivable\" 15-foot storm surge. Helene could also become Tallahassee's worst wind event in recorded history as 100 mph winds meet \"Tree City USA.\"\n\nRyan Truchelut, founder of WeatherTiger and a hurricane forecaster for the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida, said Helene, which became a hurricane Wednesday morning, is a storm without precedent.\n\n\"Helene stands toe-to-toe with any of the threats that Florida has faced over the past ten years or indeed really over hurricane history.\"\n\nHere's the latest from the path of the storm:\n\nJust what does catastrophic mean? A sobering snapshot from National Weather Service\n\nIf you need a picture of what catastrophic means, look no further than the National Weather Service's latest hurricane statement.\n\n\"Damage to critical infrastructure, catastrophic damage to the trees and powerlines, widespread inaccessibility due to blocked roads, and damage to well-built structures will all be likely, particularly close to and east of the track. Power outages will likely last days, if not weeks.\"\n\n\"Potential wind impacts in this area include: Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof and wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations may be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and roadway signs blown over. Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban or heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access routes impassable. Widespread power and communications outages.\"\n\n\"There is a danger of catastrophic and unsurvivable storm surge for Apalachee Bay. This forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay.

Structural damage to buildings, with many washing away. Damage greatly compounded from considerable floating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period. Near-shore escape routes and secondary roads washed out or severely flooded. Extreme beach erosion. New shoreline cuts possible. Massive damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Numerous small craft broken away from moorings with many lifted onshore and stranded.\"\n\n\"Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and rescues. Rivers and tributaries may overwhelmingly overflow their banks in many places with deep moving water. Small streams, creeks, and ditches may become raging rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may become stressed. Flood waters can enter numerous structures within multiple communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover escape routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of raging water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become very dangerous.

On-campus refuge space is tentatively scheduled to open at 10 a.m. and all students must be in place by NOON (12 p.m.)\"\n\nAt the same time, FSU announced it would be turning the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center into a \"refuge facility\" for off-campus students.\n\n\"Florida State University will open a refuge facility at the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center beginning 10 a.m. Thursday, Sept. 26, for the duration of the storm to current registered students who live off-campus and feel unsafe to weather Hurricane Helene in their current living situation,\" FSU Alert stated. \"It will remain open until FSU issues the ALL CLEAR. No guests or individuals not currently registered for classes will be permitted in the Tucker Center refuge.\"\n\nStudents must arrive at the Tucker Center with a FSU ID no later than noon as travel conditions will begin to deteriorate at the time.\n\nHelene storm surge to come ‘uncomfortably close’ to Wakulla Springs\n\nA storm surge warning is in effect for both coastal Wakulla County and parts inland, said David Reese, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.\n\nReese said one reason for the inland surge is that rising water could come up the St. Marks River, he said.\n\n“That storm surge warning does include St. Marks,” Reese said. “It does go up to near Newport. It does not quite get to Crawfordville. It is forecast to get to the other side of U.S. 98 between Newport and Medart or Sopchoppy. Right now, we’re forecasting it to come just shy of Wakulla Springs, although it could get uncomfortably close.”\n\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami said earlier this evening that storm surge could hit 15 to 20 feet along the Apalachee Bay from Hurricane Helene, now forecast to hit Category 4 strength.\n\nReese added that storm surge is the amount of water covering what would otherwise be dry land.\n\n“At the immediate coast, if you’re standing at the edge of the water ... 15 to 20 feet of water could be over (your) head tomorrow or tomorrow night,” Reese said. “Things taper down the more inland you go because of terrain and everything else. But that does not include wave action — so you can add waves on top of that.”\n\nNHC: Helene forecast to become Category 4 storm with 132 mph winds; storm surge could hit 20 feet\n\nHurricane Helene is now forecast to become a Category 4 storm, with devastating wind speeds of up to 132 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\n\"But additional strengthening might be possible,\" a meteorologist with the National Weather Service told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nThe NHC also ratcheted up storm surge predictions for Apalachee Bay to as high as 20 feet in its 5 p.m. forecast.\n\n\"A catastrophic and deadly storm surge is likely along portions of the Florida Big Bend coast, where inundation could reach as high as 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves,\" NHC said. \"There is also a danger of life-threatening storm surge along the remainder of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula.\"\n\nSteinhatchee bar owner: Helene coming so fast 'we didn't have time to prepare much'\n\nScott Peters, owner of Crabbie Dad's bar in Steinhatchee, supervised a crew Wednesday, a day before Hurricane Helene's forecast arrival, loading beer, coolers, and liquor into trucks and moving it all to safety further inland.\n\nPeters, 46, said the storms that have hit the bar he’s owned for 19 years seem to keep getting stronger and each season. The bar sits about 100 feet across First Avenue from where the Steinhatchee River empties into Deadman Bay.\n\n\"We’re taking everything I can lift and move and things I didn’t take out last time that I learned a lesson from,” said Peters. “You take every storm as serious as you can because this is such a low-lying area. We’re basically at sea level.”\n\nAs he spoke, a county emergency alert sounded on nearby cell phones, warning of a dangerous storm surge and cautioning people to have three days of supplies on hand before the storm hits Thursday evening.\n\nPeters said how bad the storm surge gets will depend in part on what the tides are doing as the hurricane hits sure. But he worried that because it gained strength so rapidly, it’s plowing a huge pile of water toward shore.\n\nHe said growing up in the area, people used to have hurricane parties and write out storms. But the recent string of more powerful hurricanes hitting the area has convinced him that’s no longer a good idea.\n\n“If thing comes in and goes over us as fast as they’re saying, we could get 8-10 feet of water. That’s what scares me,” said Peters. “The thing’s coming so damn fast we didn’t have time to prepare much.”\n\n— Trevor Hughes, USA Today\n\nLeon County has distributed more than 25K sandbags ahead of Hurricane Helene\n\nLeon County Administrator Vince Long said the county has given out nearly 25,000 sandbags as the community braces for a direct hit from Helene.\n\nIn an afternoon email update, Long also said that Public Works crews have been operating around the clock preparing for the hurricane and debris removal contractors are on standby.\n\nLong said workers have pre-deployed barricades and equipment near places that historically flood and that road crews will be embedded at six different schools so they can immediately deploy once conditions are safe. The crews will be stationed at Fort Braden School, Chiles High School, Chaires, Canopy Oaks and Woodville elementary schools and Montford Middle School.\n\nHe said Leon County Emergency Medical Services has \"surge staffing\" plans in place and that crews will be pre-deployed for rapid response \"before, during and after the storm.\"\n\nThe Consolidated Dispatch Agency is prepared to stage a backup call center, Long added, and is working with neighboring counties to provide 911 coverage should phone or internet service go down.\n\n\"The most severe threat for our community ... remains hurricane-force winds that could cause widespread power outages, significant property damage and put lives at risk,\" Long said.\n\nIn Wakulla County, all residents ordered to evacuate, but some inmates are left behind\n\nResidents in Wakulla County in Florida’s Big Bend region are under mandatory orders to evacuate by 8 a.m. Thursday, but some inmates are being left behind.\n\nThe Wakulla County Sheriff’s Office said it has no plans to evacuate the jail. It has capacity for 350 inmates. A spokesperson said the jail isn’t full but couldn’t say exactly how many inmates were there Wednesday.\n\nThere are two state prison facilities in the county, the Wakulla Correctional Institution and its satellite, the Wakulla Correctional Institution Annex. Those prisons weren’t evacuated Wednesday. They can hold more than 2,500 prisons combined.\n\nThe Florida Department of Corrections has already announced it had completed the evacuations of about 2,500 other inmates from 25 other prisons across 14 counties. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the Wakulla County prisons would be evacuated later, ahead of the hurricane making landfall.\n\n– Valentina Sandoval\n\nNorth Florida residents weary as Helene to become fifth hurricane to hit in eight years\n\nThe forecast arrival on Thursday of another hurricane seems like a recurring nightmare for residents of Florida's Big Bend and eastern Panhandle.\n\nHelene is expected to be the fifth hurricane to smack this roughly 200 miles of mostly rural coast between Panama City and Cedar Key in just eight years. Only three hurricanes have arrived elsewhere along the rest of the state's more than 800 miles of coastline over that time span.\n\nIn Steinhatchee, tensions felt high when Janalea England and her husband walked into a local restaurant for lunch Monday. The community is \"just getting recovered from Idalia,\" she said. Two friends along that stretch of coast told her: \"If we get hit again, we're done.\"\n\nAs concerned as she is about her own community's slow recovery, England is even more concerned about Cedar Key, a historic fishing community 40 miles to the south. The rural archipelago also suffered flooding and damage from Idalia and Debby. Then last week, a fire damaged four businesses along the town's Dock Street, the city said. On Tuesday, the city posted evacuation warnings and photos of residents prepping sandbags.\n\nSome Cedar Key restaurants and small businesses still suffer from previous storms, England said. \"Now you've got this thing? I could see someone could wash their hands.\"\n\n— Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA Today\n\nNHC ups storm surge forecast to unheard of 18 feet for Big Bend coast\n\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami said storm surge could hit a mind-boggling 12 to 18 feet along the Big Bend coast from roughly the Carrabelle River to the Chassahowitzka River. That's up several feet from the most recent forecasts.\n\n\"Due to the large size of Helene, there is a danger of life-threatening storm surge along the entire west coast of the Florida Peninsula and Florida Big Bend,\" the NHC said. \"The highest inundation of greater than 10 feet is expected along the Florida Big Bend coast. Residents in those areas should follow advice given by local officials and evacuate if told to do so.\"\n\nNumerous counties in the Big Bend are under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders. A list can be found at www.floridadisaster.org/evacuation-orders.\n\nWeather Tiger: Helene will hit Big Bend with a 'cataclysmic' blow\n\nHurricane Helene is on track to become the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Apalachee Bay since the 1840s, Dr. Ryan Truchelut of Tallahassee-based WeatherTiger said in his most recent forecast.\n\n\"Due to the intensity and extraordinary size of the storm, Helene will bring catastrophic, life-threatening surge to the west-central Florida and Big Bend coasts, and a core of destructive winds to a broad swath of North Florida and Georgia that likely includes Tallahassee, Truchelut wrote.\n\nHe said landfall somewhere in Apalachee Bay on Thursday evening is probable, most likely between 6 p.m. and midnight. \"This is just a touch west of yesterday’s track,\" he added.\n\nThere was little to no good news in the forecast. Helene, feeding off Gulf waters \"heated to a stupefying historical extreme,\" is expected to rapidly intensify to a Category 3 hurricane, though a Category 4 is not out of the question.\n\nBecause of Helene's size, impacts will be felt hundreds of miles from the Hurricane Center's cone, especially on the eastern half of the storm, he wrote.\n\n\"The anticipated landfall on Thursday is a truly unprecedented scenario for North Florida. Between Michael’s Category 5 landfall in Mexico Beach in 2018 and an 1896 Category 3 hit on Cedar Key, the only other major hurricane to make landfall anywhere in Apalachee Bay since 1851 is last year’s Idalia — which as a relatively compact storm, is a poor comparable to the gargantuan Helene. A major hurricane has never on record moved into Leon County, which the current NHC forecast shows.\"\n\nGadsden County issues voluntary evacuation\n\nGadsden County issued a voluntary evacuation and is opening several emergency shelters in response to Hurricane Helene.\n\n\"If you live in a mobile home or an unsafe structure, please evacuate to a shelter or somewhere else that is safe,\" Gadsden County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post. \"Please take action before the impacts of the storm. Remember first responders will not be able to respond after winds reach above 40 mph.\"\n\nShelters are scheduled to open at 4 p.m. today at Gadsden County High School, 27001 Blue Star Highway, Havana, and West Gadsden Middle School, 200 Providence Road, Quincy. Gadsden High will house the general population and people with special needs and pets; West Gadsden Middle will house the general population.\n\nFlorida State University advises students to consider evacuating\n\nFSU Alert, the Florida State University emergency warning system, is recommending that \"individuals should strongly consider making plans to leave the Tallahassee area TODAY before weather conditions deteriorate and be prepared to be away from campus for an extended period of time.\"\n\n\"As a major hurricane, Helene has the potential to cause severe wind damage and widespread power outages in the Tallahassee area,\" FSU Alert stated, \"The university’s operations could be disrupted for a significantly longer period than initially anticipated.\"\n\nTallahassee's history of dodging bullets with hurricanes may come to a violent end\n\nTallahassee has a mostly charmed history with hurricanes, though that's changed a bit over recent years – and may end violently on Thursday if Hurricane Helene's eyewall tears thorough Tallahassee.\n\nIn the past, hurricanes of all sizes have either lost their wind strength by the time they hit us (Eloise, 1975; Alma, 1966). Or they veer around Tallahassee, while dumping tons of rain (numerous times).\n\nClick here to learn about some of the most notable storms to pass through the area.\n\n'Prepare for a direct hit,' city of Tallahassee officials warn\n\nThe city of Tallahassee just texted its utility customers the following: \"Helene has been upgraded to a hurricane and is forecast to be a major hurricane with peak winds of 125mph before making landfall tomorrow, with Tallahassee projected to receive a direct hit. Finalize all preparations and plans now.\"\n\nHelene reaches hurricane status\n\nWhile crossing into the Gulf of Mexico on a collision course with Florida, Helene is now officially a hurricane packing winds of 70 mph. Forecasters expect Helene will reach Category 3 status with winds as high as 125 mph before it reaches landfall.\n\n\"There is still some uncertainty on exactly how strong Helene will get, and upward adjustments to the forecast intensity could be required in subsequent advisories if Helene rapidly intensifies more than forecast,\" National Hurricane Center forecasters wrote in the latest discussion. \"Regardless, Helene is forecast to be a large major hurricane when it reaches the Big Bend coast of Florida. As a result, storm surge, wind, and rainfall impacts will likely extend well away from the center and outside the forecast cone, particularly on the east side.\"\n\nAs the storm ticked east, the hurricane warning was also extended the Jackson and Calhoun counties.\n\nSee the storm's latest track and models and overlay it with your address using our Storm Tracker and Model Mixer.

For Tallahassee, that would cause damage exceeding Hermine or Michael.”\n\nHe noted that today is the last day to conclude your preparations.\n\n“IF YOU HAVE AN EVACUATION ORDER, GO TODAY. Weather conditions will go downhill tomorrow.”\n\nCommissioner Rick Minor: Tallahassee could see six hours of 74-110 mph winds\n\nLeon County Commissioner Rick Minor pleaded with residents to take seriously Hurricane Helene, which is on track to make landfall south of Tallahassee as a Category 3 storm with winds as high as 115 mph.\n\nIn an email to constituents on Tuesday night, Minor said he was briefed by Leon County Emergency Management officials, who said that if the current track holds, Leon County will suffer a direct hit.\n\n\"On Thursday we'll face about six hours of sustained winds of 74-110 mph, leading to thousands of downed trees, more than a hundred blocked roads, hundreds of damaged structures, and many, many days of extended power outages,\" he said. \"But we mustn't panic — fortunately, we all have enough time to carefully plan and prepare.\n\nMinor urged people to go to www.LeonReady.com, review the checklists and other info and start your preparations now.\n\n\"\"Listen to the updated storm forecasts, carefully consider the expert advice that'll be provided,\" Minor said, \"and finalize the plan for yourself, your family, and your pets: do you evacuate, go to a shelter, or wait out the storm at home?\"\n\nMinor said the forecast could change, but he warned residents not to bank on it.\n\n\"But if the current projections turn out to be true, it's going to be a bad one,\" he wrote. \"Leon County residents can't afford to discount the severity of this storm.\"\n\n'Nightmare' scenario unfolding for Big Bend, Tallahassee\n\nAs Tallahasseeans awoke Wednesday morning, there was no big shift in the track of what is expected to become Hurricane Helene later today. There was no wind shear that diminished what is shaping up to be an unprecedented threat to Tallahassee.\n\nFlorida's capital city and its Big Bend coastal neighbors remain in the bullseye. For those living in Wakulla, Franklin and Taylor counties, the National Weather Service forecasters offered a grim wakeup call hours after emergency managers ordered all county residents to evacuate.\n\n\"This forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay,\" forecasters wrote in the latest cyclone statement for the region. \"Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously.\"\n\nWhile exact impacts will be heavily dependent on the eventual track, expect catastrophic wind damage near the eventual point and inland along the track. Even though the hurricane is forecast to be moving quickly, very high rainfall rates and already saturated soils in some places will still combine for a serious flood risk across the region. Tornadoes also are possible.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Helene could render some areas \"uninhabitable for weeks or months.\" Widespread power and communications outages also are expected for prolonged periods.\n\nThe NWS said potential impacts include structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof and wall failures; complete destruction of mobile homes; damage greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles; numerous large trees snapped or uprooted; fences and roadway signs blown over; many roads impassable from large debris and more within urban or heavily wooded places; many bridges, causeways, and access routes impassable.\n\nStorm surge flooding, which could be as high as 15 feet in some places along Apalachee Bay, will be \"greatly accentuated\" by powerful battering waves. Other impacts from the surge include structural damage to buildings, with many washing away; damage greatly compounded from considerable floating debris; near-shore escape routes and secondary roads washed out or severely flooded; flood control systems and barriers may become stressed; extreme beach erosion; new shoreline cuts possible; massive damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks and piers; numerous small craft broken away from moorings with many lifted onshore and stranded.\n\nContact Jeff Burlew at jburlew@tallahassee.com or follow @JeffBurlew on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/02/20/first-city-progress-improvements-slated-for-savannahs-canals/69910478007/", "title": "First City Progress: Improvements slated for Savannah's canals", "text": "This story is part of First City Progress, a weekly series looking at development in Savannah and the Coastal Empire.

Around 100 million Americans have been under heat alerts for eight of the past 16 days.\n\nThis means hundreds of millions of people living in urban areas are again desperately trying to stay cool. The climate crisis is making extreme heat more frequent and last longer — but cities, without thoughtful design, can make life even hotter.\n\nAir conditioners might keep the indoors cool, but they only add to heat outdoors. And in most cases, they are adding to the climate crisis by increasing planet-warming emissions. Public transportation may be unbearable on a hot day, but driving a car that runs on gas instead just worsens traffic, also adding to heat and emissions. A lack of trees means a lack of shade, and buildings made of dark materials bring hotter interiors, which means more air conditioning.\n\nIt’s a vicious cycle, but there are other solutions.\n\nHere’s how eight cities are taking some of the heat out of their summers.\n\nMedellín, Colombia: Grow trees on the streets, not just in parks\n\nA green wall in Medellín, Colombia. The city has won awards for its Green Corridors project. Jorge Calle/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nWhen it gets really hot, people with air conditioning might stay indoors, but not everyone has that luxury and — well, who wants to say in all the time?\n\nFor cities that aren’t on the coast, parks that offer shade are a good option. Colombia’s second-largest city, Medellín, however, has created an entire metropolis of shade with its award-winning Green Corridors project.\n\nThe web-like network has transformed 18 roads and 12 waterways into lush green cycling lanes and walkways that connect the city’s parks and other frequently visited sites.\n\nTemperatures have come down in these areas and their surrounds by as much as 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit (around 3 degrees Celsius), and officials hope that before 2030, it could shave off up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius).\n\n“Urban forests are the very best thing for city heat,” Kathy Baughman McLeod, director of the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center (Arsht-Rock) at the Atlantic Council, told CNN. “Medellín has dropped the city’s average summer temperature, which is remarkable.”\n\nBy 2019, the city had planted more than 8,000 trees and over 350,000 shrubs. It also uses an area beneath a raised Metro line to collect rainwater that flows down from the bridge, capturing it in a system of pipes to help water the green belts.\n\nVienna: Splish, splash, splosh\n\nA child using a cooling down water feature on Schwarzenberg Square in Vienna, Austria. Guo Chen/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nLike in much of Europe, many in Vienna don’t have air conditioning, so water is a big part of how the Austrian capital keeps cool.\n\nFor those who don’t have time for a dip in the Danube, the city offers cooling parks with mist-spraying “trees” that people can either “shower” in, or just sit near to enjoy the cooler temperatures they bring their surrounds.\n\nChildren, who are generally more vulnerable to extreme heat than adults, are often seen playing in the city’s splash pools or running around in pop-up water features — typically hosepipes with holes punched in them — that the city government brings out on the hottest of days, including in areas like Karlsplatz, a popular city square.\n\nVienna also has a huge number of water fountains for drinking to keep people hydrated — more than 1,100 for its population of 1.9 million — which is important in preventing heat-related illness.\n\n“Air conditioning in homes may sound like a quick and easy solution. But it’s not a long-term sustainable solution because of the source of the power and the waste heat that comes off the unit,” McLeod said. “So thinking about how to get more airflow, use water features and get windows to open in some of the oldest buildings is key. The nature-based solutions are the best for extreme heat.”\n\nAbu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates: Use old cooling techniques and modernize them\n\nAbu Dhabi's Al Bahar Towers uses a dynamic solar shading system to keep the building cool. Ben Job/Reuters\n\nParts of the Middle East are some of the hottest inhabited places on Earth. Temperatures in Abu Dhabi can climb to more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit (over 50 Celsius). Air conditioning is seen as a necessity, and people tend to spend a lot of time indoors.\n\nBut people here haven’t always had air conditioning, and an ancient Arabic architectural cooling technique has made a comeback — with a modern twist.\n\nMashrabiya refers to the latticed screens often seen in Islamic architecture, sometimes surrounding a small balcony, that diffuse sunlight and keep buildings cool without completely blocking light. They are designed to encourage a breeze and offer a spot of respite from the heat within a building. The idea is essentially to stop direct sunlight landing on a building’s exterior.\n\nThat’s what inspired the design of Al Bahar Towers, a 25-story building wrapped in more than 1,000 hexagonal shades with built-in sensors that allow them to respond to the sun’s movements. When the sun hits the shades, they unfold like an umbrella to ward off the heat. Without these measures, the outside of such a building in Abu Dhabi could reach as high as 200 degrees (around 90 Celsius).\n\nThe technique has helped reduce the building’s need for air conditioning by 50%. Cool, huh?\n\nMiami: Target heat traps\n\nThe shady bus stop project in Miami. Miami-Dade County Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces\n\nIn a lot of cities, catching the bus can mean a long wait. If it’s really hot, the wait can be all the more punishing — unless, of course, that bus stop has been thoughtfully engineered to include natural shade.\n\nMedellín in Colombia may have proved that urban forests, or simply planting more trees, can cool a city a down, but Miami’s Dade county has put a lot of thought into exactly which parts of the city need cooling the most.\n\nNeat Streets Miami, a board convened by the county council, recognized that bus stops had become real danger zones during heat waves, so they planted trees around 10 stops. They wrote a guide on which trees work best and where to plant them so that other areas could replicate the project.\n\nAnd that they have. There are now 71 green bus stops in the country, most of them by communities that applied to the government for resources to green their own bus stops.\n\nTo make it more fun, the organizers also held a haiku poetry competition, and selected the best 10 to etch into the sidewalks by the original stops.\n\nHere’s one of them:\n\nThe trees have also\n\nmissed their bus — look how they wave\n\ntheir many sad arms\n\n— Ariel Francisco\n\nAthens: Work with what you’ve got\n\nThe Hadrian Aqueduct was built around 140 AD and can still carry water today. Greek photonews/Alamy\n\nNot every city has an ancient aqueduct at their disposal, but the Greek capital of Athens does. The Hadrian aqueduct was once used as a main source of water, using a system of pipes that worked with gravity to allow water to flow from its source to the city for human consumption.\n\nThe water today isn’t drinkable, but the city is looking at ways to salvage the 800,000 cubic meters of water that flows off as waste into the sea each year. One use will be to irrigate new greenbelts to run all along the 20 kilometer structure, which should help take the heat out of the areas around it. The water will also be used for misting, like in Vienna.\n\nEven for cities without infrastructure quite this old, Athens is a good reminder that defunct water systems can sometime be revived.\n\nLos Angeles: Paint the town white\n\nWorkers painting a road in Los Angeles to tackle heat. City of Los Angeles\n\nThis one is a little more controversial.\n\nSome cities have experimented with painting rooftops white to reflect sunlight and keep buildings cool, but Los Angeles went a step further and is painting entire roads white. Dark things like asphalt absorbs sunlight and emits that energy back into the air as heat. Painting the asphalt white would theoretically nip that process in the bud, and lead to cooler air temperatures.\n\nThe idea has some merit. Researchers Ariane Middel and V. Kelly Turner found that technique did cool the streets themselves by around 10 degrees. But there was a major knock-on effect. The same researchers also said it was likely the extra heat reflecting off the roads was being absorbed by … people.\n\nThat means if you’re a few blocks away, the white streets may help you feel cooler, but if you’re on the street, you could actually feel hotter.\n\nNonetheless, LA is continuing with this program to see what works and what doesn’t. It currently uses a grayish-white substance called CoolSeal, once used to help hide grounded aircraft from satellites, but it’s possible that another type of paint could yield different results.\n\nPainting rooftops has had greater success.\n\nResults vary depending on the level of heat and materials a roof is made of, but in places like Ahmedabad in India, which gets seriously hot, cool roofs have shaved 3-8 degrees Fahrenheit of the heat in homes. According to Berkeley Lab’s Heat Island Group, a black roof could be as much at 54 degrees (around 30 Celsius) hotter than a white roof.\n\nAnother option is the green roof. Cities all around the world have created “gardens in the sky” to cool down buildings.\n\nParis: Get really organized\n\nPeople cool down at the Jardin des Tuileries on a hot afternoon in Paris. Mehdi Taamallah/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nThe French capital gets seriously hot.\n\nTemperatures there have surpassed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) this summer, but the combination of high-rise buildings, limestone monuments and busy asphalt roads means it can feel even hotter.\n\nThe city has a strong urban heat island effect, where it is often 18 degrees hotter in the city center on a summer’s day than it is in the Parisian hinterlands.\n\nBut Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has been credited with putting in place some of the world’s most innovative measures to combat heat, and the city’s heat plan is truly comprehensive.\n\nThe main result is a city full of “cool islands.” Parisians can use an app called EXTREMA to guide them to more than 800 cool spots — parks, water fountains and air-conditioned museums, for example — and get there via a naturally cooled walkway. The idea is that a cool island is always a maximum seven minutes’ walk away for everyone.\n\nLike Vienna, Paris uses mist machines on hot days. It also has dozens of new “splash fountains,” in addition to its many traditional fountains, which are very shallow pools with fountain-like effects.\n\nParis’ heat plan involves a register that identifies the most vulnerable, so officials can check up on them by phone and offer advice on staying cool. Kindergartens get temporary air conditioners in their classrooms, and public parks and pools stay open for longer hours into the night. And like LA, Paris is trying to take the heat out of its roads and sidewalks by “demineralizing them,” using more porous materials. Now that sounds like a plan.\n\nSeville, Spain: Name your heat waves\n\nVisitors use a public fountain in Seville, Spain. Marcelo del Pozo/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe world has been naming hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons for decades for a reason: A named storm makes you sit up and pay attention. The southern Spanish city of Seville is taking that approach with heat waves, becoming world’s first to do so.\n\nThe July heat wave there was named Zoe.\n\n“Naming heat waves is a positive thing because it means we’re recognizing how lethal they are, and that they’re here to stay. It’s not a fluke heat wave,” the Arsht-Rock’s McLeod said. “This is this is something we’re going to be living with for a long time, no matter what we do with our emissions.”\n\nBut there’s more to what Seville is doing than naming. Arsht-Rock is working with Seville on a new categorization system for heat waves based on projected negative health outcomes. The idea is to avoid scientific jargon that most people don’t understand and link alert levels to what a heat wave is likely to do to people.\n\nA 2018 Brown University study of 20 heat warning systems in the United States found that only Philadelphia’s heat warning system was effective in saving lives, partly because it uses health-based metrics.\n\n“Besides physical interventions for heat, naming and categorizing heat waves is the best, most immediate thing you can do,” McLeod said. “Because that’s the key — heat is killing people, and that’s because people are not aware of the magnitude of the problem.”", "authors": ["Angela Dewan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/06/03/erie-city-council-1-million-fix-roof-miller-bros-site/84007224007/", "title": "Will Erie City Council OK $1 million to fix roof at Miller Bros. site?", "text": "The city of Erie-owned former Miller Bros.

The flashing on Lee Hall was also damaged, according to Kendall Jones, associate vice president Facilities, Planning, Construction, and Safety.\n\nWhile the campus cleanup is underway classes will be conducted remotely May 13-17. Monday marks the start of the summer semester at FAMU.\n\nFollowing Friday’s closure, FAMU Developmental Research School (DRS) administrators will announce re-opening plans over the weekend. The Educational Research Center for Child Development’s (ERCCD) roof was damaged, and the facility will be closed at least Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for repairs.\n\n“We appreciate all of the prayers and support from the community. Our employees are working strenuously to ensure we can restore normal operations as soon as possible,” Robinson said in a statement. “Although there has been substantial damage from the storm, we are thankful that there has been no loss of life or serious injuries reported.”\n\nWeatherTiger: The 'most destructive tornado in Tallahassee's history may have occurred'\n\nRyan Truchelut, better known as the WeatherTiger hurricane forecaster to Tallahassee, said Friday's mornings storm was a rare thing indeed.\n\n\"Long-tracking tornadoes are very unusual in Leon County,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"Notable recent events were a 2021 EF-1 that flipped planes at the the airport and then continued east to Southwood, and a 2019 EF-3 in rural eastern parts of the county. There is no history of anything other than brief, short-lived touchdowns in the urban core, college campuses, or densest residential areas of town.\"\n\nHe continued that \"radar data, an 84 mph wind gust report from FAMU, and wide swaths of structural and severe tree damage suggest that most destructive tornado in Tallahassee's history may have occurred around 7 a.m. today.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service will make the final determination.\n\nLooking for a late evening bite to eat?

Residents hunkered down in interior hallways and bathrooms as they prepared for the worst in the early morning hours.\n\n“Having been in Indianhead for 40 years, and a Florida native, I had always heard of tornadoes and the freight train noise that they make, but I had never experienced it. Well, now I have experienced it,” said Sherry Mills, an Indianhead resident.\n\nHer son and small grandson just happened to be staying over at her house the night before. “We all ran to the bathroom with no windows, it was unbelievable. The worst of it was only about five minutes, but it was terribly frightening.”\n\nThe cleanup of the neighborhood with the massive green and brown camouflaged roads will likely take days before residents see some sense of normalcy.\n\nVideo of Railroad Square from above shows scope of damage\n\nThe beloved arts district of Railroad Square was one of the hardest hit areas of Tallahassee, along with Indianhead Acres, Myers Park and College Town.\n\nSee the scope of the damage from above in drone footage and hear from one of the business owner's.\n\n\"It's terrible,\" she said. \"One of the galleries is completely gone, smashed down to the ground.

Leon County teams are actively responding to emergency calls, downed trees, clearing roads, assessing buildings, and supporting all response and recovery operations.\n\nThe scene of the tragedy off Aenon Park Road\n\nAt around 7:30 a.m., a woman believed to be 47 was killed after a tree fell on a trailer on Aenon Lane, off of Aenon Church Road, according to Shonda Knight, a spokesperson for LCSO. A sheriff’s deputy who was in the area was waved down by a resident and alerted to a fallen tree and a woman trapped under it. EMS and the Tallahassee Fire Department responded to the call.\n\nParkwayWrecker Service was also called to lift the tree off of the home, Knight said.\n\nThe woman’s significant other was able to get out of the house with minor injuries.\n\nAt the scene, sheriff's deputies and victims were helping the grieving family.\n\nTallahassee calls on more neighboring utilities to help\n\nWith more than half of Tallahassee's power grid off line, Tallahassee is beefing up its mutual aid call. A city spokesperson said they now have 10 different utilities from neighboring states and other Florida cities descending on Tallahassee to help reconnect customers.\n\nLeon County woman killed after tree falls on home\n\nThe Leon County Sheriff's Office has announced that a woman was killed during the storm.\n\n\"We regret to inform that deputies are working a storm related fatality in the area of Aenon Church Rd,\" the Leon County Sheriff's Office announced. \"An adult female is deceased due to a tree falling on the family’s home.\"\n\nSuperintendent Rocky Hanna: 'The timing couldn't have been worse'\n\nAfter a white-knuckle start to the school day in which the district tried to keep schools open, Leon County Superintendent Rocky Hanna took to X to speak directly to parents.\n\nHann said the district felt \"reassured\" by forecasters last night that the capital city would be spared the brunt of the storm.\n\n\"The timing couldn't have been worst,\" Hanna said. \"Unfortunately right before 7 a.m., the alarms went off and we held our busses moved our kids into safety in the hallways.\"\n\nThe school district had hoped to open on a case-by-case basis and even opened elementary schools, but the extent of the damage forced them to change course.\n\n\"There were just too many logistical obstacles to overcome,\" Hanna said.\n\nHe told parents crews would be working over the weekend to ensure schools could be open Monday.\n\n\"Than you for your patience and your understanding,\" he said. \"This was completely unexpected by everyone in our community, but the main thing is no one was hurt.\"\n\nTallahassee train station ravaged by possible tornado\n\nSevere storms and a suspected tornado tore the roof off of the old Tallahassee railway station, now the welcome and visitor information center of VisitTallahassee.\n\nFriday morning, pink insulation littered the ground outside of the building and on the inside. Water dripped onto the seats of All Saints Cinema, and pieces of wood with embedded nails were scattered in the parking lot.\n\nThe station sits next to Railroad Square, which was also damaged during the storm. Twisted sheet metal from the roofs of Railroad Square’s buildings had blown over to College Town and littered the student housing complexes.\n\nThe human toll of the storm: 'Thank God my baby wasn't in there'\n\nKathy Bryant woke up early Friday morning for her work shift at Burger King. Her goal was to leave before the severe weather storm hit.\n\n\"I can't believe this,\" Bryant said while wiping her tears. \"What they gonna do about this.\"\n\nShe returned to her home on Wailes Street near Railroad Square to a gaping hole. Her kitchen and living room space are now filled with debris and the trunk of a large pine tree that once sat outside her home.\n\n\"Thank God my baby wasn't in here,\" she said of her granddaughter who occasionally stays with her overnight.\n\nSeveral of her neighbors gathered to help her collect her belongings including family photos and her insulin, which was trapped in what used to be her kitchen.\n\nShe lived in the house for four years. Now she's unsure of what she will do.\n\nDick Howser Stadium at FSU trashed by storm\n\nDick Howser Stadium took on damage from a line of severe thunderstorms and a possible tornado Friday morning.\n\nThe storm hit around the time when parents started taking their high school students to school. It has forced the closure of the campus as FSU and caused damage throughout the state. Dick Howser Stadium ― the home for FSU baseball ― was among the structures in the path of the violent storm.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThe view from Indianhead\n\nThe Indianhead neighborhood, as usual during severe weather, was hard hit. Fallen trees appear to be blocking roads every 50 yards. One neighbor reported that a treetop near his house appeared to have snapped off, was shorn of branches and driven into the ground “like a pencil.”\n\nStill other trees had their tops snipped off, apparently by strong winds, leaving jagged edges of bare wood. Power lines and supporting cables were downed and lying on the ground like a mess of twist ties. A couple of residents could be seen trying to pull a limb off a roof.\n\nWith school canceled, neighborhood kids had nothing else to do but go outside, with some dragging large branches out of the streets. One mom could be heard hollering, “Don’t go too far.”\n\nDeSantis weighs in on storms\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis took to X to thank responders and pledge the state's support in the recovery ahead.\n\n\"Following the severe weather that impacted North Florida this morning, I have directed the Florida Division of Emergency Management to work with local officials and do everything possible to return life to normalcy for our residents as quickly as possible,\" he wrote. \"Thank you to the first responders and utility workers who are working on power and roadway restoration. Stay safe and heed instructions from @FLSERT and local authorities.\"\n\nAbout half of Tallahassee is in the dark as crews deal with rain, wind to reconnect the city\n\nCity of Tallahassee crews are dealing with another round of rain and wind as they begin the monumental task of reconnecting almost 70,000 customers who are without power.\n\n\"With possible tornadic activity in Tallahassee, early assessments of the electric grid show severe damage to transmission lines, impacting 11 substations,\" the city posted on X. \"Restoration will possibly take through the weekend. Mutual aid has been requested. Crews from 8 utilities are on their way to assist from Central Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, and Jacksonville. Over 66,000 customers are without service.\"\n\nFSU \"Flying High\" circus tent is gone as FSU endures 'severe impacts'\n\nThe Tallahassee morning storm wreaked havoc on the Florida State University which said it endured \"severe impacts.\" The \"Flying High\" Circus tent is no longer standing, according to reporter Douglas Soule.\n\nThe tent material is twisted around gnarled metal beams on the soaked ground. The circular bleaches are shattered in multiple spots. Wires vine through everything.\n\nThe Florida State University Flying High Circus was founded in 1947 by Jack Haskin and was one of the first ways of integrating men and women after the college became co-ed. Haskin introduced an activity he had used as a high-school teacher in Illinois: a circus of two dozen acrobatic, juggling and balancing acts.\n\nBy the 1960s, the circus was internationally famous and appeared on TV shows such as \"Wide World of Sports.\" In the 1970s, former circus director Dickie Brinson scheduled road shows all over the Southeast and Caribbean, found donors and fostered an alumni association.\n\nLeon County Schools makes the call: Schools are closed\n\nAfter trying to take it on a case-by-case basis, Leon County Schools administrators made the call at 9:15 a.m. to close all schools for the day.\n\n\"After discussion with our school principals and staff, we have made the decision to close schools for the remainder of the day,\" the district wrote on X. \"Parents: Please proceed to your school to pick up your students.\"\n\nThe announcement came less than an hour after the district said it would be opening all elementary schools except Fort Braden and Woodville. Many high school students had arrived at schools before the worst of the storms blew through, which led them to bunker down in media rooms and hallways after the tornado warning was issued.\n\nReported tornado had downtown Tallahassee in its crosshairs\n\nChristian Oliver, meteorologist with the National Weather service in Tallahassee, said a line of severe storms intensified as it neared the city, spawning a reported tornado in the downtown area.\n\n“As that line was approaching the city, we had three distinct circulations, each with their own tornado debris signature,” Oliver said. “It looked like they were all kind of coming together into one tornadic capable storm.”\n\nOliver said the Weather Service received multiple eyewitness reports of a tornado downtown. A firefighter called in to report a twister in near Gaines Street.\n\n“We’ll have to go out once it’s safe to do so to see what really happened and what moved through the city,” he said. “But we’ve had people call in saying that they actually saw at least one tornado.”\n\nCity of Tallahassee calls in outside power crews to assist; restoration will 'take some time'\n\nWith more than 66,000 out of power in Tallahassee, city officials are putting out the call for mutual aid.\n\nThat means crews from other electric companies swoop in to assist on the more than 650 outages around the city. Eight utilities from Louisiana, Alabama, Jacksonville and Central Florida are headed to the capital city.\n\nCity spokesperson Alison Faris said there is \"significant transmission line damage which has impacted 11 substations that power the city. She said the grid was hard hit because the most intense winds hit around the city's main power plant and infrastructure.\n\nCrews are already out and assessing and reconnecting customers to the grid.\n\nFaris said after early assessment that crews will undoubtedly be working around the clock and through the weekend.\n\n\"Based on the assessment and what we are seeing right now, the restoration is going to take some time because of the severity of what we're seeing,\" she told the Democrat\n\n\"There are lots of reports of downed trees and and downed polls,\" Faris said. \"If you can stay off the roads, than please do, because that enables crews to do their work on power restoration and road clearing.\"\n\nFAMU closed; employees told to work from home\n\n\"FAMU Main Campus and FAMU DRS are CLOSED today due to severe weather conditions and a localized tornado warning,\" the university posted on X. \"All non-essential employees are instructed to work from home.\"\n\nElementary schools open, except Fort Braden and Woodville; absences and tardies will be excused\n\nLeon schools confirmed elementary schools will open at 8:30 a.m. and all absences and tardies will be excused, according to district officials on X.\n\nFt. Braden and Woodville schools will remain closed today due to damage.\n\n'Severe impacts' at Florida State University. Campus closed after storm\n\nFSU Alert, the campus emergency notification system, issued this notice.\n\n\"Following the completion of the first wave of storm assessments, it has been determined that the severe impact on campus necessitates the closure of the Tallahassee campus for business operations until further notice. Essential employees may be required to report to campus, and certain scheduled activities must continue. Employees should contact their supervisors to determine essential status.\"\n\nFor further information on the University’s status, official announcements, or situational updates, check alerts.fsu.edu.\n\nReports of tree, building damage throughout the city; city advises residents to stay off the roads if you can.\n\n\"Getting reports of trees down in many locations,\" the city of Tallahassee posted on X. \"If you can stay off the roads this morning, please do. This helps responders.\"\n\nThere are also reports of debris after the storm cause structural damage to buildings around the city. A video shot at Railroad Square shows debris down.\n\n\"Tornado damage in Tallahassee Railroad Square - shredded insulation, wood and metal littered around - pieces of roof ripped off multiple buildings,\" the post stated.\n\nThe storms that hit Tallahassee this morning intensified as they approached the city, with three distinct rotating cells combining into one reported tornado that hit downtown, according to National Weather Service forecasters.\n\nMultiple witnesses, including a firefighter near Gaines Street, called the @NWSTallahassee to report seeing a tornado downtown,\" Democrat reporter Jeff Burlew tweeted. \"The Weather Service said it wasn’t clear whether the tornado was was on the ground.\"\n\nTallahassee Community College closed\n\nTallahassee Community College will be closed on Friday \"due to impacts from severe weather,\" the college posted on X.\n\nCollege locations that will be closed today are: Main Campus, Gadsden Center, Ghazvini Center for Healthcare Education, Wakulla Center, and Wakulla Environmental Institute. College services are suspended at the Center for Innovation. The Florida Public Safety Institute will remain open and operational.\n\nSchool district officials taking it on a case-by-case basis\n\nLeon County Schools is assessing damage and advises parents that safety comes first.\n\nSchool District spokesperson Chris Petley says there are many schools without power and some with tree damage. Elementary and middle school principals are taking stock and will huddle with district officials in the 8 o'clock hour. Petley said the district is currently taking things on a school-by-school basis.\n\n\"We will have decisions in the next 30 minutes on elementary,\" he said. \"It's a site by site decision as of this moment. But that could change.\"\n\nAP exams have also been canceled by many schools.\n\nPetley emphasized that absences and tardies will be excused.\n\n\"Please make the best decision for your family at this time,\" he said.\n\nDistrict staff and administrators at the Aquilina Howell Center were advised to stay home because access to the office may be blocked due to tornado damage and inaccessible roads.\n\nPower out throughout the city; Outage map shows 60,000 customers in the dark\n\nA short and furious storm knocked out power to more than 60,000 people in Tallahassee, according to the city's power outage map.\n\nThat number rivals what the city sees during hurricane strikes or near-misses.\n\n\"There are reports of substantial scattered outages around town as a result of the severe weather moving through,\" the city posted on X. \"As it is safe to do so, crews will work to restore service. If you are driving this morning, use caution as there could be downed trees or other debris.\"\n\nTornado warning sends parents and school district scrambling\n\nThe Tallahassee area is under tornado warnings as severe storms with rotating winds roar across the Big Bend.\n\nOne tornado warning for northwestern Wakulla County and Leon County is in effect until 7:30 a.m. At 6:50 a.m., tornadic storms were located along a line extending from Midway to 14 miles southwest of Tallahassee.\n\n\"DANGEROUS SITUATION UNFOLDING FOR #TALLAHASSEE right now. SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY! Multiple circulations and Radar-confirmed tornadoes apparent on Radar. #FLwx,\" the weather service posted on X.\n\nThe storms blew up at the same time Leon County High School parents were getting their kids to school. A school district spokesperson advised parents that tardies and absences would be excused and to stay off the roads until conditions are safe.\n\nOne teacher at Leon High sent an alert to students saying \"there is no power at school. Do not drive in the storm.\"\n\nMany South Georgia school districts closed in advance of the storm, but Tallahassee was listed in a lower risk area by forecasters.\n\n\"ALL LCS Busses will be delaying pick up for elementary and middle school until the severe weather passes through our area,\" the district tweeted. \"Please monitor your email and our social media for updates. Our buses are parking at all the high schools to stay in place at this time.\"\n\nThe Weather Channel's Jim Cantore tweeted radar of what he said were two radar-indicated tornadoes in the Tallahassee area.\n\nThe tornado warning is set to end at 7:30 a.m. while a sever thunderstom warning remains until 7:45 a.m.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/07/15/trump-shooting-butler-pennsylvania/74406214007/", "title": "I grew up where Trump was shot: My story of Butler, Pennsylvania", "text": "At the foot of South Main Street – across the Connoquenessing Creek, just above the train tracks – sits a piece of property with a picturesque view of small-town America.\n\nThey put a stoplight there and a new bridge bends to the left. On the right side of the road stands a sign that went up during that construction. “The City of Butler,” it reads. “A great place to live.”\n\nMy great-grandfather thought so.\n\nOn Saturday, just outside my hometown of Butler, Pennsylvania, gunshots rang out, thrusting the town into the international spotlight. Ending a celebration. Ending at least one life. Changing countless others.\n\nThe place where I grew up finds itself part of the political zeitgeist. Once again.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn the early 1900s, an Italian stone mason named Luigi “Louis” Solari chose to settle in America, right near that split of the roadway in Butler with that newer stoplight, down the hillside behind the guardrail. Today, there's only a brush-covered parcel barely visible through the thicket.\n\nLouis built his home there. He married his wife nearby in 1905, and they returned to be “tendered a serenade by their American neighbors,\" in celebration of the nuptials, \"in which a shotgun was the principal noise maker,” according to the Butler Citizen newspaper. They raised their children there before he died.\n\nWhat Butler, Pennsylvania once was\n\nThe Butler County oil boom of the 1800s gave way to the modern commerce of the 1900s, with a bustling, vibrant downtown. Fortunes were amassed on the backs of hard-working settlers of various ethnicities in the isolated city 35 miles north of Pittsburgh.\n\nAsk anyone there and they’ll tell you that Butler, not Toledo, Ohio, was the birthplace of the Jeep, a product of the American Bantam Car Co. They hold a festival every year now to celebrate that place in history. The specialty steel mill and railcar factories in town also played major roles in World War II production, the town providing its sons for service. Those heroes are remembered with banners on street lamps lining Main Street and a memorial in Diamond Park across from the courthouse.\n\nIn 1960, John F. Kennedy stood on the steps of that courthouse as a Democratic candidate for president in the staunchly Republican town and delivered a campaign speech, less than a mile away from our old house. Local lore has it Kennedy looked at a sign on the Nixon Hotel directly across the street and quipped: “Nixon Lodge? When I’m elected president, they’ll change it to Kennedy’s Inn.” He wasn't the first president to visit. Per local historian Bill May, area oil and gas tycoon T.W. Phillips hosted William Taft at his home in 1918.\n\nBy all accounts, Butler – much like Detroit and Flint back then – was a great place to live. Before Bantam's production line dissolved. Before the Pullman railcar factory shut down in 1982 and left many unemployed. Before Armco (now a Cleveland-Cliffs specialty steel plant) downsized and changed ownership. Before street drugs took their toll as in many old steel towns up and down the Three Rivers.\n\nBefore many of my friends and their parents left and never returned.\n\nAnd before Saturday’s assassination attempt of former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump. It was his second visit to the area at a critical juncture of an election year.\n\nTrump's first visit came In the waning days of the 2020 election cycle, to a place a few miles south near the Butler Country Club, where the stone fireplace my great-grandfather built still stands. The Italian-Catholic artisan could not even have been a member at that time.\n\nTrump that evening four years ago stood before a massive crowd at the height of the pandemic on a runway at the Pittsburgh-Butler Regional Airport. He delivered his final message to voters and his enthusiastic faithful that evening. I knew many who attended, many who supported Trump then and now.\n\n“We win Pennsylvania,” Trump’s runway plea went on Oct. 31, 2020, “we win it all.”\n\nHe did neither.\n\nLess than 12 hours before polls opened, on Monday night Nov. 2, political commentator Tucker Carlson opened his nightly show on Fox News and delivered a soliloquy about Butler, a town about 35 miles north of Pittsburgh where about 13,000 people still live. The Wikipedia-informed monologue turned a decaying town into a political prop: Butler clearly is America, in need of being made great again. And Trump was the only politician who cared about its people. His people.\n\nTrump could have died. Republicans have one job at RNC in Milwaukee: Unite the country.\n\nRepublican strong\n\nTrump’s return Saturday to Butler served as his final public appearance before the Monday start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The July 3 announcement of another rally in Butler – the first former or current president to ever visit Butler twice – came at the height of the biggest event of the summer, the Big Butler Fair. I was home that week visiting my mom and relatives with my wife and kids, and the buzz whirred as loud as the Gravitron every summer on the fairgrounds.\n\nButler always has been a Republican stronghold. In April 1976, the Washington Post sent a reporter there to gauge the public interest in the Ford-Carter election later that year. The headline? “Butler, Pa., Yawning as Election Day Draws Near.”\n\n“Butler’s no better nor worse than any other place,” one longtime resident told the paper 48 years ago.\n\nThough the Post pointed to a growing number of Democrats, many of whom benefitted from the steel and rail unions at the time, most of the rich businessmen and average joe farmers in the surrounding rural areas outside of town leaned heavily Republican. A photo cutline of the courthouse where Kennedy spoke accompanied the Washington Post story and called it “almost a cliché of small-town U.S.A. and chosen as an election bellwether.”\n\nSo it remains.\n\nIn recent years, Fox News has broadcast live multiple times from Mac’s Café, a breakfast restaurant a few hundred yards away from where our old house stood. The inroads Democrats made disappeared with the blue-collar jobs in the 1980s, and the political climate today has shifted well beyond the “5-to-1 Republican” ratio it was in the 1940s, as a family friend told the Post in 1976.\n\nTrump is deified in Butler, a town where longtime auto dealership owner Mike Kelly (who married into the T.W. Phillips oil and gas family fortune) loudly serves as a controversial U.S. representative. Kelly – whose office was implicated in and denied accusations it took part in the fake elector scandal following the Jan. 6 insurrection – was instrumental in bringing Trump to town on the eve of the 2020 election. His brother, Richard \"Ike\" Kelly, ran the airport at the time. Small-town politics to the core.\n\nTrump did not stop Saturday to woo new voters or sway the undecideds on his way to Milwaukee. He arrived in Butler to soak in the fervor of his base and build momentum toward a third straight Republican Party nomination.\n\nThen shots rang out.\n\nI know these roads\n\nOutside the city limits in Butler Township, Benbrook Road snakes through the Western Pennsylvania hills and fields, crossing Route 68 and becoming Meridian Road. There is a stoplight at the Whitestown Road intersection.\n\nTurn left, and you head toward my mother’s home in nearby Lyndora, on a hillside overlooking the grayness of smoke from the steel mill. Turn right, and a few hundred yards away on the left-hand side of Whitestown is American Glass Research. The late prominent scientist and noted local conservationist Frank Preston started the firm, and also created a serene and beautiful public nature park not far away. Go straight, heading toward Meridian, and the dirt-road entrance to the Butler Farm Show grounds is a few hundred yards away on the right-hand side.\n\nIt's a complex where many kids in town, including me, learned to play soccer. The place annually hosts one final summer celebration scheduled to begin in less than three weeks, the last bash before school begins anew. It's a carnival where, in 1992, I worked for Denny and Pearl’s Pizza dishing out slices and stromboli to fairgoers.\n\nThis is where Trump was shot Saturday.\n\nReportedly, the shooter scaled the AGR building, which abuts the Farm Show grounds, perched on the rooftop and opened fire, grazing Trump’s right ear with a bullet before a Secret Service response killed him. At least one other person, Corey Comperatore (a childhood friend of one of my cousins), died after being shot. The FBI identified the shooter as a 20-year-old man from a south Pittsburgh suburb, Bethel Park, which is 55 miles and more than an hour away from Butler.\n\nA message pinned to the top of the Butler Farm Show website late Saturday night read: “The farm show office will be closed Sunday July 14th. Livestock entry deadline has been extended until Wednesday July 17th.”\n\nBecause the location is now a federal crime scene. It’s hard to believe the once-joyous place will ever feel the same again.\n\nPain, revisited\n\nI was born in Dearborn and moved to Butler before my second birthday in 1976, not long after the Washington Post’s visit, and lived there until returning to Michigan for college in 1993. I still cherish my hometown, as troubled as it is and despite my love-hate relationship with it. For such a small town, it has plenty to make me proud.\n\nThere is Notre Dame football legend Terry Hanratty, three Saul brothers who played in the NFL (two of them, twins Ron and Rich, starred at Michigan State University), Olympic medalist and former University of Michigan standout swimmer Eric Namesnik, wrestling icon Big John Studd (or John Minton, Butler High class of 1966). There’s my longtime friend, classmate/teammate and former MLB pitcher Matt Clement. Longtime Detroit Tigers standout Don Kelly was born there, too, and his dad, Tom, played baseball with my uncle for Butler High in the early 1970s. There are many other notable pro and college athletes, male and female.\n\nYou may know some of our great entertainers, too. Bret Michael Sychak, also known as Poison lead singer Bret Michaels, spent his young years in Lyndora and still returns to see family. Josie Carey helped Fred Rogers start on his path to TV greatness at WQED in Pittsburgh; our family and those on the Italian-dominated south side of town called her by her real name, Josephine Vicari. Barbara Feldon, Agent 99 of TV's “Get Smart” fame, grew up there as well.\n\nButler produced a former Chief of Naval Operations (Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert) and a former Secretary of Defense (William J. Perry). Politician Rick Santorum and 1971 Miss USA Michele McDonald.\n\nAfter Saturday, it now will be known as the place where former President Trump survived an unthinkable act of political violence, erasing the past, leaving behind a stain and compounding the pain the past five decades have heaped upon the town.\n\nOur old house is gone, like so much else\n\nMy grandfather, Ido, took over the family homestead after Louis died. He and his two brothers were bricklayers who helped continue their father’s building tradition in town after World War II. He married and raised his children there, my mother and her sister and brother. Trains loudly chugged by every day and night at the bottom of their property, downstream from the Armco mill and Pullman factory a mile or so away.\n\nYou won’t find our old house anymore. The state used eminent domain in the late 1960s, forcing my grandparents to tear down Louis Solari’s masterpiece along with the two precisely crafted stone fireplaces and imported Italian marble floors. I never saw it in person, only in home movies my family took before it was demolished. The remnants of the foundation and garage still sit somewhere under all the overgrown grass. I haven’t tried to wade through the brush to that spot in 25 years.\n\nNow and again when I return to Butler, though, I work my way along the tracks to the bottom end of what remains of our property. I look across the Connoquenessing toward town but can no longer see the courthouse or the city. The once stunning view is blocked now by the ugly, tan concrete of the bridge running overhead. I turn and look up the hill, toward where the old house used to be, trying to imagine where my mom and grandfather spent much of their lives.\n\nI think about how Louis Solari once stood there doing the same, remembering the tiny village he left in Pesariis, Italy, for good (I finally got to see it in person two years ago) and finding a place that reminded him of home -- a place where he could chase his American dream.\n\nI imagine how great it must have been.\n\nChris Solari is a Michigan State Writer for the Detroit Free Press, where this column originally appeared.

Six people are running for mayor of Cincinnati in the May 4 primary, after which the field narrows to the top two vote-getters for the general election.\n\nEarly voting begin Tuesday when city residents can being choosing from a field of political newcomers and well-known politicians, some currently on City Council. That group of five Democrats and one independent includes: Ohio Sen. Cecil Thomas, of Avondale; Cincinnati Councilman David Mann, of Clifton; Hamilton County Clerk of Courts Aftab Pureval, of Clifton; retired Cincinnati firefighter Raffel Prophett, of Avondale; Businessman Gavi Begtrup, of Mount Lookout; and educator Dr. Herman Najoli, of West Price Hill.\n\nThe Enquirer editorial board has been following all six campaigns closely during this election cycle, and met with each of the mayor candidates to discuss their policy points and reasons for running. The board also asked each candidate to fill out a questionnaire covering some of the most pressing issues facing Cincinnati, including concerns about corruption at City Hall, affordable housing, policing and the city budget, among other topics.\n\nIt is important to provide our readers with some of the insight we gleaned from our time with the candidates, so we are presenting their unedited responses to our questions here. It is the board's hope that this summary will provide information that enhances your own evaluations of the race and helps you make an informed decision whether you decide to vote early or on May 4.\n\nQ: Why are you running for mayor?\n\nHerman Najoli: I am the unlikeliest of candidates. I am an outsider of politics, an independent and an educator who lives on the West Side. Rarely do you ever see anyone with those three attributes run for mayor in Cincinnati. I was compelled to enter the race last November after I assessed three things: my gifts, my desires and the opportunities ahead. My gifts include my active personality, talents in education and bold outsider ideas for excellence in organizational leadership within government. My desires include a passionate empathy for people, moral values like the dignity of hard work and independent mentality for uniting progressive thought and conservative philosophy. The opportunities ahead include the challenges of our community, the expectations of the moment and the need for lasting change that truly transforms our entire city, particularly the forgotten neighborhoods. At the end of my mayorship, I want it to be said of me, \"He changed the game.\" Party politicians and career politicians come to our neighborhood every election cycle and promise heaven. Months and years go by, we never see them back in the community. Then we read about them engaged in corruption. It hurts. I will be a true neighborhoods mayor who is visibly present in all 52 neighborhoods.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nGavi Begtrup: When I was the board chair of the Spencer Center, it took eight public school kids getting hit by cars before City Hall would fulfill our request for a school crosswalk. We need a mayor who will create an equitable and safe city with good jobs, not a city where kids have to die for City Hall to take action. Cincinnati is where I’ve raised my kids, it’s where I’ve built my small businesses, and it’s where I’ve worked in the community, especially building the Donald and Marian Spencer Center public school. The Queen City is home, but we’re struggling with stagnant growth and wages, unaffordable housing and rising violence. City Hall isn’t delivering for the people – it’s time for a change. We need the city to grow equitably and work for everyone. I’m running for mayor to restore a city government we can trust, one that is proactive in serving our community. As the only small business owner in the race, I have created good jobs with livable wages and brought tens of millions of dollars to our city. I also have deep policy and government experience as the former policy advisor for Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, where I worked with diverse stakeholders to write legislation and billion dollar budgets. I have the experience in business, in government and in our community to be a mayor who will lead, create jobs and enact smart policies that serve the whole city.\n\nRaffel Prophett: I love Cincinnati. I was raised, educated and served here. My wife and I built our home here and are raising our children. And so, I have a personal and vested interest in our city’s equity, well-being, success, sustainability and resilience. The city needs new leadership – courageous, creative and selfless leadership. A leadership responsive to the \"real\" needs of Cincinnatians. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the disproportionate hardship many of our fellow citizens face from health disparities to lack of access to the digital infrastructure. The city must step up to alleviate this suffering. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. proclaimed \"the fierce urgency of now!\" We must make equity a reality for all Cincinnatians.\n\nDavid Mann: My life has been a life of public service to my country and community. I have been privileged to serve in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Congress, Cincinnati City Council and as mayor for three years. I have no ambition for anything except to serve my community. I have chaired every committee of council and now chair the budget and finance committee. I understand better than most exactly what is involved in leading over 6,000 employees and 17 departments with a budget of $1.5 billion. We will have one of the youngest, least experienced group of council members in history after the next election. I believe my experience, evenhanded personality and maturity give me the tools to be a mentor and leader for this new council as we face the enormous challenge of recovering and moving on from the pandemic.\n\nAftab Pureval: I love Cincinnati. But for families across our city, it’s been a challenging year with COVID-19, the economic downturn and corruption in City hall. Our city is in a tough spot right now, but that is exactly when Cincinnati shines. And right now, we need strong leadership in the mayor’s office to come out swinging and accomplish what I know we can. I’m running for mayor to lift up all of Cincinnati. Our city must continue to grow, but we have to be honest that the success of the last 10 years has not been felt in all 52 neighborhoods. Every person in Cincinnati matters, and our measure of success cannot just be how the wealthiest are doing. It’s not enough, therefore, to just grow. We need to grow equitably. We either take on the inequities in our justice, health care, housing and economic systems, or we fall short of what we can be. I believe I’m uniquely situated to lead us into the next decade given my track record of taking on\n\ncorruption, reforming outdated bureaucratic systems and improving basic services. As Hamilton County Clerk of Courts, I ended the office’s nepotism and cronyism, expanded services and supported the most vulnerable among us with an award-winning Eviction Help Center. We invested in innovation while simultaneously saving taxpayers millions of dollars and giving money back to the county every year I’ve been in office. Together, I know we can move Cincinnati forward with creative solutions.\n\nCecil Thomas: I’m running to restore the integrity of the Queen City. Due to recent events involving elected members of council, Cincinnati’s character around the country and world is now in question. There is a perception that our city is a \"corrupt city.\" The ripple effects of that can be very costly and can lead to significant, permanent damage to the city’s economic growth. Investors looking to invest in Cincinnati must feel there’s an equal playing field and that everyone is negotiating in good faith. It becomes very difficult for the Port Authority, 3CDC, REDI Cincinnati and others to successfully market our city if there’s a cloud of perceived corruption. Residents living in Cincinnati must have the faith and trust that their government leaders are good stewards over the affairs of the city. If this doesn’t happen in a timely manner, residents will flee the city and investors will look elsewhere.\n\nQ: What would be your top priorities as mayor?\n\nNajoli: First, basic services and amenities. A center of business and economic excellence is resplendent with vibrancy. As mayor, I will work to streamline the city’s basic services. We will increase operational efficiencies in all departments. We will ensure functional amenities for residents. This will spur an extremely attractive and likable city for investment and growth. Second, crime and transit. An international juggernaut of education and sporting events has low crime and great connectivity. We want everyone to be involved in productive pursuits. We will improve the traditional avenues of fighting crime but also enable our people to pursue purposeful potential. Building our transit systems enables access and lessens social disparities. Third, affordable housing and desirability. A thriving metropolis of growing residents and home ownership makes it possible for its citizens to be housed. We will work through the Port Authority, neighborhood Community Development Corporations and numerous partner organizations to advance our urban redevelopment efforts. We will make our city attractive to newcomers for a much stronger tax base. And fourth, inclusiveness and health. A youthful place that cultivates equity and human potential is first and foremost inclusive and then is characterized by good public health. We will create a lab for facilitating belongingness. We will also ramp up our health systems to keep diseases at bay, tackle trafficking and addiction and make our health systems responsive to all.\n\nBegtrup: Ending corruption, creating jobs with livable wages, making housing affordable and reforming policing and improving public safety. We must restore trust in Cincinnati government by rooting out the corruption in City Hall that is keeping our city from growing equitably. Entire neighborhoods are being left behind while we continue to dole out tax money to the rich. When corruption thrives, businesses and people suffer. And as a small business owner who has created good jobs with livable wages and brought tens of millions of dollars to the region, I will support the growth of small businesses in every neighborhood. I will champion policies to replace gentrification with community-led development without displacement, addressing Cincinnati’s lack of quality housing at every price point. I will revitalize the Collaborative Agreement to make Cincinnati the country’s leader in police reform.\n\nProphett: Cleaning up City Hall. I will take the lead by returning City Hall to good governance practices: refine our council-manager-strong mayor form of government; hire a certified professional city manager; council sets policy; the mayor sets legislative agenda; and council and the mayor must be selfless leaders. We must also stop kicking the affordable housing can down the road. We must be committed to solving the affordable housing crisis. Transforming public safety is also a priority. Through data analysis, we will structure our public safety forces and other city assets to meet the needs of our citizens. I would also address poverty. I spent my formative years in the West End. I saw poverty, and I know how it affects families and their future. Poverty has so many negative ramifications, such as health, crime, infant mortality and a host of others. When I become mayor, I will get at poverty in a meaningful way in our city.\n\nMann: First, restore trust and confidence in City Hall through anti-corruption legislation and a return to the norms of the past for the city’s elected leaders. Second, move from pandemic recovery to the next exciting chapter in Cincinnati’s renaissance. Third, jobs and development. Fourth, maintain and increase numbers of police officers, firefighters, public service employees and staffing in other critical departments. Fifth, address racial disparity and end the time when Cincinnati is a \"Tale of Two Cities,\" one Black and one white. Finally, increase the number of affordable housing units.\n\nPureval: My top priority is an economic recovery after COVID-19 that benefits all 52 neighborhoods. To make sure prosperity is shared in every corner of our city, we need to rebuild our economy after COVID and prioritize growing equitably. This means an economy with better wages, paid family leave and opportunities for people to start and grow small businesses. As mayor, I will prioritize recovering and rebuilding our economy so that all families can thrive. I will work to keep families in their homes, connect unemployed workers with in-demand jobs and direct funding to struggling restaurants. I will grow our economy by streamlining the process to start a business and attract new companies and skilled workers to Cincinnati. And I will fight to share prosperity more equitably by expanding Black businesses ownership and home ownership, reforming the city bidding process and taking on the racial health disparities of COVID-19. We also need to continue to reform and improve our police department and invest in public\n\nsafety so every neighborhood is safe. And we need to improve access to affordable housing and basic services like public transportation to get families back on their feet.\n\nI’m not going to promise that we can do this overnight. It is going to take time, and it is going to take all of us. But with a shared commitment to executing on our values, I know we can get it done.\n\nThomas: My first priority will be to set a course to restore integrity, character and trust. I would start by having a public, transparent, mayor and council retreat. The purpose will be to have a candid, laser-focused discussion regarding moving forward together, as a team. I would layout my vision for the city and the means to fulfill it. I would stress the critical importance of the continued growth of our city through economic development. Then, I would explain in detail how economic development impacts all other priorities. Transportation, infrastructure, public safety, public services, affordable and market rate housing, education, inclusion, social services, tourism, and a very resourceful Convention and Visitors Bureau. Our city should be clean, safe and vibrant.\n\nQ: Corruption at City Hall is front and center. Do you think the reforms currently taking place after the indictments of three sitting council members are enough? If not, what more needs to happen in your opinion?\n\nNajoli: No, the reforms taking place are not enough. As mayor, I will undertake an intensive listening tour in all 52 neighborhoods to rebuild trust with residents. Those reforms are crafted by insiders. City Hall is deaf to resident ideas. A solution centered approach requires partnership with fellow citizens. For instance, I have developed a Checklist of Good Leader Behaviors (CGLB) that I would like each council member to review with me, as mayor, on a quarterly basis. Both actions are vital. Going out to the people to mine ideas and gain feedback, then working internally to apply the ideas or change leader behavior. Corruption at City Hall will only end when we are the character city of the United States. Our city is named after Cincinnatus – a paragon of virtue. We will benchmark our approaches against top cities in the world like Boston and London. I will create an \"Elders Council,\" which will mentor ethical leaders in our city. We must end \"business as usual\" at City Hall.\n\nBegtrup: The most important thing Cincinnati can do to end corruption is to elect a mayor and City Council who haven’t taken money from developers with millions of dollars of business in front of the city. Leadership starts with personal responsibility, which is why I created the Clean Campaign Pledge to not accept donations from developers, a pledge that a number of council candidates have signed onto.\n\nProphett: No! I believe the 1999 charter amendment, where Cincinnati voters narrowly passed the measure that created the council-manager-stronger mayor form of government, precipitated corruption. I recommended that the motion for an anti-corruption task force brought forth by Councilman David Mann be amended to expand the commission’s scope. The commission should broaden its scope to include an evaluation of the stronger mayor structure and its influence on corruption.\n\nMann: I authored the legislation creating the blue-ribbon reform panel charged with studying ethics issues at City Hall, including council involvement in development negotiations. The panel has been asked to develop a code of conduct for elected officials and to review the link between developments and campaign contributions. The panel is to present its recommendations by August 1, soon enough for charter amendment proposals to make it to the November ballot. Despite these initiatives, corrupt people will be corrupt. We need to minimize the opportunities to sell votes.\n\nPureval: Corruption is a massive problem holding our city back from what it could be. While I applaud the task force that the mayor has put together, and the charter amendments supported by Vice Mayor Christopher Smitherman and Councilwoman Betsy Sunderman, we have to do more. I look forward to the recommendations from the task force, and Sunderman and Smitherman’s proposals are a strong start, but those reforms are reactive – changing the process for responding to corruption after it has occurred. What I think we should be laser-focused on is preventing corruption. The best way to do that is to increase transparency. Right now, our ethics disclosures for local elected officials do not provide enough information to hold our elected officials accountable for relationships with people who might have business in front of the city. This is true for both gifts and salaries. The good news is that we already have a\n\nmodel in Ohio; we don’t have to recreate the wheel. The state legislature in Ohio has much more rigorous ethical reporting standards. The first thing we should do to drive more transparency and prevent ethical violations is to raise our ethical standards to meet those of the state legislature. This is a Day One action item for my administration, and it’s a very distinct and simple way to provide more transparency in the process.\n\nThomas: I applaud those legislators in their effort to address the corruption, however, I would go a step further and establish an Independent Charter Review Committee to clearly and distinctly define roles and responsibilities of the branches of government and provide recommendations. There’s too much ambiguity between the mayor, city manager and council, regarding roles and responsibilities. This would allow everyone to stay in their lanes. My Ohio Senate experience as a member of the Recodification Committee, charged with cleaning up our Criminal Code and the Sentencing Commission and cleaning up our sentencing laws, positions me to lead this effort by experience.\n\nQ: Do you think the mayor should be involved in development deals? If so, to what extent?\n\nNajoli: Balance is critical in all things. Obviously, city government is the leader in community development work and the mayor is the lead voice of the city. Good stewardship requires that the mayor be involved in development deals while great leadership requires that the mayor show wisdom in facilitating deals. As an educator, I have been a facilitator of adult learning, and I believe that the best mayor is a good facilitator. The mayor should be involved in development deals as a facilitator for stakeholders. Benjamin Barber, in his book \"If Mayors Ruled the World,\" argued that mayors who are free of ideological infighting are the key to our global future. As an independent candidate, I am not beholden to any special interests. In assessing development deals, I will exercise high level governance.\n\nBegtrup: Restoring the tripartite government enshrined in the charter is a priority of my campaign. The mayor must set a vision for an equitably growing Cincinnati and create values and priorities that guide development. For example, any development deal that receives incentives from the city must have community engagement and buy-in and must fit into a larger plan for affordable housing and transit. It is then the responsibility of the city administration to negotiate development deals and the role of council to evaluate those deals in alignment with our shared values and priorities.\n\nProphett: No. We have a city manager form of government where the CEO of the city is responsible for executing development deals.\n\nMann: As the elected leader of the city, the mayor inevitably will have some involvement in development. He provides political insights to the city administration including the city manager and development officers. He may be needed to break impasses. His role can be very helpful and constructive so long as he respects the guardrails inherent in our charter. The city manager is the CEO and chief administrative officer. The city manager has independent authority and responsibility to the three legs of city government – city manager, mayor and City Council – and, ultimately, to the citizens of our city.\n\nPureval: We have unfortunately seen what happens when politicians ignore rules and guidelines. We need to be skeptical about any politician getting involved in the specifics of development deals. The good news is that the charter provides a strong framework for us to follow. We should empower the professionals working in City Hall to negotiate with developers. We are not always going to agree with these City Hall professionals, but when we disagree, it should be transparent and out in the open. We have to put an end to the culture of back-room deals. As mayor, it will be my responsibility to set the vision for the city – to set priorities with respect to growing our economy, developing our infrastructure and our small businesses. I will empower my team, and the city manager and their team, to act on that vision and execute on those goals. It will be my job to be aware of the patchwork of development, but it will not be my job to negotiate specific deals. That should be left to the professionals.\n\nThomas: The mayor should not be directly involved in any development deals. His or her role should be to allow the manager and his team to use their gifts and talents to negotiate with developers. The mayor should expect the city manager to negotiate the best deal that’s in the city’s best interest. Then the mayor and manager should present the recommendation to council for discussion and input and eventual approval. Under a clearly defined charter, there shouldn’t be any problems. Critical to all of this is the hiring of a city manager and trust that he or she will hire the best and brightest administrators. The mayor and the council should get out of the way and let them do their job.\n\nQ: Will you take money from developers? What assurances will you give the public if those donors/developers were to come before council seeking tax breaks that the process would be fair?\n\nNajoli: No. I will not. I am an outsider of all current city deals and operations. I have zero developer friends. With me as mayor, the process will be fair. The citizens of Cincinnati should have the confidence of knowing that I will safeguard their interests well. It would be extremely wrong for a developer or donor to offer me money in exchange for support. If this is the culture at City Hall, I will change it completely by ending such a practice. Good governance will be a hallmark of my administration. My campaign is funded 100% by residents of Cincinnati. I have no non-Cincinnati influences.\n\nBegtrup: We deserve a City Hall that we can trust, which is why I am not taking any money from developers with business in front of the city. The people of Cincinnati deserve leadership that will always do the right thing for Cincinnati, not the right thing for wealthy campaign donors. Cincinnati businesses deserve a fair playing field.\n\nProphett: No. I will assure the public that there will be complete transparency, and if I am offered anything illegal, I will immediately inform law enforcement.\n\nMann: To me the question should be, what are rules for political contributions? I supported the reform to our charter which ended the use of multiple LLCs by a single individual contributor. The blue-ribbon reform panel has been asked to consider strong rules regulating contributions from developer. The key is transparency requiring continuing full disclosure of all contributions, from everyone – ordinary citizens and organizations of any kind.\n\nPureval: In every campaign I have run, the support I received was based on people who aligned with my values and my principles – not based on what I could do for them, transactionally, once elected. That will continue once I am mayor. I’m proud that we are running a grassroots campaign focused on listening to all 52 neighborhoods, talking to voters in all 52 neighborhoods and getting both volunteer and financial support in all 52 neighborhoods. And I’m proud of the fact that we have almost 1,000 individual contributions. One thing I want to make as clear as possible is that my responsibility as mayor will not be to involve myself in the specifics of development deals; we need to leave that up to the business professionals to execute on our vision. I will always be transparent with the people of Cincinnati. For example, I do not have a PAC. If you look at my campaign, you will know the money I have and where it came from – voters of\n\nCincinnati can rest assured that what they see is what they get. My decisions as mayor, and the values that I will prioritize, will be dictated by one question: What is in the best interest of Cincinnatians? That is the rubric I will follow, whether it’s a decision on legislation, board appointments or strategic planning for the future of our city.\n\nThomas: I would not have any problem accepting donations from developers simply because I’m a man of honesty and integrity. My support is not for sale. That’s a tone that I established going back in 2005 when I first ran for City Council. I’ve never strayed from that principle. Integrity, transparency, trust and the fear of God have always been my guiding principles. I also strongly believe that most developers are honorable people of good will, and it’s up to each individual elected official to use their best judgment whether to accept a given donations. If there’s any doubt of the legitimacy, then it should not be accepted.\n\nQ: If council fails to take action on a forensic audit of past development projects, would you support one for every project in the pipeline?\n\nNajoli: Yes, I will. The idea of an outside firm looking into city operations has upside. I understand why council may not want to look at past development deals. Perhaps for past deals what we might do is convene a small-scale \"Truth and Forgiveness Commission,\" which can uncover anything that might have gone wrong in the past for educational purpose.\n\nBegtrup: We must ensure that no taxpayer money has been spent on projects that have been tainted by corruption. And then we must make sure that members of council who have conflicts recuse themselves from future development decisions.\n\nProphett: Yes.\n\nMann: Sure, we always should know the relationships between developers, developments and council members.\n\nPureval: I do support a third-party audit of projects in the pipeline right now. Corruption has to be rooted out – and while that’s vital to the perception of our city, it’s also vital to the health of our economy. If people don’t trust our process and our leaders in City Hall, they aren’t going to feel comfortable investing here, moving here, staying here or raising their families here. Getting this right is critically important for the future of our city. We have to make sure that the deals currently in the pipeline are totally above board. Voters in our city and our region deserve that level of transparency and peace of mind. Hopefully, we do not find any evidence of corruption, but the best-case scenario is that we receive much-needed recommendations for how we can be better. A third-party forensic audit is a commonsense process improvement opportunity and a necessary step in our anti-corruption measures.\n\nThomas: I would support an audit, but it must be for the right reasons. There must be a clearly defined purpose and not a fishing expedition. If the audit will be beneficial in helping to explain how this all happened and to help formulate recommendations, then I think it’s good to help the city move forward. But if the audit is for the purpose of fishing, trying to score political points on past elected officials and developers, that’s not good and can only hinder moving forward. The last thing our city needs is developers overlooking Cincinnati and choosing to go elsewhere because we’re sending signals that all developers are bad. In their world, I’m sure, the word will spread quickly.\n\nQ: Do you support the affordable housing charter amendment? Why or why not? If not, what is your plan to address the affordable housing shortage in the city?\n\nNajoli: Having worked with many homeless men at a local shelter, I understand the plight of the unhoused. In 2015, I was named one of Cincinnati’s \"Forty Under 40\" for serving homeless persons. The need is great. I support the affordable housing charter amendment. City Council has been able to find money for needs in the past. We can do this. Franklin D. Roosevelt said, \"It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.\" I am inherently solutions oriented. I will harness remarkable minds and provide fresh approaches for handling our housing needs. I would like to attract a certified Benefits Corporations (B Corps) in the real estate industry to the Cincinnati area. I would like more local organizations to embrace affordable housing as a corporate social responsibility goal.\n\nBegtrup: Affordable housing is critical to the future of our city, and funding the affordable housing trust fund is an important step in closing the gap between our city needs and availability. When families have access to affordable housing, kids grow up in more stable homes. When kids have stable homes, they do better in school, they do better in life, and they can break the cycle of poverty. I’ve seen this firsthand at the Spencer Center, where kids from all over the city are thriving. Unfortunately, we have a lack of quality affordable housing in our city. Despite creating the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, City Hall hasn’t adequately funded it, which is why 9,500 Cincinnatians felt it necessary to bring forth this amendment. Were I mayor today, I would convene an aggressive task force comprising big and small business, community groups and nonprofits to implement a public-private partnership to finance the trust fund before the May election. If City Hall fails to act, we should expect the charter amendment to pass and leave the city in a challenging funding position.\n\nProphett: Yes. The affordable housing crisis in the city is huge. There is a shortage of 28,000 affordable housing units today, and the crisis is only growing. After years of failed leadership, the civic engagement that it took to bring people together to put that trust fund on the ballot is admirable. That is what it will take to move our city forward. As mayor, I won't be some type of savior that has all the answers. But I will lead from the front as the collaborative chief to get things done. We must find creative ways to fund affordable housing without cutting essential services.\n\nMann: I do not support the charter amendment. It does not identify a source of revenue to provide $50 million per year forever. Given a general fund budget of $400 million, dedicating $50 million exclusively to affordable housing every year cannot be done without major impacts on basic city services, including reductions in numbers of police officers and firefighters and public service employees who handle waste collection, snow removal, street repair and maintenance. Recreation centers and health clinics will have to close or dramatically reduce their hours of service. The charter amendment takes virtually all authority over the $50 million per year from City Council, the city manager or anyone accountable to the public. The amendment creates a board of 11 people, two persons to be selected by the president pro tem of City Council. As to the other nine members of the board, council must appoint nine members selected by various groups with all sorts of direct interests in the expenditure of funds in the trust. That is, most of the board members have direct conflicts of interest. The board acts completely independently to decide how money is spent without anyone in government authorized to review these decisions. The board approves contracts which must be executed by the city manager. I wrote the legislation creating the affordable housing trust and the law taxing air bnbs, with all collections going to the trust. In addition, for the first time starting with current year’s budget, one-fourth of all district TIF funds now must support affordable housing. The city manager has recommended using $10 million of the federal stimulus funds for affordable housing.\n\nPureval: I do not support the affordable housing charter amendment, but I do support prioritizing affordable housing. I empathize with the frustration of those who do support the charter amendment, because the truth of the matter is our city has not had a comprehensive approach to affordable housing. It has not been a priority. We need to get this issue right. Every day in the Hamilton County Courthouse, I see the devastating effects of not having an affordable housing strategy in Eviction Court. I see parents with small children being rendered homeless because they cannot afford their rent. This happens every day in Hamilton County, and it unfortunately disproportionately affects Black mothers. It is absolutely critical that we bring everyone to the table and prioritize affordable housing. First, we need to fund the affordable housing trust fund. However, relying entirely on the city’s general fund is a missed opportunity. We have to leverage city dollars in order to incentivize our institutional philanthropies and our Fortune 500 companies to invest in the trust fund. We also have to build an infrastructure that puts the city in the best possible position to win grants from the federal government, whether it be from the administration or from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. But we cannot stop there. A comprehensive plan will also require a review of the city’s development incentives like TIFF, tax abatements and VITICA to ensure that we are not only incentivizing growth but also incentivizing equity. And finally, we need a real commitment to tenants’ rights. We need a housing court to hold bad landlords accountable and support tenants and homeowners who want to grow with their neighborhoods. And we have to balance the playing field in Eviction Court by working to ensure greater access to lawyers and legal services for tenants who cannot afford representation. For too long our city has not been committed to affordable housing. If I’m elected mayor, I will change that.\n\nThomas: I do not support the affordable housing charter amendment, but I do understand the need. A guiding principle of good fiscal responsibility is to not propose an expenditure without an identified source to pay for it. Requiring the city to spend $50 million from its budget without identifying the source of the expenditure would bankrupt the city. A more reasonable solution would be to identify federal, state and local funding sources, coupled with public private partnerships and set ambitious, 10-20 year goals. This would require the establishment of an Affordable Housing Sub-Committee. The purpose would be to have a significant number of interested party meetings to hear from the experts and develop a pathway. We should also invest a sizable portion of the federal stimulus windfall into the housing trust fund.\n\nQ: What is one thing in the city budget that you would change?\n\nNajoli: Find a way to provide more support to neighborhood community councils. They are vital to revitalization and need more attention. Numerous councils state that their needs are overwhelming. The community councils are terrific partners in helping the city meet its other goals and priorities. There are some neighborhoods which are forgotten, and the community councils are not functional. These councils need to be revived and funded to ensure that all 52 neighborhoods operate in unison as one well-oiled machine. We will make the budgeting process more participatory for individuals through their community councils.\n\nBegtrup: To stimulate job creation and recovery in our neighborhoods, I would increase funding for Black and brown small businesses, which have been hit especially hard by the pandemic. But it will take more than one thing to right our budget. Our city budget is facing unprecedented challenges due to uncertainty in tax receipts and the economy. My first action as mayor will be to conduct a complete review of the budget, both revenues and expenditures, and engage in a participatory budgeting process to align our spending with our vision for an equitably growing city.\n\nProphett: One change I would make would be to increase funding for community health (health department).\n\nMann: More resources.\n\nPureval: The biggest thing in the budget that I would change is the process of how the budget is created. Right now, 95% of the budget gets baked in prior to the public having an opportunity to study it and respond. We need to actively seek out community engagement much earlier in the process. As mayor, I will be collaborative and transparent, reaching out to communities to get their feedback and an understanding of what’s important to them. The fact of the matter is, if you show me your budget, I will show you your values and priorities. My values and priorities have to come from the community, and that cannot happen on the one yard line. Community feedback needs to come at the very beginning of the process.\n\nThomas: I would revisit the area related to property tax abatement to target neighborhoods and projects that need tax breaks to move forward and to stop subsidizing million-dollar upgrades that shift more of the tax burden onto existing homeowners.\n\nQ: Do you agree with defunding the police? If so, how would you change police spending?\n\nNajoli: My philosophy is that we need to RESET the police. Twice a year we reset our clocks. It makes sense to periodically reset our thinking on many things. As mayor, I will ensure five things with the police department: Redefine the role of local police; Establish equality and due process; Stabilize community engagement polices; Enact transparency and accountability standards; Train on deescalation and sanctity of life. The RESET may streamline funding to enable policing systems reform. We will ensure that our city’s police department is operating on a futuristic model of excellence. Among other ideas, we will develop agile systems, establish input circles in communities, champion robust intervention, utilize data and so much more.\n\nBetrup: If we are proactive, Cincinnati can lead the country in police reform and be a shining city on a hill. We must revisit the Collaborative Agreement and aggressively push forward police and community relations. 2020 was the most deadly year on record as homicides and gun violence continued to mar our city. Just a few years ago, my daughter had to twice take cover during active shooter events in the neighborhood surrounding her elementary school. We need our neighborhoods to be safe and for our neighbors to feel safe.\n\nProphett: No.\n\nMann: No. We have crime. We have too many killings. These incidents will go up if we have fewer officers. We have high-quality officers and high-quality policing and, by most measures, we have better officers and better policing than in years past. The Collaborative Agreement and the consent decree have been powerful positive forces. We must look for ways, in the case of a 911 call, to match citizen needs with resources and capabilities of personnel sent to respond to the call. The police chief has requested funding for mental health teams in each district. His request should be funded.\n\nPureval: COVID-19 has shone a light on the longstanding racial inequities in our society. In our housing, in our economic systems and in our justice system; systemic racism is real. You only need to look at the names Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Timothy Thomas. The names change every year, but the color never does. Black Americans feel the brunt of a system that leads to unjust results, and in some instances, the loss of life because of systemic biases. I do not support defunding the police, but I do support reforming and improving the police. And the great news is that here in Cincinnati, because of the landmark Collaborative Agreement, we have a framework to push us forward. In order to reform and improve the police so that every\n\nsingle neighborhood is safe, we have to get back to the fundamentals of the Collaborative Agreement. Right now, the Citizen Complaint Authority is underfunded and understaffed. It can’t live up to its charge of being an independent and outside organization that investigates and holds our police department accountable. We need to fully fund that organization. We also need to do what we know works: making sure police officers are members of the communities they serve – engaging in community policing and being visible. Finally, we need to make sure we’re using our resources efficiently and intelligently by reforming our 911 process. Right now, 911 is only helpful if you are on fire or if your life is in danger. We have to take action on this by making sure police officers are only responding to issues they are trained for and where they can help – and when they’re not, we need to send unarmed and specifically-trained professionals. These are the ways we will continue to reform and improve our justice system. It’s not just important for our Black and brown communities; it’s important for all\n\nof us.\n\nThomas: I do not agree with literally defunding the police. As a police officer for 27 years, I know very well how best to use police officers’ training. Police officers are trained to maintain public safety, but they are asked to carry out many other duties that other trained professionals should handle. For example, children left alone, mental depression, neighbor disputes, traffic management, fender benders or animal removal. I would establish a committee to look at calls for service, hold interested party meetings, and report back with recommendations. The intent will be to free our police to focus on more serious crime.\n\nQ: If you ever hire a new city manager, will you do a professional search?\n\nNajoli: We must find the most prepared person for what will be a marvelous mayoral term. As mayor I will be looking for a high-level thinker who will help initiate the city’s first -ever Board of Residents Intelligently Leveraging Leadership to Improve, Advance, and Nurture Talent (BRILLIANT) plan. A highly professional search will enable us to marshal our city to its best days yet. It is my belief that such a local professional can be found within the city of Cincinnati, but I am not opposed to an countrywide search process.\n\nBegtrup: To get the city growing equitably, we must change the culture of City Hall from one of corruption to one of collaboration. Cincinnati deserves leadership at every level focused on serving the people. I have interviewed and hired hundreds of people, and I will have a city manager who will instill a culture of leadership and ownership at every level within the administration, aligned with our shared vision and mission of equitable growth and service.\n\nProphett: Yes.\n\nMann: Yes, when a vacancy occurs\n\nPureval: I am no stranger to professionalizing an organization. Before I took over the Clerk of Courts office, it was rife with patronage and nepotism. When you were applying for a job, it mattered who you supported in the last election, where you lived and who you were related to. We changed that. We drove a professional recruiting and hiring process that is now transparent and fair. Jobs are posted, candidates get a telephone screening interview and every interviewed candidate is asked the same questions. Based on your resume, your interview and the needs of our organization, we make a hiring decision. That same approach needs to be applied at City Hall in all of our hiring, including in the hiring of a professional city manager. I will direct a transparent and objective professional search to find the best person for the job, because Cincinnati deserves no less than that.\n\nThomas: Absolutely. It’s a good practice to bring in someone that has the proper skill set with the proper professional credentials. My role as mayor is to make sure he or she has the tools to get the job done. I would convene a search committee of very carefully selected members based on my vision for the city.\n\nQ: Should the city manager be professionally credentialed? The last three haven’t been.\n\nNajoli: I have a credential before my name that signifies my academic development. A professional credential is more than just a symbol of identity. A credential shows commitment to a process of excellence. The city manager should be credentialed and required to continue ongoing training. If Cincinnati is to become the character city of the United States, we must have high caliber leaders. I will support Key Performance Indicators and Knowledge Assessments of not just the city manager, but the entire administration of City Hall, plus city workers. We have seen a lack of ethics in the workplace at City Hall. A credentialed city manager is held to the high standards of an academic body. It is a great starting point.\n\nBegtrup: Professional credentialing is one consideration in hiring, but also important are character, experience and values. Our city manager must have an ethos of service before self, must embrace a vision for an equitably growing Cincinnati, and must empower her entire civil service with leadership and ownership at every level.\n\nProphett: Absolutely!\n\nMann: Obviously the city manager should be qualified. The credentialing process of the ICMA (International City/County Management Association) is significant but should not be deemed a non-negotiable item. The real question is the range of an applicant’s experience and the applicant’s intelligence, integrity, personality and courage.\n\nPureval: Our city has seen decades of success and national recognition for our city manager form of government. We should respect the unique balance we have, but we should also make our search for a city manager as professional as possible. I want the best person for the job, and our city manager search will reflect that.\n\nThomas: Absolutely. We want to bring in the best and the brightest based on qualification, professionally credentialed and experienced.\n\nQ: Police Chief Eliot Isaac is retiring this year. Do you think the current mayor and city manager should wait to choose a replacement and let the new administration do it?\n\nNajoli: The current mayor and city manager should wait and let the new team undertake the process of finding a new police chief. Succession systems are best implemented by the people who will be around to provide support and supervision. In my doctoral work, I have worked on wisdom and organizational citizenship behavior in the development of succession systems. I will bring this thinking to my work as the next mayor.\n\nBegtrup: It is in the best interest of the city and our democracy for the next police chief to be chosen by our next mayor and council elected by the voters this November.\n\nProphett: Yes. The new administration should choose Chief Isaac's replacement. This will allow for alignment between the city manager and police chief.\n\nMann: It depends on the timing of Chief Issac's retirement. We should not have an interim chief for many months just because a new mayor will arrive in January 2022.\n\nPureval: Yes, the current mayor and city manager should wait. The Chief of Police is one of the most important members of our city government, and it only makes sense that the new administration has a say in the future of the Cincinnati Police Department.\n\nThomas: I would highly recommend that the current mayor and city manager should only appoint an interim chief and should allow the incoming mayor and city manager to appoint a chief.\n\nQ: What would you do to bring back Downtown post-pandemic?\n\nNajoli: My vision is that Cincinnati will become the character city of the United States – a center of business and economic excellence; an international juggernaut of education and sporting events; a thriving metropolis of growing residents and homeownership; and a youthful place that cultivates equity and human potential. We will fully support small business and new start-ups created during the pandemic. We will invest in STEM to produce future workers and cultural activities that showcase our city. We will engage all city residents in pathways to a better life and boost housing outcomes for city dwellers. We will develop signature events for harnessing belongingness and provide opportunities for people to exploit their gifts. Our points of attack will aim at four things: entrepreneurial ingenuity, enhanced social life, increased foot traffic and expanding population. These four points will hinge on increased civic prosperity. It will be an \"all-hands-on-deck\" approach to a post-pandemic world. Every two months, I will be in every neighborhood to inspire a new breed of civic engagement. Post-pandemic, I want Cincinnati to be at the top of a list of ethical cities.\n\nBegtrup: As the small business owner in the race, I have seen firsthand the devastation caused by the pandemic. Small businesses, and particularly Black and brown small businesses, are reeling. With my experience in policy, business and economic development, I am uniquely capable of bringing together diverse stakeholders to revitalize downtown – beginning with the creation of a small business fund to help businesses start, expand or reopen. With many people likely to continue working remotely, we must be proactive with neighborhoods, nonprofits, and downtown businesses to reimagine downtown, as Cincinnati has done multiple times in its storied history. We must look at new uses for existing space and work with Hamilton County on transportation projects to connect every neighborhood to downtown so that our city is accessible.\n\nProphett: I want to create an event that celebrates getting through the pandemic, honoring those who served and those we lost. Fountain Square would be a great place to hold the celebration.\n\nMann: We must use some of the stimulus money to support recovery of all downtown activity. The goal is not to return to normal, but to leap to a future many steps beyond where we have been. I want to see a downtown so far beyond a return to normal that though we feel something sort of familiar, the total experience is much better than anything we remember. We must develop and execute a vigorous, catalytic plan to energize all aspects of downtown life including downtown workers, retail, commercial, food, entertainment, the arts, sports and residential space. I favor creation of an office reporting to the city manager charged with envisioning our post-pandemic world and a path to get there.\n\nPureval: It has been a really tough year, and we’ve all struggled. It’s been a particularly devastating year for our live events industry, our small businesses and our restaurants. When we respond and recover, we have to be targeted, specifically supporting those industries and supporting all of our neighborhoods including the Central Business District. The downtown area is the engine that drives the economics of our entire region, so when we bounce back, we have to prioritize getting people back downtown. I fully support the incredible work the city is already doing to address this: expanding outdoor\n\ndining, expanding outdoor entertainment districts and making the downtown area more\n\nwalkable. I will continue this important effort, but we have to do more. We need to see these same efforts in our neighborhood business districts. Small businesses in the 51 other neighborhoods need the same creative approaches. Additionally, third-party delivery apps are crushing our local businesses. That local money should stay local: we should bring back the fee cap of 15%, at least in the short term, because it keeps\n\nmoney in our local businesses and encourages people to return to our restaurants in-person. This is critical to lifting up our downtown and the residents who depend on it.\n\nFinally, as mayor, I will use the bully pulpit to run a marketing campaign that lets the entire region know that Cincinnati is open for business. We need to encourage people to come back to the city and patronize our small businesses. That comprehensive approach is essential to lifting us out of COVID.\n\nThomas: I would start by doing a major impact study of the post-pandemic damage to our business sector, with a major emphasis on restaurants, other small businesses and vacant office space. I would want to know what businesses need immediate help to remain open, what businesses we lost, and what will it take to get them back. I would do a major campaign to fill vacant office and retail space by working with property owners and investors. I would give a major boost to our Convention and Visitors Bureau to do a major campaign to bring conventions and tourism to the city. Downtown Cincinnati is the core for the stability of the region. A strong core feeds a strong region, and a weak core results in a weak region. Downtown is the economic engine for the entire region.\n\nQ: What’s your one big idea for Cincinnati?\n\nNajoli: I want us to end the language of poverty in Cincinnati. We embrace the idea of abundance. What I have learned is that what one focuses on, expands. We will vastly change outcomes for children and families when we start driving them toward abundance. As mayor, I will implement a Cincinnati Operation for Maximum Performance, Assessment, and Support Services (COMPASS) whose aim will be to guide individuals to find their Perfect North and live abundantly. Through COMPASS, we will catapult Cincinnatians to their absolute abundant quality of life. My enduring legacy as mayor will be the end of poverty in Cincinnati and the germination of abundance as a mark of our beloved Queen City of the Midwest.\n\nBegtrup: A Cincinnati new economy program. Cincinnati is home to some of the greatest entrepreneurship stories in history (see P&G and Kroger). Let’s spur the next generation of those successes by the city leading a collaboration with business, nonprofits, and philanthropies to build a regional entrepreneurial development program. The New Economy Initiative in Detroit is a good template for increasing Black small business ownership, and Cincinnati has wonderful existing assets in Mortar and the African American Chamber of Commerce. Through collaboration, we could lead the nation in recovery from the pandemic while creating jobs and wealth in our underserved communities.\n\nProphett: Transform public safety. The majority of incidents that police and fire respond to are health related. We need to integrate health care into public safety, which will require greater collaboration between the city’s community health system and hospitals.\n\nMann: I want us once again to be be known as the country’s best governed city with an exceptional commitment to racial justice and equity.\n\nPureval: My one big idea for Cincinnati is Black ownership. Black ownership of homes, Black ownership of neighborhoods and Black ownership of businesses. In order for us to win the next decade, we must grow equitably, and we must be intentional about growth in Black and brown communities. We do this by continuing to grow the capacity of the Minority Business Accelerator, the African American Chamber and the Urban League. These organizations are trusted partners who provide capital to launch African American and women-owned small businesses and continue to provide capital as those businesses grow. We also need to reform the way the city provides contracts to minority and women-owned businesses. And we need to incentivize our Fortune 500 companies to work with our local businesses. Finally, we need a real commitment to affordable housing. If we can accomplish true Black ownership in homes, neighborhoods and businesses, our city will be positioned to win the next decade for everyone.\n\nThomas: My one big idea for the city is to expand our convention center and to make Cincinnati a world-class city for tourism and conventions.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/06"}]}

Kennedy Memorial Stadium in the district ‒ unless the Commanders adopt its former name, the Redskins. The team has played in Landover, Maryland, since 1997.\n\nLike any other private company, however, the Commanders organization gets to choose its name. Washington retired the name Redskins in July 2020 amid nationwide protests over race, initially becoming the Washington Football Team for two seasons, and then rebranding as the Washington Commanders in 2022.\n\nTrump can't unilaterally scrap the team's stadium deal for Washington because Congress passed a law in December that transferred ownership of the RFK stadium site from the National Park Service to the District of Columbia. The $3.7 billion stadium deal, which includes $1.1 billion in local taxpayer funds, is in the hands of the D.C. Council, which is nearing a vote on the project.\n\n\"The president can say what he wants, but the law is clear. D.C. has full power over that site,\" said Ankit Jain, who serves as one of the district's two elected shadow U.S. senators. \"There are certain conditions that D.C. has to meet ‒ and none of them are, 'what is the name of the team.'\"\n\nWays Trump could try to impede stadium deal\n\nTrump called for the Commanders to revert to its original name in a July 20 social media post that also pushed for the Cleveland Guardians, formerly the Indians, to bring back its old name. \"There is a big clamoring for this,\" Trump wrote, adding in a subsequent post that he \"may put a restriction on them\" if the Commanders keep their name and \"won’t make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington.\"\n\nTrump has no role in approving the stadium project. But because of Washington's unique status as an enclave of the federal government, the president could potentially find ways to try to impede the deal.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, Congress has authority over the district. Although the 1973 District of Columbia Home Rule Act gave the city local governance with an elected mayor and city council, Congress still has a 30-day review of all legislation passed by the D.C. Council and retains authority over the district's budget.\n\nThat arrangement could give Trump an opportunity to rally Republicans in Congress to block the stadium legislative package during the review period after the deal passes the council.\n\nIn addition, a memorandum of understanding between the district and Trump's Interior Department would be required to address environmental hazards with the RFK site. And the 12-member National Capital Planning Commission ‒ which includes three Trump appointments and three Republican members of Congress ‒ must sign off on final stadium designs. Both hurdles could present Trump moments for intervention.\n\nTrump has also shown a willingness in other political battles to threaten federal funding from states, cities, colleges and universities to get his way. Would he be willing to do the same to the district over the Commanders' name issue?\n\n\"I don't think this is a serious threat,\" Jain said of Trump's demand that the Commanders adopt its old name. Instead, Jain suggested Trump raised the issue as \"a distraction\" from the backlash the president has faced for his handling of the government's files involving wealthy financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\"I don't think it's something that he's going to really follow up on, and there's very limited ability for him to do anything there,\" Jain said.\n\nTrue loyalist in Congress has helped pave way to stadium\n\nThe White House insists Trump isn't kidding around.\n\n“The president was serious,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters July 21, pointing to Trump's reputation as a dealmaker. “As part of the ‘art of the deal,’ part of his negotiating skills, as you know, sports is one of the many passions of this president and he wants to see this team’s name changed.\"\n\nWhen asked to explain Trump's authority to block the Commanders' stadium deal, a White House official directed USA TODAY to the comments from Leavitt, who did not address how Trump could execute his threat.\n\nConvincing Republicans in Congress to block the stadium deal if the council approves the legislation could be a tough sale, even for Trump.\n\nRep. James Comer, R-Kentucky, a Trump ally and chairman of the House Oversight Committee, worked to get the land transfer of the RFK site through Congress and is a vocal supporter of the project. In a July 17 letter to the D.C. Council's chairman, Comer urged the council to approve the stadium deal no later than August and expressed disappointment in delays that have held up a vote.\n\n\"The federal government transferred administrative control of this valuable property with the clear expectation that the D.C. Council would act decisively to maximize its potential,\" Comer wrote.\n\nCommanders, DC mayor stay quiet on Trump\n\nIn 2023, longtime Washington owner Daniel Snyder sold the team to a new ownership group led by billionaire investor Josh Harris, who has elected to keep Commanders as the name and has called the debate settled. The team just completed its most successful season in decades, capped by an appearance in the NFC championship game.\n\nThe Commanders and Harris have not issued a formal statement on Trump's remarks. Commanders General Manager Adam Peters, addressing reporters on the first day of training camp for veteran players on July 22, said the team isn't focused on the stadium situation.\n\n\"We really just try to focus on what's going on in here and getting ready for the season,\" Peters said.\n\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who helped orchestrate the stadium deal, deflected when a reporter asked her July 21 whether she believes Trump has the power to block the Commanders' stadium deal.\n\n\"I think the thing that we should focus on in D.C. is doing our part,\" Bowser said, adding that the council still needs to give the green light. \"We need to complete our part.\"\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has often talked about taking over the governance of the district, a city he has long derided for crime and homelessness. Nevertheless, Trump hosted Bowser and the Commanders' Harris at the White House in May to announce Washington's National Mall would host the 2027 NFL Draft.\n\nTrump never mentioned the Commander's name during the announcement\n\nMore than a decade ago, Trump had a very different take in 2013 when then-President Barack Obama said the Redskins should consider changing the team name to something less offensive.\n\n\"President should not be telling the Washington Redskins to change their name-our country has far bigger problems!\" Trump wrote on Twitter at the time. \"FOCUS on them, not nonsense.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/21/trump-serious-washington-commanders-redskins-stadium/85314999007/", "title": "Trump 'serious' about Washington Commanders threat, White House ...", "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump isn't kidding around with his threat to the NFL's Washington Commanders, the White House says.\n\n“The president was serious,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters July 21 when asked about Trump’s new warning to block a proposed stadium deal that would return the Commanders to Washington if the team doesn’t adopt its former name, Redskins.\n\nWashington retired the name Redskins in July 2020 amid nationwide protests over race, initially becoming the Washington Football Team for two seasons, and then rebranding as the Washington Commanders in 2022.\n\nLeavitt did not address how Trump has the power to restrict the team’s planned relocation back to the site of Robert F.

In the same post, Trump called on another professional sports team that was previously named for native Americans ‒ the Cleveland Guardians, formerly the Indians ‒ to go back to its old name.\n\n\"The Washington 'Whatever’s' should IMMEDIATELY change their name back to the Washington Redskins Football Team. There is a big clamoring for this,\" Trump wrote. \"Times are different now than they were three or four years ago. We are a Country of passion and common sense. OWNERS, GET IT DONE!!!\"\n\nTrump had previously voiced support for the team's former name, but it marked the first time he has used his position to call for a name change. He followed it up with a subsequent post suggesting he might hold up the team's stadium plans if it doesn't ditch Commanders and go back to its former name.\n\n\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don’t change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,'\" Trump wrote. \"I won’t make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington. The Team would be much more valuable, and the Deal would be more exciting for everyone.\"\n\nDC mayor focuses on council, not Trump\n\nUnder the Constitution, Congress has authority over the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act, signed by President Richard Nixon in 1973, gave the city local governance including an elected mayor and city council. However, Congress can still review all legislation passed by the D.C.

The franchise hopes to build on the site of RFK Memorial Stadium where the team played from 1961 to 1996 and is two miles east of the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nWashington may be facing a challenge as well from the highest-ranking elected official in the country.\n\nPresident Trump posted on Truth Social that he may restrict the team from building on the old RFK Stadium site if it doesn't change its name.\n\n\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington (name),' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,\" Trump posted.\n\nHe continued: \"The Team would be much more valuable, and the Deal would be more exciting for everyone.\" He went on to state that the Cleveland Guardians should do the same and change the franchise name back to its former name.\n\nWashington also faces some question marks with getting that deal with Washington D.C.

The franchise kept its now-former name when it relocated from Boston to Washington D.C. in 1937 and it remained for decades.\n\nWASHINGTON UNIFORMS: Commanders reveal alternate uniforms that nod to their Super Bowl glory\n\nIn July 2020, the franchise dropped the name and logo.\n\n\"We are announcing we will be retiring the (former) name and logo upon completion of this review,\" the team said in a statement at the time and that team officials were \"working closely to develop a new name and design approach that will enhance the standing of our proud, tradition rich franchise and inspire our sponsors, fans and community for the next 100 years.\"\n\nThe franchise went by the name Washington Football Team for the 2020 and 2021 NFL seasons before rebranding as the Washington Commanders ahead of the 2022 season.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump's voiced his dislike for the Commanders name. When asked about the stadium plans earlier in July, Trump said he wouldn't have changed the name in the first place.\n\n\"It just doesn't have the same, it doesn't have the same ring to me,\" he said. “But, you know, winning can make everything sound good. So if they win, all of a sudden the Commanders sounds good, but I wouldn’t have changed the name.”\n\nA new stadium is one of the top priorities of the Commanders' new ownership group led by Josh Harris. That group finished a deal to buy the team in May 2023 and are hoping to finish construction by the 2030 NFL season.\n\nIn the meantime, the team would continue to play its home games at Northwest Stadium – formerly known as FedEx Field – in Landover, Maryland.\n\nThe team has not released a statement in response to Trump's comments at time of publishing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/commanders/2025/07/21/trump-commanders-rfk-stadium-dc-reacts/85310141007/", "title": "Commanders fans have a pointed response for Trump on name ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — D.C.-area residents have a message for President Donald Trump who is threatening to derail the Commanders' pending football stadium deal unless the team restores its old name: Stay out of the city's business and do your job.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social on July 20 that he may block a deal for the team to build a new stadium on the old RFK Stadium site if the team doesn't switch back to its former name, considered offensive to Native Americans.\n\n\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,\" Trump posted.\n\nSteve Mahoney, 62, said Trump has “bigger fish to fry” than pressuring the Commanders to change the team name. “Focus on lowering prices, everything else that he said he was going to do that he's not doing,” he said.\n\nMahoney, who retired from a career in pharmaceuticals, has held onto his love for his hometown team, the Chicago Bears. Now a Washington resident, he wants Trump to let both the capital city and its football team handle their own affairs, Mahoney said.\n\n“The fans have adopted the new name,\" Mahoney said, \"and there’s no reason to change it back.”\n\nJessica Brown, 48, said she only pays “just enough attention” to the president to “know how he can affect my life.”\n\nThe stadium issue is apparently one of those cases. When it came to Trump’s threats to block the RFK Stadium deal, Brown didn’t hold back. “He should just keep his nose in his own lane,” she said.\n\nBrown, a nurse from Alexandria, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, said she supported the Commanders and other teams changing their names to avoid titles broadly seen as racist.\n\n“You should just choose other names. There are so many others,” she said. Her advice for local leaders involved in the stadium deal – “ignore him.”\n\nTwo new names, and then one stunning season\n\nIn 2013, then-team owner Dan Snyder bluntly told USA TODAY: “We'll never change the name. It's that simple. NEVER — you can use caps.”\n\nBut once major corporate sponsors threatened to pull funding amid the George Floyd protests in 2020, Snyder and the league had little choice. Major League Baseball's Cleveland Guardians also underwent a name change around the same time and have been the subject of Trump's recent nickname crusades.\n\nThe team rid itself of the former nickname in 2020 and went by “Washington Football Team” for two seasons before the “Commanders” rebrand in 2022.\n\nWhen the Commanders were sold in 2023, the potential for another name change became possible, although it was not a priority for the new regime led by managing partner Josh Harris. In a news conference at the conclusion of a stunning season − which saw the often cellar-dweller team come within one game of the Super Bowl − Harris essentially quashed any idea of a name change.\n\nThe organization and players have embraced the “Commanders” name − as have exuberant fans thrilled with the team's turnaround. But any name change would never have resulted in a reversion to the pre-2020 name.\n\nLast year, both parties of Congress worked together to pass a bill that gave the local D.C. government a 99-year lease of the land on which the RFK Stadium site and the surrounding acreage sit on the banks of the Anacostia River near the eastern edge of the city. The Commanders played at RFK Stadium from 1961-1996 and have played at NorthWest Stadium in Landover, Maryland – considered one of the NFL's worst stadiums – since.\n\nThat paved the way for the Commanders and D.C. to hammer out a $3.7 billion stadium deal, which was announced in April. The agreement would cost the District a projected $1.1 billion, while the Commanders are contributing $2.7 billion.\n\nTrump's threat called a move 'to get attention'\n\nGriffin Lafayette, a Raleigh, North Carolina native visiting Washington, called Trump’s threat to block the RFK stadium deal if the Washington Commanders don’t revert their name back to the original nickname “really stupid.”\n\n“It’s just on his laundry list of things to complain about to get attention,” said Lafayette, a 25-year-old football fan.\n\nLafayette said he was “all for” ditching the team’s original name.\n\nGerald Collins, 66, said he doesn’t care about the team name, but he wants Trump to “stay out” of the RFK stadium deal.\n\n“He isn’t a Washingtonian,” said Collins, a lifelong DC resident who works in construction. “What he’s doing is very wrong. He just wants to control things.\"\n\nCollins said he will always support the team no matter its name. He hopes the deal moves forward because it will bring the team back to the area where he watched them play when he was growing up.\n\nMayor confident stadium deal will get done\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a champion of the stadium deal who earlier this year negotiated with the NHL’s Washington Capitals and NBA’s Washington Wizards to remain in the District, was asked about Trump’s power to block the agreement.\n\n“I think the thing that we should focus on in D.C. is doing our part,\" Bowser said. \"I have worked for the better part of 10 years to get our part completed, including getting control of the land, coming to an agreement with the team and advancing a fantastic agreement to the Council. So we need to do our part. Let’s focus on doing our part.”\n\nIt is now up to the D.C. City Council to approve the deal. D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, a skeptic of the proposal, has yet to set a specific date for a vote on it. Public hearings on the matter scheduled for July 29 and 30.\n\n“No, it wouldn’t,” Bowser responded when asked whether the name being changed – even to the former name – would affect her support of the current stadium plan.\n\nThe topic has been of growing interest to Trump. On July 6, Trump told reporters that he wouldn’t have changed the name, although he elaborated that “winning” could make the name for palatable to him personally.\n\nSteven Kiekel, 36, said Trump’s threats to block the stadium came as little surprise – even though Trump announced May 5 in the Oval Office with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, Harris and Bowser standing beside him that the 2027 NFL Draft is being held in D.C.\n\n“Sounds like typical Trump being Trump,” he said. “If they wait long enough, he’ll get distracted, and it’ll go through.”\n\nKiekel, an engineer and Washington native, isn’t an avid sports follower, apart from some soccer. But he lives near the proposed stadium in the shadows of the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“It’s tricky” because of Washington’s unique relationship with the federal government, Kiekel said. Questions over Trump and the federal government's actual oversight of the land, especially under the new law, have emerged.\n\nDon't mess with success and leave the name, fan says\n\nJames Anderson, 47, said he hopes Trump’s threats don’t force the Commanders to revert to their former name, mainly because he wants the team’s good fortune to continue.\n\n“They’ve been playing much better so I don’t want them to change anything again,” he said. Last season, the Commanders advanced to the franchise's first NFC championship in 33 years.\n\nMaureen Brown, 57, said it would be a “huge step back” if the Commanders returned to their former name.\n\n“I don’t want to see them go back,” she said. “The Commanders is a fine name. ‘The Red Wolves’ would be good, too.”\n\nBrown, who has lived in Washington for 18 years, said she has never seen a game because their current stadium is inaccessible without a car. The team moving to Washington − especially to her neighborhood − would give her plenty of chances to see her favorite player, quarterback Jayden Daniels, in the flesh. Daniels was the 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year after a record-setting season in which the Commanders went 12-5 under first-year coach Dan Quinn.\n\nAnderson, who works as security guard for federal buildings, moved to Washington from Texas 15 years ago and promptly dropped the Dallas Cowboys to support his new home team.\n\nHe said if the Commanders leave Maryland for a new stadium in Washington, he would be able to go to their home games.\n\n“I was a Redskins fan much longer than I’ve been a Commanders fan,” he said. “But they have a good thing going now.”\n\nTrump’s threats, he added, are “only about himself” – not the team or its fans.\n\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

President Trump ...", "text": "The Washington Commanders thought they could finally put their name controversy behind them, but the nation's capital has a way of relitigating the past.\n\nThis offseason, Washington inked a deal to return to their old home on the RFK Stadium site and also reimagined their old Super Bowl era uniforms in what some believe could be a precursor to a jersey rebrand.\n\nPlans for the stadium have stalled while Mayor Muriel Bowser battles with the Washington D.C. council to get it approved. The mayor has expressed concern about the deal, while the Commanders may run into a speedbump for future plans.\n\nNow the Commanders face another potential obstacle en route to a stadium deal, this time against the Commander in Chief. On July 20, President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he could block a deal if the team doesn't bring back their old name.\n\n\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nHere's a look at how we got here, including the origin of the Commanders' name change, whether they can change it back and what the President has said about the issue.\n\nWhy did the Commanders change their name?\n\nWashington's NFL franchise introduced the \"Commanders\" moniker in advance of the 2022 season after two years as the Washington Football Team.\n\nThe move was necessitated by the overwhelming pressure that began to mount against the much more controversial namesake.\n\nOriginally born into the NFL in 1932 as the Boston Braves, the franchise changed its name after one season to the version considered offensive to Native Americans in 1933. It was a name that remained through the team's relocation to Washington in 1937 and withstood the test of time until the it couldn't anymore ahead of the 2020 season.\n\nFollowing George Floyd's death in Minnesota, protests broke out across the country in opposition to police brutality and racism. That also put the spotlight on Washington's team, which began feeling the heat from sponsors like FedEx, Nike and PepsiCo.\n\nAdweek reported in 2020 that 87 investment firms worth a collective $620 billion at the time sent a letter to some of the team's biggest sponsors – FedEx, Nike and PepsiCo – asking them to sever ties with the team if they refused the name change.\n\nPrevious owner Dan Snyder was adamant for years that the name would never be changed.\n\n\"We will never change the name of the team,\" Snyder told USA TODAY Sports in 2013. \"As a lifelong (name) fan, and I think that the (name) fans understand the great tradition and what it's all about and what it means, so we feel pretty fortunate to be just working on next season.\"\n\nDespite years of lawsuits and pressure from Native American groups, Snyder vowed he would never cave on the issue.\n\n\"We'll never change the name,\" Snyder said at the time. \"It's that simple. NEVER – you can use caps.\"\n\nHowever, the sponsors threats were more than enough for Snyder to reconsider his position and the old name was removed ahead of the 2020 season, sparking a search for a new one.\n\n\"We are announcing we will be retiring the (former) name and logo upon completion of this review,\" the team said in a statement and that team officials were \"working closely to develop a new name and design approach that will enhance the standing of our proud, tradition rich franchise and inspire our sponsors, fans and community for the next 100 years.\"\n\nWhat Trump has said about Commanders name change\n\nTrump has been a fixture throughout the Commanders recent rebrands and controversy. The pivot away from the controversial name came during the first Trump administration and now the stadium deal has taken centerstage during the second.\n\nThe president has always been opposed to switch, but struck a different chord earlier this month when asked about the team's move back to the RFK site.\n\n“It doesn’t have the same ring to me,” he told reporters on July 7. “But, you know, winning can make everything sound good. So, if they win, all of a sudden, the Commanders sounds good, but I wouldn’t have changed it.”\n\nWhile Trump wasn't in favor of the move, it was a decidedly different tone than the one he took at the time in 2020.\n\n\"They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins & Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct,\" Trump tweeted in response to the initial change.\n\nHe renewed that rhetoric on July 20, when he threatened to block the team's new stadium deal in the district, adding they should immediately bring back the old name.\n\n\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,\" Trump later posted.\n\n\"The Team would be much more valuable, and the Deal would be more exciting for everyone,\" he continued, adding that the Cleveland Guardians should also follow suit.\n\nIt's unclear what power the president has in this case, considering Congress turned over control of the RFK Stadium land to the city with the passage of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act in January.\n\nWill the Commanders change their name?\n\nIt's unlikely a move back to the old controversial nickname will happen, given recent stance from team brass.\n\nIf there was any doubt, team owner Josh Harris seemingly put a return to the old name to bed at a press conference in February.\n\n\"Now, in this building, the name Commanders means something,\" Harris said. \"It's about players who love football, are great at football, hit hard, mentally tough, great teammates. It's really meaningful that that name is growing in meaning.\"\n\nWhile the owner acknowledged that the team will honor its past, he pointed out that the name is here to stay.\n\n\"I think it's now being embraced by our team, by our culture, by our coaching staff. And so we're going with that,\" Harris said.\n\nNot only have the Commanders shown no interest in reverting to their name, but NFL rules dictate that it might not be a possibility at this time either.\n\nAs any name change would also be likely be accompanied with new jerseys, the NFL's uniform rules come into focus. As detailed in 2002 Resolution G-3 under Article 19 of the NFL's constitution, a team cannot change its jerseys more than once every five years.\n\nGiven that the team just unveiled new jerseys ahead of the 2022 season, they cannot make a switch again until 2027.\n\nThere is a clause for \"extenuating circumstances\" built in that would allow for a faster rebrand. It is determined by the commissioner, but relocation and ownership change are considered extenuating.\n\nAny name change would likely need the approval of the league, as was the case in 2020 when Washington first changed its team nickname to the Commanders.\n\nWhat Trump has said about the Cleveland Guardians\n\nThe Commanders aren't the only team that faced controversy surrounding their team name. MLB's Cleveland Guardians also drew the ire of Trump, who suggested they should also bring back their old name.\n\nCleveland didn't make the move until ahead of the 2022 MLB season, three years after they dropped the \"Chief Wahoo\" mascot and logo.\n\nTrump said that it was cancel culture in a 2020 tweet, indicating he was no fan of that decision.\n\nThe Guardians arrived at the conclusion to change their name after team owner Paul Dolan changed his stance on the matter, citing a changing world in the aftermath of the social unrest in 2020.\n\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

Congress earlier this month gave the Trump administration more than $170 billion over the next four years to dramatically scale up enforcement, detention and deportation. The federal spending plan, among other things, provides funding for 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to help carry out Trump's plan to deport 1 million people annually.

In a process called evapotranspiration, plants release water vapor into the atmosphere. The released water combines with other water molecules and humidifies the air. In the Plains and Midwest regions, where there are millions of acres of corn and soybean crops, it makes a difference, pumping billions of gallons of water into the atmosphere in some states. Extra water can add 5 to 10 degrees to the dew point, a measure of the humidity in the air, on a hot summer day. The \"corn sweat\" will exacerbate a heat dome set to push extreme temperatures across much of the U.S. this week.\n\nToday's talkers\n\nColbert v.

It recently released a video pushing back against the use of Native American mascots.\n\nIn a June 17 announcement, the Department of Education called the ban “an unlawful attempt to ban mascots and logos that celebrate Native American history.’’\n\nDe León said that challenge is part of the larger narrative by the Trump administration to muddy the waters and undermine civil rights protections.

City Council approval, with a $3.7 billion stadium project on the hallowed grounds of RFK Stadium.\n\nOn Monday came official word that the NFL draft, hosted by the Commanders, is coming in 2027 to the National Mall. Lights. Cameras. Monuments. And Mel Kiper, Jr.\n\nLet the Congressional Record show: No way this gets done with Dan Snyder.\n\nYet here’s what was always possible, once the NFL was able to separate itself from the widely reviled Snyder in 2023 for the record sale tag of $6.05 billion: The NFL again has a signature franchise in the nation’s capital. Long-suffering fans wearing “Hog” noses and memories of the “Fun Bunch” are back on the bandwagon, ushering in a new generation. Politicos on Capitol Hill, even in these perilous times, might have reason again to come across the aisle for the sake of football?\n\nSnyder swung and missed in seeking stadium deals in D.C., Maryland and Virginia. It has taken less than two years for Harris & Co. to strike the stadium deal and deliver the draft the NFL has long envisioned for D.C. Apparently, entities that couldn’t or wouldn’t do business with the franchise when it was owned by Snyder, are now more willing and able.\n\n“They’ve brought honor back to the franchise,” sports consultant Marc Ganis told USA TODAY Sports, as news of the draft announcement spread. “That’s what changed the entire political landscape. It’s the perception of the franchise. It was always vitally important to the community, but no one wanted to go near it, politically, especially, for many years.”\n\nAnd shoot, the Commanders product on the field has blown up, too, with rookie-of-the-year Jayden Daniels leading the way to the NFC title game in January.\n\nWhat significant markers for the comeback of one of the league’s oldest franchises.\n\nTake it from President Donald Trump. The red-hot Commanders are ...\n\nWait a minute. Take it from who?\n\nThat it was Trump who made the announcement about the draft at the White House, with Harris, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and Washington mayor Muriel Bowser in the wings, was quite the play on political football. The draft, Trump trumpeted, is “a big thing.”\n\nAnd, like I’d suspect for many D.C. residents (hey, now that Canada isn’t in the mix, anyone for being the 51st state?), Trump is bullish on the idea of the 65,000-seat domed stadium.\n\n“I don’t think there’s a better site than anywhere in the world than that site,” Trump declared. (Please, given the pending process, just don’t try to make it an executive order).\n\nBe not deceived by the optics. While it is undoubtedly beneficial to have the president supporting the NFL’s biggest offseason tentpole event, the D.C. draft has been in the league’s vision for years. He does not get credit for this. Trump hopped on a train that was already moving toward the end zone without his involvement.\n\nThen again, it’s hardly surprising that Trump, who in February became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl, seized on a prime opportunity. A week earlier, Trump, after golfing with Saquon Barkley, hosted the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles for a ceremony – even though Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts and more than a dozen players didn’t show up – and now he’s on the clock for the draft.\n\nThis, after spending time in recent days with Nick Saban as speculation persists that he will take aim at the NIL impact on college sports.\n\nYet big announcements like we saw on Monday, or a week ago Monday (when Trump lobbied to keep the “tush push” while feting the champs) also provide some cover of distraction for matters that I’d suspect matter more to many Americans.\n\nYou know. The economy, tariffs and the threat of a recession. Democracy. Respect for the Constitution and judicial system. Political targeting. Due process for deportations. And so on.\n\nWhen the Q&A part of the NFL event got underway, football took a back seat to questions about illegal immigration, Alcatraz, a potential trade deal with China…and so on.\n\nWatching from home, I flashed back to the Trump from his first administration, when he viciously attacked the NFL – and particularly its players – as the national anthem protests inspired by Colin Kaepernick over the killings of unarmed minorities by police gained momentum as part of a larger cultural movement.\n\nWhat’s the reaction – from Trump and the NFL – if there are more protests ahead?\n\nAlready, Trump has made it clear what he thinks of one of the NFL’s core social principles – diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) – while attacking it on a broad, systematic scale. The NFL, to its credit, has held firm with its DEI commitment, against the grain of so many companies rolling back what they once said they stood for.\n\nThe NFL still has the Rooney Rule, an Accelerator Program and will collaborate with the Black College Football Hall of Fame next month for the Ozzie Newsome General Manager Forum and a Quarterback Coaching Summit.\n\nThen again, the politics flowed both ways as Goodell – who often defends the NFL’s DEI efforts with vigor - showered Trump with gratitude for his support on the stadium deal.\n\n“Great to come back home,” said Goodell, who, like Harris, grew up in the District. His late father, Charles, represented New York as a U.S. Senator and Congressman, and left a legacy for his moral standing as a prominent anti-Vietnam War advocate.\n\nYet Goodell was clearly on a political business mission at the White House. It seemed a bit odd, at first, that he thanked Trump for the North American trade agreement struck during the President’s first term. Then when Trump replied that the money earned by the NFL was well-deserved – the pact allowed local TV ads to be shown in Canada during the Super Bowl, increasing the value of the league’s Canadian broadcasting rights – the politics were crystal clear.\n\nHarris knows. A pivotal factor for progressing on the stadium deal came in December, when Congress – despite apparent resistance from Maryland lawmakers, with the team currently playing in their state – transferred jurisdiction of the RFK Stadium site from the federal government to the District of Columbia.\n\nGanis doubts this happens without the ownership change. Snyder was that toxic.\n\n“Nobody ever touches it,” Ganis said. “He doesn’t get the legislation for the conveyance of the property; the deal with the city doesn’t happen. Roger, as hard as he’s worked on this for years, and as much influence as he had, could not get anything through.”\n\nIt’s a new day now, like a dream for D.C.’s football faithful. It’s no wonder that Harris took a moment at the White House to reflect on that theme.\n\n“I grew up here,” he said. “D.C. used to stop on Sundays. Everyone would be inside, watching football; (or)…glued at the stadium. So, we want to bring that back.”\n\nThat vision for the Commanders’ chief is fueled these days by so much momentum.\n\nFollow Jarrett Bell on social media: @JarrettBell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/22/ice-agents-cities-democrats-the-excerpt/85322813007/", "title": "'Flood' of ICE agents coming to cities run by Democrats | The Excerpt", "text": "", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/22"}]}

For the latest news on the LA protests, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Tuesday, June 10.\n\nLOS ANGELES − A tense standoff between California and the federal government escalated Monday, with federal officials preparing to send in 700 Marines to assist the National Guard and state officials saying they will sue the Trump administration's decision to \"trample over\" Gov. Gavin Newsom's authority.\n\nNewsom shot back at Trump over the move to send in Marines: \"U.S. Marines have served honorably across multiple wars in defense of democracy. They are heroes. They shouldn't be deployed on American soil facing their own countrymen to fulfill the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial President.\"\n\nThe addition of active-duty troops marks a significant escalation. It comes as California officials say they will sue the Trump administration, challenging the decision to federalize the National Guard and send its members onto city streets amid increasingly hostile protests over Trump's immigration policies, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday.\n\nIn addition to the Marines, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell announced on Monday that 2,000 National Guardsmen would be deployed to Los Angeles. The mobilization of additional troops comes after Trump authorized 2,000 guardsmen to be deployed to the city.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the Marines are being sent \"due to increased threats to federal law enforcement officers and federal buildings, approximately 700 active-duty... are being deployed to Los Angeles to restore order.\"\n\n\"We have an obligation to defend federal law enforcement officers - even if Gavin Newsom will not,\" Hegseth said.\n\nTrump said the troop deployment in Los Angeles is expected to last 60 days, according to California’s adjutant general.\n\nCalifornia governor says 'Trump wants chaos'\n\nAmid moves from the Trump administration to deploy as many as 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is firing back with all tools in his arsenal, including 800 additional officers, a lawsuit and invectives warning Trump is acting like a “dictator.”\n\n“Los Angeles: don’t take Trump’s bait. Trump wants chaos and he’s instigated violence,” Newsom said in a post on X. “Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don’t give him the excuse he’s looking for.”\n\nNewsom’s move to rally support comes after Trump ordered National Guardsmen to Los Angeles without the governor’s consent and after the president even suggested Newsom should be arrested.\n\n“This isn’t about public safety. It’s about stroking a dangerous President’s ego,” Newsom said in another post. “This is Reckless. Pointless. And Disrespectful to our troops.\"\n\nThe California governor has called out Trump’s moves to intervene in the city while also drawing a firm line with protestors: “Foolish agitators who take advantage of Trump’s chaos will be held accountable.”\n\nTrump and Newsom have often clashed, but the showdown over Los Angeles marks a new low in their heated relationship. In a lawsuit, Newsom says the Trump administration is violating California’s sovereignty.\n\n“One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,” the lawsuit says. Trump “used a protest that local authorities had under control to make another unprecedented power grab, this time at the cost of the sovereignty of the State of California.”\n\nRead more about their feud here.\n\nMarines heading to Los Angeles\n\nA photojournalist for the Desert Sun, part of the USA TODAY Network, spotted a convoy of Marines heading for Los Angeles Monday evening.\n\nFive buses and six to 10 armed vehicles passed Park Boulevard near Joshua Tree while heading west on Highway 62 — the main route from Twentynine Palms to Los Angeles — shortly after 7 p.m. At the nearby crosswalk, about 20 protestors were gathered demonstrating against the recent immigrations raids.\n\nThe movement of troops to the city comes just hours after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced 700 Marines would be \"deployed to Los Angeles to restore order.\"\n\nCalifornia state officials have fired back that federal troops are escalating the tension between law enforcement and protestors.\n\nProtests into the night\n\nSeveral crowds of demonstrators circled downtown Los Angeles, including City Hall and several federal buildings as helicopters paced the crowds from above. By 7 p.m. local time, the crowds numbered at least several hundred, snaking its way past cars and graffiti calling for ICE to be abolished.Car horns and sirens maintained a constant background symphony as protesters walked. Police officers periodically fired tear gas or pepper balls as a crowd sometimes moved too close to a protected building or someone threw a water bottle at them.Unlike the previous evening, local authorities appeared to have the area under firm control, although no one stopped people with spray paint from defacing public buildings.There was no visible sign of federal troops.\n\nLawsuit filed, alleges 'unnecessary, unlawful' actions by Trump\n\nAt a news conference Monday, Bonta announced details of the lawsuit against the administration, calling Trump's move \"unnecessary, counterproductive and most importantly unlawful.\" Bonta said Trump's order abused the federal government's authority and \"trampled over\" Gov. Gavin Newsom's sovereignty.\n\nTrump said the guard would restore order amid mounting violent clashes between police and protesters angry at his aggressive pursuit of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. illegally. On Monday, U.S. Northern Command confirmed 700 Marines would also be sent into the city.\n\nThe president pledged in a social media post to \"liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots. Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free.\"\n\nIn a social media post, Newsom blamed Trump for the increase in unrest after three days of protests, saying \"we’re suing him.\"\n\n“Donald Trump is creating fear and terror by failing to adhere to the U.S. Constitution and overstepping his authority. This is a manufactured crisis to allow him to take over a state militia, damaging the very foundation of our republic,” Newsom said in a statement.\n\nPolice on Monday were urging businesses and residents to report any \"vandalism, damage or looting\" for documentation after some of the protests Sunday deteriorated into destructive clashes between officers and protesters. Some vehicles were set ablaze, protesters blocked the 101 Freeway, and a group of them converged on an overpass and threw objects down at police, video footage showed.\n\nAuthorities declared several of the demonstrations Sunday \"unlawful assemblies,\" sweeping in with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades to disperse hundreds of protesters. Police in riot gear were joined by hundreds of the California National Guard troops.\n\nNewsom calls in 800 police officers\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Monday that he would have an additional 800 state and local law enforcement officers deploy to Los Angeles.\n\nNewsom said the additional officers are being called in order to handle the protests stemming from the face-offs between protestors and national guardsmen that were sent in “illegally,” according to the governor’s office.\n\n“Chaos is exactly what Trump wanted, now we are sending in hundreds more law enforcement to pick up the pieces,” Newsom said. “State and local leaders stand together, coordinated and resolute to ensure the safety of the Los Angeles region.”\n\nKaren Bass, LA’s mayor, backed Newsom: “While Washington choreographed these chaotic events, the LAPD and local law enforcement continue to effectively respond.”\n\n700 Marines sent to LA\n\nThe Pentagon is sending 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration sweeps by the Trump administration, according to U.S. Northern Command spokesperson Col Kelly Frushour.\n\nFrushour said the troops belong to the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment and are based at Twentynine Palms, about 140 miles east of Los Angeles. The California-based Marines will join the 2,100 federalized National Guard troops \"protecting federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles area,\" Frushour added.\n\nMarines heading to Los Angeles are from an infantry battalion whose typical mission is close combat with enemy forces. But for this mission, Frushour said, the activated Marines and Guardsmen \"have been trained in de-escalation, crowd control, and standing rules for the use of force.\"\n\nThe Marines will be moving out within hours, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Marines had been on standby since Saturday, according to U.S. Northern Command, which is in charge of the operation that also includes California National Guardsmen. Like the Guard troops, the Marines will be used to protect federal property.\n\nThe addition of active-duty troops is a significant escalation in the administration’s ongoing efforts to round up those who have violated immigration laws. There are thousands of active-duty troops assisting at the southern border but none inside a major U.S. city.\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook, Davis Winkie\n\nGov. Newsom files lawsuit against Trump over California ‘sovereignty’\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit on Monday against President Donald Trump over the president’s move to deploy members of the California National Guard without Newsom’s consent. The process is called federalizing the National Guard.\n\nThe Office of the California Attorney General shared a copy of the lawsuit with USA TODAY late Monday afternoon local time.\n\n“One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,” the lawsuit says. Trump “used a protest that local authorities had under control to make another unprecedented power grab, this time at the cost of the sovereignty of the State of California.”\n\nTrump authorized 2,000 National Guardsmen on June 7 to deploy to Los Angeles and on June 9 Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered another 2,000 to the city, according to the lawsuit.\n\n50 arrests, 600 non-lethal bullets fired: LAPD\n\nOfficials at the Los Angeles Police Department announced that they had arrested 50 people over Saturday and Sunday in downtown areas that “escalated into significant acts of violence, vandalism, and looting.”\n\nLAPD said 29 people were arrested Saturday evening for failing to follow orders to disperse. 21 people were arrested Sunday on charges from attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail to assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, LAPD said.\n\nAuthorities said officers used tear gas on the “hostile crowd” as well as over 600 rounds of non-lethal bullets. Among those hit was an Australian journalist covering the protests.\n\nAt least five officers received minor injuries, according to LAPD. Five police horses also “were targeted and sustained minor injuries.”\n\nPolice said protest groups used handheld radios “to coordinate and evade law enforcement.”\n\nLAPD said its Professional Standards Bureau will investigate excessive use of force allegations.\n\nWatch officer fires non-lethal bullet at journalist\n\nAn Australian journalist was shot with a rubber bullet by an officer while covering protests in Los Angeles over the weekend, according to her media outlet.\n\nLauren Tomasi, a U.S. national correspondent for Australia's 9News, was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet while reporting on the immigration raids and ensuing protests in Los Angeles on Sunday, June 8, the network reported.\n\nVideo captured by 9News shows a nearby armed police officer aiming a weapon at Tomasi before firing, striking the back of her left leg. Tomasi is heard yelling out in pain as the camera pans away.\n\nTomasi is sore but otherwise unharmed from the incident, 9News reported.\n\n- Greta Cross\n\nWhy burning EVs like Waymos isn't a good idea\n\nMultiple Waymo self-driving robotaxis were set on fire in Los Angeles during the protests. Other cars were also put to the torch but the Waymos have garnered special interest, partially because they're something new on the scene and partially because as electric vehicles, they raise different and specific concerns if their batteries burn.\n\nElectric vehicle fires can burn hotter and more intensely than gasoline-fueled cars, if their batteries catch fire.\n\nThe fires also release different emissions than traditional gasoline-powered vehicle fires, including gases such as hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and metal-based particulates.\n\nEV fires are also more difficult to put out than ones in gasoline-powered cars and require different firefighting techniques, which firefighters are trained on.\n\n- Elizabeth Weise\n\nGlendale scraps deal with ICE\n\nThe City of Glendale, about 9 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, announced it would be terminating its contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold federal immigration detainees at the local police facility, city officials said in a news release Sunday night. ICE’s agreement with Glendale had been in place since 2007, according to the release.\n\n“(The) City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive,” the statement said.\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Homeland Security responded to the announcement on X, saying ”Glendale’s politicians stand with criminal illegal aliens, including gang members, rapists, and murderers over American citizens.”\n\n“It is deeply disturbing that sanctuary politicians in Glendale, California, would terminate an agreement to hold ICE detainees and violent criminals — which the city has had with DHS for more than 15 years — just as violent rioters are looting and defacing Los Angeles and assaulting federal law enforcement,” DHS said.\n\n- Victoria Valenzuela\n\nCelebs speak out on LA protests\n\nSeveral stars have taken to social media to share information and resources, and to criticize the federal response to what they called peaceful demonstrations in Los Angeles.\n\nOn June 8, Billie Eilish's brother and collaborator, Finneas, posted on his Instagram story about the protests, cursing at ICE and sharing that he attended a protest and was immediately met with force.\n\n\"Tear gassed almost immediately at the very peaceful protest downtown ‒ they're inciting this,\" wrote the songwriter, an LA native.\n\n-Taijuan Moorman\n\nCalifornia to sue Trump administration over National Guard deployment\n\nBonta, the California attorney general, confirmed June 9 that the state plans to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its \"unlawful\" decision to deploy National Guard troops in Los Angeles against Newsom's wishes.\n\nBonta said that by the time the first few hundred troops arrived in Los Angles \"the protests had mostly dissipated and streets were mostly quiet and calm.\" After the troops were deployed, Bonta said the situation escalated and unrest grew, \"causing highways to close and putting people in danger.\"\n\nThe order violated the 10th Amendment and failed to meet the criteria required to invoke the law, according to the attorney general. Bonta said the move marks the first time a president has invoked this statute since President Richard Nixon ordered the National Guard to deliver mail during the 1970 Postal Service Strike.\n\n\"They unlawfully invoked a law that's intended to prevent an invasion by a foreign nation or a rebellion or local and state law enforcement make it so that the laws of the United States cannot be executed,\" Bonta said. \"Those are the only three triggers that would provide for the invocation of the National Guard, and none of them were present here.\"\n\nWhen asked about Trump's suggestion that Newsom should be arrested, Bonta defended the governor's actions and downplayed the possibility.\n\n\"It is the president and the Trump administration that is consistently and frequently, blatantly and brazenly violating the law, not Governor Newsom,\" Bonta said. \"So it's a seems to be more of bluster and threat.\"\n\nSan Francisco joins in protests\n\nIn San Francisco, three separate protests against immigration arrests were scheduled for Monday, June 9.\n\nThe first took place at noon at the California State Building, a few blocks from City Hall. It was called by the Service Employees International Union, whose California president, David Huerta, was arrested Friday in the Los Angeles protests. Attendees were urged to wear their union colors.\n\nA second protest was scheduled to be held at San Francisco City Hall at 4 p.m. local time and was organized by multiple local progressive groups.\n\nFinally, at 6 p.m. a protest was scheduled to be held at the 24th street BART subway plaza in San Francisco’s Mission District, which is the heart of the city’s Hispanic community.\n\nThe protests in San Francisco come as several Waymo self-driving taxis were attacked and burned in Los Angeles during protests on Saturday, June 7. The city in Northern California is home to the largest number of the self-driving cars, where they are a common sight on roadways.\n\nWaymo told USA TODAY while the company was still operating and serving riders in San Francisco, out of an abundance of caution it was limiting trips in certain areas where protesters may be gathering.\n\n- Elizabeth Weise\n\nLA day laborers don't fear ICE raids\n\nWhile national attention focused on Los Angeles, it was business as usual for virtually everyone in the city.\n\nOutside the Home Depot in the Paramount neighborhood, a small group of day laborers in paint-stained pants sat on buckets waiting for work. Several said ICE had detained people across Alondra Boulevard on June 7, sparking unrest.\n\nThey said that although they lacked papers to remain legally in the United States, they weren’t worried about being deported if ICE agents returned. Mexican-born Jose Luis Valencia, 54, said if it’s his time to go back to his home country, he’ll go.\n\n“We’re not thieves,” he said. “We’re just looking for jobs.”\n\nLA resident says city is still 'very peaceful' amid protests\n\nLongtime LA resident Ira Long, 67, said the reporting of the unrest has been overblown. Long, a pastor at the Alondra Church of Christ in Compton, said he still remembers when the National Guard was called out in the wake of the 1992 Rodney King riots.\n\n“That was a really, really terrible time. Right now I don’t feel any of that tension or anxiety,” said Long, a retired special education teacher. “But people are uneasy, and there’s a real sense of loss because we have lost people who were a part of this community.”\n\nSpeaking as church volunteers prepared to distribute food to community members about a half mile from where weekend protests erupted, Long said he wants the rest of the country to know Los Angeles is a good, safe city.\n\n“This is a very loving community,” he said. “It’s never been totally out of control. It has its challenges, its issues. But there are also amazing and fantastic families who make this a great place to live. It’s very peaceful. And right now it’s pretty cool.”\n\nImmigration enforcement protesters rally outside Justice Department\n\nDozens of protesters rallied outside the Justice Department’s headquarters in Washington to criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles, where Trump deployed the National Guard.\n\n“Enough of these mass ICE raids who are sweeping up innocent people,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said June 9. “Enough of the undermining of due process.”\n\nThe Service Employees International Union organized the protest after the union’s California president, David Huerta, was arrested in the Los Angeles protests. Bill Essayli, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, told KNBC, Huerta allegedly obstructed law enforcement vehicles from getting into a facility where they were conducting a search warrant, citing video of the arrest.\n\n“They tried to move him and then he got into a physical altercation with one of our agents and he resisted and he had to be pepper sprayed and subdued,” Essayli said.\n\nParticipants at the Justice Department protest held signs that said, “Free David. End ICE Raids” and “Justice for David Huerta Now.”\n\nThe rally was one of more than a dozen scheduled in cities across the U.S. to demand Huerta’s release and an end to workplace immigration raids, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\n'I would': Trump says he'd arrest Newsom\n\nAmid the mounting legal clash between the federal government and the state of California, Trump suggested that his border czar Tom Homan should arrest Newsom.\n\n“I would do it … I think it’s great,” Trump said when asked if Homan should arrest the governor, who has challenged the administration’s mobilization of National Guard troops to crack down on violent protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles.\n\nArresting Newsom, who responded to Homan’s threat by daring the feds to arrest him in a June 8 social media post, would represent a major escalation of the state’s widening rift with the Trump administration.\n\n− Davis Winkie\n\nNewsom warns that Trump could try federalizing Guard 'in any state'\n\nLAPD Chief Jim McDonnell called the outbreak of violence \"disgusting\" and said it had grown worse Saturday. He said he does not believe the same people who were genuinely protesting immigration policy were involved in the violence.\n\nNewsom warned that violent protesters would be arrested and prosecuted. He also kept up his social media attack on Trump, saying California \"didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved\" and that unrest is \"exactly\" what Trump wanted.\n\n\"Let’s get this straight: 1) Local law enforcement didn’t need help. 2) Trump sent troops anyway — to manufacture chaos and violence. 3) Trump succeeded,\" Newsom wrote. \"4) Now things are destabilized and we need to send in more law enforcement just to clean up Trump’s mess.\"\n\nFamilies of detainees plead for release of loved ones\n\nFamily members of several people detained last week in an ICE sweep pleaded for the release of their loved ones at a press conference Monday. Elaina Jung Hee Vermeulen, with the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, said she attempted on Sunday to meet with some of the detained warehouse workers.\n\n\"Instead of allowing me to meet with community members, they jumped onto trucks in riot gear,\" she said. Vermeulen urged local leaders to protect the rights of working class immigrants and said ICE must be banned from entering workplaces.\n\n\"Every single person who is here, who is figintg for a better life for their family, deserves to have their rights protected,\" she said.\n\nNoem explains reversal on federalizing National Guard\n\nAs South Dakota governor in February 2024, Kristi Noem threatened then-President Joe Biden when Democrats said he should federalize the National Guard in Texas to disrupt that state governor's anti-immigration efforts.\n\nIf he did, Noem warned, Biden would be mounting a “direct attack on states’ rights,” and sparking a “war” between Washington and Republican-led state governments, she said in a Feb. 6, 2024 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nOn June 8, Noem − now Trump's Homeland Security secretary − cheered Trump for doing the same thing to the Democratic governor of the state of California.\n\nOn CBS News' Face the Nation Sunday, Noem explained her reversal by saying, \"Governor Newsom has proven that he makes bad decisions.\" Read more here.\n\n− Josh Meyer\n\n‘Trump didn’t start’ riots: California sheriff rips Harris’ comments\n\nA California sheriff running for governor isn’t pleased with former Vice President Kamala Harris’ reaction to the explosive protests. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said in a June 8 post on X that Trump is \"not out there lighting cars on fire, hurling projectiles at law enforcement or blocking freeways.”\n\nThe sheriff, whose county is just north of San Diego and the fourth-most populous county in the state, was responding to Harris’ earlier statement where she said the deployment of the National Guard was \"meant to provoke chaos.”\n\nHarris, who is mulling a bid for California governor next year, put much of the blame on the Trump administration’s ICE raids and a \"cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.\"\n\nBianco, who is also running for governor in 2026, is a long-standing Trump supporter who gained a bit of attention in 2021 for vowing not to enforce COVID-19 vaccine mandates in his office.\n\nHe said Sunday the former VP’s comments were “an embarrassment.\"\n\n“The Democrats and their ‘leaders’ own this,” Bianco added.\n\n− Phillip M. Bailey\n\nLatinas for Trump co-founder blasts Trump immigration policy\n\nFlorida state Sen. Ileana Garcia, who co-founded the group Latinas for Trump, criticized his administration's recent immigration enforcement actions as “unacceptable and inhumane” in a post on X.\n\nHer remarks come as federal agents have arrested immigrants in courthouses across the U.S., including Florida, stripping them of due process protections, as NBC News reported.\n\n“I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings − in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims − all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal,” she wrote in her post, referring to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.\n\nShe said she stands with Florida Republican Rep. María Elvira Salazar, who wrote in a statement June 6 that “anyone with a pending asylum case, status-adjustment petition, or similar claim deserves to go through the legal process.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBorder czar denies threatening to arrest Newsom\n\nTrump border czar Tom Homan on Monday denied ever calling for the arrest of Newsom. Homan told Fox News that he was asked if Newsom or Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass could be arrested and Homan responded that, if they commit a crime, they could be arrested.\n\n“There was no discussion about arresting Newsom,” Homan said.\n\nNewsom had addressed the issue on social media, saying that \"Trump’s border czar is threatening to arrest me for speaking out. Come and get me, tough guy. I don't give a damn. It won’t stop me from standing up for California.\"\n\nProtesters flee tear gas grenades\n\nAt 8 p.m. local time on Sunday, authorities declared the protest to be an unlawful assembly and moved in aggressively with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades.\n\nThat sent hundreds of people running, their eyes streaming with tears. Helicopters clattered overhead as protesters fled the area to the honking of car horns and periodic cheers.\n\nAccording to preliminary information, police said at least 10 people have been arrested and three officers were injured during protests on Sunday. California Highway Patrol arrested 17 people on the 101 Freeway, police said. On Saturday, police arrested 29 people.\n\nRecent ICE sweeps sparked protests in Los Angeles\n\nThe protests began Friday after Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps in the area resulted in more than 40 arrests. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, defended the raids and said those arrested by ICE included a Vietnamese man convicted of second-degree murder, an Ecuadoran man convicted of possession of five kilograms of cocaine, and a Filipino man convicted of sexual offenses.\n\n\"These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets,\" McLaughlin said in a statement. \"Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer.\"\n\n60 arrested after San Francisco protest\n\nProtests against immigration enforcement policies were not limited to the Los Angeles area. In San Francisco, a demonstration that drew hundreds ended with violence and about 60 arrests, police said.\n\n\"Individuals in the group became violent and began to commit crimes ranging from assault to felony vandalism and causing property damage,\" San Francisco police said in a statement. An unlawful assembly was declared and many left the scene while others vandalized buildings and police cars. Two officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries.\n\n\"Individuals are always free to exercise their First Amendment rights in San Francisco but violence especially against SFPD officers - will never be tolerated,\" the statement said.\n\nVideos show Waymo cars on fire amid LA protests; service reportedly suspended\n\nLos Angeles protesters set fire to Waymo self-driving cars\n\nPhotos and videos show several Waymo self-driving cars being torched during the protests. The LAPD said one street had been closed indefinitely after \"multiple autonomous vehicles\" had been set on fire.\n\nFootage shared on social media captured several of Waymo driverless taxis engulfed in flames in the June 8 protests. Others were vandalized with messages against Trump and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, videos show.\n\nWaymo suspended service in downtown Los Angeles and \"will not be serving any rides in the protest area until it is deemed safe,\" a company spokesperson told NBC News.\n\n− Melina Khan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/10/los-angeles-protests-riots-live-updates/84124567007/", "title": "LA protests live updates: Curfew enacted amid ongoing ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from ICE protests in Los Angeles on Tuesday, June 10. For the latest news on the LA protests, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Wednesday, June 11.\n\nLOS ANGELES − Mayor Karen Bass issued a curfew for parts of downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday following intense days of protests over immigration enforcement raids that have left crews to clean up the wreckage and seen thousands of National Guard troops sent to the city.\n\nIn a news conference, Bass said the curfew will run from 8 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Wednesday, in an effort to curb ongoing vandalism and looting in downtown Los Angeles. Bass announced the curfew while many people in the city were out marching through the streets and protesting against the ICE raids.\n\nThe curfew was announced to \"stop bad actors who are taking advantage of the President's chaotic escalation,\" Bass asserted in a social media post. \"Law enforcement will arrest individuals who break the curfew, and you will be prosecuted.\"Nights of volatile protests have prompted a legal and social media standoff between California leaders and the Trump administration. The conflict centers on Trump's move to deploy Marines and the National Guard in California in response to protests that have sprung up against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit against Trump for deploying federal troops in the city. Newsom has also accused Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth of trying to use the assets to help ICE conduct raids. A judge set a hearing for the matter for Thursday.\n\nNewsom’s efforts to block federal incursion in California come after Trump doubled the National Guard presence in Los Angeles to 4,000 and deployed 700 Marines, an escalation estimated to cost about $134 million, according to a Pentagon official. Trump remained all-in on his decisions, posting on Truth Social that \"if we didn't send out the National Guard—Los Angeles would be burning right now!\"\n\nSince Friday, officers have had confrontations with protesters, leading to the use of pepper spray and flash bangs as officials announced more than 150 arrests amid flare-ups of vandalism and violence. Bass on Tuesday said damage was limited to a small area downtown, but noted that the graffiti was \"extensive\" and required a large response as the city prepares to host the 2026 World Cup.\n\nWhat to know about the curfew?\n\nThe curfew issued by Bass covers a one-square-mile area of downtown Los Angeles and will last from 8 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday local time. The mayor said she expected the curfew to last for several days.\n\nBass announced the curfew while people were marching through the streets, where protests had turned into vandalism and looting earlier in the week. Police have made over 150 arrests in response to the protests, including over 100 the night before the curfew was announced.\n\nIn a statement about the protests Monday night, Los Angeles police said that \"as demonstrators were being disbursed, agitators and miscreants within the crowd looted businesses and vandalized property.\"\n\nCalifornia officials have said that Trump’s move to send federal troops to the city has only exacerbated tensions and prompted more unrest.\n\nNewsom on Trump: 'Rule of law has increasingly given way to rule of Don'\n\nNewsom delivered a fiery speech Tuesday night, sharing details about what sparked the protests in California's biggest city and what the president’s reaction says about the state of the nation.\n\n\"This situation was winding down and concentrated in just a few square blocks downtown, but that's not what Donald Trump wanted,\" Newsom said. \"He chose escalation, he chose more force, he chose theatrics over public safety.\"\n\nNewsom said Trump did not consult with California law enforcement leaders and commandeered National Guard troops to Los Angeles streets \"illegally and for no reason.\"\n\n\"This brazen abuse of power by a sitting president inflamed a combustible situation,\" Newsom explained.\n\nNewsom said the protests were sparked by unprecedented immigration enforcement raids that saw federal agents \"jumping out of unmarked vans\" outside Home Depot to detain people. The governor added that a \"U.S. citizen nine months pregnant was arrested, a four-year-old girl taken, families separated, friends quite literally disappearing.\"\n\nTrump has said his immigration policy is meant to root out criminals and people illegally in the country, adding that deploying federal troops to Los Angeles was necessary to protect federal buildings from vandalism and keep the peace.\n\n\"California may be first, but it clearly will not end here, other states are next, democracy is next,\" Newsom said. \"This moment we have feared has arrived. The rule of law has increasingly given way to the rule of Don.\"\n\nProtesters take to the streets of Chicago, other US cities\n\nCHICAGO — Hundreds of people gathered in the city’s iconic Loop neighborhood on Tuesday to protest ICE and the immigration enforcement raids that sparked widespread demonstrations in Los Angeles.\n\nMarchers gathered at Daley Plaza near the federal courthouse, marched under the tracks of the El train and down Michigan Avenue.\n\nDemonstrators carried Mexican flags, signs reading “none of us are free unless all of us are free” and chanted a slogan in Spanish insulting immigration authorities.\n\nProtesters marched through Chicago at the same time that people took to the streets in Los Angeles.\n\nWatch the protests here.\n\n--Contributing: Reuters\n\nJudge balks at Newsom request to limit Trump use of National Guard\n\nJudge Charles Breyer balked at Newsom's request to block the Trump administration's use of the National Guard and Marines on Tuesday. Instead, Breyer ordered a briefing on Wednesday and a hearing on Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Trump administration called Newsom's motion for an emergency temporary restraining order \"legally meritless,\" in pursuit of \"an extraordinary, unprecedented, and dangerous court order,\" and claimed the court has no authority to weigh in.\n\n- Sarah Wire\n\nTrump says troops sent to LA are 'defending the republic'\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in remarks from Fort Bragg in North Carolina that service members deployed to California are \"defending the republic itself\" and helping the administration \"liberate\" the city of Los Angeles.\n\n\"They're stopping an invasion,\" Trump said, in late afternoon remarks.\n\nThe Republican president said California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats, are \"incompetent\" and suggested without evidence that \"troublemakers, agitators and insurrectionists\" were being paid to undermine federal immigration law.\n\nAsked by a reporter if he was accusing Newsom and Bass of paying demonstrators, Trump said \"somebody\" was but not necessarily the Democratic politicians. \"He was just asked by reporters about this remark and he said \"somebody\" is paying for it, without specifiying who.\n\n\"And if they're not, they're just troublemakers,\" he said. \"I believe someboyd is paying them.\"\n\nTrump said: \"As the entire world can now see, uncontrolled migration leads to chaos, dysfunction and disorder.\"\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nHas Trump overblown the threat of protests? Residents, officials say yes.\n\nTrump's deployment of thousands of troops to the nation's second-largest city has unleashed indignation and anger among residents and local officials who say the threat of immigration protests has been dramatically overblown by the White House.\n\n\"The implication is that Donald Trump is waging a war on us personally,\" said protester Charlie Knowlton, 30.\n\nImmigration agents carrying out Trump's goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants annually sparked a series of sometimes-violent protests in the greater Los Angeles area.\n\nTrump has dispatched 4,000 members of the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, arguing that local law enforcement is overwhelmed. Few of those troops are actually on the streets, however.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department alone has about 9,000 officers to serve the city of nearly 4 million people sprawling across a land area that's one-third the size of Rhode Island. The larger Los Angeles metro area has more than 18 million residents and covers an area nearly the size of Maine.\n\nLocal authorities say they have detained about 150 people in connection to the unrest that left small areas of the 5.8-square-mile downtown marred with pervasive graffiti and a few broken windows. No serious injuries have been reported.\n\n\"We all know this is a power grab,\" Knowlton said before taking a selfie in front of a line of LAPD officers in riot gear. \"What I want right now is for the city police to grow a spine and stand up to the feds.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nState asks judge to stop troops in LA from helping ICE\n\nThe motion says the state on June 9 became aware that the National Guard units in California \"would be providing support for counter-immigration operations and not only at federal buildings.\"\n\n\"Specifically, these activities—scheduled to begin today, June 10, 2025—will include 'holding a secure perimeter in communities around areas where immigration enforcement activities would take place, and securing routes over public streets where immigration enforcement officers would travel,'” the motion said.\n\nThe filing did not say how the state received word about the alleged change in operations.\n\nThe 4,000 California National Guard members called in by the president were originally tasked with protecting federal buildings and other property of the federal government. The Trump administration has not responded to the motion or Newsom's allegation's that the troops were going to used for immigration enforcement.\n\nLA Mayor: ‘We’re an experiment’\n\nMayor Karen Bass, asked why Los Angeles would be targeted, said she believes her city is “an experiment.”\n\n“If you can do this to the nation’s second largest city, maybe the administration is hoping this will be a signal to everybody everywhere to fear them—that you federal government that historically has protected you can come in and take over,” she told reporters in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nBass said she would be reaching out to President Trump. Asked what she would tell him, she said, “I want to tell him to stop the raids. I want to tell him that this is a city of immigrants. I want to tell him that if you want to devastate the economy of the City of Los Angeles, attack immigrants.”\n\n− Phaedra Trethan\n\nOver 100 arrests, 2 officers injured: LAPD\n\nThe number of arrests in connection with the demonstrations in downtown Los Angeles shot up Monday evening, according to the city’s police department.\n\nPolice reported on Tuesday that officers made at least 113 arrests. 96 were for failure to follow orders to leave the area. 14 people were arrested for looting. One person each was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, resisting arrest and vandalism.\n\nTwo officers were brought to a hospital for their injuries and released. Several businesses were looted, police said.\n\nThe crowds of people left around 3 a.m., officials said.\n\nLAPD acknowledged the hectic night in a statement: “Unfortunately, as demonstrators were being disbursed, agitators and miscreants within the crowd looted businesses and vandalized property,” police said. “We are asking that all residents and businesses continue to report any crimes… Please document with photographs or video before clean up.”\n\nThe number of arrests was more than double what LAPD reported for Saturday and Sunday when 50 people were arrested. Most were also for failure to follow dispersal orders although among the charges was attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail and assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, according to police.\n\nLA mayor considers curfew to curb nightly violence\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she is considering a curfew to restore calm to the city.\n\n“We’re looking at things like a curfew,” she said June 10, and she planned to meet with Police Chief Jim McDonnell later in the day to discuss it.\n\nShe said a curfew wouldn’t need to be citywide, but likely focused on the downtown area.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nTeams cleaning up protesters' graffiti\n\nAuthorities have dispatched painters, cleaners, and other workers to scrub away, cover up or fade out widespread spraypaint graffiti around downtown. While the vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, a small number have defaced buildings, sidewalks and streets with anti-Trump slogans, criticism of ICE and police, and exhortations to resist fascism.\n\nFederal buildings are among the hardest hit, and there was no sign of the National Guard or Marines protecting those facilities Tuesday. On North Los Angeles Street, contractors were paying particular attention to the asphalt where five Waymo self-driving electric vehicles were burned by protesters, releasing rare Earth materials that can be hazardous.\n\nAround the corner, painter’s apprentice Tim Brevard, 53, covered up graffiti on a wall with grey paint shot from a sprayer. Under normal circumstances, Brevard’s team removes gang graffiti from the same area daily. Now it is political graffiti. City policy calls for removing it within 72 hours of being reported, and the city spends about $14 million annually on graffiti removal, according to its annual budget.\n\n“Down here it’s tough because there’s fresh graffiti every day,” Brevard said as he paused to wipe sweat from his face with a gloved hand. “There’s always gang graffiti. Every day we do this.”\n\nHow did the LA protests begin? Immigration raids spark outrage\n\nThe protests in Los Angeles County began as a reaction to a handful of immigration raids, including one outside a Home Depot and another at a clothing manufacturer in the city's garment district.\n\nThe raids and subsequent outrage came as the Trump administration stepped up its detention and deportation of immigrants including at workplaces, traffic stops and routine legal check-ins.\n\nProtests against these moves have increased, too. While most have remained peaceful, the Department of Homeland Security reported a more than 400% surge in assaults on agents.\n\nAfter small protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles on June 6, Trump took several swift actions, calling in the 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines, drawing ire – and at least one lawsuit – from California officials who accuse the president of stoking tension and escalating unrest.\n\nTrump has stood by his actions, saying the deployments were necessary to contain what he described as \"violent, instigated riots.\" About 150 people have been arrested at the protests, which have included flare-ups of unruly clashes, vandalism and looting, but have remained limited to a few blocks in the city's downtown area.\n\nAs authorities brace for another day of protests and Los Angelenos ready themselves for the increased military presence, read more about how the protests began.\n\nTrump says he’d invoke Insurrection Act 'if there’s an insurrection'\n\nTrump said he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act, which would give him more leeway to use the military for domestic purposes as he deploys troops to Los Angeles in response to violent protests.\n\n\"If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it,” Trump said Tuesday during an event in the White House. “We'll see. But I can tell you, last night was terrible. The night before that was terrible.\"\n\nTrump deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles over the objections of Newsom, sparking the lawsuit from the state. Marines also were sent to help the guard after protests erupted over federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nThe troops currently are limited to protecting federal property and law enforcement officers. The Insurrection Act would give Trump authority to use them more broadly. Trump said some areas of Los Angeles, during the protests, where \"you could have called it an insurrection. It was terrible.\"\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nHouse Speaker says Newsom should be 'tarred and feathered'\n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, asked Tuesday whether Newsom should be arrested, said the governor should be “tarred and feathered.”\n\n“That's not my lane. I'm not gonna give you legal analysis on whether Gavin Newsom should be arrested. But he ought to be tarred and feathered,” Johnson, R-LA., said in a weekly press conference.\n\nJohnson said Newsom is keeping the administration from implementing federal law.\n\nNewsom quickly responded on social media. “Good to know we’re skipping the arrest and going straight for the 1700s style forms of punishment. A fitting threat given the (Republicans) want to bring our country back to the 18th Century.”\n\n− Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhere are LA protests happening?\n\nMost of the unrest is taking place across a few square miles in a mostly commercial area downtown. The city is sprawled across hundreds of square miles and the county covers thousands of square miles. The vast majority of the metropolitan area has been quiet, with people able to continue their daily routines.\n\nTrump has insisted that he had no choice but to increase the level of force in response to growing unrest over his immigration crackdown.\n\n700 Marines heading to LA for riot assistance; Newsom calls move 'deranged fantasy' of Trump\n\nHegseth says National Guard is 'huge component' going forward\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth told a House committee Tuesday the United States was entering a new phase in which the National Guard would \"become a critical component of how we secure that homeland.\"\n\n\"The National Guard is a huge component of how we see the future,\" he told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.\n\nBryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the secretary of defense, said the Pentagon is spending $134 million of deploying 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines. Funding is coming from operations and maintenance accounts, he said.\n\n− Mayes-Osterman, Cybele\n\nNewsom, Trump aide spar on social media\n\nNewsom criticized Trump on X Tuesday after Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, blasted the governor on the same social media site hours earlier. Miller wrote that \"when the rioters swarmed, you handed over your streets, willingly. You still refuse to arrest and prosecute the arsonists, seditionists and insurrectionists.\"\n\nNewsom made reference to Trump's decision to pardon or commute the sentences of hundreds of people in connection with the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"The only people defending insurrectionists are you and @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom wrote. \"Or, are we pretending like you didn’t pardon 1500 of them?\"\n\nCivil rights groups rip Trump's show of force\n\nSeveral national civil rights groups described the Trump administration's National Guard deployment as an overreach of power that was “deeply disturbing\" and “reckless.\"\n\n\"It is not lost on us that no such show of force was deployed in advance of the January 6 insurrection at our nation’s capital despite the clear threat to democracy. The contrast is alarming,\" leaders wrote in a statement released Monday night. “Peaceful protesters in Los Angeles are met with military presence, while violent actors in Washington, D.C. were allowed to breach the heart of our government with little resistance. This inconsistency amplifies questions about how power is used and against whom.\"\n\nThe right to protest the Trump administration’s \"unjust policies targeting Black and Brown communities must be protected,\" they wrote.\n\nThe groups include the NAACP, the National Urban League, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, the National Action Network, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership Conference, the National Council of Negro Women and the Legal Defense Fund.\n\nSeparately, Judith LeBlanc, executive director of Native Organizers Alliance Action Fund, called the administration’s decision to call in the National Guard and the Marines “an act of violence meant to silence organizers who are taking a righteous stand against the illegal and brutal ICE raids happening everyday.”\n\n− Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nMultiple journalists injured by nonlethal rounds\n\nMultiple members of the media have reported being caught in the crossfire or targeted by authorities using tear gas or rubber bullets.\n\nThe incidents included Australian journalist Lauren Tomasi, who was hit in the leg by a rubber bullet on camera in a video that shows an officer appearing to aim at her. A New York Post photographer, Toby Canham, also said he was shot in the forehead with a nonlethal round. British freelance photographer Nick Stern told the BBC he underwent emergency surgery after he was hit in the leg by a plastic bullet.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists has sounded the alarm over the incidents, warning against the intimidation of journalists.\n\n“Any attempt to discourage or silence media coverage by intimidating or injuring journalists should not be tolerated,” Katherine Jacobsen, program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, said in a statement. “It is incumbent upon authorities to respect the media’s role of documenting issues of public interest.”\n\nNational Press Club President Mike Balsamo warned that law enforcement \"cannot pick and choose when the First Amendment applies. Journalists in Los Angeles were not caught in the crossfire — they were targeted. \"\n\n-Jeanine Santucci\n\nMultiple journalists injured by police nonlethal rounds while covering LA protests\n\nCNN correspondent briefly detained, warned by LAPD\n\nPolice briefly detained CNN correspondent Jason Carroll while on air Monday night during the network's coverage of the protests. CNN was covering the protests live when in-studio anchors briefly lost contact with Carroll, who could be seen being led away from the protests by LAPD officers with his hands behind his back. Carroll returned to the mic, informing the anchors: \"I am being detained.\"\n\nAn officer then can be heard telling Carroll: \"We're letting you go. You can't come back. If you come back, you will be arrested.\"\n\nCNN issued a statement saying \"we are pleased the situation resolved quickly once the reporting team presented law enforcement with their CNN credentials.

Checks and balances are crumbling,\" Newsom added.\n\n-Jeanine Santucci\n\nFederal forces present 'challenge' for police\n\nOfficials at the Los Angeles Police Department said Monday that despite violent demonstrations, local police can handle whatever protesters throw at them and that federal help is unnecessary and could become a hindrance.\n\n“The possible arrival of federal military forces in Los Angeles - absent clear coordination - presents a significant logistical and operational challenge for those of us charged with safeguarding this city,” Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement. “The Los Angeles Police Department, alongside our mutual aid partners, have decades of experience managing large-scale public demonstrations, and we remain confident in our ability to do so professionally and effectively.”\n\nLAPD said officers have fired over 600 non-lethal bullets and used tear gas on the \"hostile crowd.\" Among those hit was an Australian journalist covering the protests.\n\nAt least five officers received minor injuries, according to police. Five police horses also “were targeted and sustained minor injuries,\" police said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDays of protests sparked by ICE raids in LA\n\nThe protests began Friday after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps near Los Angeles resulted in more than 40 arrests. The protests had largely been peaceful but flared up when heavily armed, masked agents raided Los Angeles businesses.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, defended the raids and said those arrested by ICE included a Vietnamese man convicted of second-degree murder, an Ecuadoran man convicted of possession of five kilograms of cocaine, and a Filipino man convicted of sexual offenses.\n\nOn Monday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said local immigrant rights groups had confirmed at least five ICE raids in the Los Angeles region. The mayor said officials were still working to compile more information on the raids but noted that in some cases, ICE targeted day laborers and detained people who appeared for scheduled immigration appointments.\n\n\"As you know, ICE does not tell anybody where they're going to go or when they're going to be there,\" Bass said at the Monday news conference.\n\nProtests also sprang up in at least nine other cities across the U.S. on Monday, including New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, according to Reuters.\n\nWhen does a protest become a riot?\n\nProtests in Los Angeles were relatively peaceful when they began on Friday, but escalated into scenes of chaos, with electric vehicles lit aflame, large clouds of tear gas and clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators. Trump has backed his move to send in troops, calling the protests “violent, insurrectionist mobs” and “lawless riots.” But Newsom said it was Trump who “instigated violence.”\n\nExperts say while there are legal definitions for a riot, the term has become increasingly politicized and encapsulates a wide variety of incidents. In most states including California, the key determinator lies in whether multiple people are involved and whether they are committing acts of violence, Brian Higgins, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said.\n\n\"One person is not a riot and neither is a group that is nonviolent,\" he said. \"They can even be breaking the law, like refusing to disperse. It's when you add in the factor of violence that it becomes a riot.\"\n\nThere are some gray areas, he said. Experts also said that while violence is a defining factor in a riot, such violence could be incited by law enforcement.

In a video statement released Thursday night, Padilla said he had been escorted to the news conference by a National Guardsman and an FBI agent after waiting for another scheduled briefing.\n\n\"Now, I'm OK for people who are wondering how I'm doing,\" Padilla, who is from California, added. \"But the big lesson here is if they can do that to me ... what are they doing to a lot of the folks that are out there when the cameras are not on?\"\n\nIn a statement on X, Noem said she met with Padilla for 15 minutes after his removal from the news conference and added that the pair exchanged phone numbers and intend to speak further. \"I wish he would’ve acted that way in the beginning rather than creating a scene,\" she said.\n\nWalmart heiress promotes anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests in ad\n\nBillionaire Walmart heiress Christy Walton took out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times urging people to join nationwide protests against the Trump administration on Saturday, June 14, drawing swift condemnation from Trump supporters.\n\nThe advertisement, which ran on Sunday, encourages readers to take to the streets as part of the some 2,000 demonstrations planned across the country. The “No Kings Day” protests are expected to be the largest demonstrations against Trump since he took office, and also coincide with Trump’s military parade in Washington.\n\nWalmart sought to distance itself from the advertisement placed by one of the richest women in America. “The advertisements from Christy Walton are in no way connected to or endorsed by Walmart,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nUnrest at Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey, draws law enforcement response\n\nAn immigration detention facility in New Jersey, where at least two officials were arrested last month, became the site of unrest on Thursday, June 12, triggering a large law enforcement response.\n\nSeveral immigration rights groups said detainees protested over insufficient food and other poor conditions at Delaney Hall, the first immigrant detention center to open during President Donald Trump's second term. Regarding the law enforcement response, groups said there were reports of agents deploying tear gas and pepper spray.\n\nOfficials have not provided details about the incident. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a critic of the facility who was arrested in front of it on May 9, said in a statement that he is concerned about reports of what has happened at the Delaney Hall “from withholding food and poor treatment, to uprising and escaped detainees.”\n\n“This entire situation lacks sufficient oversight of every basic detail — including local zoning laws and fundamental constitutional rights,” he said on X. “We must put an end to this chaos and not allow this operation to continue unchecked.\"\n\n10 arrested in Portland as protests spread nationwide\n\nA week after protests began in Los Angeles, more anti-ICE demonstrations have sprung up in cities nationwide in solidarity with LA protesters. Protests have been reported in San Francisco, New York, Washington, Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta and many more.\n\nIn Portland, authorities said overnight that 10 people were arrested for their alleged behavior during a protest outside an ICE facility the evening of June 12. The 10 arrested ranged in ages from 19 to 33 and were booked on charges that included arson, disorderly conduct and assault on an officer.\n\nTwo officers had minor injuries, the Portland Police Bureau said.\n\nWhat have courts said about federalization of the National Guard?\n\nIn its order temporarily allowing Trump to maintain his control over the National Guard, the appeals court did not issue a final ruling but delivered what's called an \"administrative stay.\" It gave the appeals judges time to consider Trump's request to block Breyer's order. The appeals court was made up of a panel of three judges, two of which were appointed by Trump and one by former President Joe Biden.\n\nA hearing was scheduled for the appeals court on Tuesday, June 17 at noon.\n\nBreyer, the federal judge who ruled Trump's deployment of the Guard was unlawful, issued just hours before the appeals court ruling a 36-page decision in which he said the president's actions were illegal and a violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. Breyer was appointed in 1997 by former Democratic President Bill Clinton and is the brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.\n\nBreyer wrote he was \"troubled by the implication inherent in Defendants’ argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion,\" responding to the Trump administration's justification for sending in the National Guard.\n\n\"(T)here can be no debate that most protesters demonstrated peacefully,\" the judge said.\n\nCurfew for parts of downtown Los Angeles\n\nFollowing days of protests in Los Angeles, which were mostly confined to parts of the city's downtown area, a partial curfew remained in effect for the third consecutive night. The curfew, lasting from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. PT for pockets of downtown Los Angeles, was implemented on Tuesday.\n\n“My hope is after continuing it a few more days, that people will get the message that we are serious,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said at a Thursday news conference.\n\nShortly before the curfew went into effect on Thursday night, the Los Angeles Police Department’s Central Division reported people in a crowd throwing bricks, concrete, and commercial-grade fireworks.\n\n\"Less lethal munitions have been authorized,\" LAPD said in a post on X at about 7:55 p.m. local time.\n\nPlanned 'No Kings' protests for June 14 grow\n\n\"No Kings\" Day organizers say it is more important than ever to have a \"national day of peaceful protest\" on June 14, following the decision by Trump to send 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\n\"I think we will see the largest peaceful single day protests that this country has seen certainly since the first Trump term,\" said Indivisible cofounder Ezra Levin, one of the organizers.\n\nNow, about 2,000 protests and rallies named \"No Kings\" Day are planned to oppose what they see as Trump's power grab, nearly double that of the April 5 \"Hands Off\" protest that saw millions of Americans turn out in big and small cities nationwide. Organizers expect millions of Americans to turn out across the country on June 14.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/12/ice-immigration-protests-live-updates/84157140007/", "title": "Court blocks ruling requiring Trump to return control of National Guard", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects news on the growing protests against ICE raids and President Donald Trump's immigration policies from Thursday, June 12. For the latest news on the immigration protests and court rulings, follow USA TODAY's live updates for Friday, June 13.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday temporarily halted a federal judge's order that blocked President Donald Trump's mobilization of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles and required him to return control of troops to California.\n\nThe ruling came just hours after U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer issued a temporary restraining order finding that Trump's deployment of 4,000 Guard members was unlawful. The court said it would hold a remote hearing on the matter on June 17.\n\nThe decision does not mean that the court will ultimately agree with Trump, but it means he will maintain command of the National Guard for now.\n\nThe ruling came amid rising tensions between Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom over federal military intervention in the state. Newsom had filed a motion for a temporary restraining order that would limit the activities of Guard members and 700 Marines to protecting federal buildings in a small area of downtown where most protests against federal immigration raids have taken place.\n\nBreyer's order, which was to take effect at noon PT on Friday, did not include a ruling on the deployment of the Marines. Breyer wrote in the ruling that the presence of Guard troops \"seemed to only inflame\" and worsen tensions with protesters.\n\n\"His actions were illegal – both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith,\" Breyer wrote in his 36-page ruling.\n\nIn a news conference following the ruling, Newsom said he was \"gratified by the order.\" The governor added that troops would be redeployed to their previous duties, such as border security, drug enforcement, and vegetation and forest management.\n\n“Today was really about a test of democracy and today we passed the test — we the people passed the test,” Newsom said.\n\nCalifornia AG says federal judge's ruling is an 'early success'\n\nDuring a virtual news conference on Thursday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the temporary restraining order an \"early success,\" but noted that \"it’s far from the end of the road.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has filed a notice of appeal and requested the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to block Breyer’s ruling.\n\nThe next hearing with Breyer in the case is scheduled for 10 a.m. PT on June 20. According to the ruling, the Trump administration must \"show cause\" for why Breyer should not issue a preliminary injunction.\n\nNewsom: Judge waiting for evidence of Marines’ deployment\n\nNewsom said he believed Breyer is waiting for evidence that the Marines have \"actually been deployed\" to Los Angeles.\n\n\"They appear not to be,\" Newsom said at Thursday’s news conference. \"They’re not coordinating with anybody on this, so he’s just waiting for that evidence.\"\n\nThe governor added that the Marines have been moved to another location for training exercises and have not been deployed to the city. The military previously said about 700 Marines will be on the streets of Los Angeles by Thursday or Friday.\n\nNewsom also criticized the Trump administration's actions, including intensifying immigration raids and the forceful removal of Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla at a news conference in Los Angeles earlier on Thursday.\n\n“The notion that the United States active duty Marines, these heroes, would be used to militarize the streets of an American city is an abomination,” Newsom said. \"The Founding Fathers did not live and die to see that happen in this country for no reason whatsoever other than vanity theater to instill fear, to incite a response.\"\n\nHegseth won't say he'll respect ruling on LA deployment\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth declined to say Thursday whether he would respect any court's ruling if it put major limitations on Guard troops and Marines deploying in Los Angeles.\n\nThe military's mission in recent days has been expanded to include the protection of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers conducting the raids prompted by Trump's directive to find immigrants living in the United States without legal status. The sweeps prompted days of protests, and demonstrations and rallies have spread across the nation.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-California, asked Hegseth at a congressional hearing Thursday to \"assure the American people\" he would respect any ruling from the Supreme Court or district courts of sending the military to crack down on protests against Trump's immigration enforcement sweeps.\n\n\"We should not have local judges determining foreign policy or national security policy for the country,\" Hegseth responded.\n\n\"You're not willing to say you would respect those decisions?\" Khanna asked.\n\n\"What I'm saying is local district judges shouldn't make foreign policy for the United States,\" Hegseth shot back.\n\nSen. Padilla removed from Homeland Security Secretary’s news conference\n\nPadilla was forcibly removed from a news conference put on by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles amid mass protests over the administration’s immigration crackdown. As Padilla started asking Noem a question, he was grabbed by security guards.\n\n“I am Senator Alex Padilla, I have questions for the secretary,” Padilla said as he was hauled from the room where Noem was speaking.\n\nAfter being dragged away, the senator was pushed to the ground and handcuffed. Noem said during the news conference that she doesn’t know Padilla and that he hadn’t requested a meeting with her.\n\n“So when I leave here I’ll have a conversation with him and visit and find out really what his concerns were,” she said. “I think everybody in America would agree that wasn’t appropriate.”\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\n'Unhinged': Democrats furious Padilla was hauled out of Noem briefing\n\nWASHINGTON – The fury radiating off of Congressional Democrats is palpable.\n\nHours after Padilla, the senior U.S. senator in California, was forcibly removed from a press briefing with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, House Democrats roamed the Capitol seeking an audience with GOP leadership. Meanwhile, their Senate counterparts gave floor speech after floor speech, condemning the action as an \"abuse of power\" and \"assault.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson called Padilla's actions \"wildly inappropriate\" and alleged he rushed at the secretary. House Democrats shouted over him, saying, \"That's a lie!\"\n\n\"Anybody that looks at that video will understand that this amounts to an assault, a felony,\" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-New York, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. \"The White House is unhinged and out of control.\"\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, a string of Democratic senators delivered floor speeches hammering the indignity of the episode.\n\n“I saw this happen to my colleague, and I am shocked by how far we have descended in the first 140 days of this administration . . . What is the becoming of our democracy? Are there no limits to what this administration will do?” said New Jersey Democrat Sen. Andy Kim on the Senate floor.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and Riley Beggin\n\nTrump, Newsom joust ahead of crucial court hearing\n\nIn an interview released Thursday with \"The Daily,\" a New York Times podcast, Newsom slammed President Donald Trump and called the decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles \"theatre\" and \"unconstitutional.\"\n\nNewsom said local police are protecting the deployed National Guard troops while also handling the protests − \"just think about how perverse that is.\"\n\nTrump, in a Truth Social post Thursday, said the city was \"safe and sound\" thanks in part to the Guard.\n\n\"Our great National Guard, with a little help from the Marines, put the L.A. Police in a position to effectively do their job,\" Trump wrote Thursday. \"They all worked well together, but without the Military, Los Angeles would be a crime scene like we haven’t seen in years.\"\n\nThe LAPD did report incidents of unrest the last two nights, and arrests were made. Demonstrators late Wednesday threw \"commercial-grade fireworks and rocks\" at officers, police said.\n\nNewsom, who has repeatedly decried the military intervention as an illegal waste of resources that provoked unrest, ultimately wants the National Guard returned to state control and Trump's actions declared illegal.\n\n\"Governor Gaven NewScum had totally lost control of the situation,\" Trump wrote Thursday, mocking the governor. \"He should be saying THANK YOU for saving his ass, instead of trying to justify his mistakes and incompetence!!!\"\n\nNewsom shrugged off the recurring \"NewScum\" reference, telling \"The Daily\" it was \"what I think a seventh grader used to call me.\"\n\nHundreds arrested in LA protests as Hegseth hints at more deployments: Updates\n\nMarine share photos of training on Instagram\n\nThe U.S. Marines deploying to Los Angeles are sharing photos of their training on Instagram.\n\nPhotos shared on the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment’s page 2ndbn7thmarhistory show Marines training with riot shields and wearing what appear to be baseball catcher’s leg guards.\n\n“U.S. Marines with 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, attached to Task Force 51, rehearse non-lethal tactics in Los Angeles, June 11, 2025,” the caption reads. “U.S. Northern Command is supporting federal agencies by providing military forces to protect federal functions, personnel, and property in the greater Los Angeles area.”\n\nNorthern Command which directs the Marines said in an update Thursday that the troops \"are conducting mission orientation and familiarization today.\"\n\nTrump vows to protect farm, hotel workers in raids\n\nTrump said he plans to make changes to his administration's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration to protect migrant farmers, hotel workers and others in the leisure industry who have been among those deported. Trump promised the changes in a Truth Social post that acknowledged ICE officers have not only targeted violent criminals, who Trump officials have said are the primary focus of raids and deportations.\n\n\"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" Trump wrote on the social media platform he owns.

A similar situation unfolded in Tucson, Arizona, where law enforcement deployed tear gas and took several protesters into custody.\n\nThis week, hundreds of people have been arrested during protests across the country, including in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Las Vegas, New York, Chicago, and Austin, Texas.\n\nTucson protest sees multiple arrests, tear gas\n\nIn Tucson, Arizona, a group of about 300 protesters marched to the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, where the rally grew tense and erupted into clashes and arrests on June 11.\n\nSome of the protesters threw paint balls and water bottles at the office’s security guards, who responded with flash bangs and pepper spray. Soon after, protesters blocked a nearby road, onlookers said. Police in riot gear arrived to disperse them and three people were taken into custody.\n\nChristina Benitez, a local teacher and Mexican American, was at the protest with her friend. They held signs reading “ICE out of our city” and “Defend the Constitution.\"\n\n“There is no excuse to quash the public with ICE and the Marines and the National Guard,” she told the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network. “That is contrary to everything our nation was founded upon, the right of assembly.”\n\n– Sarah Lapidus, Arizona Republic\n\nProtesters in Detroit rally against immigration enforcement\n\nA small but vocal group of demonstrators rallied Wednesday, June 11, outside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office in Detroit to oppose ongoing immigration raids and deportations.\n\nAccording to activists, five or six individuals – most of them believed to be Venezuelan – were detained after their immigration cases were dismissed in court.\n\n\"That's happening more and more. Regardless of the outcome, people have been snatched up straight out of court – and we've known people that this has happened to,\" Kate Stenvig, a local organizer, told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nNicole Conaway, a Detroit resident and local activist, believes what’s at stake goes beyond immigration policy. “If Trump can win this battle, then we're further down the road to fascism and him being a dictator,” she said.\n\n– Nour Rahal, Detroit Free Press\n\nSpokane mayor declared state of emergency amid anti-ICE protest\n\nPolice in Spokane, Washington, arrested more than 30 people and the mayor issued a state of emergency after a protest against immigration enforcement on June 11 escalated.\n\nThe protest formed after organizers heard two Venezuelan men were detained at a local U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, where one of them was slated to a check-in after he had applied for asylum, reported KREM2.\n\nProtesters tried to block the truck that was supposedly meant to take the men to an ICE facility in Tacoma, local outlets reported. The crowd outside the ICE field office began to swell and local law enforcement declared it an unlawful assembly. Officers deployed tear gas and fired pepper balls into the crowd before it dispersed.\n\nSpokane Mayor Lisa Brown declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew for a section of the downtown area from 9:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. At a news conference, Kevin Hall, chief of the Spokane Police Department, said over 30 protesters were arrested.\n\nAnti-ICE protesters rally outside NBA Finals game\n\nThe roar of cheers and chants could be heard outside Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis just before Game 3 of the NBA Finals, but it wasn't the sound of basketball fans. It was people gathered to protest ICE raids in Indiana.\n\nThe crowd swelled to more than a thousand people before it broke up, organizers said, although Indianapolis police put the count at around 500. The protest was prompted by rumors online that ICE raids had taken place in the nearby city of Lawrence. Local police said it wasn't aware of any U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions there.\n\nThe demonstration remained nonviolent, and one speaker reminded demonstrators not to antagonize the police. Protesters held signs reading \"ICE out of Indy now\" and \"Power to the workers not the billionaires.\" Some basketball fans on their way to the game responded to the protesters with chants of \"USA.\"\n\nResident Jaqueline Montez, 30, said it was important to her to protest now rather than wait for planned \"No Kings Day\" protests downtown and nationwide on June 14. “We’re being seen by the rest of the world,” Montez told the Indianapolis Star, part of the USA TODAY Network. “We’re being noticed today.”\n\n– Jade Jackson, Noe Padilla, and Matthew Cupelli, Indianapolis Star\n\nNewsom takes shot at defense secretary on social media\n\nNewsom posted a photo on X of National Guard troops sleeping on the floor and another image, posted by the official Defense Department's Rapid Response account, of a baseball game.\n\n\"Pete sent 4,700 troops here (when they weren’t needed) without adequate fuel, food, water or a place to sleep. But don’t worry, he’s at a baseball game,\" Newsom wrote.\n\nRapid Response quickly responded on X, posting a photo of a protester waving a Mexican flag as a fire burns. The post says: \"Weren't needed.\"\n\nThe military's Northern Command said in a statement Wednesday that the military has contracted for billeting, latrines, showers, food and laundry services and other items and services for the troops. The statement added that \"while awaiting fulfillment of the contract, soldiers and Marines have adequate shelter, food, and water.\"\n\nSome former military leaders siding with Newsom\n\nFormer secretaries of the Army and Navy, three retired admirals and two retired generals banded together to file an amicus brief in the Trump-Newsom litigation citing what they describe as \"critical national security risks\" inherent in Trump's deployment of military forces in Los Angeles.\n\nAmicus briefs are filed by people or organizations not directly involved in litigation but who take a position in the case. The group includes former Army Secretary Louis Caldera, a Democrat, and former Navy Secretary Sean O’Keefe, a Republican.\n\nThe brief says deploying the military for domestic law enforcement diverts them from their primary mission of national security and disaster response, that National Guard personnel and active duty Marines are not properly trained for such law enforcement operations, and that such a use of the military should be a \"last resort to avoid the politicization of the military, which inevitably erodes public trust, impacts recruitment, and undermines troop morale.\"\n\n'He's lost it': Newsom slams Trump's mental acuity, echoing president's criticism of Biden\n\nPolice say protesters throw fireworks, rocks at officers\n\nA one-square-mile of downtown Los Angeles remained under a curfew Thursday after days of demonstrations led to hundreds of arrests. The unrest continued Wednesday night, when police said demonstrators at one location threw \"commercial-grade fireworks and rocks\" at officers, resulting in a number of arrests.\n\nThe protests broke out on June 6 in response to ongoing ICE raids that have sparked fear among immigrant communities. While many protests have been relatively peaceful, some have turned into scenes of chaos as police fired \"less lethal\" munitions such as tear gas and flash-bangs to disperse crowds.\n\nWalz, Hochul, Pritzker to criticize immigration enforcement in House hearing\n\nHundreds of protests planned for June 14\n\nProtests are planned for 1,800 communities across the country on June 14, the same day Trump holds a military parade in Washington, D.C. For decades, the GOP has claimed most of the symbols of patriotism, including the American flag, but the people protesting Trump, a Republican, say they are the true patriots now.\n\nThe rallies, named \"No Kings Day\" to oppose what they see as Trump's power grab, are expected to be the largest and most numerous protests since Trump's second term began, dwarfing the Hands Off protests in early April that drew as many as 1 million Americans to the streets at more than 1,000 rallies.\n\nNo Kings Day was organized by grassroots groups in cities and towns of all sizes to coincide with the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary celebration, which is also Trump’s 79th birthday and Flag Day.

For the latest news on protests across the country, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Thursday, June 12.\n\nLOS ANGELES − Two people have been charged with throwing firebombs during five days of protests that have rocked a downtown section of the city and prompted President Trump' controversial decision to send 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines here, authorities said Wednesday.\n\nA federal complaint charges Emiliano Gardno Galvez, 23, of Paramount and Wrackkie Quiogue, 27, of Long Beach, with possession of an unregistered destructive device, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at least nine people face federal charges related to the demonstrations.\n\nThe protests have been prompted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps spurred by President Trump's directive to find immigrants living in the United States without legal status.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said it has arrested over 385 people since the protests began, including over 200 people after a curfew was imposed Tuesday night.\n\nProtests against immigration raids and in support of demonstrators in Los Angeles have spread from coast-to-coast. Dozens of people were arrested in protests Tuesday night in cities including New York, Denver, Philadelphia and San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott deployed the National Guard.\n\nCurfew enacted for parts of LA; Newsom says Trump chose 'theatrics over public safety'\n\nMarines expected to deploy within 48 hours\n\nThe 700 active-duty Marines sent to Los Angeles are expected to deploy within 48 hours, according to U.S. Northern Command.\n\nOfficials at Northern Command say that the Marines had completed their training for their mission in California and “will be employed seamlessly alongside the National Guard forces.”\n\n“Their activation and inclusion in the task force was intended to provide adequate numbers of forces to provide continuous coverage of the area in support of the Lead Federal Agency,” said officials, referring to the Department of Homeland Security which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nNational Guard commander Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman said earlier on Wednesday that his troops would be following federal agents: “They’re in the lead. We’re supporting them. It’s really about protecting federal facilities and federal personnel as they do their job.”\n\nMarines being deployed were trained in crowd control, de-escalation techniques and in proper use of force, according to Northern Command.\n\nThe additional troops will join 2,100 National Guard members already on the ground, officials said.\n\nHomeland Security seeks weapons, drones for LA immigration crackdown\n\nWASHINGTON —The Department of Homeland Security has asked the Pentagon for help in transporting weapons from Fort Benning in Georgia and another site in Wyoming to Los Angeles, where its immigration crackdown has become increasingly militarized.\n\nThe request from Homeland Security, confirmed by a Defense official, also seeks “drone surveillance support,” direction to troops on detaining or arresting “lawbreakers,” and graduates from an organization like the Marines’ School of Advanced Warfighting School for setting up a joint operation center.\n\nIt's unclear what type of weapons Homeland Security officials are seeking for their immigration crackdown in California. Also unclear: who would use them and who they would be used against.\n\nPentagon officials are reviewing the request, according to the official who was not authorized to speak publicly.

Tabitha Lee said 500 troops had been trained to accompany ICE agents.\n\n“This is stuff that we do not do, and this is working with federal law enforcement,” Sherman said. “They’re in the lead. We’re supporting them. It’s really about protecting federal facilities and federal personnel as they do their job.”\n\nSherman’s confirmation of the National Guard’s role comes as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Congress that the deployment of troops could expand beyond Los Angeles.\n\nEarly federal charges announced following LA protests\n\nGalvez is accused of hiding behind a fence and throwing the device at a sheriff’s deputy on Saturday, June 7, in Paramount, Essayli said. He is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico and has been previously deported, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.\n\nICE officers arrested him on a charge of attempted murder in the attack.\n\nQuiogue is charged with throwing a Molotov cocktail during the protest on June 8, Essayli said.\n\nMore charges are expected, Essayli said at a briefing Wednesday.\n\n“We are looking at hundreds of people. ... We’re going to take our time, we’re going to identify people,” he said. “We’re coming after all these people. So let’s be clear: This is the beginning, not the end.”\n\nOver 30 California mayors, city leaders call for ICE sweeps to end\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, joined by over 30 city leaders from across Southern California, called on the Trump administration to end the immigration sweeps that led to the recent volatile protests in Los Angeles and other cities nationwide.\n\n“All of us represent cities in this region where immigrants are key,” Bass said. “To have people live in fear like it is today is just unacceptable.”\n\nShe said the Trump administration is conducting a “national experiment to determine how far the federal government can go in reaching in and taking over power from a governor (and) power from a local jurisdiction.”\n\nBass also accused the administration of intentionally inciting fear through its raids and deployment of National Guard troops and Marines. “When you raid Home Depots and workplaces, when you tear parents and children apart, and when you run armored caravans through our streets, you’re not trying to keep anyone safe, you’re trying to cause fear and panic,” Bass said.\n\nLos Angeles families fear ICE raids at school graduation ceremonies\n\nMany Angeleno immigrants are foregoing the chance to witness their young loved ones receive diplomas or advance to the next grade at upcoming school graduation ceremonies out of fear of getting deported.\n\n\"I’ve spoken with parents who’ve told me that their daughter would be the first in their family to graduate high school and they’re not going to be there to witness it, because they have a fear of the place of graduation being targeted,” said Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, which covers the majority of the city and some surrounding areas of Los Angeles and serves more than a half of a million public school students, during a June 9 news conference. More than one-third of Angelenos are immigrants.\n\nTheir absence amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown is felt around Los Angeles.\n\nAt a June 10 commencement ceremony on the Westside, Palms Middle School Principal Arturo Enriquez told the public school families that community members were stationed outside of the campus \"ready to call me\" if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials showed up.\n\n\"We are a melting pot of beautiful, incredible people,\" Enriquez said to the crowd before wiping a tear from his eye. \"This incredible community, all of these students, all of these parents, guardians, friends and family, it is because of you that these young people are here ready to go on to that next step – to that high school life, to represent each of us as an incredible member of society.\"\n\nRead more about how students and families are being impacted here.\n\n-Kayla Jimenez\n\nSan Francisco protest at immigration court leads to arrests\n\nLos Angeles is not the only major city in California that has been the site of fiery protests in recent days.\n\nIn San Francisco, law enforcement arrested at least four people during a protest June 10 outside the city’s immigration court, a local NBC station reported. These arrests come after the city’s police force arrested more than 150 during a demonstration that turned violent on Sunday.\n\nOther protests have occurred in nearby Oakland.\n\nLAPD: Over 200 people arrested after curfew\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said it arrested 225 people on Tuesday night after Mayor Karen Bass’ curfew went into effect.\n\nMost of the arrests – approximately 203 – were on failure to disperse charges, while others involved curfew violations, possession of a firearm and assault on a police officer, according to a statement from the department.\n\nOfficers used non-lethal munitions to disperse the crowd and two officers were injured and received medical treatment, the department said. These arrests follow more than 160 arrests the department made during protests over the weekend and on Monday night.\n\nHegseth says deployments could expand beyond California\n\nThe federal government's deployment of National Guard troops could expand beyond Los Angeles, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at a congressional hearing Wednesday in Washington.\n\n“Part of it is getting ahead of a problem, so that if in other places, if there are other riots in places where law enforcement officers are threatened, we would have the capability to surge the national guard there if necessary,” Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth also took a shot at California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has filed suit against the Trump administration for sending in the National Guard, a move Newsom adamantly opposes.\n\n“Thankfully, in most of those states you have a governor that recognizes the need for it, supports it, mobilizes it for himself or herself,” Hegseth said. “In California, unfortunately, the governor wants to play politics with it.”\n\nNational Guard major general clarifies military role in LA\n\nNational Guard troops and Marines deployed to quell unrest in Los Angeles will not conduct arrests, but they might detain demonstrators temporarily while waiting law enforcement to arrive at the scene, National Guard Major General Scott Sherman said at a briefing Wednesday.\n\n“It’s really about protecting federal facilities and federal personnel as they do their job,” Sherman said.\n\nThe 4,000 National Guard and 700 Marines deployed by Trump are receiving two days of training on civil unrest that includes crowd control and protection of property, Sherman said. There are currently 2,000 Guard members on duty “performing operations,” he said. Another 2,000 are assembling, or “mustering,” and will be ready to begin their training Thursday, Sherman said.\n\nThe 700 Marines are at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach, but Sherman said he couldn’t say when they would be seen on the streets.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott orders National Guard to immigration protests\n\nWhite House: 'America voted for deportations'\n\nThe LAPD on Wednesday urged businesses and residents to document and report damage and vandalism as authorities braced for a sixth day of demonstrations. They have been prompted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps spurred by President Trump's directive to find immigrants living in the United States without legal status.\n\n\"The Trump administration told us they were going after violent criminals, gang members, and drug dealers,\" Mayor Karen Bass said in a social media post Wednesday. \"But they went after (day laborers outside) Home Depot. They’re going after families and children. That does not make Los Angeles more safe.\"\n\nThe White House was unyielding. Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, framed the political clash as an attempt to nullify the 2024 election.\n\n\"America voted for mass deportations,\" Miller wrote on social media. \"Violent insurrectionists, and the politicians who enable them, are trying to overthrow the results of the election.\"\n\nProtests planned across the nation on June 14\n\nAfter protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles sparked a mass military response, similar demonstrations erupted in other cities around the nation. From major metros like New York City and Chicago to smaller areas like Columbus, Ohio, and Des Moines, Iowa, here's a look at demonstrations nationwide.\n\nProtests against immigration and other Trump policies are planned in at least 1,500 communities across the country on June 14, the same day President Donald Trump holds a military parade in Washington and celebrates his birthday.\n\nThe rallies, named \"No Kings Day,\" are expected to be the largest and most widespread protests since Trump took office. Organizers say a core principle of the protests will be \"a commitment to nonviolent action\" and discouraged participants from bringing weapons to the events.\n\n\"We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events,\" organizers say on the nokings.org website.\n\n'No Kings Day' protests planned for June 14 with aim to reclaim the American flag\n\nTexas to deploy National Guard ahead of protests\n\nTexas is following President Donald Trump's lead, and will deploy the National Guard in preparation for protests planned for June 14 as demonstrations against immigration raids spread throughout the country. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican and ally of Trump, said he would send the Guard members to locations across the state to \"ensure peace & order.\"\n\nAbbott's decision comes after protesters in Austin clashed with police June 9.\n\n\"Peaceful protest is legal. Harming a person or property is illegal & will lead to arrest,\" he said in a post to X. \"@TexasGuard will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order.\"\n\nThe situation is markedly different from California, where the governor has opposed the use of the Guard.\n\nSan Antonio mayor says he was unaware of troop deployment\n\nSan Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg, a Democrat, told reporters he did not request the Texas National Guard and said he did not receive advanced warning about Gov. Greg Abbott’s deployment of troops to the city ahead of planned protests.\n\nNirenberg’s comments at a news conference came after Abbott announced he will deploy members of the state’s National Guard across Texas. Nirenberg and San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said they did not know how many troops would be deployed to the city.\n\n“I don’t have any information about the numbers or what they’re going to do,” McManus said.\n\nNirenberg urged protesters to exercise their right to free speech but told them to “keep it lawful and peaceful,” adding, “I am confident that San Antonio knows how to do this right.”\n\nViolence, curfew involve small area of vast city\n\nIn Los Angeles, Bass has declared a partial curfew effective daily from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time, part of the city's strategy to quell ongoing looting and vandalism linked to the protests. The curfew covers one square mile of a city sprawling across a land area one-third the size of Rhode Island. The larger Los Angeles metro area covers an area nearly the size of Maine.\n\nShortly after the curfew went into effect Tuesday, the Los Angeles Police Department announced that multiple groups had congregated in an area not far from City Hall and federal buildings where some detained immigrants have been held.\n\n\"Those groups are being addressed and mass arrests are being initiated,\" the LAPD said. \"Curfew is in effect.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump vents on Truth Social\n\nTrump called the protests “violent, insurrectionist mobs” and “lawless riots” and ordered 4,000 National Guard Troops and 700 Marines into the city. But Gov. Gavin Newsom said it was Trump who “instigated violence.”\n\nIn a public address Tuesday night, California Gov. Gavin Newsom condemned Trump's deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and about 700 Marines, a move that state and local officials have called unnecessary, illegal, and politically motivated. Trump, according to Newsom, was not \"protecting our communities, he’s traumatizing our communities.\"\n\nTrump fired back Wednesday on social media: \"The INCOMPETENT Governor of California was unable to provide protection in a timely manner when our Ice Officers, GREAT Patriots they are, were attacked by an out of control mob of agitators, troublemakers, and/or insurrectionists. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nNew York, Chicago, Atlanta among cities with protests\n\nIn New York City, hundreds rallied near the city’s main immigration court on June 10. Tensions eventually flared and 86 people were taken into custody, with 34 people being charged and 52 issued criminal court summonses, according to the New York Police Department.\n\nIn Colorado, a demonstration at the state capitol drew hundreds of protesters who marched peacefully through the downtown area, CRP News reported. Tensions escalated between a group that splintered off from the main demonstration and law enforcement, leading to at least 17 arrests on charges including obstructing streets and assault.\n\nIn Philadelphia, more than 150 protesters gathered at the Federal Detention Center in the City Center area, local media outlets reported. The Philadelphia Police Department said protesters at one point ignored demands to disperse and grew increasingly unruly, leading to more than a dozen arrests and several injuries.\n\nNot all rallies were marred by arrests and clashes between police and demonstrators. In Ohio, between 200 to 300 people protested ICE raids in downtown Columbus, crossing in front of the local police headquarters and city hall without incident.\n\nNational Guard troops aid immigration raids\n\nReuters reported that about 2,100 National Guard troops were in the greater Los Angeles area on Tuesday, with more on the way. Meanwhile, hundreds of Marines were in a staging area near the city, awaiting deployment to specific locations, according to Reuters.\n\nThough few of those troops were actually on the streets, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement posted photos on X showing Guard troops accompanying ICE officers on an immigration raid. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted the photos, saying: \"This We’ll Defend.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has vowed to redouble immigration enforcement raids in response to the protests, which have expanded to other U.S. cities, including Chicago, New York, and Atlanta.\n\nCalifornia sued Trump and the Department of Defense on Monday, seeking to block the deployment of federal troops. Newsom has also accused Trump and Hegseth of trying to use the assets to help ICE conduct raids. A judge has set a hearing for the matter for Thursday.\n\nGavin Newsom speech last night\n\nCalifornia leaders and the Trump administration remained in a tense standoff as Newsom accused the president of \"pulling a military dragnet all across Los Angeles, well beyond his stated intent to just go after violent and serious criminals.\"\n\nThe Democratic governor has said in recent days that Trump acted like a \"dictator\" by deploying federal troops without his consent, and compared the administration to authoritarian regimes for targeting vulnerable people. Newsom reiterated Tuesday that Trump \"chose escalation.\"\n\nTrump's \"agents are arresting dishwashers, gardeners, day laborers, and seamstresses. That's just weakness. Weakness masquerading as strength,\" Newsom said.\n\nTrump has called Newsom \"grossly incompetent\" and suggested the governor should be arrested. The president has also insisted that service members deployed to California are \"defending the republic itself\" and helping the administration \"liberate\" the city of Los Angeles.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said from the White House that he planned to respond to any protests, including against his June 14 military parade, with \"force.\"\n\nWere there riots in LA last night?\n\nProtests in Los Angeles were relatively peaceful when they began on Friday, but escalated into scenes of chaos, with electric vehicles lit aflame, large clouds of tear gas and clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators. Bass countered with the curfew, which she said she expects will last for several days.\n\nThe curfew does not apply to residents who live in the designated area, people experiencing homelessness, credentialed media, or public safety and emergency personnel, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell. The police chief noted that there has been an escalation of \"unlawful and dangerous behavior\" since Saturday.\n\nTrump has called the behavior \"riots.\"\n\nExperts say while there are legal definitions for a riot, the term has become increasingly politicized and encapsulates a wide variety of incidents. In most states including California, the key determinator lies in whether multiple people are involved and whether they are committing acts of violence, Brian Higgins, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said.\n\n\"One person is not a riot and neither is a group that is nonviolent,\" he said. \"They can even be breaking the law, like refusing to disperse. It's when you add in the factor of violence that it becomes a riot.\"\n\nThere are some gray areas, he said. Experts also said that while violence is a defining factor in a riot, such violence could be incited by law enforcement.

For them, picking up work at Home Depot is their only source of income, and some work as little as one day a week.\n\nWhile Valencia and other day laborers sought wages, other community members in Paramount and Compton, both in Los Angeles County about 90 miles from Victorville, are cautiously watching federal troops, bracing for more raids and trying to look to the future while looking out for each other. Some are still searching for detained family members. And others? Well, they've seen worse.\n\n\"We're a little nervous, but we're here looking for work to survive,\" said Valencia, who was born in the Tepito neighborhood of Mexico City. \"We need money to put food on the table and support our family.\"\n\nParamount, a community of small homes and strip malls selling everything from churros and empanadas to donuts, was once largely African American.\n\nNow, more than 80% of residents identify themselves as Hispanic.

Now he worries they'll be deported, forcing them to start life all over for the second time.\n\n\"It's tough,\" he said.\n\nDifferent perspectives on recent events\n\nThe ICE raids have sparked broad concern across Los Angeles, where 32% of its residents were born in another country. The city has long been home to immigrant communities from around the world, and many families have mixed status, with undocumented parents raising children born as American citizens.\n\nAnd while many residents and officials in Los Angeles have sought to tamp down reactions to the sometimes-violent protests, President Donald Trump and his administration have appeared to fan the flames, hurling insults in social media posts and encouraging an aggressive response to protests. Trump sent out an email June 9 to supporters asking for campaign donations to support his approach because things are \"looking really bad in LA,\" he said in an email to supporters.\n\nTrump ICE raids, deportation efforts: See the backlash and the administration's impact\n\nTrump and Gov. Gavin Newsom have continued their longtime feud, with the governor suing the federal government over Trump's decision to send in the National Guard, and Trump threatening to have Newsom arrested for interfering. Trump on June 9 deployed at least 500 U.S. Marines to back up the 4,000 National Guard troops.\n\nThe president pledged in a social media post to \"liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots. Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free.\"\n\nBut to many residents of Los Angeles and the communities that surround it, there's no invasion, no \"illegals\" and no freedom to be restored – the city was doing just fine until ICE began detaining people, USA TODAY found in a series of interviews.\n\nAmong those frustrated by the president's approach was 30-year LA resident Ira Long, 67, a retired teacher and pastor at the Alondra Church of Christ in Compton. Speaking while volunteers prepared to distribute oats, rice, tuna and canned tomatoes to community members, just as they do every Monday, Long said there's a palpable unease in the air.\n\nLong said he still remembers when the National Guard was called out in the wake of the 1992 Rodney King riots. This, he said, is far less significant.\n\n\"That was a really really terrible time. Right now I don't feel any of that tension or anxiety,\" said Long, a retired special education teacher. \"But people are uneasy and there's a real sense of loss because we have lost people (to federal immigration authorities) who were a part of this community.\"\n\n'This wasn't the first time and it won’t be the last'\n\nAmong those struggling was longtime Compton resident Isabel Ramirez, who said she is \"dying of sadness\" after multiple family members were detained on June 7. Waiting in line in a folding chair at the Alondra Church of Christ, Ramirez said her family was visiting from San Jose, but had left her house to buy gardening tools when they were detained by ICE.\n\n\"They took them away,\" Ramirez says. \"They’re all married and have children who were born in the U.S., but they don’t have papers.\"\n\nRamirez said she found out about the raids on TV and is anxiously awaiting word about her family's fate.\n\n\"We don't know where they are. We don't know where they took them. We're just waiting, still,\" Ramirez said, tearing up. \"Their poor kids, what's going to happen with them? What’s going to happen?

Wherever we go, we have our cellphones with us, just in case.\"\n\nJust down Alondra Boulevard, longtime donut shop owner Charlie Lim looked out at the handful of broken windows and widespread anti-ICE graffiti spraypainted on buildings and the street itself. On June 8, hundreds of community members clashed with authorities outside Lim's \"Dale's Donuts,\" and small piles of debris still sat in the intersection. Nearby, a law enforcement remote-monitoring station lay tipped on its side, smashed and spraypainted.\n\n'Unacceptable and inhumane': Latinas for Trump founder blasts immigration arrests\n\n\"I've seen worse,\" said Lim, who has owned the shop for 33 years. He said he started just after the King riots, when the border between Compton and Paramount was far more dangerous every night.\n\n\"They would rob you just for the fun of it,\" Lim said, recalling a time when drug dealers ran the streets.\n\nToday, he said, the city is far safer for businesses like his.\n\n\"This wasn't the first time and it won’t be the last time,\" he said, looking at the cracked window and spray paint.\n\n'We take care of people'\n\nOn June 9, community resident and retired teacher Jose \"Bear\" Gallegos, 61, kept watch on the deployed National Guard troops blocking the entrance to the Paramount Business Center, which Gallegos said is home to a small federal detention site.\n\nProtests broke out there when ICE agents tried to transfer detainees from that site to a larger facility in downtown Los Angeles, he said. Gallegos, who graduated from and later taught at the adjacent Manuel Dominguez High School, said the community was fine without ICE intruding.\n\n\"They're the ones snatching people who look just like me into unmarked vehicles,\" said Gallegos, after showing off a carton of spent tear gas canisters he collected from the street. \"They had a plan all along. They wanted a reaction from us.\"\n\nGallegos said he felt compelled to join the protest and calm unrest among his former students, and said that while there were a small number of agitators who clearly wanted to battle with law enforcement, the vast majority simply wanted to stop ICE.\n\n\"We don't have guns. All we have is prayers and feathers,\" he said. \"And there are going to be some young people who are going to be mad, rightfully so. We love L.A. We take care of people.

Waiting in line in a folding chair at the Alondra Church of Christ, Ramirez said her family was visiting from San Jose and had left her house to buy gardening tools when ICE detained them.\n\n\"They took them away,\" Ramirez says. \"They’re all married and have children who were born in the U.S., but they don't have papers.\"\n\nRamirez said she found out about the raids on TV and is anxiously awaiting word about her family's fate.\n\n\"We don't know where they are. We don't know where they took them. We're just waiting, still,\" Ramirez said, tearing up. \"Their poor kids, what's going to happen with them? What’s going to happen? We're sad, we're praying to the Virgin Mary that this gets resolved. Wherever we go, we have our cell phones with us, just in case.\"\n\nJust down Alondra Boulevard, longtime doughnut shop owner Charlie Lim looked out at the handful of broken windows and widespread anti-ICE graffiti spray-painted on buildings and the street itself. On June 8, hundreds of community members clashed with authorities outside Lim's \"Dale's Donuts,\" and small piles of debris still sat in the intersection. Nearby, a law enforcement remote-monitoring station lay tipped on its side, smashed and spray-painted.\n\n\"I've seen worse,\" said Lim, who has owned the shop for 33 years. He said he started just after the King riots, when the border between Compton and Paramount was far more dangerous every night.\n\n\"They would rob you just for the fun of it,\" Lim said, recalling a time when drug dealers ran the streets.\n\nToday, he said, the city is far safer for businesses like his. \"This wasn't the first time and it won’t be the last time,\" he said, looking at the cracked window and spray paint.\n\n'Unacceptable and inhumane': Latinas for Trump founder blasts immigration arrests\n\n'We take care of people'\n\nOn June 9, community resident and retired teacher Jose \"Bear\" Gallegos, 61, kept watch on the National Guard troops blocking the entrance to the Paramount Business Center, which Gallegos said is home to a small federal detention site.\n\nProtests broke out there when ICE agents tried to transfer detainees from that site to a larger facility in downtown Los Angeles, he said. Gallegos, who graduated from and later taught at the adjacent Manuel Dominguez High School, said the community was fine without ICE intruding.\n\n\"They're the ones snatching people who look just like me into unmarked vehicles,\" Gallegos said after showing off a carton of spent tear gas canisters he collected from the street. \"They had a plan all along. They wanted a reaction from us.\"\n\nGallegos said he felt compelled to join the protest and calm unrest among his former students. He said that while there was a small number of agitators who clearly wanted to battle law enforcement, the vast majority simply wanted to stop ICE.\n\n\"We don't have guns. All we have is prayers and feathers,\" he said. \"And there are going to be some young people who are going to be mad, rightfully so. We love LA. We take care of people. But you can't blame young people when they've had enough. And they've had enough.\"\n\nAt the Home Depot, Valencia shifted in his plastic lawn chair and considered his options. He said he’s resigned to being deported if ICE catches him, but finding work remained his top priority.\n\nValencia and the group of men, whom he said are \"like brothers,\" immigrated from Mexico and Nicaragua. Some arrived as recently as three years ago, although Valencia has been living in the United States for more than 30 years. Valencia said they have been unable to afford attorneys to help them become legal residents.\n\n\"We're not criminals. We're not thieves,\" he said. \"We’re just looking for jobs.\"\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/09/trump-arrest-california-governor-newsom/84116920007/", "title": "Donald Trump says he'd arrest California Gov.

Gavin Newsom.\n\n“I would do it … I think it would be a great thing,” Trump said June 9 when asked if Homan should arrest the governor, who has challenged the administration’s mobilization of National Guard troops to crack down on violent protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles. The president also attacked Newsom as \"grossly incompetent.\"\n\nNewsom was aghast: \"The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor.

The act allows the president to use military force to suppress rebellion or revolt against the federal government.\n\nTrump hasn't invoked the Insurrection Act amid the Los Angeles unrest. His proclamation federalizing the Guard troops, though, isn't restricted to California and says guardsmen will \"protect\" ICE and other Department of Homeland Security personnel.\n\nIn May, DHS separately requested the activation of 20,000 National Guard members to support immigration enforcement under state-controlled legal authorities that permit direct law enforcement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/09"}]}

They’re celebrated philanthropists and patrons of the arts.\n\nBut there’s something else these donors share that other well-heeled benefactors do not: Deep financial ties to Russia.\n\nWhile there is nothing new about the reputation laundering of the oligarch class, it is facing renewed scrutiny in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The recent renaming of the “Russian Lounge” at Washington’s John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts underscores the sensitivity surrounding such relationships.\n\nVladimir Potanin acquired his “philanthropic leadership” at the Kennedy Center – where his name is inscribed on the polished marble walls along with General Motors, Boeing and Capital One – with a $5 million donation in 2011.\n\nPotanin – Russia’s wealthiest businessman who plays hockey with Putin and has so far dodged Western sanctions – made his fortune devising a system for Russian business leaders to loan money to the cash-strapped administration of then-president Boris Yeltsin in the mid-’90s. When Russia could not repay the loans, the businessmen were allowed to buy key state assets for pennies on the dollar. At the time, Potanin and his business partner bought 38% of the mining and metal company Norilsk for $170.1 million, a stake that would be worth nearly $20 billion 15 years later.\n\nAround the time of the Kennedy Center donation, he said that he hoped it would “present an image of contemporary Russia to the American audience, stepping beyond the clichés about our country.”\n\nBut contributions like this appear to serve another purpose.\n\nIt is “the classic example of essentially trying to buy a better reputation … to distract from the fact that you’re still very much tied to an authoritarian regime,” said Jordan Gans-Morse, professor of corruption in the post-Soviet era at Northwestern University.\n\nAn old American playbook\n\nPotanin, who was identified by the US Treasury Department in 2018 as one of nearly a hundred influential Russian billionaires with close ties to the Kremlin, isn’t the first or only oligarch to use his wealth to attempt to sway the opinion of Western elite. In fact, it’s a page straight out of an old American playbook.\n\nNineteenth century robber barons famously splashed their names across orchestra halls and museums to shed their reputations as ethically dubious industrialists who amassed enormous wealth on the backs of America’s most vulnerable. It worked: When most Americans hear the name Andrew Carnegie, they probably think of Carnegie Hall or Carnegie Mellon and not one of the deadliest labor confrontations in American history, which occurred at one of his steel plants in 1892.\n\nA more recent example is the way the Sackler family behind Purdue Pharma reportedly donated tens of millions of dollars in what critics say was an effort to obscure the deadly legacy of its blockbuster drug OxyContin. Prestigious Western cultural institutions, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Louvre in Paris, have had to reckon with donations from the Sackler family in the aftermath of the opioid crisis. The National Portrait Gallery in London turned down a $1.3 million donation from the family in 2019 and others have also pledged not to take Sackler money in the future.\n\nA sign welcomes visitors to the Sackler Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2019. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nIn much the same way, Putin’s inner circle – many of whom are oligarchs who have profited off corruption and made their wealth in illicit ways – use philanthropy in the West to launder their reputations and gain access to American and European high society, according to experts.\n\nDartmouth sociology professor Brooke Harrington said oligarchs of any nationality typically target three kinds of institutions with their donations – cultural, political, and educational.\n\nWhile most universities are required to disclose gifts and contracts with foreign actors exceeding $250,000 a year under federal law, a 2020 report by the Department of Education found widespread noncompliance. Yale, the report states, “underreported its foreign gifts and contracts by $375 million.” Harvard, in turn, “appears to possess inadequate institutional controls over its foreign donations and contracts,” the report found. Yale acknowledged the issue at the time saying the university failed to submit reports between 2014 and 2017, but had since corrected this. Harvard said it had identified “a wider range of contracts” and updated its reports accordingly.\n\nSeven Russian billionaires donated hundreds of millions of dollars to American universities, charities, museums and foundations just since 2009, according to an analysis from the Anti-Corruption Data Collective and CNN reporting.\n\nSome experts say cultural and educational institutions can do more to prevent the reputation laundering of their donors.\n\nRespected institutions have a responsibility not to glorify those who built their wealth through illicit trade, said Louise Shelley, a public policy professor at George Mason University.\n\nNow, some cultural centers and universities are grappling with what to do with oligarchs’ donations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside the American steel mill tied to a Russian oligarch 05:19 - Source: CNN Inside the American steel mill tied to a Russian oligarch 05:19\n\n“If they can co-opt the thought leaders, as well as the political leaders, as well the cultural leaders – it becomes much harder to stop whatever it is that Putin wants to do,” Harrington, the Dartmouth professor, said.\n\nViktor Vekselberg’s partnership with MIT: “It is just absolutely wild”\n\nA decade ago, Putin wanted to stop the brain-drain of scientists and engineers to the West and cultivate home-grown tech at a $3 billion Moscow-based innovation center.\n\nAt the time, Washington and Moscow were attempting a closer relationship and the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology provided the perfect combination of knowledge, credibility and reputation for the Russian project.\n\nThe Skolkovo Foundation – led by one of Putin’s close allies Viktor Vekselberg – entered into a partnership with MIT in 2011 to build the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, or “Skoltech,” outside of Moscow.\n\nKeith Stevenson, Skoltech’s provost, told CNN in an interview that the main premise of the relationship was to develop “academic excellence and research that could be contributing to the growth of the economy around the world.”\n\nVekselberg, like many other oligarchs, made his money during the privatization of Russia’s natural resources, specifically oil and metals, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe collaboration with Skolkovo provided MIT with over $300 million, half of which was earmarked to develop Skoltech’s curriculum and the other half to use “for its own development,” according to Boston’s WGBH News.\n\nAt the start, Russia was “an ally,” MIT professor and former President of the Skolkovo Institute Edward Crawley told WGBH News, and said the relationship was similar to one the university would have with any other foreign institution.\n\nHowever, Vekselberg and Skolkovo quickly caught the attention of federal investigators.\n\nA few months after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, Boston’s local FBI office published an unusual warning:\n\n“The [Skolkovo] foundation may be a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research development facilities and dual-use technologies with military and commercial application,” the assistant special agent in charge wrote.\n\n“This type of activity does not go on at Skoltech,” said Stevenson, claiming the FBI was “talking to people that had really no true understanding of who was initiating the project.”\n\nMIT, too, was quick to dismiss the concerns and even renewed Vekselberg’s appointment to its Board of Trustees in 2015.\n\nViktor Vekselberg attends a meeting at the G20 Summit in 2013 in St. Petersburg, Russia. Handout/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nVekselberg made at least four donations to the university between 2015 and 2017, according to the Anti-Corruption Data Collective, and had a scholarship named after him.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, MIT confirmed Vekselberg has not donated to the university since 2017.\n\nInvolving Vekselberg to build the “innovation ecosystem” at Skoltech was “perfectly logical,” Stevenson said. “He’s a very well-experienced, internationally-known businessman.”\n\nStevenson added he could not comment on Vekselberg’s relationship with the Kremlin but said that, at Skoltech, his involvement “has been completely on a professional level to help build innovation.”\n\nVekselberg did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nCasey Michel, an expert on kleptocracies and illicit finance and author of a book on foreign investments in the US, sees it differently.\n\n“It is just absolutely wild how one of the most notorious oligarchs to emerge from Russia was able to obtain a seat on the actual board of one of the most prestigious universities in the United States of America,” Michel said.\n\nMIT scrubbed its website of Vekselberg’s name and removed him from its board only after he was sanctioned by the US in 2018 for benefitting from Putin’s regime. The US Treasury Department said he played “a key role in advancing Russia’s malign activities” – including the occupation of Crimea, supplying weapons to the Assad regime, attempting to subvert Western democracies and malicious cyber activities.\n\nIt did not, however, end its partnership with Skolkovo.\n\nEven a federal investigation into the financial relationship between MIT and Skolkovo didn’t stop the leading research center from renewing its collaboration with the Russians in 2019. That was just months after MIT’s Media Lab was forced to publicly apologize for its American dirty donor Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of running an underage sex trafficking ring before he committed suicide in August 2019.\n\nIn April 2019, MIT announced an enhanced vetting process for accepting donations. In a statement to CNN earlier this month, MIT said its review process “examines risks related to national security, protection of intellectual property, compliance with federal laws, data security and access, and other relevant issues while seeking to support the free and open pursuit of knowledge.”\n\nTwo months ago, after the invasion of Ukraine, MIT finally severed ties with the Russian foundation saying “this step is a rejection of the actions of the Russian government in Ukraine. We take it with deep regret because of our great respect for the Russian people and our profound appreciation for the contributions of the many extraordinary Russian colleagues we have worked with.”\n\nMIT President L. Rafael Reif said the termination of the relationship with Skoltech “comes with considerable sadness, but the actions of the Russian government made our choice clear… This does not diminish our pride in the work we did to develop Skoltech and in the first-rate research that has flowed from the relationship.”\n\nHarrington, the Dartmouth professor, said that when considering donations, institutions must remember who they are supposed to serve.\n\n“It’s the obligation of these institutions to ask themselves: does it serve the public good?” Harrington said. “Do they exist to do reputation laundering and facilitate the agenda of what is obviously now an enemy state?”\n\nWhat’s more, Michel argues that universities, especially elite institutions like MIT, have extensive resources in-house to determine where big donors’ money comes from.\n\n“They have to understand themselves as having those resources to be able to actually examine and understand what the implications of these donations, these open doors of access, may be,” Michel said.\n\n“It is incumbent upon them,” he added, “to understand the source of this wealth.”\n\nA Soviet-born billionaire was knighted, but his donations still raise eyebrows\n\nPerhaps the most prodigious example of Russian reputation laundering is that of Len Blavatnik. The Ukrainian-born billionaire made his money during the privatization of state-owned commodities like aluminum and oil following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nBlavatnik, who holds both British and US citizenship, was awarded knighthood in the UK for his philanthropy and has rubbed elbows with some of Hollywood’s most famous – and infamous – people, including Harvey Weinstein, with whom he used to host a luncheon on his yacht during the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nLen Blavatnik and Harvey Weinstein attend a private dinner in Moscow on June 11, 2015. Victor Boyko/Getty Images\n\nBlavatnik has repeatedly denied having connections to the Kremlin. “Mr. Blavatnik is not Russian. He’s an American citizen, and has been for almost 40 years, (he) was born in Ukraine. He has no involvement in Russian politics or in the Russian government,” a spokesperson for his company Access Industries said in a statement provided to CNN.\n\nHowever, Blavatnik is close to Vekselberg. Three years ago, Vekselberg – Blavatnik’s college friend and business partner who was sanctioned by the US back in 2018 – told the Financial Times: “All his main money, he made here in Russia, with me.”\n\nBlavatnik and Vekselberg owned major stakes in Russia’s largest aluminum company, Rusal.\n\n“That is the most corrupt industry in one of the most corrupt countries in the world. You can’t disentangle the sources of this wealth from the initial sources of the corruption,” said Michel.\n\n“You cannot have made that money without specific political connections or connections to organized crime or connections to other oligarchic figures,” he added.\n\nAs a result, Blavatnik’s donations and ties to oligarchs have raised eyebrows in the past.\n\nWhen Oxford University accepted more than $100 million from Blavatnik in 2010 to establish the Blavatnik School of Government, critics, in a letter published in the Guardian, insisted the school “stop selling its reputation and prestige to Putin’s associates.”\n\nFollowing the invasion of Ukraine, the university said its government school would continue to be named for the businessman. “Without (Blavatnik’s) generosity, the creation of the School would not have been possible. He has always respected the academic independence of the School and never attempted to direct its activities,” according to a statement from Oxford University published by its student paper.\n\nSince then, Blavatnik has made several other sizable donations, including $25 million to Carnegie Hall in New York – which named a seating section after him; $65 million to London’s Tate Modern – which named a building after him; $35 million to Yale – which named a fellowship after the business tycoon; as well as several multi-million-dollar grants to Stanford University, Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2018, Blavatnik made the largest ever donation to Harvard’s medical school – a whopping $200 million.\n\nAnti-corruption activists warned about Blavatnik’s efforts to export “Russian kleptocratic practices to the West” in a 2019 letter to the board of the Council on Foreign Relations, which named an internship program after Blavatnik following a $12 million donation.\n\n“It is our considered view that Blavatnik uses his ‘philanthropy’ – funds obtained by and with the consent of the Kremlin, at the expense of the state budget and the Russian people – at leading western academic and cultural institutions to advance his access to political circles,” the group of 55 American and European foreign policy experts and anti-corruption activists wrote. “Such ‘philanthropic’ capital enables the infiltration of the US and UK political and economic establishments at the highest levels.”\n\nFederal law prohibits foreign nationals – and thus, most Russians – from donating to US political campaigns. But Blavatnik, with his US citizenship, is a major donor to the Republican party. He has also made some smaller donations to Democrats and was photographed with former President Bill Clinton at a gala at Lincoln Center in 2013.\n\nLen Blavatnik, left, and former US President Bill Clinton speak at a gala at Lincoln Center in New York in 2013. Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBlavatnik’s success in improving his reputation as an American and British citizen “is just head and shoulders above all these other oligarchs,” said Michel, who believes the businessman owes part of that success to his nationalities.\n\nHis passports would also shield him from sanctions, Michel explained.\n\n“There is no capacity for the US to sanction its own citizens, to seize its own assets and to effectively bar them from ever visiting the United States of America – and the same would go for the United Kingdom as well,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'The last straw': Former oligarch on renouncing Russian citizenship 03:49 - Source: CNN 'The last straw': Former oligarch on renouncing Russian citizenship 03:49\n\nInstitutions grapple with what to do\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, western institutions have scrambled to distance themselves from oligarchs and their donations.\n\nThe Tate Modern in London severed ties with Vekselberg and another oligarch, Petr Aven, who until recently headed Alfa-Bank in Russia and is sanctioned by the European Union.\n\nOther institutions, such as Harvard University, are taking a softer approach.\n\nHarvard’s Medical School, which opened the Blavatnik Institute after the $200 million donation from the businessman four years ago, has not said it would return the funds or rename the institute. Rather, it has funded several visiting trainee positions at the school for Ukrainian scientists eager to flee their war-torn country.\n\nHarvard declined to comment.\n\nYale, which has a grant program named for Blavatnik, said the university would not allow individuals subject to US sanctions to make donations.\n\nPotanin resigned from his role as trustee of the Guggenheim Museum in New York after nearly 20 years. The Council on Foreign Relations also dropped him from their board.\n\nThe Kennedy Center’s “Russian Room” reopened in March under the name the “Opera House Circles Lounge.” A spokesperson told CNN that the term limit for the name of the room had expired, but separately referenced the war in Ukraine as a factor in the renaming.\n\n“Due to the tragedy in Ukraine, the Kennedy Center and the [Potanin] Foundation have mutually agreed to no longer use the name Russian Lounge,” the spokesperson said.\n\nPotanin did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nStill, Potanin’s name remains carved in the marble walls of the Kennedy Center.\n\n“It’s embarrassing,” said Michel. “It’s shameful. It’s a blight on the Kennedy Center itself and its only going to continue aging poorly.”\n\nThis story was updated to include a post-publication comment from Len Blavatnik’s company, Access Industries.

Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects?

Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}]}

Liquid fuel or fuel vapor that accumulates near a hot surface may ignite, leading to an under-hood fire and increasing the risk of injury, Ford said in a NHTSA filing dated July 11. A fuel leak could lead to fuel odor both outside and inside the vehicle.\n\n\"This safety recall supersedes the prior recalls and will include a new remedy for this issue, which is currently under development and expects to be finalized in the near future,\" Ford said in a statement to USA TODAY on July 16, adding there is an interim software update that will help detect cracked injectors and lower the risk of a fire.\n\nFord said it is also recalling vehicles produced with these injectors that were not previously recalled, and the company is not aware of any injuries associated with under-hood fires related to cracked fuel injectors.\n\nNeed a break?

The remedy also included adding a tube to allow fuel to drain away from surfaces that may lead to a fire.\n\nOn April 11, 2024, the NHTSA opened a recall query to determine “adequacy and safety consequences” of the previous remedy, Ford said. The NHTSA did not believe the fix got to the root cause of the issue.\n\nFord worked over the next few months to respond to the NHTSA, and then on July 23, 2024, Ford’s Critical Concern Review Group began investigating a vehicle that had an under-hood fire after receiving the update. Ford began testing the vehicle and found it had a cracked injector that led to the fire. The company spent the next nine months inspecting vehicles that had experienced under-hood fires after undergoing the update.\n\nAccording to Ford, the company also noted injector cracking on eight vehicles that experienced an under-hood fire; among them, six did not have updated engine control software.\n\n“Ford is aware of no allegations of injuries associated with these (eight) fires,” the company said.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Ford approved another remedy to address a subset of vehicles that did not properly receive the software portion of the update.\n\nWhat should I do if I have one of these vehicles?\n\nFord said it notified dealers about the issue on July 15 and owner notification letters should begin mailing on Aug. 18, 2025. Owners will be instructed to take their vehicles to a Ford or Lincoln dealer to have their engine control software updated for free.\n\nSome drivers have already received the update, so they do not need to take their vehicles in, Ford said. The company will let these drivers know if an update is needed or not. Owners can also search for their vehicle identification numbers online to see what recalls apply to their vehicles.\n\nAccording to Ford, a final fix is in the works and when the free solution is available, the company will let owners know via mail.\n\nContributing: Natalie Neysa Alund, USA TODAY\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

They are represented by Clare Locke and Farnan LLP, well-known firms specializing in high-profile defamation cases, who helped win a $790 million defamation lawsuit against Fox News brought by Dominion Voting Systems in 2023.\n\nOwens has been repeating false claims over the first lady's identity for more than a year, the lawsuit alleges, starting in March 2024 when the podcaster stated she stakes her \"entire professional reputation\" that Brigitte Macron \"is in fact a man.” In January, Owens released the first episode in an eight-part podcast series entitled, \"Becoming Brigitte,\" in which the lawsuit says she presented various \"outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions.\" The filing says they include allegations by Owens that Brigitte was born a man and stole someone's identity, that Brigitte and Emmanuel Macron are blood relatives and that they have committed \"forgery, fraud and abuses of power to conceal these secrets.\"\n\nThe filing alleges that Owens ignored the Macrons’ requests to retract the allegations.\n\n\"Owens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history — twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade,\" the complaint said.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Owens said the filing represented a \"foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist.\"\n\nOwens has attracted criticism for years over her commentaries on a range of topics, with a history of spreading antisemitic rhetoric, including Holocaust denial and revisionism. She was suspended from YouTube for a week in September after videos of several of her interviews were deemed as hate speech by the Google subsidiary. In the following two months, authorities in New Zealand and Australia rejected her visas to visit the countries ahead of her speaking tour in February and March 2025. Local media reported Australian Immigration Minister Tony Burke mentioned her rhetoric \"downplaying the impact of the Holocaust with comments about (German SS officer Josef) Mengele through to claims that Muslims started slavery,\" as reasons for her visa denial.\n\nWednesday's lawsuit is a rare case of a world leader suing for defamation. To prevail in U.S. defamation cases, public figures like the Macrons must show defendants engaged in \"actual malice,\" meaning they knew what they published was false or had reckless disregard for its truth.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Mohd Fyro/Ministry of Communications and Information/Reuters\n\nDuring the meeting, they discussed US-Singapore cooperation on a number of issues, including the climate crisis and economic development, according to the statement. It added that Lee “highlighted the importance of stable US-China relations for regional peace and security.” Pelosi is scheduled to attend a cocktail reception held by the American Chamber of Commerce in the city-state later Monday.\n\nBefore arriving in the Indo-Pacific, Pelosi’s delegation stopped by Hawaii, according to a statement from her office on Sunday. The delegation also plans to visit Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, where high-level meetings would be held to address “shared interests,” including trade, the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis, according to Pelosi’s office.\n\nThe statement and Pelosi’s public itinerary made no mention of Taiwan, but a senior Taiwanese government official and a US official told CNN on Monday that she is expected to visit Taiwan as part of her tour of Asia. It is unclear when exactly Pelosi will land in Taipei.\n\nThe stop – the first for a US House speaker in 25 years – comes at a time when US-China relations are already at a low point. The Taiwanese official added that she is expected to stay in Taiwan overnight.\n\nThe US official added that Defense Department officials are working around the clock on monitoring any Chinese movements in the region and securing a plan to keep her safe.\n\nSpeculation had swirled for weeks that Pelosi, who is second in the line of presidential succession behind the vice president, might have been planning to visit the self-governing democratic island.\n\nChina’s Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory – despite never having controlled it – has repeatedly warned against Pelosi visiting the island, vowing to take “resolute and forceful measures” if the trip goes ahead.\n\nSome US officials are worried that the reported visit would be met with a military response from China, potentially triggering the worst cross-strait crisis in decades.\n\nDuring a phone call between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping last Thursday, Xi warned the US not to “play with fire” on the Taiwan issue – though neither side confirmed if Pelosi’s reported plans were discussed. Preparation for the call predated reports of the possible trip.\n\nWhen asked about Pelosi’s possible visit on Monday, Taiwan’s Premier Su Tseng-chang did not confirm whether she might stop there and reiterated that Taipei welcomes foreign guests. “The government warmly welcomes any foreign VIP friends to visit our country,” Su told reporters.\n\nTraveling alongside Pelosi as part of the Congressional delegation are Chairman Gregory Meeks (Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee), Chairman Mark Takano (Chair of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs), Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, and Congressman Andy Kim.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Monday.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Wayne Chang", "Jessie Yeung", "Wayne Chang"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/middleeast/mahsa-amini-death-iran-intl", "title": "Mahsa Amini death: Fifth Iranian paramilitary member killed as ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA fifth member of an Iranian volunteer paramilitary group died Sunday after clashing with what state media called “rioters and thugs,” as the country’s President Ebrahim Raisi warned that protesters would be dealt with “decisively” after days of nationwide unrest.\n\nThe person died from injuries sustained on Thursday in Urmia city in northwest Iran, Iranian state news agency IRNA said. Other members of Basij, a paramilitary organization connected to the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have been killed in Qazvin, Tabriz, Mashhad and Qouchan.\n\nThe protests have been sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman detained by morality police on September 13 accused of violating the country’s conservative dress code.\n\nHundreds of anti-government demonstrators returned to the streets of Tehran and dozens of other provincial towns as darkness fell on Sunday, despite claims by state-run news agencies that pro-government rallies have put an end to the protests.\n\nThe protesters organized themselves despite a crackdown by security forces, arrests of protesters and internet disruption. Protesters chanted anti-government and anti-Supreme Leader slogans, as well as “death to dictator,” while venting their anger against the Basij militias.\n\nSince Friday, demonstrations have taken place in at least 40 cities nationwide, including the capital Tehran, with protesters demanding an end to violence and discrimination against women as well as an end to compulsory wearing of the hijab.\n\nAt least 35 people have died in Iran in recent protests over the death of Amini, state media outlet the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) said late on Friday.\n\nAmnesty International previously said that 30 people had died. CNN cannot independently verify the death toll – a precise figure is impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm – and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists.\n\nAt least 1,200 people have been arrested in connection with the wave of protests, Iranian state-backed news agency Tasmin reported Saturday, citing a security official. The IRGC has accused the protesters of “rioting” and “vandalism,” and called on the police to “protect the security of the nation.”\n\nAt least 17 journalists have been arrested in Iran as anti-state protests spread across the country, according to a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a non-profit that monitors press freedom.\n\nIranian authorities say they will restrict internet access in the country until calm is restored to the streets. Meanwhile, the IRGC, the elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country’s revolution in 1979, has asked all people to identify protesters, the country’s semi-official news agency Fars News said.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of thousands of Iranians held pro-government rallies in many cities in Iran to condemn the recent unrest, state news IRNA reported.\n\nPeople took to the streets in many cities and towns, including the holy city of Mashhad, the northwestern city of Qazvin, the central city of Esfahan as well as the western cities of Hamedan and Yasuj, to show their “unity and outrage over the recent acts of sabotage perpetrated by rioters,” state news added.\n\nAccording to Press TV, the demonstrators “condemned the crimes and evil acts committed by a handful of mercenaries serving foreign enemies, who set fire to the Holy Qur’an, mosques, and the national flags and forcefully removed women’s headscarves on the streets.”\n\nPeople light a fire during a protest over the death of Mahsa Amini in Tehran on September 21, 2022. West Asia News Agency/Reuters\n\nDecades of repression\n\nAuthorities hope that by restricting the internet they can control the protests – the latest in a wave that has swept Iran in recent years. They started with the Green movement in 2009 over contested election results and more recently the 2019 protests sparked by a rise in fuel prices. Hundreds were believed to have been killed in the violent crackdown three years ago and thousands injured, according to estimates released by the UN and rights groups.\n\nBut this year’s protests are different – in their scope, scale and unprecedented feminist nature. There is also mobilization across the socio-economic divide. A young generation of Iranians are rising up on the streets against decades of repression – arguably bolder than ever.\n\nThe demonstrations have spread to dozens of Iranian cities, from the Kurdish region in the northwest, to the capital Tehran and even more traditionally conservative cities like Mashhad.\n\nWhile they were ignited by the death of Amini, the initial calls for accountability have turned into demands for more rights and freedoms, especially for women who for decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have faced discrimination and severe restrictions on their rights.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Iranian women open up about hijab law and morality police 01:13 - Source: CNN Iranian women open up about hijab law and morality police 01:13\n\nBut calls for regime change are growing too. People across the country are chanting for “death to the dictator,” in a reference to the Supreme Leader, tearing down portraits of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Remarkable images emerged on Friday night from Khamenei’s birthplace in the city of Mashhad, where protesters set fire to the statue of a man considered one of the symbols of the Islamic Revolution. Such scenes were unthinkable in the past.\n\nThis is all happening at a time when Iran’s hardline leadership is under growing pressure with talks to revive the stalled 2015 nuclear agreement and the state of the economy under US sanctions; ordinary Iranians are struggling to cope with soaring levels of inflation.\n\nWhile these protests are the biggest challenge for the government for years, analysts believe the government will likely move to contain them by resorting to the heavy-handed tactics it has used in the past. There are signs a brutal crackdown is coming, along with the internet restrictions on a level not seen since 2019. Other measures include the government mobilizing its supporters in mass rallies following Friday prayers; officials dismissing the demonstrators as rioters and foreign agents, and ominous warnings the army and powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps will be deployed to deal with the protests.", "authors": ["Hamdi Alkhshali Jomana Karadsheh", "Hamdi Alkhshali", "Jomana Karadsheh"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/sport/lebron-james-adam-silver-react-robert-sarver-spt-intl", "title": "Robert Sarver: LeBron James and other NBA figures respond to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLeBron James and Chris Paul have criticized the NBA for the punishment handed down to Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver, who this week was fined $10 million and suspended for a year after an independent investigation found he engaged in hostile, racially insensitive and inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe report, commissioned by the NBA last fall after an ESPN report about Sarver’s behavior, found the Suns owner had “on at least five occasions during his tenure with the Suns/Mercury organization, repeated the N-word when recounting the statements of others.”\n\nHe also “engaged in instances of inequitable conduct toward female employees, made many sex-related comments in the workplace, made inappropriate comments about the physical appearance of female employees and other women, and on several occasions engaged in inappropriate physical conduct toward male employees.”\n\n“Read through the Sarver stories a few times now,” James wrote on Twitter. “I gotta be honest…Our league definitely got this wrong. I don’t need to explain why. Y’all read the stories and decide for yourself. I said it before and I’m gonna say it again, there is no place in this league for that kind of behavior.\n\n“I love this league and I deeply respect our leadership. But this isn’t right.

The NBA said Sarver and the Suns and Mercury organizations cooperated with the investigation.\n\nIn an open letter to Suns employees and players on Thursday, team vice chairman Jahm Najafi called on Sarver to resign.\n\n“I cannot in good judgment sit back and allow our children and future generations of fans to think that this behavior is tolerated because of wealth and privilege,” Najafi said. “Therefore, in accordance with my commitment to helping eradicate any form of racism, sexism and bias, as Vice Chairman of the Phoenix Suns, I am calling for the resignation of Robert Sarver.”\n\nSarver, who has been the Suns’ and Mercury’s majority owner since 2004, cannot have any involvement with the team during the yearlong suspension and must complete a workplace training program. The $10 million fine is the maximum allowed as determined by the NBA by-laws.\n\nPaul, a 12-time All-Star who has played for the Suns since 2020, also said the NBA’s punishment should have been more severe.\n\n“Like many others, I reviewed the report. I was and am horrified and disappointed by what I read,” Paul wrote on Twitter. “This conduct especially towards women is unacceptable and must never be repeated.\n\n“I am of the view that the sanctions fell short in truly addressing what we can all agree was atrocious behavior. My heart goes out to all of the people that were affected.”\n\nI am of the view that the sanctions fell short in truly addressing what we can all agree was atrocious behavior.

I took all of that into account.\n\n“There are particular rights here, somebody who owns an NBA team as opposed to somebody who’s an employee.

The jury awarded significantly more damages to Depp, a legal win for the actor.\n\nDepp sued Heard, his ex-wife, for defamation over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though Depp was not named in the article, he claims it cost him lucrative acting roles. Heard countersued her ex-husband for defamation over statements Depp’s attorney made about her abuse claims.\n\nThe jury found that Heard defamed Depp in three separate statements in The Washington Post piece, and that Depp defamed Heard with one statement his attorney made.\n\nThe jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million dollars in punitive damages. The jury awarded Heard $2 million in compensatory damages and no money for punitive damages.\n\nDepp sought $50 million in damages and Heard sought $100 million.

Anderson said the former couple “engaged in what I saw as mutual abuse.”\n\nDepp has also claimed he physically defended himself at times, speaking about one incident in which Heard said her nose was injured. Depp said in court that his head connected with Heard’s forehead while he was trying to “restrain” Heard.\n\n“There was not an intentional head butt,” the actor said.\n\nA severed finger\n\nDepp testified that his finger was severed by shattered glass in 2015 after Heard allegedly threw a bottle of vodka at him. He sought medical care but said in court that he told others at the time that he injured his finger by slamming it in a door.\n\n“I didn’t want to disclose that it had been Ms. Heard that had thrown a vodka bottle at me and then took my finger off,” he said during his testimony. “I didn’t want to get her in trouble. I tried to just keep things as copacetic and easy as possible for everyone. I didn’t want to put her into that mix.”\n\nJohnny Depp displays the middle finger of his hand in court, injured in 2015.

MRSA causes staph infections that are resistant to some antibiotics and often are difficult to treat.\n\nDr. David Kipper, who has treated Depp, corroborated portions of Depp’s story in a deposition played in court this week.\n\nHeard’s lawyers have referenced statements Depp made to ER doctors at the time to argue that Depp cut off his own finger. Depp denies this.\n\nDepp was also asked about his actions following his injury, including when he used his injured finger to write on the walls with a mixture of his blood and paint. Depp confirmed in court that he had done so.\n\nText messages\n\nHeard’s attorney Ben Rottenborn introduced several text messages Depp sent to friends and staff members as evidence on Thursday, one of which referenced Heard’s “rotting corpse.”\n\nDepp testified he was “embarrassed” by the messages read in court and said he uses “dark humor” at times to express himself.\n\nJohnny Depp during testimony on April 21.

Depp denied this.\n\nJohnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" Disney Pictures\n\n“I would be a real simpleton to not think that there was an effect on my career based on Ms. Heard’s words, whether they mentioned my name or not,” Depp said on the stand.\n\nDepp sheepishly admitted in his testimony that he has not seen the first film in the “Pirates” franchise. He said, however, “I believed in the character wholeheartedly.”\n\nHowever, when asked by Rottenborn, “If Disney came to you with $300 million and a million alpacas, nothing on this Earth would get you to go back and work with Disney on a ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ film, correct?”\n\n“That is true, Mr. Rottenborn,” Depp replied.\n\nDepp added on his career: “One day you’re Cinderella so to speak and then in zero point six seconds you’re Quasimodo.

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn 2016, the Indianapolis Star broke the news that Larry Nassar, the team doctor of the US women’s national gymnastics team, had used his position to perpetuate sexually abuse – as it later turned out, of hundreds of girls and young women.\n\nSix years later, the same paper reported the story of a 10-year old Ohio girl who had been sexually assaulted. The child was six weeks and three days pregnant – three days past the cutoff in her state for legal abortion. The story went viral, with President Joe Biden asking Americans to “imagine being that little girl.”\n\nMary Ziegler Bill Lax/Bill Lax/FSU Photography Service\n\nAnd yet the response to the story, for many, was scorn and disbelief. Republican US Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio blasted the story as “another lie.” Ohio attorney general Dave Yost joined Fox News anchors in suggesting that the story had been made up. The Wall Street Journal described the report as “too good to be true.” Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, labeled the story “#FakeNews from the liberal media.”\n\nAlmost before the critics had a chance to weigh in, the Columbus Dispatch confirmed that a 27-year-old man had been arrested in the case and, according to police, confessed to sexually assaulting the child at least twice. Media outlets that had cast doubt on the girl’s story tried to course-correct. Jordan deleted his tweet. Yost – who had previously said “there is not one damn scintilla of evidence” and that the Star should be ashamed of running the story – released a statement that read in part, “My heart aches for the pain suffered by this young child.”\n\nAs appalling as the violence perpetrated against her was, it was also shocking to witness the reflexive doubt many had about her story. More than half a decade since the Indy Star exposed Nassar, has anything changed?\n\nThe horrific story of one little girl in America is not just a reminder that we still struggle to believe women and girls. It’s a cautionary tale about how quick we are to demonize some girls and women. If we have worked to trust and support victims of sexual violence, many of us have too often left people seeking abortion out of the equation.\n\nThe history of disbelieving abortion seekers goes back at least to the 1960s. At the time, some non-Catholic hospitals had set up therapeutic abortion committees. These committees were designed to limit abortions and protect doctors from lawsuits and criminal charges. But in some parts of the country, a growing number of committee-approved abortions occurred when patients were suicidal.\n\nThese abortions qualified even under stringent “life of the mother exceptions,” but abortion opponents were furious. Anti-abortion scholars contended that abortion never improved anyone’s mental health and created “a degree of emotional trauma far exceeding that which would have been sustained by continuation of the pregnancy.” Abortions for reasons of mental health, they argued, were abortions on demand. Women just lied about their mental health to get what they wanted.\n\nBy the late 1960s, states were considering modest reforms to their criminal abortion laws, including exceptions for rape and health. The leading model, proposed by the American Law Institute – an elite group of lawyers, professors and judges – had support from Republicans as well as Democrats, but an emerging anti-abortion movement was quick to reject it.\n\nThe reason: They claimed that there were few, if any, abortions needed in cases of rape or health threats, and so any woman who invoked such an exception had to be lying. In practice, anti-abortion leaders would never support compromise laws that contradicted the principle that a fetus was a rights-holding person, and if infanticide would not be allowed in cases of rape, abortion foes opposed a rape exception from the moment of fertilization.\n\nBut a deep distrust of women also ran through opposition to rape exceptions. “Real” rape, wrote leading anti-abortion lawyer Eugene Quay, almost never resulted in pregnancy. In his view, then, sexual assault victims seeking abortions, were almost certainly lying. “It is well known that many an errant female if caught will call herself a rape victim,” he complained in a 1960 law review article.\n\nWe can see the same story when it comes to other abortion exceptions. For years, anti-abortion groups have opposed health exceptions to laws restricting or banning abortion, which they believed would be interpreted broadly enough to allow abortion for any reason at all. They pointed to Doe v. Bolton, a case decided the same day as Roe, which overturned Georgia’s abortion law. They believed that Doe included a mental health exception, and that mental health was an excuse for women who did not tell the truth.\n\nRape exceptions once seemed to be different. For decades, leading Republicans claimed that they disfavored criminalizing abortion in cases of rape or incest. Republican presidents from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump came out in favor of a rape and incest exception. But when the debate centered on low-income people, and especially people of color, distrust of women and other pregnant people always shone through, even then.\n\nThis was clear in battles about the Hyde Amendment, a ban on Medicaid reimbursement for abortion. The amendment was part of an appropriations bill, which meant that each year brought a new battle about whether it should have any exceptions. Anti-abortion leaders and their Republican allies in Congress always opposed exceptions for rape and incest. The reason: People seeking abortions could not be trusted. Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican who authored the amendment, contended that no one held women accountable if they claimed to be rape; people simply believed them.\n\nToday, the distrust that women, particularly women of color, have long faced is now on full display for anyone who can get pregnant. That’s because anti-abortion groups no longer feel compelled to hide what they think. Part of the reason is that abortion opponents are no longer worried about the Supreme Court.\n\nAt one time, pragmatists in the movement worried that taking unpopular position could alienate some Supreme Court justices, who might worry about backlash, and undermine the quest to undo a right to choose. But after Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation, many – including right-wing lawmakers – assumed that five justices would overrule Roe. The confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett further sealed their conclusion.\n\nNow, we know those predictions are correct. Besides, anti-abortion leaders are no longer worried about offending leaders of the national Republican Party, which has moved much further to the right on abortion since Trump’s rise to power in 2016. Now, there is little daylight between the Republican Party and the anti-abortion movement, not least when it comes to the question of rape exceptions.\n\nRape exceptions remained popular – a recent poll by Pew Research Center found that 69% of Americans favored rape exceptions; only 8% opposed all abortion access in all cases. But the dynamic in conservative legislatures has made popular opinion infinitely less important. More conservative states and House races have become politically uncompetitive with gerrymandering and redistricting. Primary races have become de facto general elections. More Republican leaders fear primary challenges – and angry donors – far more than voters. As a result, lawmakers are more likely to cater to the demands of the anti-abortion movement more than to the median voter – and anti-abortion leaders are voicing their true beliefs rather than seeking to expand their support.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIt may be shocking to see anti-abortion leaders calling on 10-year-olds to carry pregnancies to term, and it’s hard to believe that so many still assume that any survivor of sexual assault seeking an abortion has something to hide. But, in truth, the distrust of women seeking abortions is nothing new. What has changed is people’s willingness to discuss it openly.\n\n#MeToo has raised questions about due process, but it’s also exposed equally important issues about whether we believe only some women, and only under certain circumstances. All women who are brave enough to come forward after sexual assault deserve the benefit of the doubt.

This is horrible for me to sit here for weeks and relive everything,” Heard said during the start of her testimony at Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia.\n\nDepp is suing Heard for $50 million over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in which she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse.” Though Depp was not named in the article, he claims it cost him lucrative acting roles.\n\nHeard’s testimony comes 14 days into the trial, after weeks of jurors hearing testimony about the explosive relationship between the actors, including from Depp himself, who testified over the course of multiple days that he has never struck a woman and accused Heard of abuse.\n\nHeard and Depp, who met in 2009 and were married from 2015-2016, accuse the other of acts of physical violence during their relationship. They have both denied the other’s claims.\n\nAttorneys for Depp rested their case on Tuesday.\n\nHeard’s testimony\n\nWhen Heard took the stand to testify, she began talking about how she and Depp began falling in love after filming “The Rum Diary.”\n\n“When I was around Johnny, I felt like the most beautiful person in the world. He made me feel like a million dollars,” Heard testified. “It just felt very intense.”\n\nThe two began seeing each other romantically in 2011. Heard testified they’d spend days together at a time in a “bubble,” reading books and listening to music together, then he’d disappear.\n\nHeard was asked by attorney Elaine Bredehoft if she remembered the first time Depp hit her.\n\n“I will never forget it. It changed my life,” Heard said.\n\nHeard said she believed Depp was doing cocaine, that there was a vintage jar of cocaine nearby and that they were sitting together on a couch when she asked him about a tattoo on his arm and that he told her it said, “Wino.”\n\n“I just laughed because I thought he was joking. And he slapped me across the face,” Heard said. “And I laughed. I laughed because I didn’t know what else to do. I thought this must be a joke. I didn’t know what was going on. I just stared at him.”\n\nHeard testified that Depp hit her twice more. She said she tried to will herself to walk out.\n\n“I knew it was wrong and I knew that I had to leave him. And that’s what broke my heart. Because I didn’t want to leave him,” Heard said. “I wish I could sit here and say I stood up and walked out of that house and I drew a line and I stood up for myself.”\n\nHeard said that Depp got down on his knees, cried and apologized saying, “I thought I put the monster away.”\n\nIt was unclear what year the alleged incident occurred.\n\nHeard said she did leave shortly after the incident and that she got texts from Depp apologizing profusely saying, “I’d rather cut my hand off than ever lay it upon you” and that he understood she could never forgive him.\n\nHeard said they two reconciled shortly after the incident, and that he promised her that he’d never hit her again.\n\n“I believed there was a line he’d never cross again and that was it,” Heard.\n\nBut she described the relationship continuing with escalating violence that she believed corresponded to Depp drinking. Heard testified that Depp would shove her, hit her, push her and that fights escalated quickly.\n\nIn Depp’s own testimony, he denied having ever struck a woman in his life.\n\nHeard also detailed an incident in 2013 where she says Depp did a “cavity search” on her against her will.\n\nHeard testified Wednesday that she and Depp were with friends doing drugs at a party in a desert lodging area made up of several eclectic trailers, and that when she and Depp returned to their room Depp began smashing things inside of their trailer. He accused her of hiding his cocaine, Heard testified, and began ripping off her dress and underwear.\n\n“He was telling me, ‘We’re going to conduct a cavity search shall we?’ Like, just shoved his fingers inside me,” Heard testified.\n\nA forensic psychologist hired by Heard’s legal team previously testified that she determined that Heard had been subjected to sexual violence by Depp.\n\nDepp has previously denied all allegations against him.\n\nHeard described the ups and downs of her relationship with Depp, with periods of calm when the actor was sober.\n\n“He was the love of my life,” Heard said. “But he was also this other thing. The other thing was awful.”\n\nPsychologist testifies\n\nThe first witness called by the defense was forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes, who testified that she believed Heard has post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of intimate partner violence perpetrated by Depp.\n\n“What these tests show is that there was a high degree of serious violence perpetrated by Mr. Depp toward Ms. Heard. There was violence more on the mild level perpetrated by Ms. Heard toward Mr. Depp with one severe indicator which was the punching that she indicated to me,” Hughes testified on Tuesday. “She was subjected to sexual violence where Mr. Depp, based on her report, was subjected to none.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Depp’s attorney Wayne Dennison played a recording of a conversation between Heard and Depp.\n\n“I was hitting you; I was not punching you,” Heard’s voice was heard saying in the recording.\n\n“Don’t tell me what it feels like to be punched,” Depp’s voice was heard saying in the recording.\n\nDennison asked Hughes if she felt the situation captured in that recording was Heard fighting back reactively.\n\n“In this instance, if true, if she said she hit him first, then that would not be reactive violence,” Hughes said.\n\nDennison pressed Hughes on her assessment that violence perpetuated by Heard against Depp was “mild,” showing a graphic photo of Depp’s partially severed finger, an injury Depp said he sustained after Heard allegedly threw a glass bottle at him.\n\n“That photograph doesn’t reflect a low level of violence, does it?” Dennison asked.\n\n“That reflects a serious injury,” Hughes said.\n\nHeard will return to the stand for testimony on Thursday.", "authors": ["Sonia Moghe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/entertainment/johnny-depp-testimony-amber-heard-defamation-case", "title": "Johnny Depp testifies about his finger getting severed in defamation ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nActor Johnny Depp resumed his testimony in a Fairfax, Virginia court in his defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard on Wednesday.\n\nDepp discussed the changing nature of his relationship with Heard. He accused Heard of name calling and making demeaning comments about him at times in their relationship that would escalate to arguments.\n\n“I was not allowed to be right, not allowed to have a voice,” Depp said.\n\nAn argument between the former couple in 2015 ended with Depp seeking medical care for a severed finger after, he claims, Heard threw a bottle of vodka at him.\n\n“She threw the large bottle and it made contact [with his hand] and shattered everywhere,” Depp testifed. “Then I looked down and realized that my tip of my finger had been severed.”\n\n“I don’t know what I nervous breakdown feels like,” Depp added. “But that’s probably the closest I had ever been.”\n\nHeard has denied the claim.\n\n‘I wanted to try to make it work’\n\nIn his roughly three-hour testimony on Tuesday, the Oscar-nominated star spoke in detail about Heard’s allegations of domestic abuse, his history with substance abuse and his experiences growing up with an abusive mother.\n\n“You slowly realize you’re in a relationship with your mother, in a sense,” Depp testified Wednesday about his dynamic with Heard, comparing the abuse he says he experienced by his mother to Heard’s alleged abuse.\n\nDepp’s attorney asked him why he stayed with Heard as their relationship deteriorated.\n\n“I wanted to try to make it work,” he said.\n\n“Ms. Heard had spoken of suicide on a couple of occasions, so that also becomes a factor, that’s something that lives in the back of your brain,” Depp said.\n\nThe actor, known for his work in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise, is suing Heard for $50 million over a 2018 Washington Post op-ed in which she wrote about her experience with domestic abuse. She did not name Depp in the piece, but he claims it cost him lucrative film work.\n\nAsked on the stand Wednesday what he’s lost in light of the allegations, Depp replied, “Nothing less than everything.”\n\n“When the allegations were made, when the allegations were rapidly circling the globe, telling people that I was a drunken, cocaine-fueled menace who beat woman suddenly in my 50s, it’s over,” he said. “You’re done.”\n\nDepp has maintained his innocence and testified that while he and Heard had arguments during their relationship, he has never “struck a woman.”\n\nIn his lengthy second day of testimony, Depp discussed his tattoos, telling the court Heard would make fun of some of them, which he equated to keeping a journal of his life.\n\nHe referenced a “Winona forever” tattoo, which Depp said he got for his former-girlfriend, actress Winona Ryder, but changed it to “Wino forever” after they broke up. He said Heard didn’t like it.\n\n“I took off the last two letters and had it say ‘Wino forever,’” Depp said, adding, “I thought through pain comes humor. Humor has to come in there into the pain and that’s how you play it out in the mind… so I changed it to ‘Wino forever.’”\n\nHe said that Heard wanted him to get a tattoo of her own name, which he eventually did.\n\n“And ironically it wasn’t long after that that everything started going sideways,” Depp said.\n\n“I was doing everything I could to bring a smile to her face as opposed to a frown and then the onslaught of whatever problems she was experiencing,” he said. “I would try to wake her up with laughter, singing stupid songs in her ear. I generally just tried to keep bringing her mood up. Sometimes it worked, many times it didn’t. But I tried.”\n\nDepp gave further details about his use of oxycodone during the time he was with Heard and symptoms of withdrawal he would experience when he went through detox.\n\nCross-examination by Heard’s lawyer Ben Rottenborn began near the end of the day’s session and will continue Thursday. Heard has yet to take the stand in the trial that is expected to last six weeks.\n\nA contentious split\n\nDepp and Amber met on the set of “The Rum Diary” in 2009, married in 2015 and went to a contentious split, with charges of bad behavior levied by both sides.\n\nThe couple settled their divorce in August 2016, releasing a joint statement which read in part, “Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love.”\n\nAmber Heard and Johnny Depp in 2015.

But, as it comes to an end, people from around the world have been telling CNN what’s giving them hope for 2023 - from their own exciting plans, to potential scientific breakthroughs, and the promise of the next generation. Here are their stories.\n\nI hope my mother recovers her health. She suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage two weeks ago. I’m close to my mother, so I was very confused and sad. But now she’s in a healthier condition, so I’m more relaxed. Other people have said it was a miracle. I just need some cheer!\n\nYeon hee Jang, South Korea\n\nYeon hee Jang and her mother, whose health is improving after her hemorrhage.

We have been apart for 30 years - they came to the US due to the war in the northern part of Uganda, and I grew up with my grandmother and uncle. Unfortunately, I have tried applying for different visas but all in vain. However, I remain hopeful and optimistic that things will work out some day and I will be able to make this trip a reality.\n\nBen Katende, Uganda\n\nAs a person with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – a progressive nervous system disease), who took care of a husband who died of ALS, I am hoping for a cure. I was diagnosed in January 2022 and have pretty much lost the use of my arms, and some speech is slurred. My husband passed in 2011 from ALS, and I never thought it would be my fate as well since it is so rare. I take three ALS medications and am participating in a trial to help advance research in case one of us carries the gene, which would affect my son. We are making the most of life, living each day and hoping for a cure. ALS patients don’t have time to wait.\n\nColleen Van Natta, United States\n\nColleen Van Natta with her grandson, Beckham. Courtesy Colleen Van Natta\n\nI’m taking a 200-hour yoga teacher training course in the first quarter of 2023, and I’m so excited about this journey. I never practiced yoga until the pandemic came, and I needed to move my body and relax my mind in the uncertainty of those early days of lockdown. I couldn’t even touch my toes back then, but ever since practicing, my head is clearer, my body is stronger, and I have become more present in the moment.\n\nI hope to become a yoga teacher for my community — specifically for children and teenagers, so the next generation of youth can have the tools to handle stressful moments and focus on the present. The pandemic has done a lot of damage to kids’ overall mental well-being and I would love to help them through the practice of yoga.\n\nNikki Natividad, United States\n\nI’m incredibly hopeful for my future! I’m going to Italy in early 2023 to be with this huge love of my life, after reuniting in 2022 after 30 years. He was an exchange student in 1992 where I was going to high school. We fell in love then, but of course he had to leave and go home to Italy. I was supposed to go over after I graduated, but life, fear and immaturity got in my way.\n\nHe came to see me in 1996, when I had just gotten married and had a one year old daughter. Over the years he contacted me a few more times, until about a dozen years ago, when I said I couldn’t see him and he shouldn’t contact me anymore. He respected my wishes, but on Dec 31 2021 he sent me an email, and left me a few voicemails in the spring. I finally emailed him back, knowing if I did it would completely complicate my life, and the rest is history.\n\nI separated from my husband this summer, and spent a month in Italy in the fall. I will go back and forth until I can get the appropriate visa to stay longer - this time, and at this age, we refuse to miss our opportunity to finally be together. Such a dream for us, and we are so grateful to have found one another again after decades of being apart.\n\nLouise Dressel, Canada\n\nLouise and Elia China-Bino in 1992, 30 years before their eventual reunion.

I plan to complete my degree and show my boys it’s never too late to do what you want to do. This last year has been tough as a single parent but I’m not giving up.\n\nHeather Getz, United States\n\nMy hopes are in my seven-year-old grandson. He is deaf and unfortunately also lost his mother when he was 18 months old. Despite this, however, he is a very sunny child, happy to live, full of friends. He is a child who gives me hope because he looks to the future with hope. He gives me hope because if the new generation of children will be like him, resilient and optimistic, than the world will be a better place.\n\nIlaria Pandolfi, Italy\n\nMy hope for 2023 is that we finally start to respect other human beings without basing it on their religion, gender, or sexual identity.\n\nI’ve noticed my generation and honestly even my mom’s generation (1978-1995 and beyond) are definitely more vocal about standing up for what’s right and wrong. When someone is bullied based on sexuality or religion, you see a huge influx of celebrities and even regular people within that age group speaking against it. There’s definitely hope for the future!\n\nAlija Bulbul, United States\n\nI hope to study for a master’s program at Chester University (in England) on my dream course, electronic and electrical engineering, and I have already secured a place for fall 2023. I hope to develop my electrical engineering firm, Phrank Solutions, to be competitive in my country Nigeria and internationally, and I aspire to be an employer.\n\nEchezona Chukwuma Ifeonu, Nigeria\n\nEchezona at work, installing electrical connections for a telecommunications company's floodlights in Anambra State, Nigeria.

My biggest hope is that we stay alive and defend our people and country. And I hope Ukraine will be safe for us again one day and my husband returns, so that we can gather our families for a wedding ceremony and started fulfilling our plans that got delayed by war. I hope we finally buy an apartment or a house of our own and start trying for a child.\n\nBut for now, we all need to focus on working and fighting for our freedom. Despite the fact that we are all in danger, most people around me are keeping a positive attitude to life and trying to do our best. Sharing this hope with my family and feeling their support helps me move forward and believe in the best possible outcome for us.\n\nOlha Korniienko, Ukraine\n\nThe leadership of young people of diverse races, cultures, backgrounds, religions, sexualities and economic statuses brings me great hope. Pete Buttigieg, Olivia Julianna, Greta Thunberg are a few of them, but the list is long. We need forward-looking, forward-thinking people who learn from the wisdom of the past but plan for the future. I believe that many young people are focused on finding solutions to the problems of today. They are tireless and intelligent. They know how to communicate. They are our only hope.\n\nMarie Bourque-Namer, United States\n\nI hope that all countries will think selflessly and focus on sustainability, global warming and resources protection. Extreme weather is impacting all countries, and plastic waste is a big issue. I think more and more people and companies will know they have to start somewhere in 2023. And 2023 is the United Nations International Year of Millets, so more people will become aware of the need to have fiber-rich foods and the importance of plant protein.\n\nS.

I want to become a surgeon in the future, so I’m planning to do pre-medicine during my undergraduate studies, then proceed to medical school, then after that I will specialise. In order to achieve all this I have to get admission and full financial support at a college or university in the US, which I’m hoping will come to pass in 2023. I am hopeful because I believe in myself, my mother believes in me and my family members are constantly praying for me. There is no stronger force than that of family support that can make you believe.\n\nTatenda Kasitomo, Zimbabwe\n\nTatenda in the biology lab, working hard to achieve his medical dreams.

I believe that regenerative agriculture will be the “it” thing next year because of climate change, the energy crisis and inflation. We need to produce food locally, shorten the distribution chain and not be so dependent on oil, and we need many more people to become farmers. The holistic management movement is growing rapidly in the US, Australia, parts of Africa and now also in Europe. The impact it has made both socially and ecologically is just wild and so impressive.\n\nGabriel Liljenström, Sweden\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine war have shown that the entire world, not just developing countries, are vulnerable to economic meltdown, energy crisis, and climate change.

Why isn't the medical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne day in July 2021, my then 15-year-old daughter Poppy stumbled and fell while walking down some stairs, grazing her knee. It wasn’t a serious wound, but over the weeks it didn’t heal.\n\nAround the same time, her wrists and knees became sore; her ankles started rolling when she walked; her hands began shaking; her headaches and stomach aches became more frequent and intensely painful. She was always exhausted.\n\nBefore her health declined, Poppy had enjoyed horse riding and gymnastics, she’d competed in cross country races and been a fearless goalkeeper for the school hockey team.\n\nBut within a couple of months, as walking became increasingly difficult, she asked me for a walking stick. We found one that folds up and fits neatly in her school bag.\n\nI took Poppy to doctors who conducted tests, but they couldn’t find out what was wrong with her. Then, in October, a breakthrough.\n\nA podiatrist who was measuring Poppy for insoles to support her aching feet asked if Poppy could bend her thumb to reach her forearm. She could. Could she pull her little finger back to form a 90-degree angle with the back of her hand? She could do that, too.\n\n“Have you heard of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?” the podiatrist asked me. I hadn’t – so as soon as I got home, I went looking on the internet.\n\nThere are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), according to research and advocacy organization The Ehlers-Danlos Society. Most types are very rare, and can be diagnosed using genetic tests. However, the genes that cause hypermobile EDS (hEDS) – the most common form, accounting for about 90% of cases – are unknown, so diagnosis is based on a checklist of symptoms. The list includes a hypermobility rating, known as the Beighton Score.\n\nPoppy had enough symptoms to qualify for hEDS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor one year ago, on Christmas Eve. He told us that although we can do our best to alleviate some symptoms, there is no cure.\n\nPoppy reacted to the news better than I did. She had known for some time that something was fundamentally wrong. The diagnosis was upsetting but identifying her illness also gave her a sense of relief. I felt shocked and overwhelmed, and I cried for weeks.\n\nReading about EDS was like a dreadful slow reveal.\n\nI learned that it’s a genetic disorder that causes the body to make faulty connective tissue, and connective tissue is everywhere – in the tendons, ligaments, skin, heart, digestive system, eyes and gums.\n\nWeak connective tissue leads to hypermobility, which may sound like a good thing, but some people with bendy bodies suffer a mind-boggling array of symptoms, including joint dislocations and subluxations (like a mini dislocation, when the joint partially slips out of place), soft stretchy skin, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain and fatigue.\n\nThe severity of symptoms varies wildly. Patients with milder cases can lead relatively normal lives, while others become housebound, and some can’t digest food and must be fed through tubes.\n\nWhat’s more, people with hEDS are prone to other conditions, including POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which makes you dizzy when you stand up) and MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome, which gives you allergy-type symptoms).\n\nI learned a lot of new acronyms and they all spelled bad news.\n\nZebras or horses?\n\nI initially thought hEDS was rare, because all forms of EDS are commonly referred to as rare. But within a few weeks, I felt like I was seeing references to hEDS everywhere. Actor, writer and director Lena Dunham; actor and presenter Jameela Jamil; and drag queen Yvie Oddly live with it. I deep dived into EDS Twitter and EDS Instagram, while Poppy found it comforting to watch TikTok videos made by teenagers with the condition.\n\nDrag queen Yvie Oddly, who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, crab walks down the pink carpet at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2019. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images\n\nI discovered multiple patient groups on Facebook, each with tens of thousands of members, which turned out to be great sources of support. I asked questions (what kind of shoes are best for weak ankles? Which knee braces are easiest to pull on and off?) and kind strangers sent helpful advice. At the same time, scrolling through countless personal stories of pain, despair and shattered dreams made me feel terrified about what might lie ahead.\n\nI noticed common themes. Many EDS patients had spent years seeking the correct diagnosis; others felt they’d been neglected and gaslit by doctors.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk of zebras.\n\nLinda Bluestein, a Colorado-based physician who specializes in EDS and other hypermobility conditions, and has hEDS herself, explains why.\n\n“I was told in medical school, ‘when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras,’” she says. Many trainee doctors receive the same advice – when a patient presents with symptoms, “look for the common thing.” That’s why EDS patients commonly refer to themselves as zebras – and also use the fabulous collective noun “dazzle.” The name represents rarity and evokes the stripy stretch marks that are a common feature on EDS skin.\n\nBut if people with hEDS are medical zebras, why am I encountering so many of them?\n\nBluestein says that for many years it was thought that one in 5,000 people had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. But she says the limited research that’s been carried out into the prevalence of hEDS suggests the true number of cases is “much, much higher” than that.\n\nDr. Linda Bluestein has treated hEDS patients who have been searching for a diagnosis for decades. Linda Bluestein\n\nBluestein points me to a 2019 study carried out in Wales – a country of 3.1 million people. An examination of primary care and hospital records from 1990 to 2017 found that one in 500 people there has either hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome (a similar condition with a slightly different set of symptoms). She says it’s “a good study” but believes it’s still an underestimate. The Ehlers-Danlos Society says more population studies need to be done to give a more accurate view of its incidence elsewhere.\n\nBut despite this possible prevalence, and how debilitating hypermobility disorders can be, the average time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms is 10 to 12 years, according to The Ehlers-Danlos Society.\n\nBluestein has firsthand experience of this. Growing up, she wanted to become a ballet dancer and trained six days a week. When puberty hit, she started experiencing joint pain and migraines, and at 16 had her first orthopedic surgery. She realized she wouldn’t succeed in the ballet world and instead pursued her “back-up plan,” to become a doctor. But despite her career choice, Bluestein only received her hEDS diagnosis when she was 47 – more than 30 years later.\n\n“I told my doctor on numerous occasions, ‘there is something wrong with me, I don’t heal well, I get injured more easily than other people’,” she says. “And he just never, never listened.”\n\nWhy, for so many patients, does it take so long to get diagnosed?\n\n‘The worst possible model’\n\nIn 2014 a leading EDS expert, Professor Rodney Grahame, remarked at a conference that “no other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.”\n\nFar more women than men are diagnosed with EDS, which could help to explain the neglect, because the medical profession has a long history of overlooking health complaints made by women.\n\nA 2009 study, conducted by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases, surveyed 414 families of EDS patients from five countries and found that the average delay to an EDS diagnosis was four years for men – but 16 years for women.\n\nThe report states that women with EDS tend to be “diagnosed later because their pain and hypotonia (poor muscle tone) aren’t considered as physical symptoms but rather as psychological symptoms or common complaints.”\n\n“We tend to get dismissed a lot more easily,” says Bluestein. “People jump to the conclusion that we’re histrionic females.”\n\nAnxiety is very common in patients with hypermobility issues, says Bluestein, which can cloud the picture. “When people with anxiety present to a physician, it can suck all the air out of the room, so that the physician almost can’t see anything else.”\n\nThis can ramp up the patient’s anxiety further “because people aren’t validating our symptoms, and then we start to doubt ourselves,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, medicine is divided into silos which creates the “worst possible model” for EDS patients, says Bluestein.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We're born with this and will never be free:' Hear stories from people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 05:02 - Source: CNN 'We're born with this and will never be free:' Hear stories from people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 05:02\n\nShe explains that undiagnosed patients might consult a neurologist for their migraines, a rheumatologist for joint pain, a cardiologist for palpitations, a gastroenterologist for digestive issues and a urologist for bladder symptoms. Each doctor focuses on the symptoms that fall within their specialty but doesn’t consider the other ailments. “Nowhere along the way does somebody realize that there are certain conditions that could tie all of these things together and explain everything,” says Bluestein.\n\nThe 2009 rare diseases study found that during the quest for a diagnosis, 58% of EDS patients consulted more than five doctors, and 20% consulted more than 20.\n\nThe consequences of not getting diagnosed for years can be devastating.\n\nMelissa Dickinson, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, Georgia, says she experienced symptoms of a “mystery illness” since childhood. Then in 2013, she “went on honeymoon to Mexico, relatively healthy, and came back disabled and with a dislocated neck.”\n\nWhile on vacation, Dickinson says she got food poisoning and was prescribed ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that can pose a serious risk of aortic aneurysm to people with EDS. Instead, she says it triggered significant nerve damage, digestive issues that almost made her go blind because her body wasn’t absorbing nutrients, and put her in a wheelchair.\n\nDickinson, who finally received her hEDS diagnosis in 2014, says taking the wrong medication “wrecked me from head to toe.” Now that she’s receiving treatment, “I can walk with mobility aids, but most of my body has to have constant support to function.”\n\nLara Bloom, president and CEO of The Ehlers-Danlos Society, who herself has hEDS, says many patients have “medicalized PTSD.”\n\n“They have had to stop their careers, they’ve had to drop out of school, their relationships have broken down.” The delay inevitably results in worsening symptoms and a declining quality of life, she says. In worst-case scenarios, patients “are dying by suicide, they’re self-harming.”\n\nSometimes, the failure to diagnose EDS has led to children being taken away from their parents.\n\nIn 2010, Americans Rana Tyson and her husband Chad were falsely accused of harming their 4-week-old twin daughters, who had unexplained fractures in their legs.\n\nAlong with their older sister, the baby girls were taken by state authorities in Texas and sent to live with relatives. “It was the worst day of my life,” Tyson tells me in a phone call.\n\nFive months later, a geneticist identified the twins as having a connective tissue disorder, and they were subsequently diagnosed with EDS and a vitamin D deficiency. The family was reunited but “12 years later, it still hurts,” says Tyson.\n\nBloom says some other parents of children with EDS have been wrongly accused of “fabricated or induced illness (FII)” – a rare form of abuse, formerly known as Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, in which a parent or care giver deliberately causes symptoms or tries to convince doctors that a healthy child is ill.\n\nEllie Pattison, who has hEDS, has been repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder. Ellie Pattison\n\nEllie Pattison, a 19-year-old student who lives in County Durham, England, suffers from severe digestive issues linked to hEDS.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Ellie was repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder, she says, while her mother Caroline was accused of FII on three separate occasions. Caroline successfully fought to keep her daughter at home, says Ellie, but the ordeal has left the whole family with “an unimaginable amount of trauma.” Ellie says she suffered from PTSD and endured years of horrific nightmares, triggered by living with the fear from a young age that she could be forcibly separated from her family.\n\nThis underlines why prompt diagnosis is so important, says Bloom. “Our hope and dream is for people to get diagnosed when their symptoms begin.”\n\nThe search for answers\n\nIn the case of hEDS, a crucial first step is to find out what causes it.\n\nCortney Gensemer, a biomedical scientist in the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, is trying to solve this mystery. She and research mentor Russell Norris, head of the lab, have been studying a gene mutation they believe causes hEDS (the results of the study are currently under peer review).\n\nLike Poppy, Gensemer was diagnosed with hEDS as a teenager. She says the disease affects every aspect of her work. Looking down a microscope is particularly painful at times – her neck is unstable because of her hEDS, and she’s had metal screws put into some of her neck vertebrae to fuse them.\n\nCortney Gensemer working in the Norris Lab and recovering from neck surgery earlier this year. Cortney Gensemer\n\nNorris kitted the lab out with special equipment, including motion sensor doors (standard lab doors are very heavy), adjustable chairs and ergonomic pipettes that are gentle on the hands. “If I didn’t have all that stuff, I don’t think I’d be able to do it,” says Gensemer.\n\nTo find a hEDS-causing gene, Gensemer says she and Norris sampled DNA from a large family with cases spanning four generations and looked for a mutation that appears only in relatives who have the disease. They identified a “strong candidate gene” and inserted it into mice using gene editing tools.\n\nGensemer and Norris found that the hEDS mice had significantly more lax tissues, and floppier tails than regular rodents. “You can tie a loose knot into the mutant mouse tail. With a normal mouse tail, you can (only) bend it into a circle,” Gensemer says.\n\nThe gene that Gensemer and Norris found won’t account for all hEDS cases, she says. They believe that eventually multiple genes will be identified, and hEDS may be split into different subtypes. This would help to explain why different patients have different symptoms. Crucially, if genetic information sheds light on how the connective tissue is “messed up,” it could lead to effective treatments, says Gensemer.\n\nThe Ehlers-Danlos Society is also looking for genes as well as blood markers, working with a team of experts to sequence and analyze the DNA of 1,000 hEDS patients from around the world. And at the UK’s University of Warwick, Ph.D. candidate Sabeeha Malek, another scientist with hEDS, has proposed that EDS might be caused by a fault in the way that collagen binds to cell membranes in connective tissue. If she’s right, she hopes her work will lead to a skin biopsy test that could identify all forms of the disease.\n\nSabeeha Malek is working to identify biomarkers that could make EDS diagnosis easier. Sabeeha Malek\n\nProgress is being made but on a very small scale. “If you look at any major academic institution, there are multiple labs studying cancer, multiple labs studying heart disease. When you look at a disease that affects one in 500 people, and probably more than that, there should be a lab studying it at every single academic institution,” says Gensemer.\n\nGensemer hopes that as more discoveries are made and data is accumulated it will “change the way the medical community looks at the disease” – and that it will be taken more seriously.\n\nA giant kitten for my zebra\n\nA year has passed since Poppy’s diagnosis. The initial shock has subsided, and while I’m still grieving the loss of her health, we’ve both learned to accept our new reality and have adjusted to living with EDS.\n\nI’ve assembled a team of supportive doctors and therapists and acquired an arsenal of paraphernalia to fight pain and manage symptoms, including braces and kinesiology tape to hold her joints in place; ice packs, heat pads, tiger balm and arnica gel for sore muscles; and a cupboard full of medications and supplements.\n\nWith Poppy often stuck at home, I also got her a giant kitten that she calls Bagel, and he provides the best therapy.\n\nPoppy with Bagel. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nWriting this article has taught me a lot more about EDS: It’s been upsetting to report on the terrible experiences some have suffered, but I’ve been awestruck by the dedication of people, many with the condition themselves, who are working to find solutions.\n\nI don’t know what the future holds for Poppy. Some patients’ symptoms improve with age; others experience an increase in pain and a loss of mobility. I’ve learned there’s a limit to what we can control but there’s a lot we can do, to tackle symptoms and make life easier. And I believe that change is coming.\n\nWith a better understanding of the condition and diagnostic tools on the horizon, my biggest hope is that there will be a cure one day – and that it will come in time for Poppy.", "authors": ["Sarah Lazarus"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/01/17/cameron-diaz-jamie-foxx-back-in-action/77720423007/", "title": "Jamie Foxx is Cameron Diaz's biggest cheerleader on her first film in ...", "text": "Cameron Diaz is finally back, and no one's more excited than Jamie Foxx.\n\nFor their new action comedy \"Back in Action\" (streaming Friday on Netflix), the Oscar-winning actor did what no one else could: pull Diaz out of retirement.

It was a wonderful 10 years.\"\n\nThough Gordon knew there's nobody who can \"do action and comedy together quite like\" Diaz, he initially didn't approach her for the role because he was under the impression she wasn't looking for work.\n\nSo when Diaz's longtime friend Foxx, who was already on board \"Back in Action,\" suggested she could come out of retirement to play his character's wife, Gordon thought it was \"too good to be true.\"\n\nFor Diaz, the movie came along at a time, after COVID-19, when she and Madden thought it might be \"something good for our family\" to switch things up and have her get back on a set. Ultimately, though, she considered the project only because Foxx was involved.\n\n\"I knew, having made movies with Jamie in the past, that I was going to get the most talented man in show business, and the best partner,\" she says. \"If I'm leaving my family for 10 hours out of the day, it really matters who I'm doing it with.\"\n\n\"Back in Action\" stars Diaz and Foxx as a pair of spies, Emily and Matt, who leave the world of espionage behind to start a family. Years later, after dipping their toes back into their old roles by tracking their teenage daughter during a night out, they accidentally blow their cover and are pulled into the life they left behind.\n\nDiaz's character making a triumphant return after walking away from her career and prioritizing her family certainly calls to mind the actress' real-life journey, though given the script was written without knowing she would star. This \"echo between what's happening in the movie and her life\" was \"coincidence and luck,\" Gordon says.\n\nDespite a decade-long absence, it was \"kind of like muscle memory\" for Diaz to pick up where she left off, she says: \"A chef doesn't forget about how to chop.\" Indeed, the actress \"didn't even take warm-up time\" to get back in the swing of things, Gordon says. \"She was just in it immediately.\"\n\nBut work on \"Back in Action\" hit a terrifying snag in 2023 after Foxx was hospitalized midproduction with a health emergency. The comedian later revealed he suffered a stroke, which left him initially unable to walk and with no memory of 20 days.\n\nAt that point, \"Back in Action\" still had about eight days of filming to go. Some footage was shot with a body double for Foxx, though little of it ended up in the film after a rewrite of the scene. Production was further delayed by a four-month Hollywood actors strike.\n\nGordon felt \"total relief\" when Foxx, after making a full recovery, came in to look at early footage and was just like his old self, complete with his signature riffs as he joked around about the strike. \"It was really miraculous how he had healed,\" Gordon says.\n\nFilming began again in 2024 with Foxx, adding another meta layer to the film's title as he became the one back in action. The star says he and Diaz shared some \"tears\" after reuniting for the first time since his stroke, but he was eager to put these emotions aside and get back to work.\n\n\"We definitely had those somber moments where (you say), 'Man, we're glad everything worked out all right,' and you take that and you have that moment,\" he says. \"Then you put it off to the side, and you go back to doing what you're blessed to do.\"\n\nFoxx, who discussed his health scare at length in his December Netflix special \"What Had Happened Was ...,\" maintains a sense of humor about the crisis as he jokes about feeling relieved by how the film came out. \"What would have put me back in the hospital (is) if it was bad!\" he quips.\n\nSo now that Diaz is back, what might the next phase of her career look like? The actress, who welcomed her second child last year, now has a \"whole new filter\" when it comes to considering projects to take on.\n\n\"There's completely different boxes to check off than before,\" she says. \"I know the two that are most important, that are there no matter what, are my family and my time and how I spend it. After that, the rest of the boxes, I'll have to make that up as I go to see what speaks to me to make it worth my while.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/04/28/cerak-vanryn-mistaken-identity-taylor-university/83639026/", "title": "10 years later: Mistaken ID victim describes struggle", "text": "Maureen C. Gilmer\n\nIndy Star\n\nFor five agonizing weeks, Taylor University freshman Whitney Cerak lay in a hospital bed, gravely injured, unable to speak. Loved ones at her side prayed and comforted her. But they weren't her family. They weren't her friends.\n\nThey were the family and friends of another student, Laura Van Ryn.\n\nIn a tragic case of mistaken identity 10 years ago, Cerak and Van Ryn were wrongly identified in the chaos following a devastating crash on I-69 involving a semi and a van full of Taylor University students and staff.\n\nInitially, authorities said Cerak had died and Van Ryn was critically injured. Both girls were blond and had similar features. It would later be determined that the comatose, bandaged young woman in the hospital bed was Cerak. Van Ryn had died in the April 26, 2006, crash that killed three other students and a staff member.\n\nTen years after that drama unfolded before a national audience, Cerak — now Whitney Wheeler, married and the mother of three — returned to Taylor University this week to speak at a memorial for the victims.\n\n\"My family had a funeral for me,\" she told students and staff gathered in the auditorium of the small Christian college in Upland, Ind. \"A lot of people wonder what will people say about you at your funeral. I know.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't all good, she told the crowd, most of whom were in elementary or middle school when the crash occurred. She said she was surprised to find out she wasn't very good at sports, according to one speaker at her funeral, or that her sister thought she didn't shower often enough.\n\nThose were the light moments at Wednesday's memorial. There were other times when she struggled to keep her composure, particularly when she recalled what she'd been told about the accident, her recovery and the moment when she wrote her name on a card in the rehabilitation center after others began to wonder who really was in that hospital bed.\n\n\"The Van Ryns, they loved me like I was their daughter because they believed that I was their daughter. And even after I wrote 'Whitney' and their world changed and they knew that I wasn’t their daughter, they still treated me like I was their family.\"\n\nFour months after the accident, Cerak returned to Taylor and graduated with her class three years later, but it wasn't without struggle.\n\n\"Coming back to school was really hard. Nothing was making sense to me. My identity before the accident was no longer. I thought I was really social and funny, I had a lot of friends. But after April 26, those things changed,\" she said. \"The left side of my body was completely crushed, I wasn’t able to speak above a whisper.\"\n\nCerak said she alternated between feelings of sadness for those who died, guilt for being the only student to survive and anger because she wanted to retreat into herself — to be left alone. \"I felt broken.\"\n\nShe credits the Taylor community, her family and friends, but most of all, her faith for guiding her through the pain.\n\n\"To be honest, I kind of coasted by my first 18 years of life. I was doing all the right things, but that’s kind of where It stopped. I hadn't faced a trial. Tragedy has brought me closer to the Lord.\"\n\nToday, she lives in North Carolina with her husband, Matt Wheeler, and their three children.\n\nWednesday's memorial followed a chapel service on Monday during which family members of two killed in the crash spoke. Brad Larson's brother, Jeft, and Laura Van Ryn's sister, Lisa, both recalled their siblings in the emotional service. Also killed in the crash were Laurel Erb, Betsy Smith and university staff member Monica Felver\n\nJim Garringer, Taylor's spokesman now and at the time of the accident, said the decade since has provided a time of healing.\n\n\"Just remembering those difficult days, and reflecting back to when we first learned Whitney had lived and that it was actually Laura who died, I and so many in the Taylor community were so thankful Whitney could come back to campus again,\" he said.\n\nWatch Cerak's speech here:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/03/09/the-birdcage-25-years-anniversary-facts-robin-williams-nathan-lane/6932174002/", "title": "'The Birdcage' is 25 years old. See 25 facts about the iconic movie", "text": "Grab your white wine! The schnecken beckons! This week marks the 25th anniversary of \"The Birdcage,\" the smash hit directed by Mike Nichols with a screenplay by Elaine May, starring Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest, Hank Azaria, Dan Futterman and Calista Flockhart.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, gay marriage was not only illegal, it was banned in most states. But on March 8, 1996, audiences flocked to see something unusual in movie theaters: a lighthearted movie where openly gay men were the heroes and a family with gay parents was loving, happy and committed.\n\nThe film not only gave Lane, Flockhart and Azaria their first big Hollywood breaks, it may have helped make mainstream the idea of a non-heterosexual family.\n\nThe plot of \"The Birdcage\" is simple. Armand Goldman (a subdued, sarcastic Williams) runs a successful drag club in South Beach, Miami, and his longtime life-partner, Albert (Lane at his flamboyant, high-strung diva best), is the star. Armand's son (Futterman) gets engaged to a young woman (Flockhart) whose parents are ultra-conservative (Hackman and Wiest). All Armand's son is asking is for Armand to change his clothes, house decorations, job, voice, mannerisms, and, well, Albert, and play it straight for the length of one uncomfortable dinner.\n\nRobin Williams was fresh from his own gender-bending movie, \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" which broke a different kind of cultural ground by showing flexible gender roles and demonstrating how separated parents can work out what's best for their kids — without Hollywood magic somehow reuniting them.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn honor of the film's anniversary, here are 25 facts you may not know.\n\n1. The time was right\n\nAmerica was just about ready for this. At the time Ellen DeGeneres had not yet come out. Two recent movies featuring drag queens — \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" and \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar\" had been released to mixed reviews and decent-if-not-great box office.\n\nDid Robin Williams' name help bring more people into the theaters? No way to know, But within a few years after \"The Birdcage\" there was \"In & Out,\" \"Will & Grace,\" \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,\" \"The L Word,\" \"Queer as Folk,\" \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and more, all bringing more gay people into mainstream entertainment.\n\n2. \"The Birdcage\" was the 7th incarnation of the French farce \"La Cage aux Folles\"\n\n\"La Cage aux Folles\" (\"The Cage of Madwomen\") is a 1973 French play by Jean Poiret and Francis Veber with more or less the same plot as above, just substitute Saint-Tropez for South Beach. It was made into a French-Italian movie in 1978, had two sequels, spawned an American TV pilot called \"Adam and Yves\" that failed, and was adapted as a hugely successful U.S. musical in 1983 with book by Harvey Fierstein and music and lyrics by Jerry Herman. More recently there was a Broadway revival with a new version starring Kelsey Grammer.\n\n3. It was the first Elaine May/Mike Nichols movie collaboration\n\nYounger audiences may not grasp the significance, but Elaine May and Mike Nichols were a massively influential comedy duo in the 50s and 60s who redefined both improv and standup comedy with multiple appearances on stage and TV before launching a year-long, sold-out Broadway show together. They separated afterwards at the height of their fame to become successful individually in stage and cinema.\n\nNichols saw the 1978 \"La Cage aux Folles\" film and wanted to Americanize it — he was briefly involved with the Broadway musical — and 15 years later, three decades after he and May had ended their partnership, they teamed up to create \"The Birdcage.\"\n\nThey reunited again two years later to write and direct \"Primary Colors.\"\n\nMore:Nichols captured human behavior, funny or not\n\n4. Most of the improvising happened in rehearsal\n\nIt can be difficult to corral brilliant comic improvisors such as Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, but Nichols insisted on weeks of rehearsal — not a common thing for movies — and let them improvise all they wanted then. The best ideas went into the script because Nichols wanted to shoot the movie as much like a play as possible, without much editing.\n\n\"We sort of got all the improvising out of our systems the first two weeks, and then we shot basically what we all agreed on,\" Hank Azaria told The A.V. Club. \"And it was very tough for Robin, who really wanted to still go bananas.\"\n\nBut Nichols recognized there was only so much you could do.\n\n\"(Nichols) very generously would say, all right, I will give you a wild take to get it all out of your system,\" Lane said in an interview with The Last Laugh podcast, \"and say whatever it is that you're dying to say or if you have an idea you want to pursue, and you know, a few things came out of that.\"\n\n5. Only parts of the movie were filmed in Miami\n\nThe incredible opening tracking shot starts with the camera sailing over the Atlantic Ocean to cross Lummus Park to enter Armand's nightclub The Birdcage, or, as it's known in real life, the Carlyle Hotel at 1250 Ocean Drive.\n\nWhile most of the movie was shot in Hollywood, several exterior scenes were shot at various locations at the beach and in the Art Deco section of South Beach, including Albert's shopping stroll down Lincoln Road and the palimony scene at the bus stop next to Biscayne Bay.\n\n6. Armand was almost Steve Martin, with Robin Williams playing Albert\n\nNichols had directed Martin and Williams in \"Waiting for Godot\" a few years earlier and they were set for this movie, but schedule conflicts prevented Martin from staying in.\n\n7. Robin Williams didn't want to play Albert anyway\n\nThat turned out to be a good thing because Williams had just done a movie wearing women's clothing in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and he wanted the acting challenge of playing against his usual type to be the calm one for a change.\n\n\"I wanted to play Armand because it gave me an opportunity to portray a very dry type of comedy versus being outrageous,\" Williams said. \"It was very interesting because it's restrained and reactive ... finding different layers of behavior.\"\n\nNichols believed he nailed it. \"What I wanted in Armand was a kind of suppressed hysteria; someone who could appear perfectly straight and ordinary, but with a little something just under the surface that he can't completely control. Robin played that brilliantly.\"\n\n8. This was Nathan Lane's first big break. And he turned it down\n\nIn movies, anyway. Lane was already becoming a name on Broadway but to this point his movie appearances were limited to bit parts in \"Jeffrey,\" \"The Addams Family\" and others, and as the voice of Timmon in the animated \"Lion King.\" Nichols offered him the part while he as starring in \"Laughter on the 23rd Floor\" by longtime Nichols collaborator Neil Simon.\n\n\"To have Mike Nichols come backstage and say, 'I'd like you to star in a movie,' was a dream come true,\" Lane said.\n\nBut then he turned it down.\n\nHe really wanted this opportunity, but Lane was committed to starring in a revival of \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,\" so he regretfully declined.\n\nBut, as Lane told The Last Laugh, Nichols kept calling Lane while he was working on the play, even once from Ireland, to tell him, \"You know, I'm seeing all these people, and I keep thinking you're the guy ...\"\n\nLane says he told him, \"You're Mike Nichols. Perhaps if you called (director) Scott Rudin, we could work something out.\" And Nichols did, and the play was pushed back so Lane could become Albert.\n\n\"Ultimately it worked out for everybody because the movie came out and fortunately was a success and that was just before we started,\" Lane said.\n\n9. It wasn't originally called \"The Birdcage\"\n\nOn early drafts of the screenplay, the movie was titled \"Birds of a Feather.\"\n\n10. \"The Birdcage\" was a big break for other actors, too\n\nCalista Flockhart didn't have much of a Hollywood resume at this point, but Nichols saw her in an off-Broadway production of \"The Loop\" and signed her up. She may be able to thank \"The Birdcage\" for \"Ally McBeal\" the next year. And while Hank Azaria was known for his voices in \"The Simpsons\" and a few movie roles, it was his scene-stealing portrayal of Armand and Albert's Guatemalan houseman Agador Spartacus that got him noticed on the big screen.\n\nBut that almost didn't happen. At first, Azaria was playing a much smaller part as a stage manager.\n\n11. David Allen Grier was the original butler\n\nIn the first drafts the butler was a Black man, as he was in the original French version. After the first read through they decided to make a change, as Azaria explained to The A.V. Club.\n\n\"And they thought David was brilliant, but they thought that in an American context, the idea of a Black houseman would be somewhat distasteful and have racist overtones,\" Azaria said. \"So since it’s set in Miami, they decided to make it a Latin character. And I was already playing the other character. So I think it was Robin Williams’ idea: 'Why not just combine the two roles and just let Azaria do it?'\"\n\n12. It was such a funny movie the director couldn't stop laughing and had to be covered up\n\nWhen you get that cast together, it can be tough not to laugh, and the director had an especially tough time of it. \"Mike Nichols would laugh so hard they would have to put a blanket over his head,\" Robin Williams said during a Reddit AMA.\n\n13. Was Nathan Lane intimidated having to act against comedic force-of-nature Robin Williams?\n\nNope. \"Because of him. Because he was a saint, he was a kind, generous, sensitive soul,\" Lane said.\n\n\"He was a real actor, and he wanted the challenge of playing that role, and he graciously shared the scene. And certainly, he was a movie star who could have said, 'I don't want to do it with this guy, get me Billy Crystal.'\"\n\nWatch: Great scenes from movies starring Robin Williams\n\n14. Mike Nichols was sure the film would prove his haters wrong\n\nNot all of Nichols' films have been critical or commercial successes. But after screening the final cut of \"The Birdcage\" for his editing team in Martha's Vineyard, the director said he felt confident the movie would stick it to his detractors.\n\n“I was very emotional and very angry: I couldn’t speak all through lunch,” he said in his 2000 profile in The New Yorker. \"The film was so good, so strong. I realized I’d had no inkling of my anger at the people who had written me off. My reaction, instantaneously, was '(expletive) you, bastards. You thought I couldn’t do this anymore. Well, look at this.' \"\n\n15. \"The Birdcage\" features original Stephen Sondheim music\n\nThree songs, in fact. Broadway legend Sondheim wrote \"Little Dream\" for the movie; Albert sings it in the rehearsal scene. \"Love Is In The Air,\" sung by Armand and Val's biological mother Katherine (Christine Baranski) in her office, was the original opening number for \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.\" And the song Albert sings while performing in the club, \"Can That Boy Foxtrot,\" was cut from Sondheim's \"Follies.\"\n\nSondheim also wrote \"It Takes All Kinds\" for \"The Birdcage\" as the theme of the movie to be played under the opening title. But Nichols decided to go with \"We Are Family\" by Sister Sledge instead.\n\n16. Robin Williams' fall during the kitchen scene was accidental, but they left it in\n\nAs the dinner is crashing and burning and Armand is getting frantic in the kitchen, he slips and falls to the floor out of scene only to jump back up, scream at Agador, and run out. Only it wasn't supposed to happen and you can see Williams, Azaria and Futterman visibly trying to control their laughter.\n\n\"You'll see I'm kind of laughing, and I have to pretend I'm crying,\" Azaria told the Daily News. \"That was completely a mistake, and it ended up in the movie.\"\n\n17. Williams ad-libbed the end of the toothbrush scene\n\nAfter Albert grabs a small bag and dramatically announces he is going off to Los Copa, presumably to die, Armand says, \"Oh I see, so you're going to a cemetery, with your toothbrush.\"\n\nWilliams improvised the closer, \"How Egyptian,\" and it stuck.\n\nOther adlibs included Lane's \"When the schnecken beckons.\"\n\n18. The long opening tracking shot was actually three shots\n\nThe spectacular two-minute scene was created by Oscar-winning cinematographer Emmanuel \"Chivo\" Lubezki (\"Birdman,\" \"Gravity\") and consisted of a helicopter flying in over the ocean, then a Steadicam operator on a crane getting lowered to the ground so he could walk into the club's front door, and finally the interior of the club filmed on a soundstage in Hollywood, all nicely edited together.\n\n19. Agador was based on Judy Garland's dresser and Hank Azaria's grandmother\n\nAzaria told Vanity Fair, for an article on Nichols, that when he admitted he was having a problem understanding Agador in his introductory scene when he is soothing a frantic Albert, the director told him the character was partly based on Judy Garland's dresser.\n\n\"Judy would panic before every performance and her dresser would panic with her and he would panic more than her so that she’d have to be the one to tell him to calm down,\" Azaria said, \"and that was the ritual they had.\"\n\nAs for the voice ... Azaria had a couple of voices he was trying out, a deeper one and the higher pitched one. He asked a friend who was a drag performer and they settled on the second one. It was several weeks into the production that Azaria — who grew up in a Sephardic Jewish household where Ladino, a Spanish dialect, was spoken — realized he was just imitating his grandmother's accent and personality.\n\n20. Ages can be deceiving\n\nCalista Flockhart, playing the \"not even 18\" character of Barbara, was 31 at the time. Dan Futterman, then 28, was playing the 20-year-old Val.\n\n21. The actors were very aware of the potential pitfalls\n\nNathan Lane, who portrayed the most flamboyant of the characters, tried not to go to the stereotype well. \"It's not about extremes,\" he said. \"I just tried to be more feminine and softer. When Albert is in drag, it's a performance, and though he's melodramatic at times — as many performers are — at home he loves being a family man.\"\n\n\"I think it's true of Elaine's script that you come away with a sense that there's love and dignity to all these characters, however eccentric they are,\" Christine Baranski said. \"Love levels things; unconditional love can normalize any situation.\"\n\nThere were (and are) some complaints.\n\n\"When it came out, the gay press was very hard on it,\" said Lane, who had come out to friends and family as gay in his 20s but had not made it public at the time of the movie, even ducking Oprah's questions about it during an interview.\n\nBut for the most part \"The Birdcage\" was well-received for its portrayals for a loving gay family. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) said, \"We have seen so many films with very one-dimensional stereotypical characters. Their purpose has been to play the 'straight man' to rounds of jokes. In 'The Birdcage' we go beyond the stereotypes to see the characters' depth and humanity.\"\n\n22. Williams' history of dance montage was choreographed, but the ending was improvised\n\nDuring a rehearsal for the dancer Celsius, who's a little slow, Armand launches into a wild demonstration of dance styles (put together by the movie's choreographer Vincent Paterson on William's request) as inspiration for him. \"You do an eclectic celebration of the dance! You do Fosse, Fosse, Fosse! You do Martha Graham, Martha Graham, Martha Graham! Or Twyla, Twyla, Twyla! Or Michael Kidd, Michael Kidd, Michael Kidd, Michael Kidd! Or Madonna, Madonna, Madonna!\"\n\nBut there was a question that it might be too Robin-Williamsy and take people out of the movie, but someone suggested the perfect ending. Stories say that was Nichols, but Lane claimed it in a recent interview.\n\n\"It was Robin and I and Mike, we were all standing there, and he's saying I dunno and what about, you know, and so Robin and I... I said, you know, a director once said to me, 'I love what you're doing, but keep it all inside.'\"\n\nBonus fact from IMDB: the actor who played Celsius, Luca Tommassini, did actually dance in Madonna's 1993 The Girlie Show World Tour.\n\n23. Hank Azaria worried about his portrayal of Agador\n\n\"I think whenever you have straight or gay actors portraying gays in a humorous way, you are making fun of what you also are treating lovingly at the same time,\" Azaria said in an interview with The Daily News. \"That definitely lends itself to a crossing of the line. I certainly can understand gay or Latin people having a problem with what I did… but I felt it was authentic in its own way. I definitely did my best to make him a three-dimensional person, someone who wasn't just funny, but was also touching and sweet in his own way.\"\n\n24. \"The Birdcage\" made a few bucks\n\n\"The Birdcage\" reportedly cost $31 million to make. It opened at #1 with $18.3 million on its opening weekend, the highest grossing opening of a movie with openly gay lead characters until Sascha Baron Cohen's \"Bruno\" in 2009, and it stayed at #1 for four weeks.\n\nThe total box office for \"The Birdcage\" was over $185 million worldwide, making it Mike Nichols' most financially successful movie.\n\n25. Yes, a sequel was actually considered\n\nIn 2018 the hosts of a British podcast, \"Beyond the Boxset,\" that claims it \"pitches the sequels that nobody asked for,\" wondered \"how Nathan Lane's flamboyant Albert would cope with the loss of his remarkably patient life partner. Not to mention the tantalizing/terrifying notion of how Agador Spartacus' personal style might have evolved as he entered his mid-fifties ...\" \"Birdcage 2: Starina Rides Again\" includes pitches for different versions, and Nathan Lane heard about it.\n\nWhat they came up with was Albert traveling to Guatemala with Agador. \"It's a really smart, funny pitch,\" Lane said. So, what the heck, he sent it to his manager, who sent it to MGM. MGM optioned it... but Hank Azaria stopped it cold, saying he couldn't possibly play the part.\n\nAzaria told Lane he loved playing the character but it wasn't appropriate now and they should get a Latin actor.\n\n\"He said, 'I have one word for you: Apu,'\" Lane said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/02/09/buddy-holly-ritchie-valens-and-j-p-richardson-60-years-later-winter-dance-party-clear-lake-iowa/2164137002/", "title": "Finding Buddy Holly at the Winter Dance Party, where the music still ...", "text": "It was a three-hour drive between my small hometown and college, mostly on two-lane roads. Ample time for radio, then still in an AM world. Plenty of time for a song running 8 ½ minutes if WLS or some other station played the full \"American Pie.\"\n\n\"February made me shiver\" I fully understood, making that trek to and from the University of Illinois in early 1972. But much of Don McLean's opus was a mystery for an 18-year-old, even one steadfastly enamored with Elvis Presley since his 1968 comeback.\n\nRather than being pushed forward into album rock — one can only tolerate so much Jethro Tull flute — I was drawn back to what McLean christened as \"the day the music died.\"\n\nFeb. 3, 1959, as I would come to learn, was the date that the four-seat plane carrying Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, J.P. Richardson (Big Bopper) and pilot Roger Peterson crashed into farmland just minutes after taking off from Mason City, Iowa, on an intended flight to Fargo, North Dakota.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nNot that I knew nothing of Holly before \"American Pie.\" But it grew clear that an occasional listen to \"That'll Be the Day\" wasn't enough to understand a much more profound influence.\n\nConsider what Bob Dylan said when he finally delivered the mandatory lecture for receiving the 2016 Nobel Prize in literature, after eight months of reflection on the unprecedented honor for a songwriter.\n\n\"I guess I'd have to start with Buddy Holly. ... From the moment I first heard him, I felt akin. I felt related, like he was an older brother.\n\n\"Buddy played the music that I loved — the music I grew up on: country-western, rock 'n' roll, and rhythm and blues. Three separate strands of music that he intertwined and infused into one genre ... and Buddy wrote songs — songs that had beautiful melodies and imaginative verses. ... He was the archetype. Everything I wasn't and wanted to be.\"\n\nThe Winter Dance Party tour played at the National Guard Armory in Duluth, Minnesota, on Jan. 31, 1959, three days before the crash killing Holly.\n\nThe 17-year-old Robert Zimmerman, soon to change his name to Bob Dylan, was up front in rapt attention.\n\n\"I was only six feet away,\" Dylan said in his Nobel lecture. \"He was mesmerizing. ... Something about him seemed permanent, and he filled me with conviction.\n\n\"Then out of the blue, the most uncanny thing happened. He looked me right straight dead in the eye, and he transmitted something. Something I didn't know what. And it gave me the chills.\"\n\nMike Evans was 17 and a senior at Mason City High School, Class of 1959. He'd been to the Surf Ballroom in nearby Clear Lake for dances before and figured $1.25 for admission to see Buddy Holly and the host of other performers was well worth a 13-mile drive, even on a school night.\n\n\"Me and a bunch of guys drove over in my '52 Plymouth,\" Evans said. \"I think it was probably one of the largest crowds they ever had, something like 1,500 people.\"\n\nTeenagers crowded around the stage depending on their level of interest in each of the Winter Dance Party performers, but most were there to dance.\n\nClear Lake was the 11th stop in as many days across three states. The Big Bopper was fighting a cold from touring for almost two weeks in the frigid upper Midwest.\n\nTwo shows had been scheduled for Feb. 1, but the matinee in Appleton, Wisconsin, was cancelled when the tour bus broke down on the overnight drive from Duluth, Minnesota. Temperatures were 20 below when the bus gave out 10 miles outside Hurley, Wisconsin. When the performers finally reached Green Bay, Wisconsin, drummer Carl Bunch was not with them; he had been taken to a hospital for treatment of frostbitten feet.\n\nIt was another 350-mile trek, in a new bus, from Green Bay to Clear Lake for the Feb. 2 show at the Surf Ballroom.\n\nThere, Buddy Holly played the drums for Dion and the Belmonts, Evans said. \"Not a lot of people realized that at the time.\"\n\nOr that Waylon Jennings, then an unknown from Holly's hometown of Lubbock, Texas, was playing bass for a touring version of the Crickets. Or about the travel concerns.\n\n\"At the end all three came out and performed for 15-20 minutes together,\" Evans said. \"That was kind of cool. It made me appreciate their performance more after hearing about the problems with the bus.\"\n\nEvans left the Surf after midnight, driving past the Mason City Airport on his way home. \"It was spitting a little snow, but nothing serious,\" he says. \"Roads were a little slick but not bad.\"\n\nAt 1 a.m., a Beechcraft Bonanza took off from the airport. The private plane crashed five miles into its flight, killing all on board.\n\nOn his way to school the next day, Evans learned of the crash on Mason City radio station KRIB from Bob Hale, a local disc jockey who emceed the Surf show.\n\n\"We decided we were going to go over the crash site,\" ditching school, Evans said.\n\n\"We couldn't get real close. It's out in the middle of the field. That airplane just rolled up into a ball into a barb-wire fence. It was a mess. We all felt pretty bad about it, that's for sure.\"\n\nEvans now is 77, coming up on his 60th high school reunion. He lives in Sun City West with a spare bedroom stocked with memories of his intersection with rock 'n' roll history.\n\nThere's a sign promoting the water feature of Clear Lake — So Close, So Enticing! —along with drawings of the Surf Ballroom and the Barrel Drive-In (now gone), framed albums tied to the Winter Dance Party stars and an enhanced version of the tour promotional poster including 45 records from Holly, Valens and Dion.\n\nWhen Evans says he's from Mason City/Clear Lake, the link to Holly is often instantaneous. \"It's amazing how many people still remember. I think the music was born instead of died. The only sad thing about is was he didn't write 100 more songs.\"\n\nMike Randall has been told most of his life that he looks like Buddy Holly.\n\nDuring high school in southern Illinois in the 1970s, he played in a band called Four on the Floor with his brothers, sometimes joining with a teachers band called Impending Shame to play at sock hops.\n\n\"I had no intention of playing '50s music as a career for my life,\" Randall said. \"It wasn't my era.\" He studied jazz in college, then while living in California tried to make a living as a songwriter. \"Things didn't work out.\"\n\nRandall moved to Arizona, starting a career in the automotive industry. But auditing and handling service contracts is only so rewarding for a musician. So he agreed to play Holly for a 50th birthday party, a gig that went over well enough to become the \"most exciting thing going on in my music career.\"\n\nHe formed Come Back Buddy, a three-piece '50s tribute band that includes his now-wife, Janine, various drummers and sometimes his brother Dean. The group has been together for 20 years.\n\n\"Growing up in the Midwest, hardly anybody had faith in doing music for a living,\" Randall said. \"I always kept my day job and was afraid to make the plunge.\" That decision was made for him in 2012 with a round of job cuts. \"It's gotten busier and busier since then,\" for Come Back Buddy, with up to five performances a week, he said.\n\n\"Buddy Holly's music means so much to people. It's meaningful for my life. Some of it I can't really explain. I get to do things Buddy Holly would like to do,\" he said.\n\nRandall plays a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar like the one Holly used when he burst into the national consciousness in 1957.\n\nRandall's work is just one reason Holly's legacy remains alive.\n\n\"The Buddy Holly Story,\" a 1978 film that earned an Academy Award nomination for Gary Busey, provided important momentum ahead of the 20th anniversary of the crash.\n\nThe first Holly tribute concert at the Surf Ballroom came in February 1979, with Wolfman Jack as the emcee for a one-night event featuring Del Shannon.\n\nLou Diamond Phillips played Valens in the well-received 1987 film \"La Bamba.\"\n\nThe jukebox musical \"Buddy\" debuted in 1989 in London, where it had a 12-year run. The show has toured around the world, including 225 performances on Broadway.\n\nJohn Goldrosen wrote the first major biography about Holly — \"Buddy Holly: His Life and Music\" — in 1975, then updated that work with \"Remembering Buddy\" in 1986.\n\nLarry Lehmer expanded on his newspaper reporting about Holly and the Winter Dance Party tour for the Des Moines Register to produce \"The Day the Music Died\" in 1997, a year after Phillip Norman's Holly biography \"Rave On.\"\n\nJohn Mueller, who played Holly in the musical, has ongoing life in the role with the Winter Dance Party, a re-creation of the 1959 tour that still earns positive reviews after a decade of performances.\n\nMORE: 'American Pie' isn't a song about Buddy Holly, Don McLean says\n\nLehmer was a 13-year-old growing up near Council Bluffs, Iowa, when Holly's plane went down some 250 miles away.\n\n\"I had no idea musicians of that stature were traveling in small planes around the Midwest,\" he says. \"I didn't know where Clear Lake was or why they would be there. It was always a mystery to me.\"\n\nThat riddle consumed much of Lehmer's life for close to two decades until \"The Day the Music Died\" was published. His detailed work includes the Civil Aeronautics Board report on the crash that found the probable cause to be pilot error for attempting a flight \"which would necessitate flying solely on instruments when he (21-year-old Peterson) was not properly certificated or qualified to do so.\"\n\nLehmer mostly buys that explanation, although he's heard and tried to run down all the more conspiratorial theories: that Holly's gun was fired on the plane, that there was a fight in the cockpit, that an argument over drugs and perhaps rerouting the flight to Minneapolis for their acquisition played a role.\n\n\"The candy bars at the crash site (that some link to drug use) always seemed odd,\" Lehmer said.\n\nPerhaps more plausible is the question of whether the small plane was properly balanced depending where Holly (145 pounds) and Richardson (perhaps as much as 210) were sitting. If the Big Bopper, as most believe, was in the back, then the Bonanza's center of gravity could have been beyond allowable limits, creating handling problems for Peterson.\n\nAn effort has been made to have the National Transportation Safety Board reinvestigate the plane crash, particularly based on the balance issue and potential mechanical failure.\n\nThe number of and passion of Holly fans surprised Lehmer as it helped him sell books.\n\n\"It's almost like there is a competition to see who is the biggest Buddy Holly fan,\" said Lehmer, whose book on \"American Bandstand\" is due out this spring.\n\nWaylon Jennings is buried a mile from my house, at a cemetery in Mesa. He died in Arizona in 2002 at 64 after years of poor health.\n\nMemorials on his grave during a recent visit included Bud Light cans, guitar picks, coins, a small pink mailbox and items symbolizing his outlaw country stardom with Willie Nelson.\n\nThe Jennings that interests me is the 21-year-old version, who while working as a disc jockey in Lubbock in 1958 became friends with Holly, already a national sensation from his early hit records with the Crickets.\n\nJennings could sing, and Holly took a swipe at producing his first record. \"When Sin Stops/Jole Blon\" went nowhere — it doesn't even sound like the \"Good-Hearted Woman\" Jennings. But when Holly and the Crickets went separate ways, Buddy gave Jennings a bass guitar as a sort of Christmas gift and two weeks to learn to play it to be part of his backup band for the Winter Dance Tour.\n\nAll of that was a precursor to that Monday night at the Surf Ballroom and the backstage lobbying for one of the two seats alongside Holly on the plane to Fargo.\n\nLehmer says Jennings first told him the seemingly prophetic story of the final minutes after the performance before Holly, Valens and Richardson left for the Mason City airport. Holly gave Jennings some grief about giving up his spot to the ailing Big Bopper.\n\n\"Well, I hope your old bus freezes up again,\" Holly said.\n\n\"Well, hell, I hope your old plane crashes,\" Jennings shot back.\n\nLehmer says by the time his book came out, Jennings had repeated that story 50 times.\n\nOn my visit to Jennings' grave, two good old boys are there too, sitting in a van. They seem nice enough at a cemetery in the light of day, although I wonder if I'd want to meet up with them in a country bar after a few too many.\n\nI tell them the Surf Ballroom story, about how Jennings could have been on the plane, how Valens was because he called heads to win a coin toss with Tommy Allsup, another Holly band member on the tour. They seem impressed and watch from the van while I'm at the gravesite. They wish me well when I leave.\n\nI forgot to tell them my next stop would be the Surf Ballroom.\n\nClear Lake, Iowa\n\nThe temperature reached minus 28 overnight when I arrived for the 40th Winter Dance Party Jan. 30-Feb. 2, grown from a one-day tribute concert in 1979 to an annual four-day pilgrimage for many. \"It's the family reunion you want to go to,\" says music heritage preservationist Sherry Davis, who teams with her twin sister, Sheryl, on The Surf Speaks living history project.\n\nIt's colder than I remember it being at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Korea, where for a few days I was the coldest I'd ever been.\n\nBy Saturday morning, Feb. 2, it's less frigid while I make a quarter-mile hike from the rural intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue outside Mason City. The cross streets are easy to locate because of giant Holly trademark glasses marking the only access to the crash site.\n\nThe wind, gusting to 23 mph, is louder than the conversation given the cold and the timing. It was 60 years minus 15 hours from the moment the plane narrowly avoided hitting the Juhl family farmhouse only to crash a half-mile away.\n\nThe largest part of the wreckage landed up against a barbed wire fence, where a modest memorial stands.\n\nThe stainless steel guitar memorial on this day, of all days, is not complete. Of three steel records representing the performers, Holly's is missing, knocked off by a snowplow and under repair at the Surf Ballroom.\n\nA woman visiting from England slips and falls to the ground. She's not injured, but the incident adds to an unnerving feeling. Mallory Huffman, Surf education coordinator, places a lei around the memorial. It's from a Hawaiian fan who couldn't make it to the Winter Dance Party this year but sent her respects.\n\nThe Surf Ballroom maple dance floor is 6,300 square feet, 25 percent larger than a NBA basketball court. Booths ring the floor on two sides with an ocean beach club motif dating to the original Surf, which was built in 1933 across the street from the current location on the shore of Clear Lake.\n\nCount Basie, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey were among those playing the Surf in the big-band era.\n\nA fire destroyed it in 1947, but the music didn't die then, either. The current Surf opened 15 months later, in July 1948, with then manager Carroll Anderson more than willing to book rock 'n' roll acts at the dawn of that era.\n\nBooth seating is a tough ticket today at the Winter Dance Party and businesses quickly snatch up the tables, on the fringe of the dance floor. The only other seating is in the adjacent Cypress Room, now primarily a museum area.\n\nSo standing room is the way most take in the five-hour concerts each night, a physical challenge for the event's Baby Booomer demographic. Few complain or even act their age, and it's easy to envision 70-year-olds as teenagers.\n\n\"We've grown old with the Surf,\" says Jeff Waters, who met his now-wife, Kathy, in January 2002 and proposed to her a month later at the Winter Dance Party. They were married in June 2002, when Jeff was 60, and have only missed the party once ever since.\n\n\"A lot of us are just amazed it's lasted as long as it has,\" says Robin Luke, who performed with Holly on \"American Bandstand\" in 1958 and made his Winter Dance Party debut this year. \"When I think SiriusXM and others are still playing music on a regular basis, it sort of flabbergasts me. At the same time, I am an oldie-but-goodie kind of guy, and I've always loved old time rock 'n' roll.\n\n\"The reason people still dig it is that it's three chords and a prayer. The music is easy to remember, easy to sing and there's memories. What's amazing to me is there are quite a few young people here.\"\n\nLike Grace Siem, a 17-year-old from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, attending with her mother. Yes, this is her grandfather's music, she said, but it's hers now, too.\n\n\"Once I got a hold of it, I just dived in all the way. It's such a unique sound. There's not really anything like that today. It was something I really grew to enjoy.\n\n\"It's so crucial we get to know history, and what better way to do it than through music. It takes you back to a completely different time, and it's an experience every young person should have.\"\n\nThe Davis twins were like Siem in the 1990s. \"We would sing (Valens) 'La Bamba' every day to our bus driver,\" in fifth grade, Sheryl said. \"We thought we were driving him crazy, but he actually really enjoyed it. We would put on little rock 'n' roll review shows for our parents and grandparents and rehash some of those (movie) scenes. Great music is great music no matter what year it's from.\"\n\nNow Sherry and Sheryl are writing about the architectural phenomenology of the Surf Ballroom Winter Dance Party for an upcoming book, \"Remembering Popular Music's Past: Heritage-History-Memory.\" They also are working with the Everly Brothers Childhood Home Foundation to help preserve the tiny home where Holly's rock 'n' roll contemporaries Don and Phil Everly grew up in Shenandoah, Iowa.\n\n\"I basically consumed everything a person could consume from afar about this history and all these artists,\" Sherry said. Then she attended her first Winter Dance Party in 2016 and discovered something. \"I basically knew nothing until I got here. It gave me a new patina to my knowledge. It's the closest any living person can be to that history, but even more to that era. I don't think there's any other event where all these forces converge.\"\n\nPaul McCartney owns publishing rights to Holly's music and has since 1976. He's never played at the Winter Dance Party even though he and John Lennon named the Beatles after Holly's Crickets. When they were the Quarrymen, in 1958, their first recording was \"That'll Be the Day.\"\n\nThe Beatles' presence is felt at the Winter Dance Party because of their evolution from Holly's influence. McCartney's 1987 rockumentary \"The Real Buddy Holly Story,\" his answer to inaccuracies in the 1978 film, is shown daily during the Winter Dance Party at the Clear Lake Arts Center.\n\n\"There's something about the lyricism in Buddy Holly's words and in his melodies, I can see how that might have resonated with the English soul perhaps more than the Elvis-crazed United States rock 'n' roll,\" says Mark Morton, a Texas Tech music professor in Holly's hometown of Lubbock.\n\nAn accomplished musician who sounds like a cross between Lennon and McCartney, Morton teaches a class called \"The Music of the Beatles.\"\n\n\"Where Buddy Holly sadly was cut short in exploring beyond the 12-bar blues and beyond the three basic chords, that's where the Beatles really picked up the mantle and explored that beyond anyone's imagination,\" Morton said.\n\n\"I might go so far as to say it was the Beatles that saved tonality. That's a very big responsibility that started with Buddy Holly and carried on with the Beatles and beyond.\"\n\nWhen McCartney plays Phoenix on June 26, just after he turns 77, hope he includes Holly's \"Words of Love\" — or, better yet, make enough noise until he sings it. There's no mistaking where the Beatles' 1964 version originated, mixed in with some London mod sound, Morton said.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to have tickets for the Rolling Stones on May 7, maybe Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, both 75, will play Holly's \"Not Fade Away,\" their first U.S. single in 1964 and an opening song on previous Stones' tours.\n\nHolly, if still alive, would be 82. Would he, too, still be performing? Perhaps coming on stage for a turn with his proteges? If Tony Bennett is still out there at 92 and recording with Lady Gaga, why wouldn't that be possible for someone as creative as Holly?\n\n\"He's like Mozart,\" Morton said. \"Classical musicians wonder all the time what classical music would have been like through the 19th century had Mozart lived to 50 or 60. In a similar way, it was Beethoven that took the mantle from Mozart similar to the Beatles from Buddy Holly.\n\n\"Near the end of his short career, that's when he started to explore other harmonies. We can only conjecture what amazing things he could have come up with. The best we can do is listen to the Beatles.\"\n\nChubby Checker is through with a raucous one-hour set that would have done in a younger man, let alone one who is 77.\n\nThe final night of the Winter Dance Party is winding down, with a traditional three stars tribute to Holly, Valens and Bopper. Some in attendance are planning a trip to the plane crash site, now just an hour away from the exact 60th anniversary.\n\nIt's the time the coin flip was held in 1959, sparing Tommy Allsup, who later opened the Heads Up Saloon in Fort Worth, Texas. Valens called heads to win his seat on the plane.\n\nIt's 39 degrees and foggy 60 years later on the early minutes of Feb. 3. Driving along U.S. Highway 18, the Mason City Municipal Airport is almost invisible. Visibility at 1 a.m. is 437 yards. No planes are taking off on this night.\n\nIf only that had been the case in 1959. Peterson might have said: Sorry Buddy, I'll be happy to refund you and your pals $36 each for the tickets to Fargo. Or maybe we can try again in the morning. It'll be safer.\n\nJeff Metcalfe reports on Arizona State University sports and the Olympics for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

Beyond star-studded premieres and red carpet glamour, movies at this year's fest offer a glimpse into the diverse and often challenging stories that are shaping our cultural landscape. From mythical creatures to mind-bending thrillers and poignant documentaries, the lineup is a wild ride through genres and emotions. We're talking unicorn carcasses, tech-fueled terror and a whole lot of Nicolas Cage. We're anticipating a festival that not only entertains, but also challenges us to reflect on the world around us, one frame at a time.\n\nHere are 12 films we're looking forward to at the festival.\n\n'Age of Disclosure' (World premiere)\n\nWe get our own Area 51 at SXSW this year with \"Age of Disclosure.\" This isn't your average alien conspiracy flick. We're talking 34 high-ranking government officials, military brass and intelligence gurus spilling the beans on an alleged 80-year cover-up. Think \"Men in Black\" meets a Congressional hearing, with Lue Elizondo, Marco Rubio, and a whole host of insiders speaking of a secret war to reverse-engineer alien tech. Does humanity's future hang in the balance? This documentary is giving us a front-row seat to the bi-partisan effort to expose it all. With recent Congressional hearings and proposed legislation on UAPs, this film is landing at a moment when the truth might finally be stranger than fiction.\n\nShow times: 2:30 p.m. Sunday, Paramount Theatre; 6 p.m. Tuesday, Paramount Theatre\n\n'Another Simple Favor' (World premiere)\n\nThe upcoming \"A Simple Favor\" sequel is generating buzz for more than just its plot. In the movie, Anna Kendrick's Stephanie Smothers is pulled back into the orbit of Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) for Emily's wedding to a mysterious Italian tycoon. Behind the scenes, drama swirled. Lively's legal disputes with \"It Ends With Us\" director Justin Baldoni have cast a shadow over the production, and rumors of friction between Kendrick and Lively have persisted for years, since reports describing a challenging environment circulated during the filming of the original \"A Simple Favor\" in 2018. Neither actress has publicly confirmed a conflict.\n\nShow times: 5:30 p.m. Friday, Paramount Theatre; 11 a.m. Saturday, SXSW Film & TV Theater at The Hyatt Regency.\n\n'Death of a Unicorn' (World premiere)\n\n\"Death of a Unicorn\" prances into SXSW with a premise as whimsical as its title. Early buzz suggests a darkly comedic fairy tale about a father (Paul Rudd) and daughter (Jenna Ortega) who stumble upon a unicorn carcass. Beyond a quirky premise, the dead unicorn resonates with contemporary anxieties about nature's exploitation and the devastating consequences of human greed. Word of mouth from the festival circuit will likely determine whether \"Death of a Unicorn\" becomes a cult classic or a fleeting festival curiosity, but its potential to spark conversations about environmental responsibility gives it a timely edge.\n\nShow times: 5:30 p.m. Saturday, Paramount Theatre; 11 a.m. Sunday, SXSW Film & TV Theater at The Hyatt Regency.\n\n'Drop' (World premiere)\n\nChristopher Landon, the mastermind behind the twisted \"Happy Death Day\" and the body-swapping chaos of \"Freaky,\" is serving up a different kind of terror with \"Drop.\" The film centers around a widowed mother venturing out on her first date in years. What starts as an innocent dinner with a handsome stranger quickly devolves into a game of psychological torment, fueled by a barrage of anonymous \"drops\" to her phone. Moviegoers can expect a suspenseful ride where the buzz of a notification becomes a harbinger of pure terror.\n\nShow times: 9:30 p.m. Sunday, Paramount Theatre; 2:30 p.m. Monday at SXSW Film & TV Theater @ The Hyatt Regency.\n\n'Holland' (World premiere)\n\nNicole Kidman is ditching the Monterey moms of \"Big Little Lies\" and the seductive corporate sharks of \"Babygirl\" for something more … tulip-tinged. In \"Holland,\" she's Nancy Vandergroot, a seemingly perfect homemaker in, you guessed it, Holland, Michigan, where the picture-perfect life is about to get twisted. Joining her is Matthew Macfadyen, fresh from his \"Succession\" triumph. Also Gael García Bernal, whose presence alone hints at a story that reaches beyond the quaint Midwestern town. When Nancy and her colleague start sniffing around a secret, the tulips start to wilt, and suddenly, everyone's hiding something.\n\nShow times: 6 p.m. Sunday, Paramount Theatre; 11 a.m. Monday, SXSW Film & TV Theater at The Hyatt Regency.\n\n'Idiotka' (World premiere)\n\n\"Idiotka\" is crashing into SXSW like a vodka-fueled reality TV binge, and it's bringing a cast that's as eclectic as its premise. Anna Baryshnikov plays Margarita, a Russian immigrant chasing the American Dream in West Hollywood — and that dream involves a reality show, naturally. Camila Mendes (\"Riverdale\") joins the chaos alongside Julia Fox, who's sure to bring her signature brand of unpredictable energy. Benito Skinner and Saweetie are also along for the ride. \"Idiotka\" promises a genre-bending ride through the glitter and grit of immigrant ambition.\n\nShow times: 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, ZACH Theatre.\n\n'On Swift Horses' (US premiere)\n\nDaisy Edgar-Jones, fresh off the emotional rollercoaster of \"Twisters,\" is trading tornadoes for a simmering California love triangle in \"On Swift Horses.\" She's Muriel, a woman starting a new life with her war-veteran husband, Lee (Will Poulter), when the arrival of his charmingly chaotic brother, Julius (Jacob Elordi, bringing his intoxicatingly troubled energy from \"Priscilla\" and \"Euphoria,\" but with a gambling problem), throws everything into disarray. When Julius goes chasing after his own romantic obsession, Muriel finds herself drawn into a secret life of horse racing and forbidden desires.\n\nShow times: 7 p.m. March 13, Paramount Theatre.\n\n'Seen & Heard' (World premiere)\n\nIssa Rae, the mastermind behind \"Insecure,\" is back. This time she's trading scripted drama for the real deal. \"Seen and Heard,\" isn't just a history lesson, It's a star-studded journey through the evolution of Black television. Expect Oprah, Tyler Perry, Shonda Rhimes, and a whole squad of legends like Ava DuVernay and Lena Waithe, all crammed into a cinematic time machine.\n\nShow times: 6:15 p.m. Saturday, SXSW Film & TV Theater at The Hyatt Regency.\n\n'Selena y Los Dinos' (Texas premiere)\n\n\"Selena y Los Dinos\" is bringing the Queen of Tejano back to the big screen. The documentary is a heartfelt family album come to life, packed with never-before-seen footage, personal snapshots and stories straight from the people who knew Selena best. Directed by Isabel Castro and executive produced by Selena's sister, Suzette Quintanilla, and her brother, A.B. Quintanilla III, the film is a raw and intimate look at Selena's journey from Corpus Christi kid to global icon. And with Chris Perez teasing a Los Dinos reunion at the screening, it’s bound to be an emotional experience.\n\nShow times: noon Wednesday, Paramount Theatre; 6:45 p.m. March 15 at AFS Cinema.\n\n'Summer of 69' (World premiere)\n\n\"Summer of '69\" brings a whole new meaning to \"coming of age\" at SXSW, and it's definitely not your parents' summer love story. Abby Flores, played by Sam Morelos, is a video game-loving high schooler with a serious crush on Max Warren (Matt Cornett). When she discovers he's finally single, she's on a mission to go from zero to … well, you know. Enter Chloe Fineman as Santa Monica, a local stripper who takes Abby under her wing for some, shall we say, advanced dating lessons. With a supporting cast that includes Nicole Byer, Liza Koshy and Charlie Day, this film promises a hilarious and raunchy ride through the awkwardness of teenage desire.\n\nShow times: 3:30 p.m. March 13, Paramount Theatre; 9:15 p.m. March 14, SXSW Film & TV Theater at The Hyatt Regency.\n\n'The Surfer' (North American premiere)\n\nNicolas Cage, fresh from his bone-chilling turn in \"Longlegs,\" is trading horror for sun-drenched surf in \"Surfer.\" But don't expect a chill beach vacation. “The Surfer” promises a descent into sunstroke-fueled madness. Cage plays a man returning to his childhood surf spot with his son, only to find himself humiliated and embroiled in a turf war with some locals. Early buzz from its Cannes premiere hinted at a tense and visceral experience. Will Cage bring the same unhinged energy he's known for to a film that trades supernatural horror for the simmering rage of a man pushed past his limits?\n\nShow times: 6 p.m. Monday , ZACH Theatre; 6:45 p.m. Wednesday, Alamo Lamar 5, 6.\n\n'Together' (Texas premiere)\n\nWhile a trailer is still elusive, early buzz from producers and co-stars Alison Brie and Dave Franco suggests \"Together\" blends elements of \"The Monkey\" (2025), \"The Substance\" (2024) and maybe even \"The Notebook\" (2004). The film centers a couple who relocate to the countryside, then experience a supernatural event that profoundly alters their love, their lives and even their physical forms. \"Together\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to positive word of mouth, which led to Neon acquiring the distribution rights. It’s Michael Shank’s directorial debut.\n\nShow times: 11:55 p.m. Friday, Paramount Theatre; 9:30 p.m. March 13, ZACH Theatre.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/07/17/jennifer-love-hewitt-freddie-prinze-movie-reunion/84496621007/", "title": "Jennifer Love Hewitt talks new 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'", "text": "When Jennifer Love Hewitt learned a new \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" movie was in the works, her first reaction was \"immediate fear and panic that I might have to be in it.\"\n\nHewitt starred in the original 1997 slasher movie, in which a group of friends run over a pedestrian and are hunted by a killer who knows what they did. But she hasn't played Julie James since the 1998 sequel, when she was 19. So before filming began on the latest \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" (in theaters July 18), Hewitt was a \"nervous wreck.\"\n\n\"Coming back at 46 is really daunting in Hollywood, for lots of reasons,\" she says. \"You don't want people to be like, 'Oh, she looks different,' or 'She's aged.' You don't want any of that.\"\n\nJoin our Watch Party!

The actress's nerves were eased, and she \"fully started crying\" when the extras in her first scene welcomed her back with a round of applause.\n\nNeed a break?

After the friends − played by Chase Sui Wonders, Madelyn Cline, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers and Sarah Pidgeon − realize something similar occurred in 1997, they turn to the survivors of the original film: Julie (Hewitt) and Ray Bronson, played by a returning Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\nPrinze was enticed back by director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson's (\"Do Revenge\") pitch for a film exploring how the same events can affect people in different ways. In the years since Julie and Ray's friends were murdered, she has become a professor who teaches about post-traumatic stress disorder and the importance of dealing with trauma. Ray, in contrast, bottles up his emotions.\n\n\"It gave me this idea of trauma making or breaking human beings,\" Prinze says. \"The people I know that have been reformed from it, and the people I know who are crushed by it, and my own trauma, my own experiences that you can apply to bring some vulnerability to the role.\"\n\nRay and Julie were a couple the last time fans saw them but have since divorced, a decision that felt right for both actors. \"There was no way that they could be in a healthy relationship after what they went through,\" says Prinze, who imagines that Ray's neglect of counseling contributed to the marriage breaking down.\n\nFor Prinze, working with Hewitt again was like a high school reunion. \"You're waiting to see what's different, what's the same, how you've grown,\" he says, noting he was ready to prove he's a better actor now than he was in the '90s. But a fast-paced shooting schedule left the pair with little time to catch up before being thrown into their first scene together. \"There was a 'Good morning,' and 'I heard you have kids,' \" he jokes.\n\nHewitt says the 27 years between movies allowed her to deliver a richer performance.\n\n\"Had we done this earlier, I would not have had real grief in my life,\" she says. \"I would not have had trauma to overcome at that point, and I've had those things now.\"\n\nWhile the new film heavily echoes its predecessor, there are tweaks to the central scenario. The original friends hit a pedestrian with their car and dumped his body in the water. But the new characters' role in the accident is less direct, as they don't run over anyone. Instead, one of them is messing around on the road, causing a driver to swerve, crash and fall off a cliff into the water. The group then hides the fact that they were there.\n\nThe director saw this change as a way to add complexity. \"There's more nuance in morality in 2025,\" she says. The characters are also in their 20s this time, not teens. \"There's more accountability when you're older,\" Robinson says. \"The weight of their decisions matter more. You can't blame it on youth.\"\n\nCline points out that the blueprint for her character, Danica, was Sarah Michelle Gellar's fan favorite, Helen Shivers from the first movie. Danica is even the winner of the same beauty pageant as Helen. But if the new film has its own Julie James, it's Wonders' Ava Brucks, who goes to visit the actual Julie for advice. The \"Bodies Bodies Bodies\" actress aimed to capture the \"sweet heart\" of Hewitt's original character.\n\nHewitt, who now shares the \"I Know\" franchise with her children, drew on her relationship with her daughter to inform Julie's protective feelings toward Ava ‒ a dynamic that extended off-camera. She remembers having a conversation with Wonders, 29, about passing the torch, which echoed a discussion Hewitt had with Sigourney Weaver on the 2001 rom-com \"Heartbreakers.\"\n\n\"I was able to say, 'Passing this baton to you guys feels great, and I hope that you take this baton and you pass it on 27 years from now,' \" she says.\n\nWonders was thankful Hewitt was \"so generous\" and hopes she can one day return the favor to a younger actress. \"My crowning moment was Jennifer Love Hewitt grabbing my hand after the very last scene we shot together, and she said, 'You have the Julie James heart,' \" she says. \"I started crying. It was so emotional and so sweet.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/17"}]}
