Should they? What to know", "text": "If it seems everyone is talking about bitcoin these days, you're onto something.\n\nThe digital currency has been hitting record highs and neared $100,000 this past week, having doubled in value throughout 2024. Launched in 2009, bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, meaning that it's a digital currency and does not rely on banks to verify transactions.\n\nBitcoin's surge – up about 130% this year – is one of the \"Trump trades,\" market moves that have kicked in since former President Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nTrump has dabbled in cryptocurrency – releasing crypto-based digital trading cards – and Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, is reportedly close to acquiring crypto trading firm Bakkt. The Trump family launched its own crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, in September.\n\nInvestors have wagered Trump's support for bitcoin and other digital assets will lead to fewer restrictions on the industry. During the presidential campaign, Trump said he would make America the “world capital for crypto and bitcoin.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nTrump has tapped Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk to co-lead, with Vivek Ramaswamy, the new Department of Government Efficiency, or D.O.G.E. It's an acronym for cryptocurrency called Dogecoin, which Musk supported as it became a phenomenon in 2021.\n\nBeen hit with the bitcoin buzz, but don't quite understand it? Here's some bitcoin basics.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital asset, launched in 2009 by a person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto and designed to have a cap of 21 million bitcoin tokens. Bitcoin is created as crypto miners use their computing work to validate bitcoin transactions on its decentralized blockchain network, essentially a digital ledger meant to prevent fraud. As the crypto miners work, they earn bitcoin.\n\nSo far, about 19 million tokens have been released. In April, bitcoin underwent a \"halving,\" which kicks in about every four years to reduce the rate at which new bitcoins are created and released into circulation. As the bitcoin cap of 21 million tokens nears, demand likely increases, according to Investopedia.\n\nCurrently, a bitcoin is worth about $98,000. But the ownership of fractional shares of bitcoin is common, notes NerdWallet.\n\nWhat are bitcoin ETFs?\n\nIt's Trump's interest in bitcoin alone that's led to bitcoin's climb. Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted to allow the sale of bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, to the public.\n\nThat action allowed more investors to get into bitcoin in a similar manner to how they invest in stocks, bypassing crypto exchanges.\n\nHow does bitcoin work?\n\nLike the dollar, bitcoin can be used as currency, but it's virtual and isn't controlled by banks or governments. While an entire bitcoin is priced at nearly $100,000, you can own partial shares of each coin. The smallest share of each bitcoin is called a Satoshi – after the cryptocurrency's creator – equal to a hundred millionth of one bitcoin, according to NerdWallet.\n\nYou can buy bitcoin on a crypto exchange such as Binance.US, online stockbrokers including Fidelity and E-Trade, and trading apps like Robinhood.\n\nIf you buy bitcoin on a crypto exchange, you will create a \"crypto wallet\" to hold your bitcoin. If you invest in those bitcoin ETFs the SEC approved earlier this year, online brokers will hold your bitcoin in your brokerage account as any other investment.\n\nWhat can I buy with bitcoin?\n\nPretty much anything. For instance, you can get a bitcoin debit card, which you load with a certain amount of your cryptocurrency holdings. That can be used as you would any debit card.\n\nBeyond that, many companies now accept cryptocurrency for purchases including AT&T, Microsoft, Rolex, Time Inc., and Tesla, notes Investopedia.\n\nYou can buy \"art,\" too. That banana duct-taped to a wall, which sold last week for $6.2 million? The buyer paid in crypto.\n\nWhat concerns are there about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?\n\nBack in 2018, investment guru Warren Buffett predicted that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, will likely \"come to a bad ending.\" His stance hasn't really changed, reported Nasdaq.com.\n\nBut many point to the surge in bitcoin's valuation as a sign the cryptocurrency has arrived. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge and a former White House director of communications, has said Bitcoin could exceed $170,000 by mid-2025, and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has predicted Bitcoin will hit $1.48 million by 2030, Fortune reported.\n\nHowever, crypto exchanges can fail. The 2022 bankruptcy of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange resulted in customers losing $8 billion; founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March.\n\nBitcoin values dipped after that, but have since risen to new heights – because, supporters say, as more people invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the currencies become more stable.\n\nVolatility can be seen as an advantage for those in search of future earnings – or as a disadvantage for those seeking somewhat stable investments.\n\n\"Remember that bitcoin and crypto are highly volatile, and may be more susceptible to market manipulation than securities,\" notes Fidelity Investments in a primer for investors. \"Crypto holders do not benefit from the same regulatory protections applicable to registered securities, and the future regulatory environment for crypto is currently uncertain.\"\n\nMaybe think about investing in bitcoin as you would joining the wave of online bettors. \"If you decide to buy Bitcoin, it's a good rule of thumb to invest only what you can afford to lose,\" writes NerdWallet's Kevin Voigt, \"and take measures to protect your assets.\"\n\nContributing: Daniel de Visé, Jessica Guynn, Max Hauptman, Jonathan Limehouse and Bailey Schulz of USA TODAY, and Reuters.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

They say Trump Media’s valuation is divorced from the business realities it faces.\n\nIts flagship product Truth Social, Trump’s bullhorn of choice, is a minor player in a social media landscape dominated by megacorporations like Facebook owner Meta. Trump Media, on the other hand, has racked up tens of millions of dollars in losses and generated sparse sales. And it has struggled to attract advertisers and users since its launch in 2021.\n\nIt owes its success to Trump, who is one of Truth Social's most prolific users and has among the most followers on the platform with nearly 6.8 million. Trump has 34 million followers on Facebook, 24 million on Instagram and more than 87 million on X.\n\n\"It's hard to come up with any reasonable metrics that would get you to this valuation,\" Derek Horstmeyer, a finance professor at George Mason University in Virginia, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe one-day pop was typical of so-called meme stocks in recent years, like video-game retailer GameStop.Trump supporters banded together on social media to lift the stock even before it completed the merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that was already listed on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe difference here may be that the former president's fans may continue to lift − rather than dump − the stock.\n\nTrading was exceptionally heavy, according to University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter. The number of shares available to trade – called the public float – is about 28 million. But more than 52 million shares traded Tuesday. In fact, trading was so intense that Nasdaq temporarily halted it following the opening bell. Typically, trading in most stocks is less than 1% a day.\n\n“Clearly a lot of the buyers and holders are people who are buying it for ideological reasons and plan on holding it for a while,” Ritter said.\n\nThat’s not so different from the online traders, mom-and-pop investors, small brokers and others who organized on social media platform Reddit to drive up the price of GameStop and face down hedge funds that were betting against the company and shorting the stock.\n\n“In that regard, GameStop investors were doing it for ideological reasons, too,” Ritter said. “But after the stock price went up, they then sold and the stock price collapsed.”\n\nNobody knows when the Trump Media bubble will burst, he said. Just because you are a Trump supporter doesn’t mean you will hold it forever, Ritter said.\n\n“In the short run, anything can happen,” he said. “But in the long run, I am highly confident there is going to be a huge percentage decline.”\n\nHow much is Truth Social worth?\n\nThose Trump Media shares have handed Trump a crucial lifeline in posting bond as he appeals the civil fraud judgment against him.\n\nA New York appeals court gave Trump 10 more days to post his bond and slashed the amount to $175 million. Trump has been struggling under the weight of not just the $454 million civil fraud judgment, but also an $83.3 million defamation trial loss to advice columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n\nTrump's gains are all on paper for the time being. He would need Trump Media’s seven-person board to lift a restriction that prevents Trump and other insiders from selling shares or using them as collateral for a bond for the next six months.\n\nThe board, which is stacked with allies including his son, Donald Trump Jr., and three former members of his administration, could also hold a secondary offering that would allow Trump to cash out some of his stake in coming months.\n\nWhat is Trump’s net worth?\n\nTruth Social going public means a massive boost to Trump’s net worth, at least on paper.\n\nHis shares in Trump Media and the reduction in the bond that Trump must post in a New York civil fraud lawsuit increased his net worth by more than $4 billion Monday, catapulting him into the world’s wealthiest 500 people on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the first time.\n\nWhy is Truth Social’s ticker DJT?\n\nResearch shows that familiar names, such as a former president’s initials, can help a company’s stock performance.\n\nOne 2006 study by Princeton University psychologists found that stocks with tickers that are easier to pronounce tend to perform better in the first few days of trading. Another study from Pomona College in 2019 verified earlier research that found clever tickers tend to perform better, partly because they are more memorable to investors.\n\nWhat is Digital World Acquisition?\n\nDigital World is a SPAC, also known as a blank check company. These publicly traded shell companies exist to acquire or merge with private companies and take them public.\n\nTruth Social’s merger with Digital World was first announced in 2021 when the number of companies going public via SPACs surged.

Social media firm Reddit is valued at about $8 billion following its recent initial public offering. It had more than $800 million in sales last year. Trump Media's Truth Social platform generated $3.3 million in revenue during the first nine months of 2023.\n\n“This is a stock where the market price is divorced from fundamental value,” said University of Florida professor Jay Ritter.\n\nRitter compared Truth Social to the wax-and-wane fortunes of AMC, the movie theater chain, and video retailer GameStop that got short-term boosts when online traders, mom-and-pop investors, small brokers and others organized on social media platform Reddit to buy up shares and face down hedge funds that were shorting the stocks.\n\n“This doesn’t happen too often, but there are precedents,” Ritter said.\n\nHe estimated that the stock is worth about $2 a share and he predicted that trading in the stock would continue to be volatile as Trump supporters buy and sell shares.\n\nA minor player in the social media universe where Facebook and TikTok command billions of users, Truth Social had about 494,000 U.S. mobile app users on iOS and Android in February and another 648,000 unique visitors in the U.S. to its website, according to research firm SimilarWeb. Both stats are down on a year-over-year basis, a 51% decline for mobile apps and a 20% decline for web visitors, the firm said. Truth Social does not disclose its user figures.\n\nGrowing the platform that trades on Trump’s personality and brand will be critical to its success, according to a regulatory filing. Other risk factors include Trump’s \"death, incarceration or incapacity\" as well as his checkered business history from the bankruptcy of the Trump Taj Mahal in 1991 to the bankruptcy of the Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts in 2004.\n\n\"A number of companies that were associated with President Trump have filed for bankruptcy,\" the filing states.\n\nThe surge in Digital World shares has increased the value of Trump’s stake in Trump Media by billions of dollars.

Shipping costs also skyrocketed, with one shopper being quoted $500 for ground and $5,000 for next-day air. Many of the complaints involved products sold by third-party sellers of Amazon, Walmart and eBay.\n\nNearly three dozen states have anti-gouging laws, but they define gouging differently. Florida's law bans the sale of an \"essential commodity\" at an \"unconscionable price.\"\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Amazon said price gouging was \"a clear violation of our policies, unethical, and in some areas, illegal. In addition to terminating these third party accounts, we welcome the opportunity to work directly with states attorneys general to prosecute bad actors.\"\n\nIn late February, Amazon said it would monitor its platform for violations but did not say it would ban sales of the items.\n\nAmazon.com has said it removed or blocked more than 1 million products on its platform for price gouging and misleading claims related to the outbreak.\n\nSen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday asking for a plan to stop the gouging and scams. He wrote that while the FTC has warned the public about some scams and is watching companies that claim to have unapproved treatments, he remains \"worried that piecemeal efforts are insufficient in light of the magnitude of this crisis.\"\n\nAmazon told Markey last week that it has removed more than 530,000 product offers because of price-gouging concerns.\n\nThis week, Consumer Brands Association urged Attorney General William Barr to protect Americans from price gouging of consumer packaged goods as sellers take advantage of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"A trillion-dollar company with such advanced technology surely can better figure out how to cap price increases during international emergencies such as the coronavirus outbreak,\" Garber said of Amazon. \"Elected officials shouldn't wait for another panic to investigate how online platforms may be enabling price gouging.\"\n\nContributing: Jessica Guynn, Charisse Jones and Coral Murphy, USA TODAY\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/02/06/super-bowl-tickets-prices-fall/78261799007/", "title": "Super Bowl ticket prices are falling – along with interest in game", "text": "Maybe the third time isn't a charm for America's audiences as they prepare to watch the Kansas City Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes go for their third consecutive Super Bowl win?\n\nFrom ticket prices to online interest in the game and Taylor Swift, the numbers for Super Bowl 59 on Sunday are trending down.

The Chinese president “knew I would do something,” Trump said. In fact, China has not been devaluing its currency to create a trade advantage since 2014.\n\nThe president also said that the wall he wants to build on the Mexico border will cost “$10 billion or less,” but cost estimates by his own Department of Homeland Security and two independent organizations say it could cost at least twice that much.\n\nThe president also repeated several false and misleading claims, including taking too much credit for job creation.\n\nThe Associated Press interviewed Trump in the Oval Office on April 21 and published a transcript of the interview on April 24. The interview comes as the president nears completion of his first 100 days in office — which will occur on April 29 — and dealt in part with the promises he made during the campaign.\n\nChina’s Currency\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump issued a “100-day action plan to Make America Great Again.” One of those promises dealt with China’s history of devaluing its currency to gain a trade advantage. In his action plan, Trump said on his first day in office he would “direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.”\n\nThat has not happened. In fact, the Treasury Department issued a report on April 14 that declined to label China a currency manipulator.\n\nThe president told the Associated Press that “things change” and he needs “flexibility” once he takes office. He said the decision was in part political, as he is trying to convince China to lean on North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program.\n\nBut then he twisted the facts about China’s history of devaluing its currency.\n\nTrump said he decided not to label China a currency manipulator, in part, because it has not manipulated its currency since he took office. Trump claimed credit for that, saying “there’s a certain respect” that China’s President Xi Jinping has for him and “he knew I would do something” if China devalued its currency.\n\nIn fact, China has not been devaluing its currency to create a trade advantage since 2014, years before Trump took office.\n\nTrump, April 21: \"But [Chinese] President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there’s a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he’s helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, 'By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you’re a currency manipulator.' It doesn’t work that way. … \"And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don’t get it, in which case they’re very stupid people, or they just don’t want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, 'He didn’t call them a currency manipulator.' Well, for two reasons. Number One, he’s not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it’s like generalities, it’s not. They have — they’ve actually — their currency’s gone up. So it’s a very, very specific formula. And I said, 'How badly have they been,' … they said, 'Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.' That’s Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea.\"\n\nAs The Washington Postexplained, “The value of a currency is determined by supply and demand, and currency manipulation occurs when a country buys or sell [sic] large amounts of its own currency on global markets to change the price. But U.S. policy is really directed at countries that sell large volumes of their own currency to lower its price — a practice that makes a country’s exports relatively cheap on global markets, hurting American exporters. In previous years, when China artificially lowered the value of its currency, it helped the country export products to the United States, and U.S. industries and workers balked at what they saw as an unfair competitive edge.”\n\nThe Treasury report found that “after engaging in one-way, large-scale intervention to resist appreciation of the RMB [the Chinese currency] for a decade, China’s recent intervention in foreign exchange markets has sought to prevent a rapid RMB depreciation that would have negative consequences for the United States, China, and the global economy.”\n\nMoreover, the report notes that China’s “lack of intervention to resist appreciation” has been occurring “over the last three years.” In other words, China didn’t make a change in its policy since Trump took office, or because — as Trump said — of a perceived threat that Trump would “do something.”\n\nEconomists broadly agree that China has not been holding down its currency since 2014 or 2015.\n\n“The accusation that China is manipulating its currency in order to gain an unfair advantage for its exports is not supported by economic facts,” Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and formerly head of the IMF’s China Division, told us in an email. “Since mid-2014, the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBC, China’s central bank) has in fact been intervening in currency markets to prevent the renminbi (RMB) from falling too sharply in value against the dollar. Over the past three years, China has burnt up $1 trillion of its stock of foreign exchange reserves in order to support its currency and prevent it from depreciating as much and as fast as market forces seem to want.”\n\n“Thus, China has, if anything, been doing the U.S. a favor by not letting the RMB depreciate as much and as fast against the dollar as indicated by market pressures,” Prasad said. “The reason it has done this is largely to forestall any domestic financial instability from panic-driven capital outflows if it were to allow the RMB to depreciate a lot, especially over a short period.”\n\nBrad Setser, a senior fellow and acting director of the Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations, said conventional wisdom is that China shifted from buying reserves to selling reserves several years ago.\n\n“If by manipulation, you mean — when did China stop accumulating reserves to hold its currency down, it stopped manipulating in 2014 or 2015,” Setser told us via email.\n\nBut Setser said the issue is made more complex, “because China has held its currency relatively stable against the dollar this year, and that is arguably a change (though holding the currency stable against the dollar has been relatively easy for China because the dollar has been relatively stable or even weakened a bit against the other big currencies).”\n\nSome consider manipulation to mean any government intervention in the market at all, not just depreciating currency, Setser said.\n\nBut it is clear from Trump’s statements that he was concerned about China holding down its currency to gain a trade advantage, to the detriment especially of U.S. manufacturers. Economists say that’s exactly what China was doing for more than a decade, but as Eduardo Porter put it for The New York Times, “Trump Isn’t Wrong on China Currency Manipulation, Just Late.”\n\nTrump said his decision to not label China a currency manipulator was partly political, since he is trying to convince China to pressure North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program. We take no position on that.\n\nBut Trump’s claim that China stopped manipulating its currency when he took office — and more, that it did so “because there’s a certain respect, because [Xi] knew I would do something or whatever” — is another example of Trump taking credit for something that long predates his presidency.\n\nSpinning the Border Wall Costs\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump also promised to build a “big, fat beautiful wall” along the southern border. In his 100-day action plan, Trump said he would work with Congress to fully fund the wall “with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall.”\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as we will explain later, has moved forward with the project, so that promise is a work in progress.\n\nBut in the AP interview, Trump lowballed the estimated cost of the project, claiming it will cost “$10 billion or less.”\n\nTrump, April 21: \"Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I’m seeing. I’m seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.\" Associated Press: \"What do you think the estimate on it would be?\" Trump: \"Oh I’m seeing numbers — $24 billion, I think I’ll do it for $10 billion or less. … The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It’s not going to cost anywhere near that.\" Associated Press: \"You think $10 billion or less.\" Trump: \"I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it’s not going to be anywhere near (those) kind of numbers.\"\n\nWe can’t predict the future, but the estimates to date have been much higher than $10 billion:\n\nAccording to an internal document obtained by Reuters, the Department of Homeland Security estimated the cost could be as much as $21.6 billion.\n\nBernstein Research, an investment-management and research firm, has estimated that the cost of the project is “widely expected to be greater than $15 billion and perhaps as much as $25 billion.”\n\nMIT Technology Review, a magazine published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, estimated in October that a 1,000-mile wall could cost between $27 billion and $40 billion.\n\nThe cost of the wall will depend on many factors — such as the height and length of the wall, the construction materials used, and whether parts of the wall are substituted with fencing or other barriers.\n\nLet’s take a look at what the Trump administration envisions and how much it might cost.\n\nOn March 17, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued two requests for proposals “to acquire multiple conceptual wall designs with the intent to construct multiple prototypes.” One RFP is for a “solid concrete border wall,” and the second RFP is for “other border wall.” For the “other border wall,” the RPF says: “Prototypes constructed in response to this solicitation must offer designs that are alternatives to reinforced solid concrete walls (i.e. no solid concrete external faces).”\n\nSo, we know that the administration is at least considering not just a solid concrete wall, but a combination of walls and other barriers.\n\nThe wall — whether solid concrete or an alternative design — must be between 18 feet and 30 feet tall and 2 feet wide, according to the RFPs. It also must go 6 feet below the ground to prevent people from tunneling under the wall.\n\nAs for the length of the wall, the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,933 miles. But the DHS document obtained by Reuters indicated that the administration will not seek to build new barriers the full length of the border.\n\n“The plan lays out what it would take to seal the border in three phases of construction of fences and walls covering just over 1,250 miles (2,000 km) by the end of 2020,” Reuters wrote on Feb. 9. “With 654 miles (1,046 km) of the border already fortified, the new construction would extend almost the length of the entire border.”\n\nThe 654 miles of existing barriers is a reference, as we have written before, to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for the construction of 700 miles of fencing and enhanced surveillance technology. In its report, Bernstein Research wrote that under the 2006 law “18ft tall steel ‘primary fencing’ is used in many urban areas … to less substantial ‘vehicle fencing’ in lower-risk areas.”\n\nThe cost of the primary fencing, also known as pedestrian fencing, averaged about $6.5 million per mile under the 2006 law, according to a September 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office. At that per-mile average price (not adjusted for inflation), a 1,250-mile “wall” constructed entirely of pedestrian fencing would cost more than $8 billion.\n\nMore recently, Trump’s chief budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told talk show host Hugh Hewitt in March that the per-mile cost “starts at $8 million per mile” and “goes up to about $25 million per mile.”\n\nThe range of Mulvaney’s per-mile cost estimates would place the total cost at between $10 billion and $31.25 billion for 1,250 miles of walls and fences. Mulvaney added that the total cost “just depends on … what you decide to build in what areas.”\n\nAs we said, Homeland Security estimated that the 1,250-mile combination of fences and walls under the Trump administration plan could cost as much as $21.6 billion.\n\nBernstein Research estimated the cost at between $15 billion and $25 billion. The firm — which provided its estimate during the campaign, when Trump gave no details on the size and scope of the project — assumed construction of a 1,000-mile concrete wall at 40 feet tall and 7 feet deep, but only 10 inches thick.\n\nMIT Technology Review provided its cost estimate in October. The magazine’s cost estimate of between $27 billion and $40 billion assumes construction of a 1,000-mile concrete wall that is 50 feet tall and 10 feet underground — which is taller and deeper than the specifications ordered by DHS, but not as long.\n\nWe don’t know what the wall will cost, but independent analyses and Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security say a border wall could cost twice as much as Trump’s figure.\n\nJob Creation and Other Repeats\n\nIn his interview, Trump also repeated claims we have fact-checked before — most of them dealing with his campaign promise to be “the greatest jobs president God has ever created.”\n\nTrump once again claimed too much credit for job creation, saying, “we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since.” As we wrote two weeks ago, under Trump, the U.S. job growth has been 317,000 jobs in February and March. That’s according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe January job numbers — an additional 216,000 jobs — were based on a survey that was done before Trump was inaugurated.\n\nThis job growth is a continuation of a trend that began pre-Trump: The economy added more than 250,000 new jobs a month in 20 of the 96 months under President Obama, and as of March, the U.S. has had 77 straight months of job growth.\n\nThe president also cited examples of his job creation, and in some cases he took too much credit.\n\nTrump: \"As an example, Ford, General Motors. I’ve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma [chairman of Alibaba Group], he comes up, he says, 'Only because of you am I making this massive investment.' Intel, only because of you. … The press never writes that.\"\n\nBut, as we’ve written before, investments made by Ford and GM were part of longtime trends and market decisions. Ford CEO Mark Fields, for example, praised Trump’s promises to cut taxes and regulation, but said recent investments in U.S. plants were market-based. Asked on Fox Business News if he would have made the investments had Trump not won the election, Fields said, “Yes, absolutely.”\n\nAs for Intel, we wrote in February that Trump had a stronger case in that instance. The Intel CEO credited Trump’s pro-business policies for a $7 billion investment in an Arizona factory, though Intel had announced a $5 billion investment in that facility in 2011. The project wasn’t completed.\n\n“We’re making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect,” Intel spokesman William Moss said. “That said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration’s pro business and pro investment goals.”\n\nAnd Jack Ma, of Alibaba, the e-commerce Chinese company, told Trump in early January that he would add 1 million U.S. small businesses to the online platform over the next five years, a move Alibaba said could add 1 million jobs (one each per small business).\n\nTrump also again took credit for saving hundreds of millions on the F-35 jet made by Lockheed Martin, savings that were in the works before he was sworn in.\n\n“[A] little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget,” he said, going on to say that he called Lockheed and said he would have to “bid this out to another company, namely Boeing” and that “I started getting competing offers back and forth.”\n\nTrump claimed he saved $725 million. In the past, he has claimed a savings of $600 million. But as The Washington Post‘s Fact Checker found, Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the head of the F-35 Joint Program Office, had already announced on Dec. 19 — before Trump met privately with Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson — that the cost of the F-35 would come down. His cost reduction estimate came out to $549 million to $630 million, according to the Post’s calculation.\n\nAviation Weekalso wrote that Trump “overstates” his role and that the price reduction on the jet had been “ongoing.”\n\nIn addition, the president rehashed a campaign claim that distorts the facts on the vetting process required for those entering the U.S.\n\nTrump: \"We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country.\"\n\nTrump didn’t specify that he was talking about refugees, but he indicated he was speaking about his “stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism.”\n\nThroughout the 2016 campaign, Trump made similar claims. For instance, in a late August speech on illegal immigration, he said that Syrian refugees seeking admission to the U.S. have “no documentation” and “no paperwork.” That’s false.\n\nAs we wrote, Barbara Strack, chief of the refugee affairs division of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Congress in October 2015 that “we’ve found with Syrian refugees … in general they have many, many documents.” Documents were also one part of the vetting process, she said. Those applying for refugee status are also interviewed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and go through security checks by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. There’s a health screening and a three-day “cultural orientation,” too.\n\nFor a full list of sources, see FactCheck.org.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe first 100 days of the Trump presidency\n\nAnalysis: A bumpy 100 days for Trump?

The independent agency also sued the operator of Zelle, called Early Warning Services.\n\nThe CFPB put Zelle-related fraud losses at more than $870 million involving customers at just the three banks over a seven-year period from the launch of the app in 2017.\n\nZelle disputes how the CFPB reached the $870 million figure. A Zelle spokesperson issued the following statement: \"The CFPB’s headline grabbing number is misleading, as many reported fraud claims are not found to involve actual fraud after investigation.\"\n\nIn some cases, banks say, a customer might report fraud but maybe the customer later remembers that they did make a certain purchase. So, it's not fraud after all. Or maybe a criminal is trying to exploit the network by making a false claim.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe CFPB figure, banks said, is based on total fraud claims minus what banks paid out in losses. But banks said all claims do not involve actual fraud or end up being a case where banks are required under law to reimburse a customer using a payment app, such as if they were tricked into paying $500 or $1,000 as part of an online puppy-for-sale scam.\n\nHundreds of thousands of consumers filed complaints after getting hit by fraud, according to the CFPB, and they were largely denied assistance. In some cases, the CFPB said, some consumers actually were told to contact the fraudsters directly to recover their money.\n\n'A gold mine' for fraud\n\nRohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told journalists on a conference call Friday that the major financial institutions failed to fix glaring flaws in the system while marketing Zelle's near-instant electronic money transfers as safe.\n\n\"What they built became a gold mine for criminals,\" Chopra said.\n\nBankers see a 'last ditch effort' by CFPB\n\nBankers defended the safety of the Zelle app, and said the CFPB was overreaching in its actions.\n\nZelle said in a statement to the Detroit Free Press that the CFPB is attempting to expand the existing law, and appears to be timing the lawsuit based on political factors unrelated to Zelle.\n\nBill Halldin, a spokesperson for Bank of America, said in a statement to the Detroit Free Press that the bank strongly disagrees with the “CFPB’s effort to impose huge new costs on the 2,200 banks and credit unions that offer the free Zelle service to clients.”\n\nHe noted that “23 million Bank of America clients have embraced Zelle, regularly using it to send money to friends, family and people they trust.”\n\nBank of America said it works directly with customers when they have an issue.\n\nTrish Wexler, a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson, called the CFPB's December lawsuit \"a last ditch effort in pursuit of their political agenda.\"\n\n\"The CFPB is now overreaching its authority by making banks accountable for criminals, even including romance scammers,\" Wexler said in an emailed statement. \"It’s a stunning demonstration of regulation by enforcement, skirting the required rulemaking process,\" Wexler continued.\n\nThe Consumer Bankers Association issued a statement Friday, defending bank actions.\n\n\"Banks have rigorously followed the law in characterizing and offering services through Zelle, yet the CFPB today has moved the goalposts, suggesting that ‘being safe’ means something other than what Congress has defined in law,\" said Lindsey Johnson, president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association.\n\nChalk up one more heated issue that could be in play in Washington in 2025.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are expected to try to vastly limit the CFPB's powers.\n\nThe CFPB was launched after the 2008-09 recession as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n\nThe scams are real and so are the losses\n\nConsumers have been upset for years after being hit by a long list of scams, which can involve money being withdrawn from their bank accounts via Zelle. Crooks didn't need to send their victims out to buy gift cards when they could get instant cash via a payment app, like Zelle.\n\nOver the years, I've talked with many consumers at all sorts of financial institutions who faced massive headaches because crooks knew the maneuvers to make, often starting out by impersonating a bank or someone else, to steal money out of a bank account via the Zelle app.\n\nToo many times, the consumer told me that they were stuck on the hook and out the cash.\n\nOne consumer watchdog group called the CFPB's legal action \"an important step in holding payment systems accountable for enabling fraudulent and unauthorized payments.\"\n\n“Payment fraud impacts all Americans across many communities, young and old,” Carla Sanchez-Adams, senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, said in a statement.\n\n“The CFPB is standing up for people who weren’t able to get the big banks to take their claims of fraud seriously and return their hard-earned money.”\n\nPIRG’s research arm, the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, has been persistently raising awareness about fraud and other problems involving peer-to-peer payment apps, such as Zelle. The group issued a report called \"Virtual wallets, real complaints\" in June 2021.\n\nMike Litt, PIRG’s consumer campaign director, said consumers have had problems with fraud on Zelle for years.\n\n\"Hopefully, the CFPB’s lawsuit can change that,\" Litt said in a statement.\n\n\"These troubling alleged practices need to be addressed by all parties as quickly as possible. It’s crucial that in our increasingly cashless age, we have digital financial systems that the public can trust and use without fear of losing their money.”\n\nWhat is often debated is what kind of fraud would be covered under existing banking rules. Did the consumer send the money willingly via romance scam — or do something that isn't covered? Regulators are pushing banks to cover something new called “induced fraud” when a customer is tricked into sending money under false pretenses.\n\nLast year, I reported that after much public-pressure the network operator of Zelle had agreed to implement new requirements to \"mandate consumer reimbursement for certain types of scams\" on the Zelle Network. But Zelle was not specific on what kind of scams were going to be reimbursed.\n\nConsumers can report fraud to their banks and submit complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint.\n\nWhat the CFPB said about Zelle\n\nThe CFPB's complaint Friday takes aim at how the Zelle system itself worked and allegedly enabled fraud, too.\n\nChopra said the CFPB's investigation uncovered two major patterns of account takeover fraud that banks failed to address.\n\nSome criminals, he said, would obtain one-time passcodes that could be used to take over accounts.\n\nOther bad actors, he said, would physically steal phones or devices with banking apps installed to immediately make unauthorized transfers.\n\n\"In case after case,\" he said, \"banks routinely denied requests for help, turning a blind eye, even when customers provided clear evidence that criminals had taken over their accounts and that the transactions were unauthorized, including police reports documenting the crimes.\"\n\nThe lawsuit charged that more than $360 million in losses associated with Zelle-related fraud hit 420,000 Chase customers; some 210,000 Bank of America customers complained that they lost $290 million; and 280,000 Wells Fargo customers complained of losing more than $220 million.\n\nThe Zelle system, Chopra said, made it easy for fraudsters to move money quickly. And many consumers found it nearly impossible to get their money back.\n\nMany times, Chopra said, the banks didn't do enough to stop suspicious activity across the banking system.\n\n\"When one bank detected fraud and closed an account, nothing stopped the criminal from hopping to another bank and starting fresh when fraud occurred,\" Chopra said.\n\nChopra said the three banks systematically failed their customers hit by fraud on Zelle.\n\nBig banks, regulators said, joined forces to launch Zelle once the banks saw that they were losing out to other money transfer platforms, such as CashApp, Venmo and PayPal. But the regulators say the move to rush the Zelle network to the market to compete against growing payments apps was done without implementing effective consumer safeguards.\n\nEarly Warning Services, which designed and operates Zelle, is co-owned by seven big banks — Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, PNC Bank, Trust, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo. Early Warning Services is a financial technology and consumer reporting company based in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nThe Zelle payment system is massive. Back in 2021 alone, about 1.8 billion payments — totaling $490 billion — were sent by consumers and businesses through the Zelle Network, according to the Early Warning Services. Total dollars transferred were up 59% from 2020.\n\nThe regulators are not suing the other banks that co-own Zelle, noting that a bulk of the transactions involve the three banks being sued.\n\nThe CFPB said it is seeking to stop the \"alleged unlawful practices, secure redress and penalties, and obtain other relief.\"\n\nConsumers have reported losses related to fraud and Zelle at a wide range of financial institutions, however, and regulators did not address those losses in the news media call. Some 2,200 participating financial institutions offer the Zelle app to customers with U.S.-based deposit accounts.\n\nThe lawsuit points out that Zelle is embedded in the mobile apps of Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Chase and consumers cannot remove the Zelle function.\n\nFrom the start, according to the legal complaint, Zelle's marketing and branding \"exploited consumers' perceptions of reliability and security.\"\n\nSpecific charges of failing to prevent fraud\n\nThe CFPB said Friday that the defendant banks failed to implement appropriate fraud prevention and detection safeguards. The CFPB alleges that Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Early Warning Services violated federal law through crucial failures including:\n\nZelle’s limited identity verification methods allowed bad actors to quickly create accounts and target Zelle users. Criminals could exploit Zelle’s design, according to regulators, to make sure that payments intended for the consumer’s account ended up flowing into an account controlled by crooks.\n\nEarly Warning Services and the defendant banks were \"too slow to restrict and track criminals as they exploited multiple accounts across the network.\" Banks, according to regulators, did not share information about known fraudulent transactions with other banks on the network. As a result, regulators indicated that repeated fraud schemes could be carried out across multiple institutions before being detected, if they were detected at all.\n\nDespite receiving hundreds of thousands of fraud complaints, the CFPB said, the defendant banks failed to use the information to prevent further fraud. They also allegedly violated the Zelle Network’s own rules by not reporting fraud incidents consistently or on time.\n\nDespite obligations under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E, the defendant banks failed to properly investigate Zelle customer complaints and take appropriate action for certain types of fraud and errors.\n\nWhat Zelle has to say\n\nJane Khodos, a Zelle spokesperson, emailed a statement to the Free Press, saying that the CFPB's lawsuit will hurt consumers, as well as small businesses, community banks, minority-owned banks and credit unions.\n\n\"Zelle leads the fight against scams and fraud and has industry-leading reimbursement policies that go above and beyond the law,\" according to the company's statement.\n\n\"The CFPB’s misguided attacks will embolden criminals, cost consumers more in fees, stifle small businesses and make it harder for thousands of community banks and credit unions to compete,\" Zelle said.\n\nIn 2023, Zelle said in its defense, the company saw a 27% increase in transaction volume but reports of scams and fraud decreased by nearly 50%. Some 99.95% of payments were sent without a report of scams and fraud.\n\nZelle also took issue over when consumers must be reimbursed under the law, which has been a point of contention between banks and consumer watchdog groups.\n\n\"Zelle reimburses customers for all instances of fraud as required by the law under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Reg E, and today’s litigation from the CFPB does not dispute that fact,\" Zelle stated.\n\nZelle said it also goes \"above and beyond what is required by law and reimburses customers for certain types of scams where the customer authorized the transaction.\"\n\nZelle said the CFPB, through the lawsuit, \"would be simultaneously creating and enforcing entirely new legal requirements that go well beyond what Congress authorized the CFPB to do.\"\n\nRegulation E\n\nAt issue is how much ability the CFPB has to expand consumers' protections under what's known as Regulation E. The banks say the CFPB is overreaching its authority.\n\nZelle said the \"CFPB is attempting to impermissibly expand the law to require banks to reimburse consumers for transactions they authorized, which goes well beyond the clearly defined requirements established by Congress in the Electronic Funds Transfer Act.\"\n\nConsumers need to be suspicious of every contact that appears to be made from a financial institution or other trusted entity — and recognize that often you might not get any money back from the bank in cases of fraud. Do not try to quickly solve a problem — say a call about unpaid taxes — by agreeing to transfer money via a payment app.\n\nA U.S. Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations in July, for example, disclosed that nearly two-thirds of consumers were not reimbursed for their losses in 2023 when they disputed a transaction after falling victim to scams involving Zelle at Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Nearly $102.3 million was not reimbursed in 2023, according to the report.\n\nThe subcommittee found several areas where Congress, regulators and the companies that participate in the Zelle Network could take steps to improve consumer protection, including amending the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to require financial institutions to reimburse consumers for “fraudulently induced” authorized transactions.\n\nIt was also recommended that the CFPB update Regulation E to require financial institutions to provide greater transparency and more clarity on what constitutes a “reasonable” investigation. The goal is to create a higher standard for dispute investigations, giving banks a minimum set of requirements.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Washoe County currently has 171,300 parcels of real estate and 30,500 personal property accounts, with a total assessed value of $12.2 billion.\n\nDuring my tenure, I've been honored to represent the Nevada Assessors Association as president and vice president, and continue to serve as its Legislative Committee chair. I'm an advocate for the taxpayers of Washoe County and believe property values should be fair, equitable and predictable in an ad valorem property tax system.\n\nMy professional life has been dedicated solely to providing excellent public service to the citizens of Washoe County. My career with Washoe County began in 1989, shelving books at the library while I finished my high school education at Sparks High School. I worked my way through college and received a bachelor of science degree in business administration from the University of Nevada in 1996.\n\nIn July 1999, I began my career with the Assessor's Office as an appraiser i and became a certified appraiser with the State of Nevada for both real and personal property. I worked my way up the appraisal series to the senior appraiser position before running for assessor in 2006.\n\nI celebrated my 25-year anniversary with Washoe County last December, which demonstrates my commitment to the office and to the taxpayers of the county.\n\nI'm a proven leader, dedicated public servant, and have the knowledge, skill and ability required of the Washoe County assessor. My first term tested my leadership as I faced a declining real estate market, significant Supreme Court decisions and a reduced operating budget. I'm proud to say we overcame these challenges, made difficult decisions along the way, and ultimately became a better, more sustainable organization.\n\nSpecifically, the assessor's annual budget was reduced from $8 million to $5.5 million, resulting in staff reductions from 85 employee positions in 2007 to 59 positions currently.

That means 25 milliliters or a single shot of liquor is one unit; a 16-ounce can of beer or cider is two units; and a standard 6-ounce glass of wine (175 milliliters) is two units.\n\nThe brains of nondrinkers who began consuming an average of one alcohol unit a day showed the equivalent of a half a year of aging, according to the study.\n\nIn comparison, drinking four alcohol units a day aged a person’s brain by more than 10 years.\n\n“It’s not linear. It gets worse the more you drink,” first author Remi Daviet, an assistant professor of marketing in the Wisconsin School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in a statement.\n\n“A problem in this study is that they only have information on people’s drinking habits for the one year prior to the (brain) imaging,” said alcohol researcher Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington.\n\n“I think this is a major limitation of the study as it’s likely that the cumulative consumption of alcohol throughout one’s lifetime is associated with the brain, not just the level of consumption right before the images were taken,” she added.\n\n“The relationship between alcohol and health is complex, and our understanding of that relationship is evolving over time. Based on this study, I would not really draw any definitive conclusions, but I would say that the authors have identified areas for further research.”\n\nBenefits of alcohol?\n\nDoctors used to believe that moderate amounts of alcohol could provide a health benefit, especially to the heart and the brain, but recent research has called that assumption into question. A number of studies have found no amount of drinking to be healthy, and the World Heart Federation recently published a policy brief saying there is “no level of alcohol consumption that is safe for health.”\n\n“Small amounts of alcohol are associated with health benefits for some conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and diabetes, but harmful for others, such as road traffic accidents and breast cancer,” Gakidou said, adding there are others, such as a stroke, where the outcome isn’t clear.\n\n“There isn’t really a simple answer for a given individual,” she said. “Based on what we do know at this time, whether small amounts of alcohol are beneficial or harmful for an individual depends on that person’s health status and their risk profile. … Are they more prone to heart disease or cancer?”\n\nBrain scans and large study size\n\nThe report analyzed data from more than 36,000 people who took part in the UK Biobank study, which houses in-depth genetic and health information on more than 500,000 middle-aged adults living in the United Kingdom.\n\nPeople in the study had provided information on the number of drinks they had each week in the previous year and had undergone an MRI brain scan. Researchers compared their scans with images of typical aging brains and then controlled for such variables as age, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic status, genetic ancestry and overall head size.\n\n“The fact that we have such a large sample size allows us to find subtle patterns, even between drinking the equivalent of half a beer and one beer a day,” coauthor Gideon Nave, an assistant professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.\n\n“Having this dataset is like having a microscope or a telescope with a more powerful lens,” Nave said. “You get a better resolution and start seeing patterns and associations you couldn’t before.”\n\nHe told CNN that is why this study was able to find a more distinct pattern of association between drinking and brain volume than past studies. However, he added, the results are just that – an association – as the study could not prove cause and effect.\n\n“Our study is by far the largest investigation of the topic,” Nave said. “It uses a general population sample, and it controls for more confounds than before. As such, it provides overwhelmingly more evidence than any previous investigations and gets us closer to settling the debate.”\n\nHowever, the study left a number of questions unanswered, such as a person’s cognitive engagement, Gakidou said.\n\n“I believe that there is sufficient evidence that suggests that brain function decays faster among those that are not engaged in intellectually stimulating activities, either through work or hobbies,” she said.\n\n“My main criticism is that the authors are overinterpreting the findings of their study and drawing conclusions that are not necessarily supported by what is presented in the paper. I do not see a significant trend in their graphs, and so I’m not convinced by the conclusions.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/alcohol-by-age-study-wellness", "title": "Global study finds surprising results for alcohol consumption | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

For all other causes, it’s harmful at all levels of consumption.”\n\nIndeed, the study found no protective effect for diseases such as tuberculosis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, liver disease, epilepsy, pancreatitis and many cancers.\n\n“Alcohol guidelines, both global ones and national ones, have typically emphasized the difference between consumption level for men compared to women,” Gakidou said. “What our work suggests is that global guidelines, national guidelines and local guidelines would be more effective if they emphasize age as opposed to sex.”\n\nThe findings underscore “the importance of alcohol recommendations that are tailored to specific regions and populations,” Amanda Berger, vice president of science and health for the trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, told CNN in an email.\n\n“Importantly, no one should drink alcohol to obtain potential health benefits, and some individuals should not drink at all.”\n\nYounger than 40 found at highest risk\n\nThe report, released Thursday in the journal Lancet, is the first to report alcohol risk by global geographical region, age, sex and year, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which prepared the study.\n\nThe analysis looked at 30 years of data on people ages 15 to 95 from 204 countries and territories gathered by the institute’s Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, which tracks premature death and disability from over 300 diseases.\n\nThe analysis estimated that 1.34 billion people around the world consumed harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020. More than 59% of the people who drank unsafe amounts of alcohol were between 15 and 39. Over two-thirds were men.\n\nIn every geographic region, the study found drinking alcohol does not provide any health benefits to people under age 40 but does raise the risk of injury, such as motor vehicle accidents, suicides and homicides.\n\nThe study defined a standard drink as 10 grams of pure alcohol, which might be a small 3.4-fluid ounce (100 milliliters) glass of red wine, a 12-fluid ounce (355 milliliters) standard can or bottle of beer (3.5% alcohol) or a 1-fluid ounce shot of spirits (30 milliliters) that is 40% alcohol by volume.\n\nConclusions criticized\n\nWhile praising the analysis as well-conducted, some experts not involved with the research expressed concern about the study’s conclusions.\n\nStatistics show there are “over 14 times as many alcohol-attributable deaths in the UK among 70-74 year-olds than 20-24 year olds,” said Colin Angus, a senior research fellow at the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the UK’s University of Sheffield, in a statement. The data “contradicts the assertion in this new study that we should focus on the drinking of younger age groups,” Angus said.\n\n“The elephant in the room with this study is the interpretation of risk based on outcomes for cardiovascular disease – particularly in older people,” said Dr. Tony Rao, visiting clinical research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London.\n\n“We know that any purported health benefits from alcohol on the heart and circulation are balanced out by the increased risk from other conditions such as cancer, liver disease and mental disorders such as depression and dementia,” Rao said in a statement.\n\nA study published in March found just one pint of beer or glass of wine a day can shrink the overall volume of the brain, with the damage increasing as the number of daily drinks rises. On average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank half of a beer.\n\nResearch in the US has shown drinking among adults rose during pandemic, particularly among women, with “a 41% increase in heavy drinking days,” said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, medical director of the Substance Use Disorders Initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nA study published in June found many moderate drinkers over age 30 binge on the weekend – defined as five or more drinks in a row or within a short period of time. Drinking an average of more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men – or five or more drinks on the same occasion – was linked to alcohol problems nine years later.\n\nWomen are especially sensitive to the effects of alcohol, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or NIAA. Alcohol-related problems appear sooner and at lower drinking levels than in men, it said.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to alcohol-related brain damage and heart disease than men, and studies show women who have one drink a day increase their risk of breast cancer by 5% to 9% compared with those who abstain.\n\n“The recommendation that those under 40 should not drink at all is totally unrealistic,” Matt Lambert, CEO of the Portman Group, an industry-funded group that regulates alcohol marketing in the UK, said in an email.\n\nGakidou, the study’s senior author, admitted that “it’s not realistic to think young adults will stop drinking. Still, we think it’s important to communicate the latest evidence so that everyone can make informed decisions about their health.”\n\nFor those over age 65, any increase in drinking is worrisome because many older adults “use medications that can interact with alcohol, have health conditions that can be exacerbated by alcohol, and may be more susceptible to alcohol-related falls and other accidental injuries,” the NIAA said.\n\n“There is a high threshold for being able to say that alcohol is an effective prevention therapy, and the studies so far do not reach that threshold. If they did, then you can be sure that the drinks industry would be applying to the FDA for a license,” said Dr. Nick Sheron, a professor in the hepatology department at the UK’s University of Southampton.\n\n‘A more detailed and nuanced analysis’\n\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation last published a report on alcohol four years ago when it analyzed 2016 Global Burden of Disease data on people 15 to 49, finding no amount of liquor, wine or beer was safe for overall health.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“What we have done in this new study is a more detailed and nuanced analysis of 21 different world regions,” Gakidou said. “What we’ve been able to do now is break it down: Who is alcohol harmful for? Who is alcohol beneficial to? That’s why the message is coming across as different, but it is actually consistent with what we said before.\n\n“If you ask me, ‘Will the message be different in 10 years?’ Maybe. It is likely new evidence will come out,” she said. “That may change our thinking.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/08/24/health-benefits-coffee-how-much-drink-and-there-risks/1639899001/", "title": "Is coffee healthy or not? Here's how much you should drink — and ...", "text": "Whether it's an iced coffee on a summer morning, a hot cup before work or a warm latte on a snowy day, there is no doubt that Americans love coffee – or at least its caffeine.\n\nWe use it to wake up, stay focused and get work done.\n\nBut two age-old questions about the world's most widely used psychoactive substance linger: How much coffee is too much? And is it actually good for your health?\n\nStudies around the world have attempted to address coffee's health effects to varying results. One study will say coffee is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, while a health professional will say it can lead to higher risk of the condition.\n\nWhen it comes to a drink downed by roughly two-thirds of American adults each day, answers to such simple questions are surprisingly elusive.\n\nFirst, go easy on cream and sugar\n\nAs long as you limit cream and sugar, coffee isn't fattening like other caffeine-based substances such as energy drinks and soda. The calorie content in a plain cup of brewed coffee is next to nothing, and there's no fat either.\n\nBut not everyone drinks their coffee black, as any Starbucks menu suggests.\n\nLoading up a coffee with too much cream or sugar can drown out some of the positive health associations it provides.\n\n“We know that sugar has adverse effects,” Penny Kris-Etherton, a nutrition professor at Penn State University, told the American Heart Association.\n\n“Even if you add sugar and don’t exceed your calorie needs, you’re still negating some of the benefits because sugar is a negative food ingredient.”\n\nDoes coffee cause cancer?: California says those ominous warning signs about coffee being linked to cancer can be taken down\n\nHow much coffee is too much?\n\nThere's ongoing dissent in the health community about how much coffee one should drink.\n\nAmong recent studies, The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded in March that six eight-ounce cups or more per day can increase risk of cardiovascular disease by 22%. The study examined nearly 350,000 individuals.\n\nSimilarly, a 2013 study by University of South Carolina researchers found men and women under the age of 55 who consume an average of more than 28 cups per week (four per day) were more closely associated with death over the course of the 32-year-long study.\n\nWhat a typical home costs in your state: Can you guess which is the most expensive?\n\nBut other research has found that even extremely high coffee intake may be safe. One study partially funded by the British Heart Foundation said you can safely drink 25 cups of coffee per day. It should be noted, however, that the study examined only about 8,000 people around the United Kingdom.\n\nMultiple studies have found that a daily coffee intake of four cups is a safe amount. Even federal dietary guidelines suggest three to five eight-ounce cups of coffee per day (providing up to 400 milligrams of caffeine) can be a part of a healthy diet.\n\nDr. Steven Nissen, Chief Academic Officer of the Heart and Vascular Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, told USA TODAY there isn't a specific daily limit that would apply to everyone, but drinking more than four to five cups provides for more caffeine than he would recommend.\n\n\"Keep in mind that the biological half-life of caffeine is seven to nine hours. So, if you have a bunch of coffee in the morning, it'll be gone by bedtime. But, if you drink it all day long and you really load up, you may have insomnia, which really is an issue,\" said Nissen.\n\nNot all people react to caffeine in the same way, so if you are feeling some of the negative symptoms of the substance, like insomnia or anxiety, don't be afraid to scale back or cut off your coffee intake.\n\nBut is coffee good for you?\n\nMany studies, like the ones cited above, suggest that up to four cups of coffee is a safe amount, but is it actually beneficial for you?\n\nSeveral studies associate normal coffee consumption with health benefits, but they don't prove causation.\n\nAccording to the previously mentioned AJCN study, people who don't drink coffee have a 11% higher chance of cardiovascular disease than those who consume one to two cups per day. The study found decaf drinkers had a 7% higher chance of developing cardiovascular disease as well.\n\nA study from the National Institutes of Health published similar findings: those who drank at least three cups of coffee daily had a 10 percent lower risk of death. The review examined over 400,000 men and women ages 50 to 71.\n\nAdditionally, two studies in the Annals of Internal Medicine supported the idea that a few cups of coffee is linked to a longer life.\n\nOne study examining over 185,000 Americans reported an 18% decreased chance of death compared to non-drinkers. The other study, comprised of more than 520,000 people across Europe, also found that people who drink several cups per day had a lower risk of death than non-drinkers.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these studies are simply observing trends between coffee consumption and health; they don't determine if coffee actually leads to health benefits.\n\nAlong those lines, Nissen staunchly opposed the notion that coffee actively decreases risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\n\"I don't buy it for a moment,\" he said. \"These are what are called observational studies, they're not optimized control trials. They're poor in quality. They're not reliable. I would not drink caffeine to lower your risk of heart disease.\"\n\nNissen views coffee as somewhat of a neutral substance – it won't actively benefit your health, but a safe amount of it is not necessarily bad for you either.\n\n\"My advice to patients is if you like coffee and you want to drink it, it's probably safe. Unless, of course, you have heart rhythm problems, where you can see some increased risk of palpitations,\" Nissen said.\n\n\"With that exception, I don't think there's any evidence for harm, but I don't think there's any evidence for benefit.\"\n\nSpecialty types of coffee, however, like French press coffee, boiled Scandinavian brew and espresso, possess a powerful cholesterol-booster and can raise cholesterol levels by 6 to 8 percent.\n\nWhat about for children and teens?\n\nOf course, caffeine is not limited to adults, and caffeine intake for those 18 and under should be more closely monitored, as you might expect.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics suggests kids aged 12 to 18 limit caffeine use to 100 milligrams per day — about one cup of coffee, one to two cups of tea or two to three sodas.\n\nAre you guilty of these? 3 spending habits that are ruining your chances at retirement\n\nThough few and far between, there are nightmare stories involving teens and caffeine.\n\nDavis Allen Cripe, a 16-year-old high schooler from South Carolina, died in 2017 from a caffeine overdose when he drank a large Diet Mountain Dew, a cafe latte from McDonald’s and an energy drink all within about two hours.\n\nAs for those 12 and under, there is no definitive amount that can be considered safe for all ages.\n\nKeeping a close eye on the caffeine intake of younger ones can help prevent some of the negative side-effects, like anxiety, diarrhea and dehydration.\n\nFollow Jay Cannon on Twitter: @JayTCannon", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/03/09/beer-glass-wine-daily-brain-shrink/9425508002/", "title": "A beer or glass of wine daily may shrink your brain, health study says", "text": "A new study suggests that drinking as little as one beer or glass of wine daily is associated with a shrinkage in brain volume equal to two years of aging.\n\nModerate drinking is defined by the CDC as one drink or less daily for women, two drinks or less daily for men.\n\nThe brain naturally ages, but as the brain ages and shrinks in size, people can experience a decline in memory and other brain functions.\n\nModerate consumption of alcohol – one drink a day for women and up to two for men – is associated with a reduction in brain volume, a new study suggests. And the more you drink, the more your brain may shrink.\n\nYour brain naturally shrinks as you age. But alcohol intake could lead to an accelerated decline in the size of the brain and a faster decline in memory, decision-making and other brain functions, suggests research published this month in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications.\n\nResearchers studied MRIs of more than 36,000 middle-aged adults in the U.K. and compared the scans with their reported alcohol intake. After grouping the subjects by average daily alcohol intake – from none to two beers or glasses of wine or more a day – the researchers found the more alcohol consumed was associated with a more pronounced decline in brain volume, regardless of other factors.\n\nFor someone who's 50, an increase from drinking the equivalent of half a beer or half-glass of wine daily to a full pint or glass of wine was associated with brain shrinkage equivalent to aging two years. Those age 50 who drank more – 1½ beers or glasses of wine daily – had changes in the brain as if they had aged 3½ years, the researchers say.\n\nEven the smallest increase, from not drinking to drinking just one alcohol unit a day (equal to half a beer), was associated with smaller brain volume – about a half year more brain aging. Drinking four drinks a day, compared with not drinking at all, was associated with more than 10 years of brain aging, they found.\n\nWhat concerned the researchers is the findings “contrast with scientific and governmental guidelines on safe drinking limits,” said study co-author Henry Kranzler, who directs the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Studies of Addiction, in a description of the research.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines for moderate drinking – one drink or less a day for women, two drinks or less a day for men – are \"an amount that exceeds the consumption level associated in the study with decreased brain volume,\" Kranzler said.\n\nPast research yielded somewhat conflicting results on alcohol and its brain effects, the researchers say. Heavy drinking has been linked to changes in the brain, including shrinkage. But some studies suggested moderate drinking may have no effect and light to moderate drinking may be beneficial for older adults.\n\nThis study, combined with a growing body of research suggesting an increase in mortality with alcohol consumption, suggests \"the idea that moderate drinking promotes health appears no longer defensible,\" Kranzler told USA TODAY.\n\n\"For pretty much any level of drinking, a reduction is likely to yield health benefits,\" he said.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nBut the study does have limitations, said Emmanuela Gakidou, an alcohol researcher and professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington. \"It seems that they only have information on how much people drank the year prior to when the images were taken,\" not lifetime drinking, she said.\n\nCumulative consumption of alcohol is important in studying its effects on the brain and study subjects could have had higher or lower alcohol intake before the study, Gakidou said.\n\nAlso, at lower levels of alcohol consumption, its relationship between brain volume \"appears very weak at best,\" she said.\n\nThe researchers agreed that the study has limitations, but the large group of people included helped provide \"a clearer picture\" of alcohol's effect on brain volume, Kranzler said. A larger, prospective study with repeated MRI scans is needed to track people and alcohol's effects, as well as track whether abstinence or reduced drinking can change brain volume, too, he said.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/14/study-warns-diet-drinks-pose-risk-stroke-heart-attack-older-women/2875278002/", "title": "Diet drinks pose stroke risk, heart attack for older women, study says", "text": "For women trying to keep a healthy weight after menopause, the American Heart Association has a simple message: Choose water over diet drinks.\n\nA study published Thursday in Stroke, a journal of the AHA, reveals women age 50 and older who consume more than one artificially sweetened drink a day are significantly more likely to have a stroke, a heart attack and an early death.\n\nEven women with no history of heart disease or diabetes are considerably more vulnerable to increased health risks if they drink multiple diet beverages a day.\n\nThe results of the study, which examined data on 81,714 women ages 50-79, tracked for an average of 11.9 years beginning in the mid-to-late ’90s, may come as a blow to those trying to fend off weight gain by eschewing regular sodas in favor of low-calorie alternatives.\n\n“Many well-meaning people, especially those who are overweight or obese, drink low-calorie sweetened drinks to cut calories in their diet,’’ said Yasmin Mossavar-Rahmani, the study’s lead author. “Our research and other observational studies have shown that artificially sweetened beverages may not be harmless and high consumption is associated with a higher risk of stroke and heart disease.”\n\nCompared to other postmenopausal women who imbibed less than one diet drink a week, regular consumers had a 23 percent enhanced likelihood of any kind of stroke, 31 percent higher chance of a stroke caused by a blocked artery – by far the most common – and a 29 percent increased possibility of a heart attack. Their chances of dying from any cause increased by 16 percent.\n\nJust as worrisome was the revelation that two-plus-a-day diet-beverage drinkers without previous heart disease or diabetes were 2.44 times more likely to have a stroke caused by a blood clot. That figure dipped a bit to 2.03 times among obese women without those maladies but skyrocketed to 3.93 times among African-American women.\n\nThe authors warn that their study only shows an association, not a cause-and-effect correlation, behind high consumption of artificially sweetened beverages – whether sodas, fruit juices or other – and the increased health risks.\n\nThey also pointed out the results are not applicable to men or younger women. In July, an advisory by the AHA warned against frequent and long-term consumption of diet drinks, especially for children, and instead recommended water, whether plain, carbonated or flavored without sweeteners.\n\nOne major question left unanswered by the latest study is exactly what ingredient in diet drinks has the adverse health effects.\n\n“We don’t know specifically what types of artificially sweetened beverages they were consuming,’’ Mossavar-Rahmani said of the women in the study, “so we don’t know which artificial sweeteners may be harmful and which may be harmless.”\n\nThe American Beverage Association, which represents the soft-drink industry, did not take issue with the study’s methodology but pointed out that regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Agency consider artificial sweeteners safe.\n\n“In January, the World Health Organization released a major study that reaffirmed the safety and efficacy of these sweeteners as a way to reduce sugar in foods and beverages,’’ the ABA said in a statement. “We support the WHO’s call for people to reduce sugar in their diets and we are doing our part by creating innovative beverages with less sugar or zero sugar, clear calorie labeling, responsible marketing practices and smaller package sizes.”\n\nThere has been mounting evidence about the perils of frequent consumption of diet beverages, which have been linked to higher risk of dementia, obesity and Type 2 diabetes.\n\nThat much is acknowledged in an editorial in the same issue of Stroke as the Mossavar-Rahmani study. The editorial also calls for more research on the various types of artificial sweeteners to discern their individual health effects.\n\nLacking that, the editorial says, water remains the healthiest alternative to sugary drinks, and it concludes:\n\n“If (diet beverage) consumption is used to wean off (sugary drinks), it should be viewed as a time-limited intermediate in the transition to water and other healthier beverages.’’", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/02/17/alcohol-health-effects-risks/11221162002/", "title": "Alcohol's health effects on the body: Risks of drinking, explained", "text": "In recent years scientists have debated how much alcohol is safe for the average person to drink. There's no question that too much is unhealthy, but what counts as too much is still being debated.\n\nExperts in alcohol-related diseases don't want to stop people from having fun, but they often come down on the side of \"less is better\" and any alcohol at all carries some risk. Others, mostly those who focus on population-level data for their research, say there's still a benefit to moderate drinking.\n\nIt comes down to how much risk you are willing to take for that Budweiser, glass of red wine, or gin and tonic.\n\n\"If you're OK with being potentially at risk, then you responsibly drink a small amount of alcohol,\" said breast cancer oncologist Dr. Marleen Meyers, of NYU Langone Health.\n\n\"If you're 100% risk averse, then you don't smoke, you don't drink, you don't go in the sun, you keep your body weight down, exercise, eat well,\" she continued. \"It's an individual choice.\"\n\nOn the flip side, there is some social benefit to relaxing and having a drink – as long as people can control their consumption, said Eric Rimm, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H.

It wouldn't be realistic or ethical to randomly assign one group of people to drink regularly for decades and another group to abstain.\n\nAlso, many factors impact why someone might drink heavily, moderately or not at all, which might also lead them toward or away from other healthy lifestyle factors. That makes it hard to figure out whether it's alcohol or lifestyle or some combination that contributes to their well-being.\n\nResearchers are left with studies modestly flawed in different ways and new data that contradicts older findings.\n\nRimm's work revolves around analyzing such data. He helped write the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which recommends that for those who choose to drink, men consume no more than two drinks a day on any drinking day and women no more than one.\n\nHe remains convinced, based on 40 years of research, that level is fine – and even healthy.\n\nYes, people will likely get more benefit from an hour of exercise than a glass of wine, but alcohol will somewhat reduce the risk of blood clots and improve glucose control, he said. That's why you bleed more if you nick yourself shaving the morning after having a drink or two.\n\nThat's also why he thinks it's probably better to drink small amounts five nights a week rather than just more on weekends – because it will keep alcohol's benefits consistent in the bloodstream.\n\nGeorge Koob, who directs the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, also stands by the American guidelines, though he notes they are currently under review. More and more studies, he said, show that drinking even a small amount increases the risk for cancer, and 5% of cancers are causes by alcohol.\n\nIn January, the Canadian government issued new guidelines, encouraging people to cut their drinking. Health risks from drinking are \"low\" for people who have two drinks or less per week; \"moderate\" for those who consume between three and six drinks per week; and \"increasingly high\" for those who drink seven or more per week, according to the new guidelines.\n\nBinge drinking is also dangerous, the report concluded: \"Consuming more than two standard drinks per drinking occasion is associated with an increased risk of harms to self and others, including injuries and violence.\"\n\nSpecialists in liver disease, oncology and cardiology, among others, argue there's no totally safe level of alcohol.\n\n\"Any benefit that you see from heart disease and diabetes, it's weighed by the increased risk of cancer,\" said Dr. Brian Lee, a liver specialist at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. \"There's no alcohol that can improve your health and probably any alcohol use is harmful.\"\n\nHow long does alcohol stay in your system? That depends on age, weight and medications\n\nHeavy drinking is unhealthy for everyone\n\nAll the experts agree that heavy drinking – more than one drink a day for women and two for men – presents serious health risks.\n\n\"The problem that we haven't recognized is what is the excessive amounts of alcohol that definitely leads to problems,\" Koob said. (His organization offers a Treatment Navigator to help people with drinking problems.)\n\nHeavy drinking can cause all sorts of health problems, including liver disease, some types of cancer, heart attack, stroke and an increased risk of accidents such as falls and car crashes. Some evidence suggests alcohol can exacerbate the effects of dementia, Koob said.\n\nIn Massachusetts alcohol accounted for 1 in 20 deaths – roughly 3,000 in 2019.\n\nHeavy drinking also costs the public money, David Jernigan, a Boston University School of Public Health professor of health law, policy and management, recently told Massachusetts legislators. In 2010, the most recent data available, problem drinking cost the state government $345 per person, he said, while alcohol taxes generated only $11.\n\nDid you try Dry January? Here's how to keep healthy habits going all year\n\nMedications and psychotherapy can help people with alcohol use disorder remain sober for the two to five years needed to dramatically reduce the risk of relapse, said Dr. David Streem, a psychiatrist and medical director of the Cleveland Clinic's Alcohol and Drug Recovery Center.\n\nBeverage companies and others are recognizing the need to provide alcohol alternatives, selling mocktails and opening dry bars, Koob said. There's Dry January, Sober October and even a section in the Green Bay Packers' Lambeau Field for those who want to avoid alcohol.\n\n\"I see a shift to people wanting to engage with alcohol in a healthier way,\" he said.\n\nOne drink a day?\n\nDr. Henry R. Kranzler directs the Center for Studies of Addiction at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. He is also a wine lover.\n\nHis research suggests that drinking more than about one drink a day – for both men and women – is associated with lower white and gray matter in the brain. In other words, people who drink much more than that may have cognitive problems.\n\n\"The more you drink, the more health risk you incur,\" he said. \"Low levels, like a drink a day on average or less, is probably not meaningfully increasing your risk.\"\n\nKranzler keeps his own red wine consumption below this. \"I drink three or four times a week and I have one or one-and-a-half glasses of wine. I'm not concerned that's adversely affecting my health.\"\n\nOne drink per day increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and death by about 10% to 20%, but Dr. Stanley Hazen, who specializes in preventive cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, thinks it's the sweet spot for the heart. Two drinks increase the danger.\n\n\"By three drinks, you're at more than double the risk,\" he said. \"That's the same magnitude as having diabetes.\"\n\nThe role of genetics\n\nAlcohol has been part of human life likely at least since people started cultivating crops, said Dr. Victor Karpyak, a psychiatrist who studies the genetics of alcoholism at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nStill, some people are more sensitive to alcohol's effects than others. \"Rather than trying to apply a one-size-fits-all approach, we need to consider a more personalized point of view,\" he said.\n\nBetween 15% and 25% of white people carry a genetic risk for alcohol abuse, showing a greater response to alcohol, Streem said. Less than 5% of Black Americans have the same genetic mutation.\n\nPeople of Asian descent often carry a gene that protects against alcoholism by causing the person to flush or feel sick with the first few sips. They lack a protein that normally breaks down a toxic breakdown product of alcohol, Kranzler said.\n\nAre Asians 'allergic' to alcohol? How the dreaded 'glow' makes drinking feel isolating\n\nFor someone with an alcohol use problem, the only safe level of drinking is none, Streem said. Someone with a family history of alcohol use disorder also should avoid all alcohol.\n\n\"We know there's a lot of genetic risk that is carried from one generation to the next, even if you only have one parent or one side of the family that has significant substance use history,\" he said.\n\nMen whose fathers had a drinking problem are at highest risk and shouldn't drink at all. \"Once you have a genetic proclivity to develop the disorder, there's only one missing piece and that's exposure to the substance,\" Streem said.\n\nCompared to men, women are more likely to avoid alcohol entirely or drink less. But women who do drink excessively develop more medical problems, Karpyak's review of contemporary research has found.\n\nStill, genetic makeup contributes about 50% to 60% of vulnerability to alcohol use disorder, Karpyak said, with environmental factors making up the balance.\n\nHow to find the 'right' amount for you\n\nA \"safe\" level of alcohol is going to be different for everyone, depending on their personal risks and tolerance.\n\nA woman who consumes the same amount of alcohol as a man likely will have a higher blood alcohol concentration, Kranzler said. That's because women tend to be lighter than men and tend to have lower lean body mass, which determines how alcohol is distributed in the body and its concentration in the brain.\n\nPeople also tend to have less lean body mass as they age, so an older person will reach a high blood alcohol concentration faster than a young one, he said.\n\nDrinkers also develop tolerance, so a person who consumes alcohol regularly will be less impacted by that first drink than a teetotaler, Kranzler said.\n\nStarting to drink at a young age also increases risk for drinking problems later on, as does being exposed to marijuana before age 14.\n\nIt's important for parents to explain this risk to young adolescents, especially those with a family history of alcohol problems. Just as some kids can't eat peanuts because of allergies, others shouldn't drink or use marijuana at an early age because they are already at higher risk than their friends, Streem said.\n\nFor her patients and those at high risk for breast cancer, Meyers recommends no drinking at all.\n\n\"We would never say to a patient 'one cigarette occasionally is OK.' It's the same with alcohol,\" she said. \"The advice I would give to anyone who has cancer or wants to reduce the risk of cancer is to drink as sparingly as possible.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Meyers said, medicine is not yet to the point where a doctor can identify each person's individual risk.\n\nThere will always be people who live to 100 eating bacon, drinking whiskey and smoking every day. But it's not possible to identify those lucky few early in life. Until then, she said, the only guidance people have is from population-level data suggesting \"what you can do to bring your odds down.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

However, only ground and instant coffee with caffeine reduced the risk for an irregular heartbeat called arrhythmia. Decaffeinated coffee did not lower that risk, according to the study published Wednesday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.\n\nPrior studies have also found moderate amounts of black coffee — between 3 and 5 cups daily — has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, as well as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, liver disease and prostate cancer.\n\n“This manuscript adds to the body of evidence from observational trials associating moderate coffee consumption with cardioprotection, which looks promising,” said Charlotte Mills, a lecturer in nutritional sciences at the University of Reading in the UK, in a statement.\n\nHowever, this study, like many in the past, was only observational in nature and therefore cannot prove a direct cause and effect, added Mills, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“Does coffee make you healthy or do inherently healthier people consume coffee?” she asked. “Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove the relationship between coffee and cardiovascular health.”\n\nGround, caffeinated coffee lowered risk the most\n\nThe study used data from the UK Biobank, a research database which contained coffee consumption preferences on nearly 450,000 adults who were free of arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. They were divided into four groups: those who enjoyed caffeinated ground coffee, those who chose decaffeinated coffee, those who preferred caffeinated instant coffee, and those who did not drink coffee at all.\n\nAfter an average of 12.5 years, researchers looked at medical and death records for reports of arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease, stroke and death. After adjusting for age, diabetes, ethnicity, high blood pressure, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, sex, smoking status, and tea and alcohol consumption, researchers found all types of coffee were linked with a reduction in death from any cause.\n\nThe fact that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was beneficial “might suggest that it is not simply the caffeine which could potentially explain any associated reduction in risk,” said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston University Medical School in Birmingham in the UK, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Caffeine is the most well-known constituent in coffee, but the beverage contains more than 100 biologically active components,” said Kistler, who holds joint appointments as professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne and Monash University.\n\n“It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival,” Kistler said.\n\nDrinking two to three cups of coffee a day was linked to the largest reduction in early death, compared to people who drank no coffee, according to the statement. Ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of death by 27%, followed by 14% for decaffeinated, and 11% for instant caffeinated coffee.\n\nThe link between coffee and a lowered risk for heart disease and stroke was not as robust: Drinking two to three cups a day of ground coffee lowered risk by 20%, while the same amount of decaf coffee reduced risk by 6% and instant by 9%.\n\nThe data changed when it came to coffee’s impact on irregular heartbeat: Four to five cups a day of caffeinated ground coffee lowered risk by 17% while two to three cups a day of instant coffee reduced the likelihood of arrhythmia by 12%, the statement said.\n\nMore study needed\n\nA limitation of the study was that coffee consumption was self-reported at a single point in time, said Annette Creedon, a nutritional scientist and manager at the British Nutrition Foundation, which is partially funded by food producers, retailers and food service companies.\n\n“This study had a median follow-up period of 12.5 years during which many aspects of the participants diet and lifestyle may have changed,” said Creedon in a statement. She was not part of the research.\n\nIn addition, coffee can produce negative side effects in some people, she added. People with sleep issues or uncontrolled diabetes, for example, should check with a doctor before adding caffeine to their diets.\n\nThese negative side effects “can be particularly relevant to individuals who are sensitive to the effects of caffeine,” Creedon said. “Hence, the findings of this study do not indicate that people should start drinking coffee if they do not already drink it or that they should increase their consumption.”\n\nMost studies are focused on the health benefits of black coffee, and do not take into account the extra sugars, creams, milks and processed additives that many people use in coffee.\n\n“A simple cup of coffee perhaps with a little milk is very different to a large latte flavoured with a syrup and added cream,” Mellor said.\n\nAdding sugars and dairy fats to coffee can reduce their health benefits, experts say. Adobe Stock\n\nIn addition, how coffee is brewed can also affect its benefits for health. Filtered coffee catches a compound called cafestol that exists in the oily part of coffee. Cafestol can increase bad cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoproteins).\n\nHowever, using a French press, Turkish coffee maker or boiling coffee (as is often done in Scandinavian countries), does not remove cafestol.\n\nAnd, finally, coffee’s benefits do not apply to children – even adolescents should not drink colas, coffees, energy drinks or other beverages with any amount of caffeine, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/03/11/beverages-fruit-drinks-sports-drinks-juices-flavored-water/24713883/", "title": "Study: Parents wrongly think sugary drinks healthy", "text": "Bruce Horovitz\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBamboozled by misleading product marketing and labeling, parents have failed to get the message that sugary drinks — beyond soda — are not healthy for kids.\n\nThat's the conclusion of a new study from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at University of Connecticut, published today in Public Health Nutrition.\n\nMany parents believe that drinks with high amounts of added sugar — particularly fruit drinks, sports drinks and flavored water — are \"healthy\" options for kids, according to the report, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which focuses on improving health and health care. Never mind that the most recent federal dietary guidelines recommended limiting added sugar to 10% of total calories.\n\n\"Although many parents know that soda is not good for children, many still believe that sugary drinks are healthy options,\" says Jennifer Harris, who wrote the study and is director of marketing initiatives at Rudd Center. \"The labeling and marketing for these products imply that they are nutritious, and these misperceptions may explain why so many parents buy them.\"\n\nThe findings come at a particularly difficult time for the beverage industry, which has seen sales of regular and diet carbonated soft drinks steadily decline in recent years.

There's nothing wrong with having a sports drink or a soda or a juice drink — it's about moderation and balance. And parents get that.\"\n\nThe vast majority of parents give kids sugary drinks regularly. Some 96% of parents say they gave sugary drinks to their kids in the month prior to the survey. The most common sugary drinks that parents give kids are fruit drinks — given by 77% of parents in the past month, the survey found. Some 80% of parents of children age 2 to 5 provided fruit drinks, such as Capri Sun or Sunny D.\n\nEqually significant, nearly half of parents surveyed rated flavored waters as healthy, and more than one-quarter considered fruit drinks and sports drinks to be healthy. African-American and Hispanic parents were more likely than white parents to rate some sugary drinks as healthy, the study found.\n\nParents said they were particularly influenced by nutritional claims appearing on the packages — such as claims that the items are \"real\" or \"natural\" or contained vitamin C or antioxidants, or were low in sodium or calories.\n\nThat, says Marlene Schwartz, a study author, is why there's a need for increased attention to ingredient claims on product packaging, \"and other marketing tools that may mislead parents to believe that some sugary drinks are healthful options for children.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/08/24/alcohol-death-disease-study-beer-wine/1082443002/", "title": "Alcohol is a leading cause of death, disease worldwide, study says", "text": "Alcohol is killing more people globally than we originally thought, according to a new study.\n\nThe study, published Thursday in the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet, found that alcohol, such as beer and wine, is a leading risk factor for death and disease, associated with 2.8 million deaths each year and the seventh-leading risk factor for premature death and disability globally in 2016.\n\nResearchers used 694 studies to estimate worldwide drinking patterns and used 592 studies plus 28 million people to learn about alcohol's health risks between 1990 and 2016 in 195 countries.\n\nThey found drinking alcohol was associated with nearly 1 in 10 deaths of people ages 15 to 49 years old.

Part 1: 10 things you probably don't know about the Space Coast can be found here.\n\nIf there's one thing that Titusvillians think they know about Titusville, it's that they know everything about Titusville.\n\nAnd if they don't know everything about Titusville, they know a family that's been here for six generations that knows everything.\n\nBut what if I told you there was more to this North Brevard town than what meets the eye? Although known for its prime launch viewing spots and history with Kennedy Space Center, Titusville's roots run deeper than the highs and lows of its space age.\n\nThink you know everything about Titusville?\n\nHere are 10 things that you might not know:\n\n1. Titusville has the county's only fire safety clown\n\nJust recently, Titusville became the only city in the county to employ a fire safety clown. And yes, it is exactly how it sounds. Meet Kerri Lubeski, the Life Safety Specialist for the Titusville Fire Department, and her alter ego \"Ember,\" the fire safety clown. Lubeski graduated March 30 from the Florida State Fire College in Ocala, which offers a week-long fire clown training program. And again, yes, there is indeed a clown school just for firefighters. The idea is \"public education through characterization,\" said Lubeski, and she plans to utilize her talents at community events, school visits and through other public outreach efforts.\n\n\"It's just a different way to teach fire prevention messages with a character that can exaggerate things and create a message that will stay with them for a long time because it was taught by a clown,\" said Lubeski.\n\nShe said she's aware that a lot of people are afraid of clowns, but still hopes \"Ember\" will be a positive influence on the community.\n\n2. Bruce Springsteen, Rascal Flatts and Fleetwood Mac all have a common link to Titusville\n\nIf you've been to a concert by Rascal Flatts, Fleetwood Mac, Kid Rock, Melissa Etheridge, Bruce Springsteen or even Demi Lavato, there's a good chance you witnessed a piece of Titusville on stage.\n\nAll of these music artists have a common link to the Space Coast, and it's that their bands include musical instruments made right here in Titusville. Gold Tone Music Group is a worldwide brand that sits in an unassuming location right on Hopkins Avenue. The location houses its family-run factory, and works with music distributors worldwide. Its biggest distributor? Amazon.\n\nGold Tone is as inconspicuously famous as it gets. Many Titusvillians aren't aware that this musical power player is right in their backyard. Folk musicians Wayne and Robyn Rogers opened a music store in Brevard in the 1970s but eventually developed a \"traveling banjo,\" which put their business on the map. The company now carries five different product lines, including the \"zero glide\" nut system the company patented. That's a special part that reduces contact between the string and the nut of an instrument.\n\n3. Tarzan once opened a theme park here\n\nYoungsters may not know of a man named Johnny Weissmuller, but he's a pretty big deal to those who have been in the area for generations. He was an actor that was most famous for his role playing Tarzan in the movies from the 1930s and 1940s. He was also an Olympic athlete. You know the famous Tarzan yodel? Weissmuller invented that and allegedly yelled it to his neighbors from the back door of his Titusville home on Knox McRae.\n\nWeissmuller didn't just live here, though. He was part of a theme park called \"Tropical Wonderland\" in the 1950s. Tropical Wonderland, which was eventually renamed \"Florida Wonderland,\" was located at the intersection of U.S. 1 and State Road 50. It touted Wild West shootouts, a train ride and a zoo featuring alligators, monkeys, lions and an elephant ... which met its demise when it got loose on U.S. 1 and was hit by a semi-truck.\n\nAn elephant died on U.S. 1 in Titusville? It's true, according to North Brevard Historical Society documents. One of the original Tropical Wonderland buildings, an iconic A-frame structure, still stands today.\n\n4. Monkeys used to roam the streets (and may still)\n\nThanks to the failed Florida Wonderland theme park, monkeys were dumped in Titusville following its closure, according to North Brevard Historical Society records. The non-native primates roamed areas all around Sisson Road and the Enchanted Forest. Some old-timers even recalled seeing them found dead. Some could even be spotted today.\n\nLocals say that it's been awhile since a monkey sighting (the 1990s), but anything's possible.\n\n5. There's a wild sunflower field that makes the best backdrop for pictures\n\nNear where Tropical Wonderland once stood is now a sunflower field that blooms every year. In May, locals can be found posing for pictures among the beautiful, yellow landscape. The flowers were planted by Bob Kirk of Kirk Realty, who owns the property, and wanted it to be a community garden of sorts. He said he enjoyed seeing people take pictures in the field, and even planted corn on the property for kids to come and pick for free. He said a group of children would collect sunflowers each year and bring them to local hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nUnfortunately, Kirk said he isn't replanting this year as the property is being permitted for a new development. If you need a sunflower fix, Sledd's U-Pick farm in Mims hosts a sunflower maze at least twice a year in May and in the fall. It's currently open for the season.\n\n6. There are cliffs and quarries hidden among Titusville's ancient dunes\n\nRewind about 120,000 years and Titusville was beachfront property, said David Celli, who works for Brevard County Parks and Recreation and is a self-proclaimed \"fossil hunter.\" Celli walked through the woods near WW James Park off of Sisson Road until he reached a cliff that stood above a pool of water. He called the sandy hills in South Titusville \"the ridge.\"\n\nThese are the ancient dunes, he said, and you will find coquina rock quarries and remnants of a time when the ocean barreled over Titusville's coastline, and even farther onto the mainland. Celli said he found a 5-inch-long shark tooth in Gainesville, indicating the entire state was once waterfront.\n\nWalk the ridge near Sisson Road, the Enchanted Forest, State Road 405 or Grissom Parkway and experience a piece of prehistoric Florida.\n\n7. A popular fishing boat was invented in Titusville\n\nFor those who want the maneuverability of a canoe, but the balance and strength of a fishing boat, behold the Gheenoe. The Gheenoe is a boat developed by Harley Gheen, who was an avid fisherman and senior designer at Kennedy Space Center in the 1960s. He abandoned his career to develop his specialized fishing boat, which decades later is legend among fishermen worldwide.\n\nThere are four models of Gheenoe boats manufactured at the Gheenoe location on State Road 405 in Titusville and two additional models manufactured on Childre Ave. Gheenoe is now run by Harley's two sons, Sam and \"Pugar.\"\n\n8. The \"redfish capital of the world\"\n\nOne of Titusville's claims to fame is it is the \"redfish capital of the world.\" Of course, there are a number of other places that make this same claim. However, the lagoons that border Titusville are known for their plentiful supply of large redfish.\n\nA paradise of sorts for local fishermen, redfish tails can be spotted peeping up throughout the Mosquito Lagoon and various other areas of the Indian River Lagoon. Of course, Merritt Island must also deserve credit for this, as the wildlife refuge borders these areas as well.\n\n9. The name used to be Sand Point\n\nTitusville was not always Titusville, a group of historians at the North Brevard Historical Society told FLORIDA TODAY. It was once \"Sand Point,\" a name many wish would have stuck.\n\nThe name was changed after Colonel Henry Titus won a domino game against Captain Clark Rice in 1873 for naming rights. Titus was the unofficial postmaster of the town and when it became incorporated in 1867, he gave the city his namesake.\n\n10. Most of downtown Titusville burned to the ground\n\nModern-day historic downtown Titusville is but a fraction of what it used to be in the 1800s. Nearly all of downtown, about 42 buildings and outhouses, were burned to the ground in the great fire of 1895. One person was killed, and others were injured.\n\nThe fire was a case of arson and two men were arrested for the deed. It started in the Hamburg dry goods store and spread throughout the city thanks to a strong western wind that night, according to North Brevard Historical Society documents. Town council documents, books and notable pieces of Titusville's history were destroyed in the process. The estimated damage at the time? $60,000.\n\nThe two men arrested for the crime were found guilty and faced jail time in Orlando because locals did not want them housed in the area.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\n— As mentioned in the first part of this series, 10 things you may not know about the Space Coast, one of the greatest archaeological discoveries in history happened in ... a Titusville subdivision. While developing the Windover Farms subdivision, an ancient burial site was found in a pond. “The remains uncovered at the Windover site were between 7,000 and 8,000 years old, making them 3,200 years older than King Tutankhamen and 2,000 years older than the Great Pyramids of Egypt,\" according to Florida Frontiers.\n\n— Also mentioned in the first article, Titusville has an endangered plant that only grows there. Its fancy scientific name is Dicerandra thinicola Miller, but experts call it the \"Titusville mint\" for short. It has a strong minty smell and may have long term medicinal use. Spot it along the path that runs through the Imperial States neighborhood through to Barna Avenue.\n\n— Titusville shares a claim to fame with Rockledge for hosting a drive-in movie theater that showed pornos. The Moon Drive-In theater was located on State Road 50 in Titusville and showed X-rated films. Its racy content was booted in 1979 and turned into a more \"family friendly\" site, according to FLORIDA TODAY archives. Rockledge also had an X-rated drive-in theater on Barnes Boulevard.\n\nThis is the second part of a series that examines fun facts about the Space Coast's history. Up next is Merritt Island.\n\nSpecial thanks to Betty Mattingly, Esther Vulpius and Michael Knight of the North Brevard Historical Society who interviewed with FLORIDA TODAY and provided historical resources.\n\nContact trends reporter Jessica Saggio at jsaggio@floridatoday.com, 321-242-3664 or follow her on Twitter @JessicaJSaggio.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2016/02/04/abuduction-kidnapping-murder-death-baby-steve-pokin-lloyd-keet/79307942/", "title": "Pokin Around: Abduction and killing of baby was sensational news ...", "text": "Steve Pokin\n\nSPOKIN@NEWS-LEADER.COM\n\nIn January I received a letter asking if I knew anything about the kidnapping of a baby from a house on Meadowmere Street in the early 1900s.\n\nDid I know that the kidnapping and subsequent death of the baby was news across the nation?\n\nI did not.\n\nA month later, here I am, shaking the rattle of baby Lloyd Keet, who was kidnapped and killed in 1917. His abductors were convicted of kidnapping, but murder charges were dropped before trial.\n\nThe rattle I hold is metal, with a mother-of-pearl handle.\n\nI lift the baby's feeding bowl. I feel its heft. The saucer has his name on it: Josiah Lloyd Keet. His nickname was \"Buddy,\" which is on his small grave marker at Maplewood Cemetery.\n\nI sit in the front room of Jennefer Keet, a relative of the baby who died so many years ago. She lives north of Springfield.\n\nAs I pull letters from a small suitcase I am transported 99 years back in time. The suitcase has the initials of the baby's mother, MLK: May Lloyd Keet. She died in 1980, a mother forever changed by the abduction and death of her baby.\n\nJennefer has been crying. That's because she has been reading the letters in the suitcase. She had forgotten the satchel was in her closet — until I called and asked to see the letters.\n\nHer grandfather was the baby's older brother. His name was James H. Keet Jr., a longtime circuit judge who died in 2005.\n\nJames, then called Jimmie, was 3 years old and asleep upstairs in the Meadowmere home when his baby brother was snatched from the first-floor nursery.\n\nThe man ultimately held responsible for the kidnapping had a hangman's noose placed around his neck. He was strung up three times but did not die. We'll get to that.\n\nJennefer helped care for Judge Keet in his final years. As a result, she became the family archivist.\n\nIn addition to the letters, she has a fistful of Western Union telegrams that were sent to the newspaper and then forwarded to the baby's grieving parents.\n\nShe has dozens of newspapers from across the nation. Front-page headlines scream with news of the baby's kidnapping and death.\n\nBut it's the hand-written letters in the satchel I find most interesting — even more intriguing than the fact that newspapers once cost 2 cents.\n\nThe letters form a time capsule of human kindness.\n\nIn one are the remnants of a flower. Another letter once contained $2 for the purchase of flowers for the dead baby. Many of the envelopes are marked with the word \"answered.\"\n\nJennefer, to her surprise, finds an unopened envelope. It had been tucked within another envelope.\n\nIt was written by William T. Gautier of Columbus, Georgia, on June 10, 1917, the day after baby Lloyd's body was found at the bottom of an abandoned well.\n\nHe wrote it to the baby's parents: James Holland Keet and May Lloyd Keet, Jennefer's great-grandparents.\n\nToday, for the first time, the words of Mr. Gautier, whom I presume is dead, are read:\n\n\"Never in my life has my heart gone out in such a flood of genuine sympathy as it does to you in your sorrow.\"\n\nI wonder: How long does sorrow keep? Ninety-nine years?\n\nJosiah Lloyd Keet, 14 months, was kidnapped the night of May 30, 1917, from his parents' home at 1455 E. Meadowmere St.\n\nHe was taken on a Wednesday night from one of Springfield's most popular and prosperous families. The parents were a short distance away at a dance at the Springfield Country Club, which at the time was at 1325 S. Glenstone Ave. The Country Club Shopping Center is there now.\n\nThe couple's two boys had been left with two maids. When the parents returned about midnight, the maids were upstairs with Jimmie. But Lloyd was gone.\n\nA screen had been removed from the nursery window where he had been in his crib. Two sets of footprints were outside the window.\n\nThe next morning, the father received a ransom note asking for $6,000. It started with: \"We've got your kid, don't say any thing to the police or put it in the papers.\"\n\nHe was given instructions on where to drive — starting at the downtown square. He was told to have someone light the sign atop the Heer's building when he started his journey. That way, the letter said, the abductors would know he was on his way.\n\nThey told him they would know if anyone followed him.\n\nThe father, 33 at the time, gathered the cash, according to news accounts written subsequently. The money was not a problem. He was one of the wealthiest men in the Ozarks, reportedly worth $3 million. He had headed the Holland bank and owned a prosperous dry goods store. He was willing to pay to get his baby back.\n\nHe drove his Roadster — an open-top, two-seater — the night after the kidnapping. It rained hard into the topless car and lightning danced across the night sky, according to news accounts. Following the demands of the ransom note, he drove for hours that night in Greene and Christian counties.\n\nUnfortunately, someone had followed him. The captors saw this and chose not to meet with him. The ransom was never paid.\n\n\"They don’t know who followed him,\" says local historian Richard Crabtree, who has researched the kidnapping and is the author of the website Springfield, Missouri History, Landmarks and Vintage Photography. He occasionally gives talks on the Keet kidnapping.\n\nIn 1917, says Crabtree, not everyone had a car. Many simply walked or rode a horse. But the father was wealthy and well equipped to drive during a terrible thunderstorm. He had been a race car driver for several years.\n\n\"He was kind of a playboy,\" Crabtree says. \"He was an attractive guy. They were just a nice, young, wealthy couple.\"\n\nPolice took over the investigation, although the Keets brought in Pinkerton investigators from St. Louis and bloodhounds. Soon, according to news stories, psychics were called.\n\nThe story was huge.\n\n\"It was covered by the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune,\" Crabtree says. \"The only thing that knocked it out of the headlines for a while was our entry into World War I.\"\n\nThe United States had entered the war the month before the kidnapping.\n\n\"At the time, there was not a lot of kidnapping going on,\" Crabtree says. \"That is why it made such big news. There was such a reaction — how could you kidnap someone who was so young and innocent?\"\n\nThe Keet abduction occurred 14 years prior to the most famous kidnapping in American history — the abduction on March 1, 1932, and subsequent murder of the 20-month-old son of famous aviator Charles Lindbergh.\n\nBut back In 1917, the notion of taking a baby for ransom was almost unheard of, says John Sellars, executive director of the History Museum on the Square.\n\n\"The thought of kidnapping and killing a small child was so heinous; it had a terrible impact not only here but on kidnapping laws after that,\" he says.\n\nIn fact, Springfield attorney Roscoe Patterson represents a historical link between the kidnappings. Patterson was the Greene County prosecutor in 1906 when three black men awaiting trial were unlawfully seized from jail by a mob that lynched them on the Springfield Square.\n\nEleven years later, angry mobs in 1917 threatened to lynch the Keet kidnappers on the same square.\n\nThe Keet family hired Patterson to help prosecute the man believed to be the ringleader of the kidnapping crew.\n\nYears later, Patterson became a Missouri U.S. senator. He co-sponsored a bill that made kidnapping a federal crime, as it is today. The bill had gone nowhere for years. It was enacted into law three months after the Lindbergh kidnapping.\n\nI went to see the Keet house, the scene of the crime. It is a beautiful home set back from the street in one of Springfield's most attractive neighborhoods. The interior has exposed timbers which give the house a rustic feel.\n\nJim and Stephanie Michels bought it in June 2011.\n\nIt didn't take long for neighbors to inform them they had purchased the \"Keet house,\" constructed for James and May Keet in 1910.\n\n\"At the time, this house was built outside of city limits,\" Jim Michels says. \"It was a get-away and I heard it was built to look like a hunting lodge in Wyoming where the Keet family used to go.\"\n\nNeighbors also informed him of the kidnapping and death of the baby.\n\n\"It does not bother me at all,\" Michels says. \"I am not afraid of ghosts.\"\n\nBilly Long bought the house in 1995. Long was elected to Congress in 2010. He did extensive remodeling of the house and sold it in 2000.\n\nLike Michels, Long was unaware of the kidnapping until after he bought the house. The knowledge does not bother him.\n\n\"It was a long time ago,\" he says.\n\nJames Holland Keet, baby Lloyd's father, died in 1945 at age 61.\n\nThe baby's mother, May, continued to live in the home until her death in 1980, at age 94.\n\nAfter the death of her baby, her grandsons say, May never again agreed to be photographed.\n\n\"She enjoyed being out with family and friends,\" says grandson James Holland Keet III, 66, of Little Rock, Arkansas. \"But she no longer was interested in seeking new friends very much.\"\n\nThe two grandsons grew up in the house on Meadowmere. They remember security bars over the windows.\n\nJames Holland Keet III recalls as a boy coming home late one day. He had not told his parents where he was.\n\n\"My mom had been very worried and I found out that my 5-foot 2-inch mother had one helluva right cross,\" he says.\n\nHe entered politics in Arkansas and in 2010 was the Republican candidate for governor. He lost to Democratic incumbent Mike Beebe.\n\nThe other grandson, James Calvin Keet, 73, lives in Hawaii.\n\nHe also remembers the bars on the windows. But he does not recall his family ever discussing the kidnapping and death.\n\n\"It is not something they talked about,\" he says.\n\nThe police investigation led to Claude Piersol, a 20-year-old Springfield man, and five others — four from the same Springfield family\n\nMembers of the abduction crew months earlier had made the mistake of talking about kidnapping someone else — Springfield jeweler C.A. Clement.\n\nPolice arrested Piersol and the others in connection to the plot to kidnap Clement, which was never carried out. But part of that plan involved taking Clement to the abandoned Crenshaw Mansion, a 14-room brick home built prior to the Civil War near today's intersection of Kansas Expressway and Battlefield Road. A Hy-Vee is there now.\n\nPolice suspected them in the Keet kidnapping, as well, and they were being held in the Greene County jail.\n\nFamily friends of the Keets searched the Crenshaw Mansion. A caretaker showed them where a large stone had been slightly moved atop an abandoned well. They found baby Lloyd 8 feet down in the cold water. This was eight days after the abduction.\n\nNews reports offer two versions of how the baby died. One was that he was colicky and his captors stuffed handkerchiefs in his mouth to quiet him and he suffocated. The other was that he was colicky and they gave him too much laudanum, an opiate drug used as a cough suppressant at the time. The overdose, the story goes, killed him.\n\nOnce the dead baby was found, thousands of angry people rushed to the square. Many wanted to lynch the suspects. Three black men had been hanged without trial on the square just 11 years earlier.\n\nFearing a lynching, Greene County Sheriff Will Webb hustled the suspects into two cars to flee Springfield. His original destination was the state penitentiary in Jefferson City. But various vigilante groups forced him in different directions.\n\nIt was in Stockton that a mob of 600 caught up with Sheriff Webb. They forcefully took Piersol, the ringleader, promising the sheriff they would wring a confession from him, but not kill him.\n\nThey took Piersol outside the Stockton city limits, tightened a noose around his neck and three times jerked him from his feet. His eyes bulged and his face turned purple, according to news accounts. He continued to proclaim his innocence. On the third time he passed out and the mob returned him to the sheriff.\n\nMonths later, the trial was moved to Marshfield. Murder charges were dropped. The kidnappers faced life in prison.\n\nPiersol maintained his innocence and was convicted largely on the plans the crew had to kidnap Clement, the testimony of handwriting experts — who said Piersol wrote the Keet ransom notes — and the testimony of a country club employee who said he saw Piersol in a car following Mr. and Mrs. Keet the night of the dance.\n\nTwo members of the crew were sentenced to 15 and 10 years in prison, respectively. Charges were dropped against three.\n\nPiersol was sentenced to 35 years in prison. According to some news stories, he confessed to the Keet kidnapping after his conviction.\n\nHe served only 21 of those years and was released.\n\nPiersol, the man convicted of one of the most heinous crimes in Missouri history, lived his final 24 years a free man. He died at the age of 65 in Kansas City, where he had worked as a locksmith.\n\nThese are the views of Steve Pokin, the News-Leader's columnist.

Park rangers evacuated Mesquite Springs Campground and sheltered in place with 20 visitors at a high point on the rim of Uhehebe Crater, park officials said.\n\nThat night, a park ranger watched power poles and metal dumpsters float out of Grapevine Canyon—an initial indicator of the flood's impact.\n\nRestoration challenges\n\nCrews faced multiple obstacles as they began restoration work, such as funding proposals, contract modifications, and later finding damage to sewage collection pipes.\n\nThe wall studs in the historic Garage were found to be so rotted that they didn't touch the ground. That building was partially held up by the exterior stucco.\n\nConstruction contractors were dealing with repairs to historic structures built in the 1920s, which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and required consultation with the California Office of Historic Preservation.\n\nAs restoration work continued, the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020, which impacted the work timeline as the global supply chain halted or slowed.\n\nAt the same time, park revenue was reduced by a significant drop in international tourism.\n\nOn April 22, 2021, contractors arrived at Scotty's Castle to find the historic Garage completely engulfed in flames and spreading to the historic Longshed.\n\nUsing federal funds, the restoration project also needed a review, according to the National Environmental Policy Act and also the National Historic Preservation Act, which required consultation with local Native American tribes, park officials stated.\n\nAs of Nov. 15, 2024, Scotty's Castle is expected to fully reopen in fall 2026. This is due to the previously mentioned funding challenges, compliance with laws to protect historic and natural features, contracting issues, unforeseen conditions, the pandemic and the fire, park officials stated.\n\nScotty’s Castle\n\nIn 1904, Scott was in Chicago seeking backers for his legendary gold mines, and E.A. Shedd and Albert Johnson invested, despite receiving no return.\n\nA millionaire, Johnson continued to invest in Scott's ventures, and in 1906, he made his first attempt to visit the gold mine in Death Valley.\n\nThe traveling party was attacked on its way into the valley and Scott's brother, Warner, was shot in the groin. The party had to leave in search of medical attention for Warner.\n\nIn 1909, Johnson returned to California. Although he still found no gold, the dry weather and outdoor life proved beneficial to his health.\n\nJohnson made repeated trips to visit Scott in the desert and by the time he realized that there was no gold mine, he had started to acquire land.\n\n28th Annual ‘Long Walk’: Troops to march from Ft. Irwin to Barstow Veterans Home\n\nOf the 1,500 acres he eventually owned, the Steininger Ranch was the most important parcel. Nestled in a spring-fed verdant valley, this was soon to be the site of the Death Valley Ranch.\n\nJohnson's business interests prospered in the 1920s, and he began building his winter ranch home in 1922, which would later be known as Scotty’s Castle.\n\nIn the 1930s, Johnson’s fortune declined. He and his wife, Bessie, then moved from Chicago to Los Angeles and spent more time at the ranch.\n\nFor various reasons, Johnson felt beneficent towards Scott, and in a verbal agreement made specific provisions allowing Scott the right to live out the rest of his life on castle property.\n\nAt his death in 1948, Johnson willed most of his fortune and property to the Gospel Foundation, an organization he founded in 1946. His wish was that the National Park Service would one day purchase the property, which occurred in 1970.\n\nWalter Scott died in January 1954 and was buried on property overlooking Scotty's Castle.\n\nDaily Press reporter Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at RDeLaCruz@VVDailyPress.com.

But there are other methods to take down the monument that would have less environmental impact.\n\n\"I agree,\" he said. \"Removed but not blown up.\"\n\nHis comments come amid a wave of statues of historical figures that have been torn down following protests of racial injustice. Some have criticized the destruction, which they say has largely come at the hands of unchecked mobs as opposed to deliberative decisions by elected leaders. However, in some cities and states, government officials have led the statues' removals.\n\nProtesters initially targeted statues of Confederate leaders but have expanded to leaders of the Union as well as pre-Civil War figures.\n\nWhen some suggested that Mount Rushmore might be next, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, tweeted, “Not on my watch.”\n\n'Not on my watch': South Dakota governor on taking down Mount Rushmore\n\nMount Rushmore carries special significance for Great Plains Indians: It depicts the faces of four white American leaders who presided over the founding and expansion of European descended ancestors throughout the United States. It was built on land that the tribes still claim ownership to via treaty with the United States.\n\nBear Runner said the monument was built without any consultation or approval from Sioux leaders of that era.\n\n“To me, it’s a great sign of disrespect,” he said.\n\nInto this comes the July 3 fireworks display and Trump, who has been criticized for disparaging minorities. Several groups led by Native American activists are planning protests for the visit.\n\n\"I'm not really happy that he's coming to pollute our Black Hills,\" said state Rep. Shawn Bordeaux, a Democrat and the chair of the State-Tribal Relations Committee and a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe.\n\nWhy the tribes are upset about Mount Rushmore\n\nMount Rushmore was created to draw tourism to South Dakota and its carving took place between 1927 and 1941. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum intended for Mount Rushmore to stand for America's greatness, and it's referred to as the Shrine of Democracy. However, stories in recent years have highlighted Borglum's ties to white supremacy, possibly joining the Ku Klux Klan, his Confederate sculpture funded by the KKK and that the tribes have argued for generations that the land was stolen from them.\n\n“Mount Rushmore is a symbol of white supremacy, of structural racism that’s still alive and well in society today,” said Nick Tilsen, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe and the president of a local activist organization called NDN Collective. “It’s an injustice to actively steal Indigenous people’s land then carve the white faces of the conquerors who committed genocide.”\n\nThe Lakota know the mountain into which Mount Rushmore is carved as the Six Grandfathers.\n\nMore on Confederate statues: Is this the end for other Confederate memorials?\n\nThe Lakota consider the Black Hills, or Paha Sapa in Lakota, to be the spiritual center of the Great Sioux Reservation where their culture began, and it was home to seven Lakota tribes.\n\nThe tribes were given the Black Hills in perpetuity in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. But miners seeking gold came into the area in an expedition led by Gen. George Custer in 1874. More miners encroached in the Hills once gold was found and demanded the U.S. Army's protection.\n\nAlthough the Lakota and Northern Cheynne were victorious in the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876, by the following year, thousands of cavalrymen were deployed to the area and began what the Lakota called the \"sell or starve\" campaign: The Indian Appropriations Act of 1876 cut off all rations until the Lakota ended hostilities and ceded the Black Hills to the federal government. By the fall of 1877, the Lakota were under the control of federal agents on reservations, their land confiscated by the federal government under the Agreement of 1877.\n\nTribes have attempted to reclaim the Black Hills several times in recent decades.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Claims found in 1979 that the Sioux Nation was entitled to $17.1 million in compensation due to the federal government's seizure of the Black Hills. The following year, U.S. Supreme Court decided 8-1 that the federal government had violated the Fifth Amendment and the tribes were entitled to compensation in United State v. Sioux Nation of Indians. The tribes declined the compensation because it would legally end their demand for the Black Hills to be returned to them.\n\nSeveral requests were denied in the early 1980s to return millions of acres of the Black Hills to the tribes, as well as bills in Congress that would have returned some of the land.\n\nThe effort to settle the land dispute was revived in 2009, and a United Nations report in 2012 said that Indigenous land, including the Black Hills, should be returned.\n\nMount Rushmore as a 'a “Rorschach test,\"\n\nTim Giago, a journalist who is a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe, said he doesn’t see four great American leaders when he looks at the monument, but instead four white men who either made racist remarks or initiated actions that removed Native Americans from their land.\n\nWashington and Jefferson both held slaves. Lincoln, though he led the abolition of slavery, also approved the hanging of 38 Dakota men in Minnesota after a violent conflict with white settlers there. Roosevelt is reported to have said, “I don’t go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every ten are.”\n\nThe monument has long been a “Rorschach test,\" said John Taliaferro, author of “Great White Fathers,” a history of the monument. \"All sorts of people can go there and see it in different ways.”\n\nThe monument often starts conversations on the paradox of American democracy — that a republic that promoted the ideals of freedom, determination and innovation also enslaved people and drove others from their land, he said.\n\n“If we’re having this discussion today about what American democracy is, Mount Rushmore is really serving its purpose because that conversation goes on there,” he said. “Is it fragile? Is it permanent? Is it cracking somewhat?”\n\nThe monument was conceived in the 1920s as a tourist draw for the new fad in vacationing called the road trip. South Dakota historian Doane Robinson recruited Borglum, one of the preeminent sculptors at the time, to abandon his work creating the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial in Georgia, which was to feature Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis and Stonewall Jackson.\n\nBorglum was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, according to Mount Rushmore historian and writer Tom Griffith. Borglum joined the Klan to raise money for the Confederate memorial, and Griffith argues his allegiance was more practical than ideological. He left that project and instead spent years in South Dakota completing Mount Rushmore.\n\nNative American activists have long staged protests at the site to raise awareness among the history of the Black Hills, which were taken from them despite treaties with the United States protecting the land. Fifty years ago this summer a group of activists associated with an organization called United Native Americans climbed to the top of the monument and occupied it.\n\nQuanah Brightman, who now runs United Native Americans, said the activism in the 1970s grew out of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. He hopes a similar movement for Native Americans comes from the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n“What people find here is the story of America — it's multidimensional, it's complex,” Griffith said. “It’s important to understand it was people just trying to do right as best they knew it then.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/features/2024/10/24/cemeteries-tell-of-lives-lived-in-worcester-county/75499509007/", "title": "Worcester County's cemeteries tell stories, history", "text": "In silence, they lie still amid the local landscape. Often, the only sound comes from rustling leaves as they fall in a chill October breeze. That said, according to some visitors, other sounds might be heard, including the laughter of children.\n\nAs such, they often draw historians, folklorists, paranormal investigators, and the merely curious. But whatever beliefs a person has about the supernatural, one thing is known for certain: in our local cemeteries, one can find not only secrets of the dead, but stories of those who lived.\n\nAmong them: people who were enslaved, treated as property both by law and custom. But like everyone, they had hopes, dreams, and humanity. And, they had names, to be remembered: Thomas. Flova. And those whose names were not recorded, or which are now unreadable due to weather, wear or damage.\n\nIn the same earth lies graves of those who held others in bondage, and so the ground itself becomes a place of history's terrible reckoning.\n\nThere are those who went to their graves early, from injuries sustained in war, or from diseases whose causes were little understood, but whose toll was writ large in death, and grief.\n\nNeed a break?

So it went for one Joseph Palmer, in Leominster.\n\nAs Halloween nears, places of burial may find themselves a particular lure for those in search of ghosts, or rumors of ghosts. They are places to visit to learn, understand, and to pay respects.\n\nIn putting together these brief cemeteries of some of the region's most striking graves and cemeteries, there are rules, written and unwritten, that should always be observed:\n\nRespect local visiting times. A night visit might be tempting, but it's almost universally prohibited except by special permissions.\n\nMany headstones are attractive for grave-rubbing, but if not done correctly, this can damage delicate stones. If you don't have permission and don't know how to do it properly, just don't do it.\n\nYes, the atmosphere of many cemeteries lend themselves to spooky photo shoots and TikTok videos, but the same courtesies apply. Get any required permissions, or look for other locations.\n\nAbove all, cemeteries and graves are places of sanctity. Learn, listen, and as the saying goes, leave nothing but footsteps, take nothing that does not belong to you, and bring with you the knowledge that graves can bestow upon the living.\n\nRural Cemetery in Worcester\n\nRural Cemetery in Worcester — more commonly known as Grove Street Cemetery — is definitely haunted ... not by ghosts or vampires, but by history. A beautifully landscaped cemetery established in 1838 and still active today, the cemetery is the final resting place of many of the families and towering figures who built the city. Indeed, names written on tombstones and mausoleums are echoed on public buildings, parks and more across the county: Thayer, Crompton, Bancroft, Clark and more. For a history buff, the cemetery is a touchstone to the city’s past, a reminder that, in many ways, the people who built the city and made it what is today are still with us today. For journalism aficionados, there’s one resident who stands above all others: Isaiah Thomas Sr.\n\nThomas was the publisher of the Massachusetts Spy, a Revolutionary War-era newspaper which was one of the country’s first, and one of the first to take an editorial stand against the British in the days leading up to the war. Although the editorials were written under pseudonyms, Thomas was forced to retreat to Worcester, where he continued publishing.\n\nThomas’ early resistance to British oppression was one of the sparks that lit the Revolution, so it seems strange that his tomb – conveniently placed near the cemeteries entrance – is rather nondescript, only identifiable by a plaque, although someone thought to put a small American flag in front of the grave, giving Thomas a modicum of the respect he deserves.\n\nWandering the paths aimlessly from there, one can meander into several of the city’s forefathers. The tomb of Jonas G. Clark – founder of Clark University – is clean and polished, practically glistening in the morning sun. Others are more worn with time. (It should be noted that several of the graves, including Thomas’, where relocated from cemeteries on the Worcester Common and Mechanics Street). History – and the cemetery’s caretakers – have been kind to the markers. But, time has taken its toll. One marker seems to simply be a rough-hewn stone, inscribed with only the words, “The Inn of a traveler on her way to Jerusalem.\" If there was ever any other identifier on the stone, it’s no longer visible.\n\nPerhaps the most strikingly beautiful and well-maintained mausoleum belongs to music teacher Walter Scott Kennedy and his wife, Ellen Frances Rogers — who was reputed to be the wealthiest woman in Worcester in the early 20th century.\n\nThe couple also left the city Elm Park’s Rogers-Kennedy Memorial, also known as “The New England Settlers.” Visitors can peek through the windows inside the mausoleum, which is as clean and well-kept as the building’s outside. On the walls are inscribed the words, “Death is no departure but arrival/no falling asleep, but waking/It is life which is the night, and death is daybreak.”\n\nAll told, Rural Cemetery is an inspiring place to visit, almost every inch of its beautiful grounds punctuated by some piece of Worcester history, long-gone specters of yesterday echoing quietly to remind the city of its past, lest it be forgotten. ― Victor D. Infante\n\nEvergreen Cemetery in Leominster\n\nLeominster’s Evergreen Cemetery has an oddly appropriate name, given the number of people buried there whose stories resonate today. Families in the city have buried their deceased relatives there for more than 150 years. Near the wrought-iron front gate, rows of small marble footstones mark the graves of U.S. military veterans of many wars and conflicts in the distant and not-so-distant past. .\n\nAcross from 248 Main St. lies a grave marker famous enough that someone created a Google Maps tag for its location. The first thing that draws your eyes to the marble stone isn’t the name, Joseph Palmer, but the carving of Palmer himself, with an enormous, long, Santa Claus-esque beard that became highly controversial in Leominster during his time.\n\nAfter serving in the War of 1812, Palmer returned and began growing out his facial hair, a daring move at a time when men were expected to be clean-shaven, and everyone was expected to follow such rules.\n\nAuthor Jeff Belanger, who researches and writes about New England lore, devoted a 2021 episode to Palmer's story in the New England Legends Podcast, which Belanger cohosts with Ray Auger. Belanger cited an 1890 Boston Globe article that stated Palmer grew the beard because of his Christian faith, but was subsequently accused by his pastor of worshiping the devil.\n\n“When people stick out because of the way they choose to dress, style their hair, or in this case, wear their facial hair, other folks take notice, and for whatever reason, some people get mad about the nonconformists,” Belanger said during the episode.\n\nIn May 1830, Palmer was walking through Fitchburg when four men armed with razors surrounded him, held him down, and tried to shave off his beard. He managed to escape by stabbing two of them with a pocketknife, but he was arrested for assault. He pled not guilty and was jailed for 15 months.\n\nPalmer kept the beard for the rest of his life. He died in1873. Beneath the carving on Palmer’s tombstone, above his name, there’s an inscription: “Persecuted for wearing the beard.”\n\nDue east of Palmer’s grave where the cemetery meets the trees, there is a long strip of grass without headstones or names, the legacy of a pandemic that ravaged Leominster 100 years before COVID-19.\n\nDuring the 1918 influenza pandemic, one of the deadliest in recorded history, 20 unidentified residents who succumbed to the virus were buried in one unmarked mass grave at Evergreen.\n\nIn late 2018, a century after the 1918 flu and only one year before COVID-19 was first detected in China’s Hubei province, the Leominster Historical Commission held a memorial ceremony for the unnamed influenza victims.\n\n“The bodies would decompose, and the people were afraid of infection, so they had to be immediately buried,” commission chairman Don Piermarini told the Sentinel & Enterprise. “The health department wanted you to get rid of that body as fast as possible.”\n\nWithin two years of that ceremony, when COVID-19 ripped through the world, mass graves and virus fatalities would re-enter the nationwide public consciousness. In April 2020, as New York City experienced catastrophic COVID death tolls, morgues became overfilled, and on Hart Island, where New York buries its unidentified or unclaimed bodies, 138 people were buried in one week.\n\nThere were other parallels between the 1918 flu and the most intense period of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn both crises, Leominster shut down public gatherings of any kind, and residents were expected to wear masks that covered their noses and mouths in order to prevent virus particles from spreading through the air. Both viruses had, and COVID-19 still has, the potential to cause lifelong damage to survivors’ bodies.\n\nIn 2012, the Leominster Historical Society placed a marker on the Evergreen Cemetery mass grave, and though grass has grown over some of its corners, it’s still noticeable in the wide grass between two rows of older headstones.\n\nThe marker reads, “Here are buried some of the victims of the 1918 – 1919 influenza pandemic. May they rest in peace.” ― Meg Trogolo\n\nHope Cemetery in Worcester\n\nSitting between St. John's and Notre Dame Cemeteries, Hope Cemetery is one of the oldest remaining burial grounds in the area.\n\nIn autumn, 168 acres of rolling land is illuminated by the brilliant colors of the surrounding fall foliage, a crisp breeze keeps visitors comfortable as they walk the incredibly clean grounds.\n\nEstablished in 1852, the cemetery replaced at least six other local burial grounds were deemed overcrowded, with bodies of the deceased exhumed and relocated there. Thus, Hope Cemetery became Worcester's second garden cemetery, with a focus not only on those buried there, but also but the environment for those coming to visit their loved ones.\n\nAs with many cemeteries dating to the distant past, several ghost stories that go hand-in-hand with the cemetery between Webster Street and Hope Avenue. In the past, visitors have reported hearing children's laughter, specifically near a statue of Christ holding an angel. Other stories tell of a tall woman who tends to the flowers, but who always seems to disappear when approached.\n\nThe grounds are owned and operated by the city of Worcester, and burials take place year-round, with an average of 250 each year.\n\nThere are a number of notable internments including Elizabeth Bishop, considered one of the most important and distinguished American poets of the 20th century. Loring Coes, the inventor of the Monkey wrench has a family plot. Abby Kelly Foster, a 19th century feminist, and her husband Stephen Foster, an abolitionist are buried, as well as Robbert Goodard, the inventor of the first liquid-fueled rocket.\n\nAccording to the Friends of Hope Cemetery, \"Any citizen of Worcester has the right to be buried in Hope Cemetery. If the person or the family is unable to pay for burial, space is provided without cost.\"\n\nIt is the diversity within the cemetery that is most catching. With specific sections for Civil War veterans including members of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment — one of the first Black regiments to fight in the Civil War — religious groups and sects such as Orthodox Christian and a Jewish section with a completely different design. On top of the specific sections, there is an amalgamation of public plots; Worcester residents from all walks of life lie next to one another peaceful and at rest.\n\nMyriad languages decorate a plethora of headstones and monuments. Through etchings, many celebrate the lives lived. Some unique items could be seen on gravestones during a recent visit, including coins, small Mancala pieces, envelopes, and a chrome balloon animal in the style of Jeff Koons. Traditionally, leaving coins and other items, a tradition dating at least to Roman times, signifes respect, including for military veterans.\n\nWhether visiting a loved one, taking a historical trip to see one of Hope Cemetery's notable residents, or trying to hear the laughter of ghostly children, Hope Cemetery is a stunning place to spend an afternoon. ― Sarah Barnacle\n\nBay Path Cemetery in Charlton\n\nWhen people think of John “Grizzly” Adams, a hunter who rose to fame in the 1800s by training bears to perform, they picture him in California, where he moved during the 1849 gold rush and made his name. Or, they think of the popular 1970s TV series, with the late Dan Haggerty in the title role.\n\nHowever, Adams hailed from Massachusetts, raised in Medway, and a distant cousin of President John Adams, according to information on findagrave.com and other sources. His final resting place is in Charlton’s Bay Path Cemetery, on a little hill near the center of town surrounded by historic stone walls.\n\nBorn in 1812, Adams spent his younger years working for a circus, hunting and catching wild animals in northern New England’s forests. In 1849, he went west to try his luck searching for gold, but instead found himself back at the intersection of trapping and show business, including working with circus showman P.T. Barnum.\n\nSome seven Adams family gravestones stand in a row at Bay Path, not far from the cemetery’s Muggett Hill Road entrance, including “Grizzly” Adams’ parents, sister, wife, and children. The tallest of them, decorated with a carving of a man and a bear, belongs to Grizzly himself.\n\nIn addition to Adams’ original gravestone, the Charlton Historical Society placed a shorter marble stone a few feet away in 1976, reading “Grave of Grizzly Adams.”\n\nMany who fought in the American Revolution are also buried at Bay Path Cemetery, notably John Spurr, who threw English tea into Boston Harbor as part of the 1773 Boston Tea Party, and who fought in the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. A marker next to Spurr’s grave commemorates his eight years in the Continental Army.\n\nSpurr settled in Charlton after the war and built a house at 27 Main St., close to the cemetery, and which is on the National Registry of Historic Places. He died in 1816 and is buried next to several relatives, a few feet from the stone wall that separates the cemetery from Dresser Hill Road.\n\nCuriously, historical records show two men named John Spurr who participated in the Boston Tea Party. The other John Spurr died in 1822, is buried in Providence, Rhode Island, and, according to a 2023 WPRI Channel 12 article, also has a marker next to his grave denoting military service in the American Revolution.\n\nMoses Dodge, born in Sutton in 1762, also served in the Continental Army’s Massachusetts regiment. Dodge, his son Gibbs Dodge, and other members of his family are buried in a tomb built into a small hillside next to the cemetery’s Muggett Hill Road entrance.\n\nIn the cemetery’s southeast corner is a stone column marking the graves of the Marble family, including Hiram Marble, who spent years digging for buried treasure every single day.\n\nMarble’s story started two centuries before he was born, with an urban legend from the initial days of English colonization in Massachusetts. Early residents of Lynn passed down stories about a pirate named Tom Veal who stashed plundered valuables in a local cave, but was trapped inside when an earthquake struck.\n\nHiram Marble belonged to Charlton’s Spiritualist church, part of a popular 1800s movement that believed that the living could communicate with the spirits of the dead. In 1852, he claimed he had contacted Tom Veal through the barrier between this life and the next and Veal had told him the treasure was in a spot in Lynn called Dungeon Rock.\n\nMarble moved his family to Lynn, bought the property that Dungeon Rock sat on, and began digging a tunnel with help from his son Edward, determining where to carve next by holding séances to contact Veal again.\n\nNeither Hiram, who died in 1868, nor Edward ever found the buried treasure. Hiram himself is buried alongside his wife Arminda beneath a column at Bay Path Cemetery, and looking at his grave, it’s easy to wonder whether he ever found Tom Veal in the afterlife or tried to communicate with the living from the other side of the veil between worlds. ― Meg Trogolo\n\nMeeting House Hill Cemetery in Princeton\n\nMany cemeteries in colonial New England began as churchyards where parishioners were buried. Princeton’s Meeting House Hill Cemetery is among them, located on a hillside close to Mount Wachusett where the town’s first church, or meeting house, once stood.\n\nThe gravestones face west, and many of them are made from slate, which makes the carvings on them still easy to read centuries later. Several veterans of the American Revolution are buried there, including Capt. Elisha Allen, a farmer whose epitaph reads, “Inhumanly murdered by Samuel Frost, July 16, 1793.”\n\nFrost had been tried for the murder of his father in 1789, but was acquitted on grounds of insanity. Allen hired him to work on the farm, thinking it was safe, but he was proven wrong when Frost beat him to death with a garden tool while the two worked in a field. This time, Frost was convicted and given the death penalty, and he was hanged publicly in Worcester three months later on Oct. 31, Halloween night.\n\nNear the center of Meeting House Hill is a trio of slate gravestones that tells pieces of a story tied to the end of slavery in Massachusetts.\n\nKwaku “Quock” Walker was born into slavery in Central Massachusetts in the 1750s, and grew up working alongside his family on James Caldwell’s farm in Barre.\n\nCaldwell and his wife promised Walker that on his 21st birthday, he would be free, but Caldwell died before he could fulfill that promise. His wife remarried a man named Nathaniel Jennison, who refused to honor that promise. Walker left the Jennison farm, but was caught and beaten.\n\nIn 1781, Walker sued Jennison for assault and battery in the Worcester County Court of Common Pleas in the first of a string of cases.\n\nIn the end, the court ruled that he was a free man. Chief Justice William Cushing told the courtroom that “slavery is inconsistent with our own conduct and Constitution and there can be no such thing as perpetual servitude of a rational creature.”\n\nMoses Gill, a justice on the court who lived in Princeton, ruled in two of those cases, and one aspect of the Walker story that isn’t often told is that Gill was an enslaver himself.\n\nGill enslaved at least three Black workers as domestic servants in his Princeton home. They are buried in a row at Meeting House Hill Cemetery beneath small, elaborately carved gravestones near the Gill family plot.\n\nOne is Flova, a woman who died at 41 years old in 1778. Another is Thomas, a man who died at 89 years old in 1782. A chip has fallen off the top corner of the third stone, removing the name of the man buried there, but the bottom of the stone says he died at 39 in 1776.\n\nEach slate stone is engraved with a face surrounded by swirled designs and bears the deceased’s name, date of death, age at death, and one more piece of information: “a Negro Servant to the Hon. Moses Gill Esq.”\n\nEngravings such as the ones on their gravestones were expensive at the time. In1953, Ethel Mirick wrote in the Princeton News that Thomas’ long life “was bespeaking of the care which Gill bestowed upon his black servants.”\n\nHowever, as the saying goes, even a gilded cage is still a cage.\n\nThough the church that once stood above it is gone, replaced by houses with views of the Boston skyline dozens of miles away, the markers of the past remain, serving as a reminder that American slavery was not limited to areas south of the Mason-Dixon line — white colonists enslaved African families in classic, picturesque New England towns like Princeton, too. — Meg Trogolo\n\nShaker Cemetery in Harvard\n\nAlong Harvard's Shaker Road, your eye might be drawn to a stone wall, typically of many found in New England, and a simple white gate with a sign that reads, Harvard Shaker Cemetery, 1971-1918. What's different about this cemetery, however, is that very few graves are marked by traditional stones. The majority are white, cast-iron signs, pocked with rust, and with the names of the deceased written on a broad banner at the top.\n\nThe curious shape has prompted the nickname, \"Lollipop Cemetery,\" which belies both the gravitas of this resting place, and the lives of those who are interred here.\n\nThe Shakers were and are a religious and social community who left an indelible stamp on the town of Harvard, and the region. Almost unique historically among faith movements, they embraced gender and racial equality, with both male and female leaders.\n\nThe Harvard Historical Society relates that at least 331 Shakers were buried here between 1792 and 1929. In the 1850s, the village population peaked at about 200, with members' landholdings totaled more than 2,000 acres. But in the Civil War era, the population dropped dramatically, including the departure of some members.\n\nIn 1879, the Shakers started replacing many stone markers with the cast-iron ones, with a stone marker reading, \"Harvard Shakers\" added by the town, which in 1945 would come into possession of the cemetery.\n\n\"It is pretty unusual looking, and that is one of the things that attracts people to it,\" said Judy Warner, assistant to the board of the Harvard Historical Society. \"The cemetery was one of the first things the Shakers did after they settled in Harvard.\"\n\nWork on the cemetery began in earnest in 1792. \"They fenced and cleared an acre of land. It took them eight days with four yolk of oxen to make the stone walls around it. There are journal entries about that,\" Warner said. The last recorded burial in the cemetery took place in 1929.\n\nAs to why the Shakers eventually replaced most of the stone markers with the cast-iron ones, Warner said the reason was likely practical, with problem-solving and practicality as a hallmark of Shaker beliefs. But there's something more: while the cast-iron markers bear names, Warner noted that in many Shaker settlements, graves often were marked with stones that simply read, \"Shakers.\"\n\nSome graves belong to people, including children, who died very young, not unusual in a time when diseases and accidents often took an early toll. However, many of those interred lived long and apparently healthy lives, including Ezra B. Newton, a 47-year member of the Shaker community, who lived to 101.\n\n\"The Shakers were sort of noted for longevity. They had a reasonably good life, compared to the general population,\" Warner said. \"They often attributed their good health to the water that they had, and actually later sold Shaker Spring Waters, and they touted the health benefits.\" This water came from a now-extinct spring that ran from Harvard's Shaker Village under land now part of Route 2.\n\nAs for Newton, he gained prominence locally, with a celebration in 1895 to mark his 100th birthday.\n\nThe cemetery has 12 graves belonging to the Myrick family, including Elijah Myrick, a Shaker elder and trustee of some 40 years, held patents for several inventions, including a type of cast-iron chimney cap.\n\nWarner observed, \"The Shakers were quite different from some other communities in that they loved modernization. They were not loathe to accept new ideas. They wanted to be up to date.\"\n\nWarner is not only a keeper of history; she's also a neighbor to the cemetery. Although most visitors treat the cemetery respectfully, it has been a target of vandalism, and theft of the striking markers. \"People should just be respectful and not damage anything, or think they need a souvenir,\" Warner said. \"Some markers were broken, and have been repaired.\"\n\nWarner notes something that is true of all cemeteries: \"It is a holy place.\" — Margaret Smith", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/05/29/ivan-terrible-painting-russian-officials-urge-harshest-sentence-vandalism/650450002/", "title": "Ivan the Terrible painting: Russian officials urge harshest sentence ...", "text": "Deutsche Welle\n\nMoscow's Tretyakov Gallery has said it will review the sale of alcohol on its premises after an apparently drunken guest used a metal pole from a security barrier to smash the protective glass and damage a 1885 masterpiece by Russian painter Ilya Repin.\n\nTretyakov curator Tatyana Gorodkova has described the act of vandalism as a \"tragedy.\"\n\n\"The incident was awful and frightening and speaks to the aggression which reigns in society,\" she said Monday.\n\nShe also said the museum was considering hiring psychologists to help pick out potentially dangerous visitors.\n\nRepin's canvas, one of the country's most famous paintings and described by its curators as being in the same league as the Mona Lisa, depicts Russia's 16th century ruler, Ivan the Terrible, cradling his dead son in the moments after the tsar, according to some historical accounts, killed the prince in a fit of rage.\n\nAccording to Gorodkova, the content of the picture likely played a role in the Friday night attack. While smashing the glass, the 37-year-old visitor apparently shouted something about how Ivan the Terrible did not kill his son. Several historians believe the prince died of illness instead, and the viewpoint is popular among Russian nationalists.\n\nGorodkova said the attack showed how Russians are increasingly \"not differentiating artistic work from historical facts.\"\n\nRussian police arrested the man shortly after the Friday attack. Authorities said the man grew \"disturbed\" by the painting after drinking vodka in the on-site cafe. The Interior Ministry also published a video recording of the perpetrator giving a statement.\n\n\"I came to see it, about eight in the evening I went to the cafe, I was already about to leave, and I drank 100 gram (3.5 ounces) of vodka,\" the man said in the video. \"I don't (usually) drink vodka, and something just snapped.\"\n\nThe suspect remains in detention.\n\nAddressing reporters alongside Gorodkova on Monday, Russia's Deputy Culture Minister Vladimir Aristarkhov said the offender should be made an example of to deter future vandalism.\n\n\"The Ministry of Culture is urging the harshest, most severe punishment for the man who damaged the picture,\" Aristarkhov said.\n\nUnder the current law, the offender could face up to three years in prison, but several officials have said the parliament might raise this limit for similar cases in the future.\n\n\"Three years is nothing compared to the value of this painting,\" Aristarkhov added.\n\nFriday's attack is not the first time the picture has been defaced. In 1913, a man stabbed the painting with knife. Although Repin was still alive at the time and able to help with the restoration effort, the gallery's curator ended up committing suicide over the attack.\n\nThis article originally appeared on DW.com.

Demonstrations led the university to end classified war research and stop military recruitment, among other changes, wrote Rosalind Rosenberg, a professor of history at Barnard College, for Barnard Magazine.\n\nToday's demonstrators also have specific changes in mind, often involving divestment from Israel, citing the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinian people who died in Gaza amid Israel's bombardment and ground assault. That military campaign was triggered by Hamas' incursion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, when about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 240 people were taken hostage.\n\nBut as campus authorities react swiftly, citing safety concerns and calling in police to break up encampents, it's unclear if or how the current protests will influence the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nUSA TODAY revisited four monumental campus protests to explain how college protests have become a staple of American life and often influence the outcomes of political strife. Here's a look at how previous campus protests unfolded — and whether they were successful in their causes.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley: Free Speech in 1960s\n\nAt the University of California Berkeley starting in 1964, students protested the university's limits on political activities and free speech during the civil rights movement and Vietnam-war era.\n\n\"In the wake of McCarthyism’s anti-Communist sentiments during the 1950s, public universities in California had enacted numerous regulations limiting students’ political activities,\" wrote Karen Aichinger for the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee University. \"At the University of California, Berkeley, student groups taking part in any on- or off-campus political activities were banned from campus.\"\n\nWhat transpired were \"small sit-ins and demonstrations\" that \"escalated into a series of large-scale rallies and protests demanding full constitutional rights on campus,\" reads the UC Berkeley website.\n\nNearly 800 students were arrested by local police as a result.\n\nThe students' protest ultimately worked in their favor. The university eventually overturned policies that would restrict the content of speech or advocacy, according to the college.\n\n\"Today, the Movement stands as a symbol of the importance of protecting and preserving free speech and academic freedom,\" reads the UC Berkeley website.\n\nKent State University in Ohio: Vietnam War in 1970\n\nThe most prolific university protest of the Vietnam War happened at Kent State University in Ohio in May 1970. Students started protesting the Vietnam War and the U.S. invasion of Cambodia on their campus on May 2. Two days later, the National Guard opened fire into a sea of antiwar protesters and passerbys. The soldiers killed four young people – Allison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, Sandra Scheuer, and William Knox Schroeder – and injured several others with their violence.\n\n\"The impact of the shootings was dramatic,\" wrote Jerry Lewis and Thomas Hensley in an article for Kent State University. \"The event triggered a nationwide student strike that forced hundreds of colleges and universities to close.\"\n\nThe shootings also influenced national politics, Lewis and Hensley wrote.\n\n\"In The Ends of Power, (H.R.) Haldeman, (a top aide to President Richard Nixon), states that the shootings at Kent State began the slide into Watergate, eventually destroying the Nixon administration,\" the article reads.\n\nToday, the protest and shootings \"certainly come to symbolize the deep political and social divisions that so sharply divided the country during the Vietnam War era,\" Lewis and Hensley wrote.\n\nJackson State College in Mississippi: Racial Injustice in 1970\n\nDays after the shootings at Kent State, police opened gunfire at a college dormitory Jackson State College in Mississippi, a school with a predominantly Black student population.\n\nBlack students there were protesting racial injustice, including how they were treated by white drivers speeding on campus, according to the university.\n\nPolice received a call that Black young people were throwing rocks at white drivers near the campus. Police arrived at the scene and shot hundreds of bullets into Alexander Hall, according to an FBI report, NPR reported. Police killed two students – Phillip Lafayette Gibbs and James Earl Green – and injured 12 others. The college also canceled its graduation due to the killings and unrest.\n\nAt a 2021 commencement ceremony, the university honored 74 of the students who were unable to walk the stage in 1970, NBC reported. At the commencement ceremony, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said police “unjustly gunned down two innocent young Black men, terrorized and traumatized a community of Black students and committed one of the gravest sins in our city’s history,\" NBC reported.\n\nThe killings at Jackson State College and Kent State University national sparked outrage. College students across the nation protested on their campuses, according to the Zinn Education Project, a collaboration of historical content from the groups Rethinking Schools and Teaching for Change.\n\n\"The spring of 1970 saw the first general student strike in the history of the United States, students from over four hundred colleges and universities calling off classes to protest the invasion of Cambodia, the Kent State affair, the killing of two black students at Jackson State College in Mississippi, and the continuation of the war,\" wrote Howard Zinn in the book \"You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train.\"\n\nAngus Johnston, an adjunct assistant professor at Hostos Community College of the City University of New York and a historian of student activism, said after both events: \"There was a period of about 30 years or so where it tended to be fairly unlikely that campuses would respond with mass arrests even in the case of admin building occupations.\"\n\nNationwide: South Africa anti-Apartheid protests in 1985\n\nAnother form of popular college campus protest occurred in the 1980's. Students across the country wanted their colleges to cut ties with groups that supported from the South African apartheid.\n\n\"Under apartheid, race restricted every aspect of life for South Africans who were Black, Indian and colored — a multiracial classification created by the government,\" The New York Times reported. \"There were strict limits on where they could live, attend school, work and travel.\n\nColumbia University was at the center of the movement. Students led by the Coalition for a Free South Africa at Columbia University \"blockaded Hamilton Hall, the university’s administrative building, leading to the first successful divestiture campaign at the university,\" reads a summary of the events from the Zinn Education Project.\n\nThere was less pushback for protesters during this time, due to a “certain embarrassment among elites in the United States that there was complicity with South Africa’s white government,” said Daniel Farber, a history professor at the University of Kansas who has studied American activism, reports Vox Media.\n\nColumbia University was one of the first colleges to divest from doing business with South Africa and 155 universities followed suit. U.S. Congress also passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act in 1986, which aimed to prevent new trade and investment between the nation and South Africa.\n\nWhat is the future of college protests in America?\n\nFree speech experts told USA TODAY that students should continue to peacefully protest in open campus spaces to avoid conflict.\n\nAlex Morey, the director of campus rights advocacy for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, encourages universities to remain neutral in times of unrest and not to call in authorities unless a demonstration turns violent. The national nonprofit defends Americans rights to free speech and thought.\n\n\"Peaceful protest is a hallmark of a healthy speech climate on American college campuses and it has been for decades – whether it's the Berkeley free speech movement, or students protesting the Vietnam War era or civil rights,\" Morey said. \"Generations of students have felt passionately about certain issues and the open air places on campuses are great places to support their views.\"\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

Oct. 29, 1960 (1-0)\n\nOpponent: Tunney Hunsaker (15-9-1)\n\nSite: Freedom Hall State Fairground, Louisville\n\nWeight: 192 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Hunsaker was the police chief of Fayetteville, W.Va., when he fought Cassius Clay, who won a six-round unanimous decision. Hunsaker’s eyes were swollen shut by the end of the fight, and afterward he said, “Clay was as fast as lightning. I tried every trick I knew to throw at him off balance, but he was just too good.” In his autobiography, Ali said Hunsaker dealt him one of the hardest body blows he ever took during his career. Ali and Hunsaker became good friends and stayed in touch through the years. Hunsaker said he did not agree with Ali’s decision to refuse military service, but he praised him as a great humanitarian and athlete.\n\nBoxing legend Muhammad Ali dies at 74\n\nAppreciation: Muhammad Ali was a champion in and out of the boxing ring\n\n2. Dec. 27, 1960 (2-0)\n\nOpponent: Herb Siler (1-1)\n\nSite: Miami Beach (Fla.) Auditorium\n\nWeight: 193 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Siler became Clay’s first knockout victim, going down in the fourth round of a scheduled eight-round fight. Twelve years later, Siler was convicted of manslaughter and served a seven-year prison sentence. He died in 2001 in Miami.\n\n3. Jan. 17, 1961 (3-0)\n\nOpponent: Tony Esperti (9-6-2)\n\nSite: Miami Beach Auditorium\n\nWeight: 195 pounds\n\nThe skinny: On his 19th birthday, Clay knocked out Esperti in the third round of a scheduled eight-round fight. Esperti, nicknamed “Big Tony,” was an infamous character around Miami Beach. When his boxing career ended, Esperti found himself in trouble often. According to TheMiami Herald in 1967, Esperti was arrested 11 times for assault and battery, and each time the victims declined to press charges. On Oct. 31, 1967, at a restaurant in North Bay Village, Fla., Esperti was arrested for allegedly gunning down Thomas “The Enforcer” Altamura, a reputed mobster. According to newspaper reports, Altamura was waiting to be seated at the restaurant when Esperti allegedly walked up and shot him to death. Esperti died in 2002 at the age of 72.\n\n4. Feb. 7, 1961 (4-0)\n\nOpponent: Jimmy Robinson (1-2-0)\n\nSite: Miami Beach Convention Hall\n\nWeight: 193.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Clay was supposed to fight Willie Guelat on the undercard of the light-heavyweight title fight between Harold Johnson and Jesse Bowdry, but Guelat failed to show up. Clay knocked out Guelat’s replacement, Robinson, in 94 seconds.\n\n5. Feb. 21, 1961 (5-0)\n\nOpponent: Donnie Fleeman (35-11-1)\n\nSite: Miami Beach Auditorium\n\nWeight: 190 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Clay won by technical knockout in the seventh round of a scheduled eight-round fight. Fleeman, Clay’s first true opponent, was a tough Texan, but he couldn’t cope with Clay’s speed. Fleeman plodded forward, and Clay picked him off at will. The fight took seven rounds mainly because Clay decided that seven was enough. Fleeman, 28, retired after the fight.\n\n30 of Muhammad Ali's best quotes\n\n6. April 19, 1961 (6-0)\n\nOpponent: LaMar Clark (44-2)\n\nSite: Freedom Hall State Fairground, Louisville\n\nWeight: 192.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Clay knocked out Clark, a former chicken farmer from Utah who had won 44\n\nconsecutive fights by KO, in the second round of a scheduled 10-round fight. Clay destroyed Clark, breaking his nose in the process. Clark, 27, retired after the fight.\n\n7. June 26, 1961 (7-0)\n\nOpponent: Kolo “Duke” Sabedong (15-11-1)\n\nSite: Las Vegas Convention Center\n\nWeight: 194.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Clay, fighting for the first time in Las Vegas, the new mecca of boxing, won a 10-round unanimous decision against Sabedong, a strapping 6-6 Hawaiian. Sabedong, 31, started out fighting dirty and hit Clay below the belt to try to provoke an upset. But he lacked the speed and skill to bother Clay, who blamed his sluggish showing on trainer Angelo Dundee’s decision to fly them to Las Vegas rather than take the train. Sabedong died in 2008 at the age of 78.\n\n8. July 22, 1961 (8-0)\n\nOpponent: Alonzo Johnson (18-7)\n\nSite: Freedom Hall State Fairground, Louisville\n\nWeight: 192.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Johnson was the first nationally ranked fighter to get in the ring with Clay. He was a seasoned veteran but had no real punching power. Johnson gave Clay a tough fight on a sweltering summer night. The bout went the distance, with Clay winning a unanimous decision. One judge, however, scored it 48-47 for Clay, who was booed by the hometown fans for the first time for his less-than-inspired performance.\n\n9. Oct. 7, 1961 (9-0)\n\nOpponent: Alex Miteff (25-10-1)\n\nSite: Freedom Hall State Fairground, Louisville\n\nWeight: 188 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Miteff, a 26-year-old from Argentina, was a promising heavyweight contender known for his body attacks, but he was no match for Clay. The “Louisville Lip” must have taken to heart the booing from his previous fight because he brutally pounded Miteff, knocking him out in the sixth round. Miteff retired after losing his next fight. He tried to come back five years later but retired for good after being KO’d by Jerry Quarry in the third round in April 1967. Miteff had a small part in the movie Requiem for a Heavyweight, which starred Anthony Quinn and Jackie Gleason.\n\n10. Nov. 29, 1961 (10-0)\n\nOpponent: Willi Besmanoff (44-27-7)\n\nSite: Freedom Hall State Fairground, Louisville\n\nWeight: 193 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Besmanoff, 29, was a German who had fought the likes of Sonny Liston, George Chuvalo, Zora Folley and Archie Moore before Clay. Before the fight, Clay told a TV interviewer, “I’m embarrassed to get in the ring with this unrated duck. I’m ready for top contenders like Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. Besmanoff must fall in seven!” Besmanoff was insulted and came right out after Clay. But Clay toyed with him for six rounds, then KO’d him in the seventh, determined to make good on his prediction.\n\n11. Feb. 10, 1962 (11-0)\n\nOpponent: Sonny Banks (10-2)\n\nSite: Madison Square Garden, New York\n\nWeight: 194.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: This was Clay’s first fight at Madison Square Garden. Before the fight, Clay said, “The man must fall in the round I call. In fact, Banks must fall in four.” But Banks, 21, became the first to put Clay on the canvas when he knocked him down in the first round. Banks went down in Round 2, then took a beating from Clay before the fight was stopped early in the fourth round. Three years later, Banks died from injuries suffered in a nine-round bout vs. Leotis Martin.\n\n12. March 28, 1962 (12-0)\n\nOpponent: Don Warner (12-6-2)\n\nSite: Miami Beach Convention Hall\n\nWeight: 195 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Warner was a two-handed puncher who had a good record of wins inside the distance. “He was a tough left-hooker from Philadelphia,” said Dundee, Ali’s trainer. Clay said Warner, 22, would go down in the fifth round. But he sent a bloodied Warner through the ropes in Round 4. Asked why he had taken Warner in the fourth when he had predicted the fifth, Clay said he had to deduct a round because Warner neglected to shake hands at the weigh-in.\n\n13. April 23, 1962 (13-0)\n\nOpponent: George Logan (22-7-1)\n\nSite: Los Angeles Sports Arena\n\nWeight: 196.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Logan threw a lot of left hooks, most of which missed, while Clay’s quick hands opened cuts over Logan’s eyes. The referee stopped it in the fourth round. But more significant for Clay was his chance meeting with budding photojournalist Howard Bingham, and the two formed a lifelong friendship.\n\n14. May 19, 1962 (14-0)\n\nOpponent: Billy Daniels (16-0)\n\nSite: St. Nicholas Arena, New York\n\nWeight: 196 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Daniels, from New York, was 6-4 and an Air Force veteran. He was a good boxer with decent punching power and came into the fight undefeated and rated 10th in the world heavyweight rankings by Ring Magazine. He was featured on the cover with Clay as two young unbeaten contenders. Daniels was cut in the second round, and that caused the fight to be stopped in the seventh.\n\n15. July 20, 1962 (15-0)\n\nOpponent: Alejandro Lavorante (19-3)\n\nSite: Los Angeles Sports Arena\n\nWeight: 199 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Lavorante was another Argentine fighter who was discovered by Jack Dempsey. He was Hollywood handsome with a great knockout punch. But Clay knocked out Lavorante in the fifth round. In his next fight two months later vs. John Riggins (not the football player), Lavorante was KO’d in the sixth round, fell into a coma and died from his injuries 19 months later at age 27.\n\n16. Nov. 15, 1962 (16-0)\n\nOpponent: Archie Moore (184-22-11)\n\nSite: Los Angeles Sports Arena\n\nWeight: 204 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Moore was one of the greatest light heavyweights and most prolific fighters of all time (219 professional fights). But he was 45 when he fought Clay. Clay knocked him down three times in the fourth round and won by TKO in the fourth. Moore’s next fight was his last, and it was against wrestler Mike DiBiase in Phoenix. Moore beat up on DiBiase and won by TKO in the third round, ending his 27-year career with a victory.\n\n17. Jan. 24, 1963 (17-0)\n\nOpponent: Charley Powell (23-6-3)\n\nSite: Civic Arena, Pittsburgh\n\nWeight: 205 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Powell was a former pro football player and the brother of American Football League receiving great Art Powell. Charley Powell was bigger than Clay and not intimidated by him. Powell started strong and caught Clay with a few body punches, but he soon realized the deceptiveness of Clay’s strength. Clay KO’d Powell at the end of Round 3, again finishing an opponent in the round he had predicted. At this point, Clay had predicted knockouts in 13 of his 14 KO victories.\n\n18. March 13, 1963 (18-0)\n\nOpponent: Doug Jones (21-3-1)\n\nSite: Madison Square Garden, New York\n\nWeight: 202.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Before a sold-out Garden crowd (the first sellout there since Rocky Marciano vs. Joe Louis in 1951), Jones hurt Clay early and often, staggering him in the first round. By the middle rounds, Clay, realizing he was in a real fight, started using his powerful jab. While the ringside judges gave Clay a narrow victory, the crowd thought Jones had won and booed Clay unmercifully. The disputed bout was named Fight of the Year for 1963 by Ring Magazine.\n\n19. June 18, 1963 (19-0)\n\nOpponent: Henry Cooper (27-8-1)\n\nSite: Wembley Stadium, London\n\nWeight: 207 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Cooper, 29, was a top fighter in Europe and had a powerful left hook. But he was a big underdog against young and brash Clay and was outweighed by 21 pounds. Cooper came out strong and bloodied Clay’s nose in the first round. But by the third round, Clay had opened a bad gash over Cooper’s left eye. Instead of finishing him, though, Clay danced around and taunted Cooper. Late in the fourth round, Cooper connected with a left hook that floored and hurt Clay. He got up as the round ended. Clay then opened the gash further in the fifth round, and the fight was stopped. Clay’s fifth-round KO prediction came true.\n\n20. Feb. 25, 1964 (20-0)\n\nOpponent: Sonny Liston (35-1)\n\nSite: Miami Beach Convention Hall\n\nWeight: 210.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Finally, Clay was fighting for the world heavyweight title in one of the most anticipated bouts of that era. Liston had won his title by knocking out champion Floyd Patterson in the first round. Clay came in as a 7-1 underdog, yet taunted Liston before the fight, repeatedly calling the ex-convict, who had alleged ties to organized crime, a “big, ugly bear.” From the start, Clay’s speed, quickness and movement made Liston’s heavy punches look slow. Clay complained that his eyes were burning after the fourth round, and he couldn’t see. Dundee rinsed his eyes out with a sponge and pushed him out for the fifth. Clay stayed away from Liston in the fifth, and by the sixth round his vision had cleared. He began connecting on combinations at will, and at the end of the sixth round Liston said he couldn’t continue, complaining of a shoulder injury. Clay ran around the ring shouting, “I am the greatest!” and “I shook up the world!” The next day, Clay changed his name to Cassius X, and then Muhammad Ali.\n\n21. May 25, 1965 (21-0)\n\nOpponent: Sonny Liston (35-2)\n\nSite: St. Dominic’s Hall, Lewiston, Maine\n\nWeight: 206 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Because of the way the first fight ended, boxing authorities order a rematch in remote Lewiston. Only 2,434 fans were present, the lowest attendance ever for a heavyweight title fight. The end of the fight remains one of the most controversial in boxing history. Halfway through the first round, Liston fell to the canvas in what many have argued was not a legitimate knockdown. Ali did not retreat to his corner, but stood over Liston, yelling at him, “Get up and fight, sucker!” The photo that captured that moment became one of the most famous in all of sports. Referee Jersey Joe Walcott, a former heavyweight champion, appeared confused, and 20 seconds passed. By then Liston had gotten up and resumed boxing. But Nat Fleischer, publisher of The Ring, alerted Walcott that Liston had been down more than the requisite 10 seconds, and Walcott stopped the fight, giving Ali a first-round knockout. Some claimed that Liston had bet against himself and took a dive because he owed money to the Mafia. Liston said years later in an interview that he feared for his safety from Nation of Islam extremists who supported Ali.\n\n22. Nov. 22, 1965 (22-0)\n\nOpponent: Floyd Patterson (43-4)\n\nSite: Las Vegas Convention Center\n\nWeight: 210 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Patterson, on the comeback trail after two losses to Liston, said in a pre-fight interview, “This fight is a crusade to reclaim the title from the Black Muslims. As a Catholic, I am fighting Clay (he persisted in calling Ali by his birth name) as a patriotic duty. I am going to return the crown to America.” Ali toyed with Patterson throughout the fight before winning on a 12th-round TKO.\n\n23. March 29, 1966 (23-0)\n\nOpponent: George Chuvalo (34-11-2)\n\nSite: Maple Leaf Gardens, Toronto\n\nWeight: 214.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Chuvalo, a Canadian, is widely regarded as having the best chin in boxing history, having never been knocked down in 93 fights. This fight would have been for Ali’s world title, but boxing politics caused it to be called “a heavyweight showdown.” The fight went the distance, with Ali winning a unanimous decision. “He’s the toughest guy I ever fought,” Ali said afterward. Dundee said of Chuvalo: “He never stopped coming on. You’ve got to admire a man like that.”\n\n24. May 21, 1966 (24-0)\n\nOpponent: Henry Cooper (33-11-1)\n\nSite: Arsenal Football Stadium, London\n\nWeight: 201.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: After the controversial first fight, the second was for the world title, but it was fairly anticlimactic. Cooper, who had a tendency to suffer cuts, succumbed again to his weakness, and a bad cut over his left eye stopped the fight after six rounds.\n\n25. Aug. 6, 1966 (25-0)\n\nOpponent: Brian London (35-13)\n\nSite: Earls Court Arena, London\n\nWeight: 209 pounds\n\nThe skinny: London, known as the “Blackpool Tower,” was a mediocre boxer who had been beaten by Cooper three times before he fought Ali. Ingemar Johansson had said London would have struggled to beat his sister. Ali toyed with him for a couple rounds before knocking him unconscious in the third round at Dundee’s insistence.\n\nPHOTOS: Ali through the years\n\n26. Sept. 10, 1966 (26-0)\n\nOpponent: Karl Mildenberger (49-2-3)\n\nSite: Wald Stadium, Frankfurt, West Germany\n\nWeight: 203 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali continued his European tour. He was tired and stressed by a return to the USA to continue his fight against the military draft and was nowhere near his best. He cut Mildenberger in the fourth and dropped him in the fifth, but the German rallied to cause Ali discomfort as the champion worked to finish off the fight. In the 12th round, with Mildenberger on the ropes, referee Teddy Waltham stopped the fight. Ali must have been grateful. At the airport the next day, Waltham’s fee of 1,000 pounds was stolen. When Ali heard, he gave Waltham the money from his own pocket.\n\n27. Nov. 14, 1966 (27-0)\n\nOpponent: Cleveland “Big Cat” Williams (65-5-1)\n\nSite: Houston Astrodome\n\nWeight: 212.7 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Williams, 33, once a formidable fighter, was worn out by this time. He had been shot in the stomach by a police officer, attacked by a girlfriend with a meat cleaver and gone toe-to-toe twice with Liston, being KO’d early in both fights. Ali became concerned that Williams might be badly hurt if the bout went on too long. An indoor-record 35,460 saw Ali, in his own words, “the night I was at my best.” Howard Cosell told boxing writer Thomas Hauser, “The greatest Ali ever was as a fighter was against Williams. That night, he was the most devastating fighter who ever lived.” He also did the “Ali Shuffle” for the first time as a pro before knocking out Williams in the third round.\n\nBoxing's odd couple: Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell\n\n28. Feb. 6, 1967 (28-0)\n\nOpponent: Ernie Terrell (39-4)\n\nSite: Houston Astrodome\n\nWeight: 212 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Before a record indoor fight crowd of 37,212, Terrell, who held the World Boxing Association belt, insisted on calling Ali by his old name, Cassius Clay. Big mistake. Ali broke a bone under Terrell’s left eye early on and damaged his retina. By the middle rounds Terrell flinched every time Ali drew back his fist. Ali carried him through all 15 rounds, taunting him with every punch by saying, “What’s my name, Uncle Tom? What’s my name?” The fight was described by sports writer Tex Maule as “a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty.”\n\n29. March 22, 1967 (29-0)\n\nOpponent: Zora Folley (74-7-4)\n\nSite: Madison Square Garden, New York\n\nWeight: 211.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Just before the fight, Ali lost his appeal against his 1-A classification for the draft and was ordered to appear in Louisville on April 11 for induction into the U.S. Army. In the first heavyweight title fight in the Garden in 15 years, Ali dropped Folley in the fourth round, then knocked out the 35-year-old in the seventh round with a quick right. This would be Ali’s last fight for three-and-a-half years.\n\n30. Oct. 26, 1970 (30-0)\n\nOpponent: Jerry Quarry (37-4-4)\n\nSite: City Auditorium, Atlanta\n\nWeight: 213.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Quarry was a tough heavyweight who was perfectly capable of winning the heavyweight title that was held by Joe Frazier. He was not intimidated by Ali, but when he suffered a deep cut over his left eye that his corner was unable to close, referee Tony Perez called it after the third round. Quarry, bitterly disappointed, got off his chair and moved toward Ali, but he was stopped by Ali’s cornerman, Bundini Brown.\n\n31. Dec. 7, 1970 (31-0)\n\nOpponent: Oscar Bonavena (46-6-1)\n\nSite: Madison Square Garden, New York\n\nWeight: 212 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali needed a court order to allow him to fight in New York. His opponent was the rugged Argentine known for not listening to his trainers (Gil Clancy for this fight). Ali had predicted a ninth-round KO and tagged Bonavena on cue, but when he moved in for the finish, Bonavena threw a desperate left hook that shook Ali. “I was numb all over,” Ali later admitted. By the 15th round, with both men exhausted, Ali threw a heavy left hook that knocked down Bonavena, then dropped him twice more for the KO. Afterward, Ali shouted: “I want Joe Frazier!” And one of the great rivalries in sports was born.\n\n32. March 8, 1971 (31-1)\n\nOpponent: Joe Frazier (26-0)\n\nSite: Madison Square Garden, New York\n\nWeight: 215 pounds\n\nThe skinny: This was a landmark bout, not only for its promotion as “The Fight of the Century,” but also for the purse of $5 million, which was unheard of at the time. The boxers were to split it. Ali called Frazier an Uncle Tom and suggested that any black person who supported Frazier instead of him was a traitor to his race. Frazier fumed and trained like never before. Frazier won the early rounds and was relentless throughout, winning a unanimous decision in one of the fiercest fights of all time while handing Ali his first loss.\n\n33. July 26, 1971 (32-1)\n\nOpponent: Jimmy Ellis (30-6)\n\nSite: Houston Astrodome\n\nWeight: 220.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: A month before the bout, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Ali’s draft conviction and quashed his five-year prison sentence. Ellis was a sparring partner who had fought more than 1,000 rounds against Ali. He even had Dundee in his corner with Ali’s blessing. But Ali stung Ellis with a straight right in the fourth round and treated the rest of the fight as if it were a sparring session, and the referee stopped the fight in the 12th round after Ali threw another hard right, sending Ellis into the ropes.\n\n34. Nov. 17, 1971 (33-1)\n\nOpponent: Buster Mathis (29-2)\n\nSite: Houston Astrodome\n\nWeight: 227 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Mathis came in at 256 pounds and was overweight, while Ali was the heaviest he’d ever been. It has been said that Ali took it easy on Mathis, hardly training for the fight, which went the distance. Ali was criticized by some for not finishing Mathis. But he said he would not hurt a man just for the benefit of the writers. “I gotta sleep at night,” Ali said.\n\n35. Dec. 26, 1971 (34-1)\n\nOpponent: Juergen Blin (28-8-6)\n\nSite: Hallenstadion Arena, Zurich\n\nWeight: 220 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Blin was a former butcher from Hamburg. He might have been able to cut meat, but he couldn’t cut it in the ring with Ali, who clinched and stuck to the ropes until the seventh round, when he dropped Blin. The German got up, but his corner threw in the towel.\n\n36. April 1, 1972 (35-1)\n\nOpponent: Mac Foster (28-1)\n\nSite: Nippon Budokan, Tokyo\n\nWeight: 226 pounds\n\nThe skinny: This was the first major prizefight held in Asia. Foster, like Ellis, was a former Ali sparring partner. Ali weighed in at 226, 1 pound under his heaviest to date. Ali won the 15-rounder but in disappointing fashion. Many doubted he would find the form needed to regain the title.\n\n37. May 1, 1972 (36-1)\n\nOpponent: George Chuvalo (66-17-2)\n\nSite: Pacific Coliseum, Vancouver, British Columbia\n\nWeight: 217.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: In his second fight against the Canadian, Ali hit Chuvalo at will, but the bout still went 12 rounds. Ali was loathe to hurt fighters that he could beat easily. So it was with Chuvalo.\n\n38. June 27, 1972 (37-1)\n\nOpponent: Jerry Quarry (43-5-4)\n\nSite: Las Vegas Convention Center\n\nWeight: 216.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali had little trouble in his second go-around with Quarry. By the fifth round he was entertaining the crowd, telling the ringside media, “This is an easy way to make a living.” In Round 6, Ali decided to try to close him out, but Quarry remained on his feet. The fight ended early in the seventh round after Ali, seeing that Quarry had nothing left, asked the referee to stop the fight.\n\n39. July 19, 1972 (38-1)\n\nOpponent: Alvin “Blue” Lewis (27-3)\n\nSite: Croke Park, Dublin\n\nWeight: 217.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali got a guaranteed $200,000 to fight Lewis, an ex-convict from Detroit. He gave Ali trouble early, but Ali knocked down Lewis in the middle rounds. Ali ended it in the 11th after telling Dundee he desperately had to urinate. But after the fight, it took 25 minutes before Ali could get to a bathroom.\n\n40. Sept. 20, 1972 (39-1)\n\nOpponent: Floyd Patterson (55-7-1)\n\nSite: Madison Square Garden, New York\n\nWeight: 218 pounds\n\nThe skinny: The rematch drew 17,000, and Patterson, who had lost to Ellis during Ali’s exile, looked better early on than he had in years. But Ali opened a cut on Patterson’s eyelid, and the fight was stopped in the seventh round despite Patterson’s protests.\n\n41. Nov. 21, 1972 (40-1)\n\nOpponent: Bob Foster (49-5)\n\nSite: Sahara Tahoe Hotel, Stateline, Nev.\n\nWeight: 221.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali was more than 40 pounds heavier than his opponent, who was really a light heavyweight. This fight took place in a nightclub where fans sat around dinner tables. Ali toyed with Foster until the fifth round, the one in which he had predicted victory. Foster survived four knockdowns and opened up the first cut on Ali in the ring. But Ali knocked down Foster two more times before getting an eighth-round stoppage.\n\n42. Feb. 14, 1973 (41-1)\n\nOpponent: Joe Bugner (43-4-1)\n\nSite: Las Vegas Convention Center\n\nWeight: 217.25 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Bugner, the British champion, was big, strong and a skilled technician in the ring. He and Ali fought 12 slow rounds, and Ali never was able to put him away before winning a unanimous decision. The flashiest thing in the ring that night was Ali’s robe, which was given to him by Elvis Presley.\n\n43. March 31, 1973 (41-2)\n\nOpponent: Ken Norton (29-1)\n\nSite: San Diego Sports Arena\n\nWeight: 221 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Norton came in largely unknown, having earned $300 in his previous fight, but he was about to change history. The former Joe Frazier sparring partner was trained by Frazier’s trainer, Eddie Futch. Norton nailed Ali with a straight right in the second round and broke his jaw. Dundee asked Ali to stop, but he fought for another 10 rounds, losing on a split decision. Immediately after the fight, Ali had surgery on his jaw. The doctor who wired it said, “I can’t fathom how he could go the whole fight like that.”\n\n44. Sept. 10, 1973 (42-2)\n\nOpponent: Ken Norton (30-1)\n\nSite: The Forum, Inglewood, Calif.\n\nWeight: 212 pounds\n\nThe skinny: The fight was promoted as “The Revenge: Battle of Broken Jaw.” Ali said of Norton: “I took a nobody and created a monster. Now I have to punish him bad.” And Ali, who never lost a rematch to someone who had beaten him, was able to overcome Norton’s awkward style and win the 12th and final round to take the decision.\n\n45. Oct. 20, 1973 (43-2)\n\nOpponent: Rudi Lubbers (21-1)\n\nSite: Bung Karno Stadium, Jakarta, Indonesia\n\nWeight: 217.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali, looking ahead to a rematch with Frazier, easily dispatched the Dutchman in 12 rounds. A crowd of 35,000 watched the bout, and 10,000 showed up at an exhibition Ali gave in the country.\n\n46. Jan. 28, 1974 (44-2)\n\nOpponent: Joe Frazier (30-1)\n\nSite: Madison Square Garden, New York\n\nWeight: 212 pounds\n\nThe skinny: The fight was spiced up by a wrestling match between the two during a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell. Frazier attacked his opponent after Ali called him ignorant, and both men were fined $5,000. But Ali dominated the less-than-thrilling rematch and outpunched Frazier, winning the decision.\n\n47. Oct. 30, 1974 (45-2)\n\nOpponent: George Foreman (40-0) 38 KOs)\n\nSite: Mai 20 Stadium, Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n\nWeight: 216.5 pounds\n\nThe skinny: “The Rumble in the Jungle” was one of Ali’s greatest moments. It’s where “rope-a-dope” made its way into America’s lexicon. Many thought Ali, at 32, was a fading star and that powerful Foreman would have his way with “The Greatest.” But they underestimated Ali’s skills. Ali leaned on the ropes and let Foreman punch himself out, which he did by the end of the seventh round. In Round 8, Ali dropped Foreman with a pair of combinations, the final right hand sending the exhausted champion to the canvas. Foreman didn’t get up in time, and Ali was again world heavyweight champion.\n\n48. March 24, 1975 (46-2)\n\nOpponent: Chuck Wepner (30-9-2)\n\nSite: Richfield (Ohio) Coliseum\n\nWeight: 223 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Wepner was known as “The Bayonne Bleeder,” and the New Jersey native’s full-time job was liquor salesman. After Wepner stepped on Ali’s foot and knocked him down with a blow to the chest in the ninth round, Ali came back and opened cuts over Wepner’s eyes and broke his nose. With 19 seconds left in the fight, Ali knocked down Wepner for the first time in his career, and the fight was stopped. Actor Sylvester Stallone, watching on closed-circuit TV, was inspired to write the script for Rocky, based on Wepner’s challenge.\n\n49. May 16, 1975 (47-2)\n\nOpponent: Ron Lyle (30-2-1)\n\nSite: Las Vegas Convention Center\n\nWeight: 224 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Lyle was a powerful opponent who had learned to box in prison. Ali fell behind early but finished strongly, nailing Lyle with a straight right in the 11th round, dazing the big challenger. Ali then punished Lyle until the referee stopped the fight.\n\n50. June 30, 1975 (48-2)\n\nOpponent: Joe Bugner (51-6-1)\n\nSite: Merdeka Stadium, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n\nWeight: 224 pounds\n\nThe skinny: A $2 million purse lured Ali to only his second fight in a Muslim country. The rematch with Bugner didn’t generate much hype, so Ali was persuaded to say this might be his last fight to drum up interest. Ali danced around the ring most of the fight, throwing combinations every so often, and won the 15-round decision with ease.\n\n51. Oct. 1, 1975 (49-2)\n\nOpponent: Joe Frazier (32-2)\n\nSite: Araneta Coliseum, Manila\n\nWeight: 224 pounds\n\nThe skinny: “The Thrilla in Manila” might have been the greatest heavyweight fight of all time. Ali promised it would be “a killa and a thrilla and a chilla when I get the gorilla in Manila.” He mistakenly thought Frazier was over the hill. Ali attacked Frazier early, but Frazier took the momentum in the fifth round and pounded Ali for several rounds. Ali rallied in the 12th, and both men were exhausted by the end of 14 rounds. Frazier’s trainer, Eddie Futch, would not let his fighter come out for the 15th. Ali raised his arms in victory, then collapsed, saying later it was the closest thing to death he had ever experienced.\n\n52. Feb. 20, 1976 (50-2)\n\nOpponent: Jean-Pierre Coopman (24-3)\n\nSite: Roberto Clemente Coliseum, San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nWeight: 226 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali’s best friend, Howard Bingham, said this about Coopman, a Belgian: “By all accounts he was a very nice man. He just couldn’t fight.” At the news conference to announce the fight, Coopman was so pleased to meet his hero he kept trying to kiss him. “Get this guy away from me,” Ali said. Coopman’s American manager, George Kanter, trying to sell the fight, found a voodoo witch doctor whom he claimed would help Coopman win. Coopman believed in witches and was happy to be put into a deep hole and have water poured over him. He drank champagne in his locker room before the fight. Ali toyed with him until the fifth round, then dropped him.\n\n53. April 30, 1976 (51-2)\n\nOpponent: Jimmy Young (17-4-2)\n\nSite: Capital Centre, Landover, Md.\n\nWeight: 230 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali was the heaviest he’d ever been and produced what many thought was the worst performance of his career, but Young only wanted to survive. The fight went 15 rounds, and Ali won by unanimous decision.\n\n54. May 24, 1976 (52-2)\n\nOpponent: Richard Dunn (33-9)\n\nSite: Olympic Hall, Munich, West Germany\n\nWeight: 220 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali’s skills were waning, and Dunn fought hard. But Ali knocked him down five times in five rounds before the fight was called. Dunn was the last fighter Ali would knock down. After the fight, Ali donated his gloves to a British boxer who had lost his eye. Inside the gloves it was written: “Ali wins” in one, and “Round five” in the other.\n\n55. Sept. 28, 1976 (53-2)\n\nOpponent: Ken Norton (37-3)\n\nSite: Yankee Stadium, New York\n\nWeight: 221 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali was offered $6 million to fight Norton for a third time. Ali knew it would be difficult, and it was. Norton was well ahead after seven rounds, but Ali fought back and they were dead even by the 14th, though Norton’s corner thought he was ahead. They told Norton to just stay out of trouble. Ali won the 15th round and the fight.\n\n56. May 16, 1977 (54-2)\n\nOpponent: Alfredo Evangelista (14-1-1)\n\nSite: Capital Centre, Landover, Md.\n\nWeight: 221 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Evangelista had no business being in the ring with Ali, even with the champ’s eroded skills. Ali won easily, with the fight going the full 15 rounds. Afterward, he talked openly about retirement.\n\n57. Sept. 29, 1977 (55-2)\n\nOpponent: Earnie Shavers (54-5-1)\n\nSite: Madison Square Garden\n\nWeight: 225 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Shavers came in having stopped 52 opponents in his 54 wins. He also idolized Ali. By the end of the 12th round, Ali was ahead, eight rounds to four. Shavers rocked Ali with big punches in the 13th and 14th rounds, but Ali stole the 15th round and the fight. Afterward, Teddy Brenner, who had booked Ali at the Garden for years, told the 35-year-old that he would no longer put on his fights. Ferdie Pacheco, Ali’s doctor, told the fighter he was showing signs of kidney damage and that he should stop fighting.\n\n58. Feb. 15, 1978 (55-3)\n\nOpponent: Leon Spinks (6-0-1)\n\nSite: Las Vegas Hilton Pavilion\n\nWeight: 224 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Ali had beaten all the other Olympic gold medalists of his era, and he expected to easily defeat Spinks, 24. But Ali trained very little for the fight, and as usual, lay on the ropes as Spinks built a lead. For the first time, however, Ali could not come back and lost a split decision.\n\n59. Sept. 15, 1978 (56-3)\n\nOpponent: Leon Spinks (7-0-1)\n\nSite: Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans\n\nWeight: 221 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Spinks was stripped of the World Boxing Council belt when he refused to face Norton instead of Ali. He also was arrested and charged with cocaine possession, and he kept breaking training camp. Ali did train and controlled the WBA title fight, winning a decision to become the first man to win the heavyweight title three times. The crowd was 65,000, and the event was shown live on ABC.\n\n60. Oct. 2, 1980 (56-4)\n\nOpponent: Larry Holmes (35-0)\n\nSite: Caesars Palace, Las Vegas\n\nWeight: 217 pounds\n\nThe skinny: Holmes was a former Ali sparring partner and came in as an undefeated champion. The famed Mayo Clinic had found that Ali had “mild ataxic dysarthria,” a problem using the muscles required to coordinate speaking, and that he had trouble even conducting a basic finger-to-nose coordination test. Ali was beaten for eight rounds, even though Holmes had backed off and later cried about beating a man who had given him his start and probably never should have been in the ring. Dundee mercifully stopped the fight after the 10th round.\n\n61. Dec. 11, 1981 (56-5)\n\nOpponent: Trevor Berbick (19-2-1)\n\nSite: Queen Elizabeth Sports Centre, Nassau, Bahamas\n\nWeight: 236 pounds\n\nThe skinny: More than a year after the Holmes beating, Ali fought a 10-rounder against Berbick, who nearly didn’t fight because he wanted more money. There was tremendous chaos surrounding the fight, but when it finally happened, Berbick ended Ali’s great career with a unanimous decision. Berbick, who briefly held the WBC title in 1986, was murdered in Jamaica in 2006.\n\nPHOTOS: Charismatic Muhammad Ali", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/04"}]}

The observatory said it was working closely with emergency management partners.\n\nThe eruption had remained confined to the summit caldera early Monday, but USGS Volcanoes and the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency later reported some overflowing on the southwest portion. Shortly before 12:20 p.m. EST (7:20 a.m. HST) USGS Volcanoes announced the volcano's eruption had moved to the northeast rift zone, with lava flows heading downslope to the north.\n\nIn a later update, USGS Volcanoes announced that the eruption in the northeast rift zone was still ongoing but no lava was erupting from the southwest rift zone.\n\n\"We do not expect any eruptive activity outside the Northeast Rift Zone. No property is at risk currently,\" USGS Volcanoes said on Twitter.\n\nAn eruption from the northeast means lava could flow towards Hilo, Hawaii, or other locations in East Hawaii, but it could take the lava weeks or even months to reach people. Lava emerging from a southwest rift zone could reach communities in hours or days.\n\nUSGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said the lava flows are not threatening any nearby communities downhill at this time. Still, volcanic gas, fine ash and Pele's Hair, thin strands of volcanic glass, could \"be carried downwind.\"\n\nThe Observatory added that it appears the eruption will remain in the northeast rift zone.\n\n\"The shift of the erupting area into the northeast rift zone takes the hazard into much less steep terrain,\" Hawaii Emergency Management Agency tweeted following the development.\n\n\"Eruptions on steep terrain move quickly downhill while lava is still very hot and liquid. Shallow slopes allow it to cool more as it moves downhill, slowing its progress even more. NE rift zone eruptions may take weeks or months to reach the sea, vs. hours on steeper slopes.\"\n\nWhile nearby communities are not threatened at this time, shelters have been opened as a precaution in Kailua-Kona and Pahala.\n\nBig Island resident Bobby Camara, who lives in Volcano Village, urged everyone across the island to follow and keep track of the eruption with viligance. Camara has seen three Mauna Loa eruptions in his lifetime.\n\n“I think everybody should be a little bit concerned,” he told The Associated Press. “We don’t know where the flow is going, we don’t know how long it’s going to last.”\n\nThe USGS encouraged residents who are potentially at risk from Mauna Loa lava flows to review their eruption preparations, noting that past events show lava flows can \"change rapidly.\" The Hawaii County Civil Defense also has a Mauna Loa Lava Inundation Zones map for reference.\n\n\"If the eruption remains in Moku‘āweoweo, lava flows will most likely be confined within the caldera walls. However, if the eruptive vents migrate outside its walls, lava flows may move rapidly downslope,\" the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory wrote in its Sunday night alert.\n\nPortions of the Big Island were also under an ashfall advisory Monday morning, though it ended later in the day. Officials cautioned people with respiratory illnesses or sensitivities to take precautions, even after the advisory was lifted.\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Health advised residents and visitors to prepare for air quality impacts due to the eruption on Monday afternoon. As of 7 p.m. EST, the air quality remained normal, according to the department of health.\n\nBut the department warned that \"the eruption could cause vog conditions, ash in the air, and levels of sulfur dioxide to increase and fluctuate in various areas of the state.\"\n\nWith conditions changing rapidly, the department advised people to take precautionary measures, including reducing outdoor exposure and wearing masks if outside to limit inhalation of hazardous particulates.\n\nFalling ash, searing gas: Photos show eruption of Sakurajima volcano in Japan\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nBecause of a spike in earthquakes at the summit of Mauna Loa, scientists have been on alert for an eruption. With Sunday night's eruption, the volcano alert level for Mauna Loa has increased from advisory to warning, and its aviation alert upgraded from yellow to red.\n\nMauna Loa, which last erupted in 1984, rises 13,679 feet above sea level. It's among the five volcanoes that make up Hawaii's Big Island.\n\nMauna Loa sits immediately north of Kilauea volcano, which is also erupting – but with a \"watch\" volcano alert level and orange aviation alert, according to the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. A 2018 Kilauea eruption destroyed 700 homes and sent lava into the ocean.\n\nBecause Mauna Loa is taller than Kilauea, experts note, it could rush down some of its hillsides faster because of steeper slopes – possibly in a matter of hours.\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/18/mount-etna-eruption-skiers-video/79080555007/", "title": "Mount Etna eruption: Watch skiers glide by flowing lava in Italy", "text": "As Italy's Mount Etna continued to erupt, three daredevil skiers were captured skiing down the snowy slopes.\n\nVideo footage shows the skiers coming down the slopes with glowing, molten lava flowing in the background.

The FBI has said it is investigating the attack as a \"targeted act of terrorism,\" with the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a native of Egypt whose 2022 tourist visa is expired.\n\nThe countries are primarily in Africa and the Middle East, with a full ban on foreign nationals from 12 nations. They are Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nThe president's proclamation also includes a partial travel ban of people from seven other countries − Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The restrictions are to go into effect on Monday, June 9.\n\nHere is a closer look at why the administration says it is instituting full bans on the 12 nations.\n\nWhy is Haiti on the travel ban list?\n\nLike nearly all of the countries on the full ban, Trump points to visa overstay rates as a key component in his reasoning.\n\nThe proclamation released Wednesday also says Haitian immigrants pose a security risk, echoing Trump's years-long claims linking immigrants with crime and criminal activity, despite consistent independent research that debunks the rhetoric. Research suggests immigrants actually commit fewer crimes than people born in the U.S.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced last month that the U.S was ending temporary protected status (TPS) for an estimated 520,000 Haitians. The program gives temporary legal status and work authorization to people from countries experiencing conflict, natural disasters and other extraordinary conditions.\n\nTrump during his 2024 presidential campaign baselessly claimed that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating pets and promised mass deportations over complaints that their presence was hurting communities. President Barack Obama's administration first granted TPS status to Haitians in 2010 after a devastating earthquake killed as many as 300,000 people and decimated much of the nation's infrastructure. The country has remained unstable, including a 2021 presidential assassination that led to massive government instability, and a surge in gang violence over the past few years.\n\nWhy is Iran on the travel ban list?\n\nTrump says in his ban that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, and that the nation \"regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks,\" and has \"historically failed to accept back its removable nationals.\" The country has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1984, which involves limits on U.S. foreign assistance, a ban on certain exports and various financial restrictions.\n\nThe U.S. and Iran recently restarted talks in an attempt to reach a nuclear deal. Since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 deal that curbed Iran's uranium enrichment activity, deeming the accord deeply flawed, Tehran has accumulated a stockpile of uranium refined to levels close to what would be suitable for nuclear bomb fuel, Reuters reports.\n\nWhy is Afghanistan on the travel ban list?\n\nThe ban points to Afghanistan's ruling government and visa overstays as the reason behind its inclusion on the list.\n\nBecause the Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group according to the U.S., runs the country, the administration says it does not have \"appropriate screening and vetting measures\" and \"lacks a competent or cooperative central authority\" to issue passports and other identity documents.\n\nAs with other countries on Trump's list, the proclamation also cites Afghan nationals overstaying their visas as another reason for their ban.\n\nThe U.S. is ending the temporary protected status program for Afghanistan along with Haiti. Homeland Security Sec. Noem said in a May statement that safety and economic conditions had improved in the country enough to warrant the program termination, which could lead to the deportation of thousands of Afghans residing in the U.S. upon its July 14 end date.\n\nWhy is Myanmar on the travel ban list?\n\nThe Trump administration says Myanmar, referred to as Burma by the U.S. government, has \"historically not cooperated with the United States to accept back their removable nationals,\" and pointed to visa overstays in its proclamation.\n\nWhy is Sudan on the travel ban list?\n\nThe administration points to what it says is the country's lack of a competent or cooperative central government, similar to the language used regarding Afghanistan, as the reason for its inclusion, claiming it results in a questionable ability to issue passports and civil documents.\n\nSudan is further accused of having relatively high visa overstay rates, according to Department of Homeland Security data cited in the ban.\n\nWhy are Equatorial Guinea, Republic of the Congo and Chad on the travel ban list?\n\nThese three African countries are on the ban due to the administration's argument that they have high visa overstay rates.\n\nThe ban says Chad's visa overstay rate, which is listed at over 55% and 37% among business and tourist visa holders in 2022 and 2023, \"indicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws.\"\n\nWhy are Eritrea, Libya and Somalia on the travel ban list?\n\nThe administration points to visa overstay rates and lack of trust in each nation's government in its ban, and that Eritreafails to make the criminal records of its citizens available to the U.S.\n\nTrump also explicitly singles out Somalia and Libya for the presence of terrorist groups and operations within its territories.\n\n\"The historical terrorist presence within Libya’s territory amplifies the risks posed by the entry into the United States of its nationals,\" the proclamation says, also calling Somalia a \"terrorist safe haven.\"\n\nWhy is Yemen on the travel ban list?\n\nAs with several other African and Middle Eastern nations listed, the administration accuses Yemen of not having sufficient measures in place for issuing passports and other travel documents. Trump's ban says the nation lacks control over its own land and has been the site of site of active U.S. military operations since January. The U.S. is involved in combating the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, who have been engaged in a civil war for a decade.\n\nAt least 4.5 million people in Yemen have been displaced by the conflict since 2014, the United Nations estimates, with tens of thousands are living in famine-like conditions and 5 million living on the brink of famine.\n\nContributing: Trevor Hughes, Joey Garrison and Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY; Reuters.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Now, with a new travel ban on 12 countries taking effect, Afghans like Fahima’s husband who have been waiting years for resettlement may never have the chance.\n\n“I’ve had sleepless nights since Jan. 20 and am tired of the constant worry for my family,” Fahima said in an interview earlier this year, asking that her last name be withheld to protect her family.\n\nTrump signed a proclamation on June 4 barring entry into the United States of foreign nationals from 12 countries and partially from seven countries. Citing national security and terrorism concerns, Trump said the countries lack appropriate screening and vetting capabilities.\n\nBut this leaves in the lurch thousands of Afghans who once worked for the United States war effort and have been awaiting resettlement in third countries, like Fahima’s husband, who fled to Iran.

Thousands fled during the frenzied days that followed the fall of Kabul, when the U.S. military tried to evacuate people who supported its mission.\n\nBut many were left behind.\n\n“It is very disheartening that folks have served shoulder to shoulder with the U.S. government as allies, and now the process for reunification has been hindered or halted,” said Freshta Taeb, co-lead of the New Jersey Coalition for Afghan Refugees and a board member for the Afghan-American Foundation.\n\nThe Biden administration also vowed to help Afghans who reached the United States to reunite with their family members, but many remain separated, Taeb added, calling it a \"betrayal.\"\n\n“The trust that we had in the government is now broken,” said Taeb, a Democratic Party candidate for New Jersey Assembly District 12.\n\nSome Afghans who have already settled in the country are also in jeopardy.\n\nThree weeks before he signed the travel ban, Trump ended “temporary protected status” for Afghans in the United States. The designation had granted temporary legal status and work authorization to foreign nationals whose country is deemed unsafe for return.\n\nWhen it takes effect in July, it could leave more than 9,000 Afghans who receive TPS subject to deportation.\n\nWhat the latest poll numbers show: Donald Trump presidential approval rating today\n\nA carve-out for some\n\nAbout 200,000 more Afghans were eligible to come through a U.S. program called Operation Enduring Welcome, said AfghanEvac, an advocacy group that helps resettle Afghan refugees.\n\nThey include men and women who worked closely with U.S. diplomats, aid workers and military personnel and “are the reason many Americans came home alive,” the group said in a statement. Many have left their homes, sold belongings and fled to third countries awaiting resettlement.\n\n“They have already faced multi-layered background checks, medical screenings, and interviews,” AfghanEvac wrote. “They are known. They are trusted. And in many cases, they are waiting to be reunited with loved ones already here.”\n\nTrump’s travel ban exempts Afghans who qualify for special immigrant visas because they have served the U.S. government. But it’s a “narrow exception” said AfghanEvac, and “a cold comfort to the tens of thousands still in the process.”\n\nMany do not qualify, reported No One Left Behind, a veteran-led nonprofit advocating for Afghans. It excludes people who fall short of a required year of service because they were injured in the line of duty and members of the Afghan National Army who trained with U.S. forces.\n\nThe group noted that the Trump administration’s plan to eliminate the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts — which is handling planning and logistics for the relocation of Afghans — is likely to hamper the processing of visa applicants. The measure was included in a proposed reorganization of the State Department submitted to Congress on May 29.\n\n“Our Afghan allies are still counting on us. Let’s keep our promise,” No One Left Behind said in a statement.\n\nWomen at risk\n\nWomen’s advocates have also voiced dire concerns about the ban, noting the extreme restrictions they face there. The U.N. Human Rights Council has described “severe discrimination that may amount to gender persecution — a crime against humanity.”\n\nDaisy Khan, an advocate for women’s equality from North Jersey, was part of a delegation that met with Taliban leaders to press for women’s rights in April 2022. Now, she said, she is receiving messages of disbelief from advocates and women who will be affected by the ban.\n\n“We know people who were counting and banking on this and looking forward to reunifying with families and pursuing their education and making sure their voices and lives don’t get snuffed out,” said Khan, executive director of the New York-based Women's Islamic Initiative in Spirituality and Equality.\n\n\"This proclamation abandons the very women who risked everything working alongside U.S. forces and defending women’s rights and human rights,\" she said. \"It gets us nowhere to abandon men and women who believed in the American promise of protection.\n\n\"We’re not just breaking our moral commitment. We are letting the whole world know that American abandons its allies when it’s convenient,\" Khan said.\n\nShe called for the Trump administration to \"immediately reverse this proclamation and honor our commitment.”\n\nThe travel ban is set to take effect on June 9.

Schools are asking them to reconsider leaving the U.S.\n\nLocal and national immigrant advocates expressed concern and uncertainty about President Donald Trump's newly instituted ban on travel to the U.S. from 19 countries and how it could impact Milwaukee-area families waiting to reunite with relatives abroad.\n\nThe ban is a new take on the so-called \"Muslim travel ban\" from Trump's first administration, a prominent policy that faced legal challenges and went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court. Former President Joe Biden tossed it out when he took office. Set to take effect Monday, the order bars travel from 12 countries and enacts partial restrictions on seven other countries.\n\nThis time, some, but not all, have Muslim-majority populations.

While the order has an exception for Afghans who worked with U.S. forces and are Special Immigrant Visa holders, many others trying to join family do not have those SIVs in hand.\n\nThe federal refugee resettlement program has been halted since Jan. 20, Trump's first day in office. An executive order said the stoppage was supposed to be reviewed within 90 days, but no review has been produced, the program has not restarted, and tens of thousands of people approved to resettle before the executive order have not arrived. The new travel ban means people can expect even more delays, Badwan said.\n\n\"Emotions are high right now,\" Badwan said. \"It's definitely devastating.\"\n\nIn a proclamation signed June 4, Trump cited \"national security risks\" posed by citizens of the targeted nations as a reason for the new ban.\n\n\"Nationals of some countries also pose significant risks of overstaying their visas in the United States, which increases burdens on immigration and law enforcement components of the United States, and often exacerbates other risks related to national security and public safety,\" Trump wrote in a proclamation.\n\nMark Hetfield, president of national refugee resettlement group HIAS, originally the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, said the Trump administration's method of choosing the countries based on their rate of how many people overstay temporary visas \"makes absolutely no sense\" and likely will be challenged in court.\n\n\"The rationale is irrational,\" he said. \"They're having blanket bans on immigrant visas based on nonimmigrant overstays.\"\n\nMilwaukee is home to immigrants from banned countries\n\nOne country with a total ban is Myanmar, or Burma. Milwaukee is believed to be home to one of the largest populations of Burmese refugees in the U.S., including several persecuted ethnic minorities, including the Rohingya, who are Muslim, as well as the Chin, Karen and Karenni, who may practice Christianity, Buddhism or folk religions.\n\nMohamed Anwar and Andrew Trumbull, who co-founded the Burmese Rohingya Community of Wisconsin, said they are grateful that many in the Rohingya community have been able to resettle in the U.S. and hope that can continue.\n\n“We don't think Burmese refugees are a particular risk to the US agenda,\" the co-founders said in an emailed statement to the Journal Sentinel. \"We are peaceful and hardworking people, very grateful to be here, to become American citizens where before we were not citizens of any nation.”\n\nWisconsin also has the third-largest Hmong population in the country. Many of the first Hmong refugees to the state fled Laos after helping the American military during the Vietnam War.\n\nLo Neng Kiatoukaysy, executive director at the Hmong American Friendship Association, said the travel ban would make it more difficult to visit family and limit opportunities for cultural exchange and education.\n\n“Our great grandma and grandpa, they were in the same shoes as many of the immigrants here today,” he said. “And what if this happened when they came to America back then? They would not want to have the same fear, the same intense feeling, this isolation that we’re experiencing right now.”\n\nOver half of the banned or restricted countries are African. Esther Ama S. Ptak, executive director at the African Center for Community Development in Madison, said the ban will prevent people from seeking safety and cause extended family separation for those living in different countries.\n\n\"The travel ban only adds to global injustice and does nothing to help nationals from the banned countries and the U.S.,” Ptak said.\n\nInternational students, a particular target of the Trump administration in recent months, could also be affected by the travel ban. Iranians made up the fourth-largest international student contingent at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in fall 2024, according to university data, with 61 students. At UW-Madison, there were 57 Iranian students last semester.\n\nPeople who have valid visas should not be affected by the ban, the National Iranian American Council said in an informational document. But the organization urged caution for people who haven't yet arrived in the U.S.\n\n\"Some number of Iranian nationals have continued to receive visas in the opening months of 2025 and may not yet have entered the United States. While the order states these visas should be valid, experience tells us that this does not guarantee there will not be complications attempting to enter the U.S. – particularly amid the rollout of this order,\" the council said.\n\nUW-Madison's International Student Services said it is reviewing the details of the travel ban. In a statement, they advised those from affected countries to “seriously reconsider any travel plans outside of the U.S.”\n\nBeyond affecting travel to and from the U.S., the ban tells Muslim families that \"their faith makes them suspect,\" and it fuels fear in Muslim-American communities, said Fauzia Qureshi, executive director of the Wisconsin Muslim Civic Alliance.\n\n\"A reinstatement of the travel ban sends a chilling message,\" she said, adding: \"Policies like this make people feel alienated from the very country they contribute to.\"\n\nHetfield, president of HIAS, said the Trump administration changed its strategy this time by adding other countries — including some in Latin America, Africa and southeast Asia — as courts ruled it was not legal to ban Muslims specifically.\n\n\"They dressed it up, they put lipstick on it,\" he said, but ultimately, \"it's a way to prevent Brown people from coming to this country.\"\n\n(This article has been updated to include new information and to add a photo gallery.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2025/06/05/trump-travel-ban-2025-countries/84049050007/", "title": "Trump travel ban 2025: These 19 countries are on the list", "text": "AI-assisted summary Trump's 2025 travel ban affects citizens from 19 countries.\n\nPeople from 12 countries are banned from the U.S. Partial restrictions apply to seven other countries.\n\nThe travel ban goes into effect June 8.\n\nExceptions exist for certain visa holders, athletes and individuals in the U.S. national interest.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a new travel ban on Wednesday, June 4, 2025, restricting visits to the U.S. from citizens of 12 countries and limiting visits from citizens of seven more.\n\nIn the proclamation announcing the travel ban, Trump cited terrorism and public safety concerns as the reasons for the ban.

Experts have warned, however, that even if the variant is not more lethal, it will likely lead to an increase in infections, hospitalizations and virus-related deaths.\n\nCuomo: 'Another disaster waiting to happen'\n\n\"That variant is getting on a plane and landing in JFK, and all it takes is one person,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement Sunday. He called on the Trump administration to ban flights from the U.K. or, failing that, for airlines to test passengers before they fly from the U.K. to New York.\n\nCuomo said Monday that British Airways had agreed to require passengers on flights from the U.K. to New York to produce a negative coronavirus test before departure. In a tweet, he said New York was working with two other air carriers, Delta and Virgin Atlantic, to do the same.\n\n\"This is another disaster waiting to happen,\" he said at a briefing Monday.\n\nFauci: 'Follow it ... don't overreact'\n\nBut President Donald Trump's assistant secretary for health, Admiral Brett Giroir, said the CDC has not made any recommendation to limit travel from the U.K. to the United States. In an interview Monday with CNN, Giroir said he spoke with CDC Director Robert Redfield on Sunday evening about the matter.\n\nCOVID-19 POLICIES:House panel subpoenas Azar and Redfield as lawmakers allege 'extensive' political meddling\n\n\"There was not a (CDC) recommendation for that,\" Giroir said, although he said U.S. officials would monitor the situation and could change course if warranted.\n\n\"Every hour we get more information,\" he said. \"So I think everything is possible. We just need to put everything on the table, have an open scientific discussion and make a best recommendation.\"\n\nThe White House Coronavirus Task Force is meeting at 2 p.m. on Monday, and the issue could come up for discussion then. The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said he would oppose new travel restrictions based on current information about the new coronavirus variant.\n\nThe U.S. must \"without a doubt keep an eye on it,\" Fauci told CNN on Monday.\n\n\"Follow it carefully, but don't overreact to it,\" he said.\n\nDr. Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said travel bans need to be carefully considered because they can cause fear and disruption. Such restrictions can buy time, he said, but may not always be effective. He noted, for example, that Trump’s oft-cited ban on travel from China occurred after the virus was already circulating in the U.S.\n\nBut British officials said they understand the reaction to the new coronavirus variant circulating there.\n\nBritish Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the virus variant is “out of control” around London and southeastern England.\n\nCanada, India, France, Germany, Italy and Poland are among the countries that have banned flights from Britain. Eurotunnel, the rail service that links Britain with mainland Europe, also has suspended service.\n\nGermany said all flights coming from Britain, except cargo flights, were no longer allowed to land starting at midnight Sunday. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also moved to ban all flights from the U.K. starting at midnight Sunday. He said travelers who arrived Sunday would be subject to secondary screening and other health measures.\n\nGiroir noted that viruses mutate all the time, and there's no indication this new coronavirus variant is more deadly.\n\n\"So I don't think there should be any reason for alarm right now,\" he said Sunday. \"We continue to watch. ... But again, viruses mutate, over 4,000 mutations that we've seen so far in this virus, and it's still acting essentially like COVID-19. And the vaccines should continue to work very robustly against all of these strains.\"\n\nWho controls travel?\n\nTravel from the U.K. to the United States is already much lower than normal because Trump issued a series of presidential proclamations early in the coronavirus pandemic to ban non-U.S. citizens from certain countries from entering the United States.\n\nThe CDC and the State Department can advise Americans against traveling to certain countries based on health threats or other concerns such as crime and terrorism. The CDC currently advises against any travel to the U.K. because of the pandemic.\n\nTrump has used his presidential authority to restrict travel into the U.S., most notably from China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged late last year. On Jan. 31, Trump issued a presidential proclamation limiting travel from China, and he repeatedly touted that as a major success in limiting infections in the U.S.\n\nTrump also banned travelers from the European Schengen Area, a group of 26 European countries that allows open travel across their borders, beginning March 13. Three days later, visitors from the U.K. and Ireland were prohibited. There was speculation as late as last week that the U.K. ban could soon be lifted.\n\nContributing: Julia Thompson and Nicholas Penzenstadler, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/trump-republican-senate-leadership-elections", "title": "Trump mounts anti-McConnell campaign as conservatives seek ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is calling up his allies in the Senate, GOP sources tell CNN, and making a suggestion as he seeks to divert blame for – Republicans’ lackluster midterm performance: Take aim at Mitch McConnell.\n\nTrump, who is facing a round of sharp criticism from inside his own party for hurting Republican candidates in the midterms, has instead sought to gin up opposition to McConnell ahead of leadership elections next week – even as the GOP leader has already locked down enough support to win another two years, which would make him the longest-serving Senate party leader in US history.\n\nYet McConnell is facing new dissension within the ranks as a faction of Senate Republicans are grumbling internally about the timing of the leadership elections next week and are now calling for a delay – something that several GOP sources and a member of Republican leadership have signaled is unlikely to happen.\n\nThe internal back-biting has prompted a new round of fears: That Republicans will be at odds over their future and hurt their ability to unite ahead of the December 6 runoff for the US Senate seat in Georgia. Some of Trump’s allies fear that his obsession with the Kentucky Republican will only undercut their campaign in Georgia, with memories still raw for many in the party who blame the former President for costing them two seats and the Senate majority in last year’s runoff in the Peach State.\n\nBut privately, Trump is trying to turn GOP anger toward McConnell.\n\nIn phone calls with allies, elected officials and incoming members of Congress, the former President has accused McConnell of spending recklessly in states where Republicans faced significant headwinds at the expense of candidates in more competitive contests. He and aides have specifically alluded to the Alaska Senate race, where the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund spent more than $5 million attacking a Trump-backed Republican challenger to incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski. That candidate, Kelly Tshibaka, appears poised to advance to a ranked choice runoff against Murkowski on November 23.\n\nTrump has been extremely critical of McConnell’s decision to slash support for Arizona Senate hopeful Blake Masters over the summer, one aide noted. Masters currently trails incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly by more than 100,000 votes with 80% of votes counted, according to the latest CNN data.\n\nSources said Trump has conveyed these frustrations to nearly everyone he has spoken to since Tuesday, hoping it will translate into an onslaught of public criticism of McConnell.\n\n“He isn’t making explicit asks, but he wants to see more Republicans holding Mitch accountable,” said a second person close to Trump.\n\nMcConnell’s office declined to comment to CNN for this story.\n\nBut it was McConnell’s super PAC, that was the biggest spender in all Senate races in either party – dropping more than $280 million in ads along with its affiliated nonprofit group. Trump’s outside group spent a small fraction of that in Senate races.\n\nIn the Arizona race, McConnell told CNN last month that he and the major GOP donor, Peter Thiel, had a discussion over “resource allocation” as other outside groups went onto to prop up Masters. Plus, it was McConnell’s group that poured roughly $30 million into Ohio to bolster Trump’s-endorsed candidate, J.D. Vance, who was struggling against Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan but ultimately won convincingly.\n\nSteven Law, the head of the Senate Leadership Fund, told CNN the group tried to put a concerted focus on Biden and Democrats this cycle. But he suggested that Trump’s emergence on the campaign trail helped Democrats late in the cycle.\n\n“Keeping the focus on Joe Biden and Democrats who had voted for inflationary spending and who supported soft on crime policies, those are the priorities,” Law said. “And to the extent that there’s any distraction from that, it diminishes our ability to drive home that argument.”\n\nCalls for leadership election delay\n\nSenate Republicans next week are poised for a series of tense meetings. They are expected to meet behind closed doors next Tuesday for their first in-person meeting since the midterms.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is calling for a delay in the leadership elections, believes that Republicans first need to have a discussion about “why the results were what they were and what we are going to do about it,” a Rubio adviser said. The adviser said that Trump did not encourage Rubio to make the public plea for a delay.\n\n“First we need to make sure that those who want to lead us are genuinely committed to fighting for the priorities & values of the working Americans (of every background) who gave us big wins in states like Florida,” Rubio tweeted.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who opposes McConnell’s leadership bid, also tweeted that Republicans should delay the elections so as not to “disenfranchise” Herschel Walker, who is running in the Georgia runoff that will take place after the elections.\n\nAnd three GOP senators – Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rick Scott of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah – sent a letter urging members of the GOP conference to postpone leadership elections scheduled for Wednesday, underscoring Senate Republicans’ frustration with the outcome of the 2022 elections.\n\n“We are all disappointed that a Red Wave failed to materialize, and there are multiple reasons it did not,” says the letter. “We need to have serious discussions within our conference as to why and what we can do to improve our chances in 2024.”\n\nDespite the push to delay, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said the leadership elections will go on as scheduled.\n\n“We look forward to meeting next week with our new and returning members. I expect a full and open discussion beginning at Tuesday’s policy lunch on our path forward. On Wednesday we will meet again for our scheduled conference for elections,” said Barrasso, who oversees the leadership elections, in a message to the conference that was obtained by CNN.\n\n“I welcome the questions and points made in the letter circulated by Senators Rick Scott, Lee and Johnson,” he wrote.\n\nWhile the path to a Republican majority is narrow, Johnson and Lee won their reelection races in 2022. Scott serves in leadership now as the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP’s campaign arm.\n\nTennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn is “supportive” of Johnson running for the No. 4 spot, Republican policy committee chair, according to her spokesperson.\n\n“Someone suggested I run. I didn’t reject the idea and then rumors started to fly,” Johnson told CNN about a potential leadership bid. “My primary objective is to have robust and organized discussions within the conference prior to any leadership election and develop a more collaborative model for the conference.”\n\nBut McConnell allies say delaying an election where the GOP leader is not being challenged will only intensify the internal divisions.\n\n“We need to move on,” one Senate GOP source said. “McConnell will win.”", "authors": ["Gaborr Manu Raju Dana Bash Alex Rogers", "Manu Raju", "Dana Bash", "Alex Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/20/live-updates-inauguration-donald-trump/77755663007/", "title": "Inauguration updates: Trump pardons J6 rioters, signs orders on ...", "text": "Donald Trump became the 47th president of the United States on Monday, taking the oath of office at his second inauguration and vowing that a \"golden age\" for the country begins now.

But each were convicted of seditious conspiracy for organizing their groups at the riot. Tarrio got 22 years in prison and Rhodes got 18 years.\n\nRhodes was listed by name as receiving a commutation.

More than 1,000 pleaded guilty and 260 were convicted at trials. The guilty pleas included 327 people admitting felonies and 682 people admitting misdemeanors.\n\n\"These are the hostages, approximately 1,500 for a pardon.

We hope they come out tonight.”\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump issues executive order to halt TikTok ban – but is it legal?\n\nAs one of his first moves following his inauguration, President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday aiming to halt enforcement of a ban on TikTok in the U.S. for 75 days.\n\nThe order comes after TikTok abruptly shut down in the U.S. over the weekend, only to say it was working to restore service based on assurances from Trump. Service was swiftly restored to the popular short-form video app Sunday, although Apple and Google haven't returned it to their app stores for downloading.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Sunday that he would issue the order on his first day as a second-term president \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\n\"The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\" Trump promised.\n\nWhether Trump's executive order can truly halt the law temporarily isn't clear. The law works by imposing a $5,000 fine on companies for each user who accesses TikTok through their services. That includes companies like Apple and Google that provide platforms to download and update apps and companies like Oracle that provide internet hosting services.\n\nFederal employees required to return to work in-person\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing department heads to require federal employees to \"return to work in-person at their respective duty stations on a full-time basis\" immediately, with exemptions allowed.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing about 800,000 federal workers, promptly filed a federal lawsuit Monday against the Trump administration and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to ensure they comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).\n\nThe lawsuit, AFGE along with watchdog groups Public Citizen and State Democracy Defenders Fund (SDDF), claim Trump and his Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \"do not represent the interests of everyday Americans... (they) will be considering cuts to government agencies and programs that protect health, benefits, consumer finance, and product safety.\"\n\nAs Trump's return-to-office mandate was expected to get major pushback from federal workers, the president is also threatening to take legal action against the latest AFGE contract which extended remote worker protections until 2029.\n\n“AFGE will not stand idly by as a secretive group of ultra-wealthy individuals with major conflicts of interest attempt to deregulate themselves and give their own companies sweetheart government contracts while firing civil servants and dismantling the institutions designed to serve the American people,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement. “This fight is about fairness, accountability, and the integrity of our government. Federal employees are not the problem—they are the solution.”\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nTrump travels to arena for inaugural rally\n\nDonald Trump was spotted on his way to the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., where he'll hold an inaugural rally with supporters.\n\nHe was supposed to participate in a parade to celebrate the start of his second term, but festivities were moved indoors due to the below-freezing cold in the nation's capital.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nHegseth advances in committee for Defense role\n\nA majority on the Senate Armed Services Committee voted in favor ot Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon.\n\nHegseth, a combat veteran and former Fox News host, will advance to the full Senate following the committee's party-line vote: 14-13. The vote before the full Senate could happen later this week.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook and Riley Beggin\n\nShowing up in the cold in red, white and blue\n\nA few blocks from the White House, Trump supporters sported “Make America Great” hats and scarves and carried American flags. Some took pictures as police stood nearby.\n\nAt one point early Monday, a motorcade of black SUVs whizzed by. People whipped out their cell phones and shouted that they'd seen Trump.\n\nChristina Bush had planned to join other Trump supporters on the mall for the inauguration, but that was canceled because of the frigid weather. Instead, she wore her red, white and blue knit cap and planned to visit some memorials.\n\n“It was important to take today to remember how blessed we are to live in the greatest country in the world,” said Bush, 35, of Oceanside, California.\n\nShe said it’s also important to bring people and the country together.\n\nDespite the frigid weather and snow, Ali Grzelak and her father, Steve, drove down from Monmouth, New Jersey on Sunday to celebrate Trump’s inauguration.\n\n“We’re just happy to be part of the atmosphere,’’ said Grzelak, 34, as she stood with Bush, a longtime friend, steps from the White House. “There’s like a spirit in the air.’’\n\nGrzelak had attended a Trump rally in New Jersey in 2020 and felt it was important to show support again.\n\n“Trump’s done so much for us, the least I can do is show up in some cold weather,’’ she said.\n\n– Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nTrump participates in pass in rev\n\nFollowing a ceremonial luncheon, Trump attended a proceeding known as the pass in review, when leaders observe and \"review\" processions of military troops.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happens next on Inauguration Day?\n\nDonald Trump may have given his inaugural address, but that doesn't mean the ceremonies are over.\n\nThe presidential parade is kicking off next. It was previously scheduled to take place on Pennsylvania Avenue and proceed to the White House, but the procession was moved inside the Capital One Arena due to cold weather.\n\nSenate Republicans are also hoping to begin confirming Trump's Cabinet picks on Monday afternoon. Marco Rubio's secretary of state nomination could be considered, along with John Ratcliffe's CIA nomination.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIn sweeping orders, Trump aims to remake federal policy on border, gender, climate change\n\nDonald Trump planned to sign dozens of executive orders Monday in a sweeping move to reimagine the country's relationship with immigration, its economy, the environment and even gender roles.\n\nIncoming White House officials – speaking on condition of anonymity shortly before Trump took the oath of office – previewed the directives, which included the declaration of at least two national emergencies targeting the border and the energy sector.\n\nThe orders are expected to include mandates for how the U.S. government recognizes gender on federal documents and change official names of Mt. Denali in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe orders could undo with the flourish of a pen many of former President Joe Biden's key efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, protect federal lands from oil drilling and enshrine the civil rights of transgender people. And they could grant the second Trump administration expansive authority to enforce border security and immigration laws.\n\n– Lauren Villagran, Elizabeth Weise, Erin Mansfield\n\nNo, Donald Trump didn't put his hand on the Bible\n\nTrump opted out of an inauguration tradition on Monday: He didn't place his hand on a Bible as he was sworn in.\n\nBut that doesn't change Trump's inauguration.

Now, the central bank is trying to do the exact opposite.\n\nDavid Rubenstein, the billionaire investor and co-founder of The Carlyle Group (CG), told CNN last week the Fed is actively rooting for the unemployment rate to go up to get inflation under control.\n\n“He can’t quite say this, but if the unemployment rate goes up to 4% or 5% or 6%, inflation will [probably] be tamed a bit,” Rubenstein said of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he hired a quarter-century ago to work in private equity, “But he can’t come out and say, ‘I hope the unemployment rate goes up to 6%.’ That doesn’t sound politically very attractive to say that.”\n\nFed officials have warned the jobs market is too strong right now and is contributing to the very high cost of living. To cool inflation, the Fed is increasing interest rates at the fastest pace in decades. The goal is to ease demand for workers, which would bring the jobs market more into balance and take pressure off prices.\n\nThe unemployment rate tumbled in July to 3.5%, tied for the lowest level since 1969. The jobless rate ticked up to 3.7% in August, but for a healthy reason: Hundreds of thousands of Americans got off the sidelines to actively look for work.\n\nBut a jump in the unemployment rate toward 6% would translate to a sizable wave of layoffs.\n\n“There will be a lot of job losses. The Fed isn’t going to publicly say, ‘We want job losses,’” said Rubenstein, who interviewed leading investors for his new book, “How to Invest: Masters on the Craft.”\n\nPowell warns of ‘pain’ for Main Street\n\nIf the Fed tries to slow the economy to the point where inflation gets back down to its 2% goal, it would lead to the loss of 5.3 million jobs and the unemployment rate climbing to 6.7%, according to a recent analysis from RSM, an accounting and consulting firm.\n\nPowell, in a high-profile speech during the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium last month, said the Fed will “forcefully” use its policymaking tools to get inflation under control – a strategy that will bring “some pain to households and businesses.”\n\n“These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,” he said during his speech.\n\nSome major companies, including Ford (F), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, have already disclosed major layoffs in recent weeks.\n\nHowever, there is little evidence that layoffs are becoming more widespread. Weekly jobless claims declined last week to a two-month low. The number of job cut announcements made through August is the lowest year-to-date total since 1993, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nRecession worries\n\nNonetheless, economists continue to warn the US economy is at an elevated risk of a recession, if not this year then in 2023 and 2024.\n\n“Nobody knows for certain, and I don’t like to use the word ‘recession,’” said Rubenstein. “When I worked in the White House under President Carter, the inflation adviser there was told not to use the R-word. Recessions scared people. So he came up with another word: banana.”\n\nThe Carlyle co-founder said he doesn’t know if the economy is going into a “banana” or not – but it won’t be the end of the world if it does happen.\n\n“We’re not likely to go into a deep recession like we had in ’07-‘08. I don’t see signs of that,” Rubenstein said. “And it’s not a depression. You know, it’ll be a modest recession, if it occurs. I don’t know if it will occur.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Billionaire businessman explains how to invest like the best 02:28 - Source: CNN Business Billionaire businessman explains how to invest like the best CNN Business 02:28\n\nMarkets may not have bottomed yet\n\nRubenstein noted that economic downturns present opportunities for investors who can buy good companies at deep discounts.\n\n“There’s always going to be recessions, but that’s when great fortunes are made,” he said.\n\nRubenstein isn’t confident the worst is over for US stocks, which plunged into a bear market in June but have since bounced back. Still, he stressed it’s very difficult to precisely time the market and suggested investors shouldn’t waste too much time trying.\n\n“I don’t think we’ve hit the bottom, the absolute bottom, but we’re kind of close near the bottom in some technology areas,” Rubenstein said. “You never know when it’s really bottom. But if it goes down another 10%, what difference does it make? If you buy something now and it goes down 10% and then later goes up 30%, what difference would it make if you hit the bottom of the market?”\n\nMoving the inflation goalposts would ‘scare’ people\n\nEven though recent indicators show inflation is starting to cool off, Rubenstein cautioned it will take “years” before inflation gets back down to the 2% level the Fed is seeking.\n\n“I don’t think you can raise interest rates high enough that you’re going to get the inflation rate down very quickly. It takes a while, particularly when we have a war in Ukraine,” he said. “The Fed recognizes that once you have inflation in the system, as Paul Volcker has said, it’s very difficult to get it out.”\n\nSome economists have suggested the Fed could move the goalposts on inflation, revising its 2% inflation target to the more attainable level of 3%.\n\nRubenstein, however, does not think that’s likely anytime soon.\n\n“That would scare the markets,” he said. “They would say, ‘That means the Fed doesn’t think it can get to 2%. That means inflation is going to be higher for awhile.’ That would scare people.”\n\nPowell and his colleagues at the Fed insisted inflation would be “transitory,” before conceding late last year that wouldn’t be the case. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made matters worse this spring, sending food and energy prices skyrocketing.\n\nRubenstein praised Powell as a “very smart, hardworking person” but said the Fed chair (and others) “underestimated” how bad inflation would be.\n\n“We sometimes think that the chairmen of the Fed are people who are gods,” Rubenstein said. “Alan Greenspan was almost a god.

He served as director of the domestic economics division at the Federal Reserve Board from 2011 to 2018. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\nRising prices are causing real and immediate financial hardship for millions of American households. While a growing number of economists claim the Federal Reserve has gone too far in its fight against inflation and is unnecessarily setting the US economy up for a hard landing, I would argue the Fed is doing what it must to fulfill its responsibility for controlling inflation, even if doing so means risking a recession.\n\nDavid Wilcox Peterson Institute for International Economics\n\nThe higher inflation rises, and the more it resists the Fed’s efforts to control it, the tougher the Fed will have to be. This is the textbook prescription for how a central bank should behave.\n\nHigh inflation is a problem for several reasons. Many people today are experiencing a serious erosion of their standard of living as increases in the prices of items they purchase outstrip any increases in income they might receive. High inflation also complicates everyday decision-making about key issues, such as how much to save for retirement. And it increases anxiety, partly because high inflation also tends to be more variable and unpredictable.\n\nUnfortunately, the only known remedy for persistent high inflation is a recession. Today’s hardship from rising prices is therefore likely to be followed by an increase in joblessness over the next year or two. The Fed understands the costs many Americans will probably have to endure for the sake of bringing inflation back down, but there is no other way out. The worse the inflation problem becomes, the greater the recessionary cost.\n\nIn 2021, when inflation was first emerging as a problem, it was concentrated in categories directly affected by the pandemic. Cars, for instance, saw rising prices due to the Covid-related shortage of microchips.\n\nNow, prices are galloping higher for many household purchases, including everyday necessities. Over the 12 months ending in September, the consumer price index increased 8.2%. Food prices were up 11.2%, energy prices were up 19.8%, and shelter costs were up 6.6%. Together, these components constitute a little more than half of the average market basket. They’re items consumers can’t do without, so they have less discretion over whether to spend.\n\nThe question now is how much more the Fed will have to do to bring inflation back down to the target level of 2%. It has already raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point three times this year, and left a widespread conviction that more rate hikes are yet to come. It has also begun shrinking its balance sheet by unwinding some of its bond purchases – another method for dialing back on the economic support it provided during the height of Covid.\n\nNobody knows whether these actions will turn out to be too little, too much or just right. That will depend on myriad factors outside the Fed’s control, such as what Russian President Vladimir Putin’s continuing invasion of Ukraine will do to the world’s energy and food supplies; how virulent the next strains of Covid prove to be and how far the economic decoupling of China from the rest of the world proceeds.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, we know two things for sure. First, the Fed will need to continuously be in course-correction mode, responding to unforeseen developments by adjusting its policies to help get the economy back on track. Lately, the inflation news has run worse than expected, so the Fed has responded sensibly by being absolutely clear it will raise rates as much as necessary to quell inflation, even at the cost of sending the US economy into recession. If we get a run of news in the other direction, the Fed will be able to back off.\n\nSecond, this is a fight the Fed must win. We learned the bitter lesson in the 1970s of what happens when central banks don’t face up to their inflation-fighting responsibilities: We end up with an inflationary avalanche that becomes ever more difficult to stop.\n\nDealing with inflation problem now will be painful because it will probably cost many workers their jobs. But not addressing it now would make matters worse, as households and businesses become more convinced that high inflation is here to stay and it becomes a self-fulling prophecy. Faced with this choice – painful now, or more painful later – the Fed is taking the right path.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe process of bringing inflation down will be too slow for anyone’s satisfaction because it involves setting off a chain reaction that often takes one to two years to play out. The first step is that financial conditions have to tighten; that step is already well along. Loan rates have moved up sharply, stock prices have dropped, and the dollar has strengthened in foreign exchange markets.\n\nNext, the tighter financial conditions have to restrain demand. Higher loan rates make it more expensive to borrow, discouraging purchases of new homes, cars and business capital. Lower stock prices mean households fortunate enough to own equities are suddenly less wealthy, so they reduce their spending. A stronger dollar makes the goods and services produced in the US relatively more expensive compared to items produced aboard, another necessary element of cooling demand. This second step is still a long way from completion. Housing construction has dropped off, but the labor market remains severely overheated, with too many unfilled jobs compared to the number of willing workers.\n\nFinally, softer demand will eventually encourage firms to restrain their price increases, and workers to temper their wage demands. Once convincing evidence has emerged that this final step is well underway, the Fed will be able to begin cutting rates. As that happens, employment gains will resume, the unemployment rate will come back down, and inflation will once again be low and stable in the neighborhood of 2%. Economic life – at long last – will go back to something resembling “normal.”\n\nThe next year or two are certainly going to be tough. But the only thing worse than dealing with today’s inflation would be failing to do so. The economy won’t work to anyone’s satisfaction until inflation is under control. There’s no alternative but to grit our teeth and get on with it.", "authors": ["David Wilcox"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/business/uber-sexual-assault-safety-lawsuit", "title": "Uber's safety issues still loom large: Another five passengers sue ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFive more passengers are suing Uber over alleged sexual assault incidents that occurred in recent months at the hands of drivers on its platform.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest reminder of the flood of lawsuits that Uber and competitor Lyft face as they work to combat well-known safety issues on their platforms, especially for female riders.\n\nThe incidents detailed in a lawsuit filed this week in San Francisco County Superior Court took place between August 2021 to February 2022 in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Illinois and California. They include: a plaintiff who alleges she was “digitally penetrated” by a driver who then attempted rape; another plaintiff who alleges she had her breasts fondled by a driver who then raped her; and another who alleges her driver “began masturbating in the driver’s seat” and then forced her to perform oral sex while he held down her head.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of five Jane Does by law firm Slater Slater Schulman LLP as a multiparty complaint to be litigated individually. The firm said it has retained roughly 550 clients who have claims against Uber; it is actively investigating about 150 others, it said. However, the firm said it has only filed lawsuits against Uber for a small number of these claims to date, or 24 cases.\n\nUber, in a statement, said the company does not comment on pending litigation, but that it takes “every single report seriously.”\n\n“There is nothing more important than safety, which is why Uber has built new safety features, established survivor-centric policies, and been more transparent about serious incidents,” a spokesperson said in the statement.\n\nThe lawsuit specifies that while Uber markets itself as a company that provides safe rides, it doesn’t make clear the known risks and limitations of its service to customers. “Uber does not inform riders … that hailing a ride after drinking puts riders in peril from the drivers themselves. By marketing heavily to young women who have been drinking, and promising safe rides, Uber puts riders in peril,” the lawsuit reads.\n\nSlater Slater Schulman LLP is among several firms with practices targeting safety issues on Uber and Lyft’s services. A mass tort claim brought by firms like Estey & Bomberger and Levin Simes Abrams indicates there are more than 700 cases filed by other plaintiffs. Some cases Lyft is facing are slated to go to trial through a coordinated proceeding later this year.\n\nThe lawsuit comes two weeks after Uber released its second-ever safety report, in which it disclosed that it recorded 141 reports of rape in the United States in 2020 even as its ridership was decimated by the pandemic. Across its two safety reports, which cover 2017 to 2020, the company disclosed that it received 9,805 reports of the most severe categories of sexual assault, which range from “non-consensual kissing of a non-sexual body part” to “non-consensual sexual penetration,” or rape.\n\nUber notes on its website that as “the numbers in both reports show, critical safety incidents on our platform are, statistically, extremely rare.” Lyft, in a blog post accompanying its safety report released last year, said: “while safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we realize that even one is too many. Behind every report is a real person and real experience, and our goal is to make each Lyft ride as safe as we possibly can.”\n\nUber, followed by Lyft, initially pledged to put together a safety transparency report in response to a 2018 CNN investigation into drivers accused of sexual assault or abuse by passengers since 2014, based on publicly available data including police reports. After CNN began asking questions about sexual assaults, Uber announced new safety measures such as a partnership with RapidSOS, which sends a rider’s location and relevant information to a local police agency when the rider uses an emergency button in the Uber app. The company also revamped its approach to background checks. In March 2021, Uber and Lyft announced they would share the names of drivers who were deactivated over the most severe safety incidents.\n\nStill, the lawsuit alleges Uber’s approach is inadequate. Among other measures, the lawsuit states that installing and requiring video cameras in cars would having a chilling effect on “the wantonness of potential predators.”\n\nIn response to CNN’s 2018 report, Uber, followed by Lyft, said it would no longer force into arbitration passengers who allege that they have been sexually assaulted or harassed by drivers, which has paved the way for such claims to be filed against the company.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}]}

There were eight victims in the attack, ages 52 to 88, who were all transported to local hospitals.\n\nThe victims suffered injuries ranging from minor to serious, and Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at least two of them were airlifted to a hospital in the Denver area.\n\nSunday's attack falls on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and comes over a week after the slaying of two Israeli Embassy aides outside a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C. The attack occurred at a \"regularly scheduled, weekly peaceful event,\" according to Michalek. He said witnesses reported seeing the suspect use a makeshift flamethrower and throw an incendiary device into the crowd.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Boulder dispatch received several calls to the county courthouse on Pearl Street at around 1:26 p.m. local time, Redfearn said at an afternoon news conference. Initial reports indicated that there was a man with a weapon, and people were being set on fire at the scene. Responding officers encountered multiple victims who were injured with wounds consistent with burns and other injuries, Redfearn added.\n\nColorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement that the attack appeared to be a \"hate crime given the group that was targeted.\" Weiser said the group meets weekly at the Pearl Street Mall in downtown Boulder to \"call for the release of the hostages in Gaza.\"\n\n\"Hate has no place in Colorado,\" Weiser added. \"We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views.

This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across our nation.\"\n\nSeveral blocks remained closed off in downtown Boulder surrounding the county courthouse, according to Redfearn. Multiple teams, including canine, bomb squad, and hazmat, were in the area, Redfearn said.\n\nAuthorities were still working on clearing the area for devices.\n\nVideos appear to show hectic moments following the attack\n\nVideos posted on social media appear to show the chaotic scene after a man attacked a group of people with a Molotov cocktail.\n\nIn one video, a shirtless man in dark sunglasses believed to be the suspect holds two glass containers filled with a clear liquid and paces back and forth on a patch of grass, shouting at people nearby. Off to the side, bystanders appear to provide first aid to a person lying on the ground.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, an organization that works to fight antisemitism and bias, said the 53-second video was shot after the attack.\n\nRead more here.\n\n'My friends were burning and hurt'\n\nAaron Brooks, of Boulder, was riding his bike when he heard someone yelling for a doctor and saw a friend running from the courthouse. Brooks said he often participates in the march, so he headed toward the courthouse to see what was going on.\n\nThe attack had just happened, he said.\n\n\"I saw smoke coming from the ground, blood on the ground, smoke coming from a person,\" Brooks said. \"It looked like somebody was burning, and people were throwing water on her.\"\n\nBrooks said he also saw a shirtless man who was shouting and holding two bottles filled with liquid. He saw another man yelling and assumed they were together, although he later learned the second man was trying to stop the suspect.\n\n\"I yelled at him, 'What are you doing? Why did you do this?'\" Brooks said. \"My friends were burning and hurt, and I got emotional.\"\n\nUniversity of Denver buildings vandalized with anti-Israel graffiti\n\nHours before the attack in Boulder, 18 to 20 buildings on the University of Denver campus were vandalized with anti-Israel graffiti.\n\nThe vandalism took place either late Friday or early Saturday, said Adam Rovner, director of the university’s Center for Judaic Studies. Rovner said the graffiti was spread among buildings across the campus, including dormitories.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the graffiti was tied to the attack in Boulder, which is about half an hour northwest of Denver.\n\n\"In the wake of the murders in DC at the Jewish Museum and in the wake of this horrific attack on a peaceful vigil in Boulder, this kind of thing is what globalizing the Intifada means,\" Rovner said. \"It means attacks on innocent people.\"\n\nIt's 'the definition of antisemitism': People react to Israeli embassy shooting\n\nBoulder Jewish Community Center: 'We are saddened and heartbroken'\n\nIn a statement on social media, the Boulder Jewish Community Center said it was in touch with law enforcement about the Jewish community in the city and noted that safety is its \"highest priority.\"\n\n“We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza,” the Boulder Jewish Community Center said.\n\nRun for Their Lives is an organization that facilitates global running or walking events calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, according to the organization’s website. The website states that local communities meet once a week for a 1-kilometer walk or run while wearing matching t-shirts and carrying flags of the countries where the hostages are from. The events are shared on social media by local organizers.\n\n\"The term 'Run' is symbolic, emphasizing that the hostages cannot run for their lives,\" according to the website. \"We run or walk on their behalf, because they can’t—and to act before it’s too late.\"\n\nADL: Suspect appeared to say victims are 'killers'\n\nAn organization that works to fight antisemitism and bias said in a statement that it has reviewed videos of the suspect believed to have thrown the Molotov cocktails.\n\n\"We believe he can be heard saying, 'How many children have you killed?' 'We need to end Zionists,'\" the ADL said.\n\nThe organization said the man also gestured toward what appeared to be victims of the attack and proclaimed: \"They are killers.\"\n\n'There was a lot of people out — a very beautiful day'\n\nAt 2:08 p.m. local time, the Boulder Police Department said in a post on X that they responded to a report of several victims near the Boulder mall, about 30 miles northwest of Denver. Pearl Street is a four-block pedestrian mall that stretches from 11th Street to 15th Street. Multiple businesses and restaurants, as well as the Boulder County Courthouse, are located in the area.\n\nAbout an hour later, the police department said it was evacuating several blocks around the area between Walnut and Pine streets as they continued \"to investigate this active incident.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of people out — a very beautiful day,\" Redfearn said, adding that there was a group of people that were conducting a peaceful demonstration in support of Israeli hostages. The police chief said he believed the demonstration occurred frequently in the area.\n\nRedfearn called the incident \"unacceptable,\" noting that it was too early for police to speculate on a motive.\n\nIncident comes amid heightened tensions across the U.S.\n\nDan Bongino, the FBI's deputy director, said on X that the agency's leadership team was on the ground in Boulder and would soon have an update on the attack.\n\n\"This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts,\" Bongino said. \"We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.\"\n\nCivil rights and advocacy groups have reported a surge in antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\nAccording to Israeli tallies, the attack killed about 1,200 people, and 251 Israelis were taken hostage into Gaza. Israel’s subsequent military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians and has destroyed much of the enclave, said Gaza health officials.\n\nThe attack also occurred after two Israeli embassy employees were fatally shot in Washington, D.C., on May 21. The victims were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum when the suspect opened fire, killing Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim. The suspect shouted, \"Free, free Palestine\" while in custody, authorities said.\n\nIsraeli embassies immediately increased security measures following the incident, USA TODAY previously reported. Just days after the shooting, federal authorities announced that a dual U.S. and German citizen was arrested in New York for allegedly attempting to firebomb a branch office of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nGov. Polis: 'Heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community'\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement on social media that the state was working with local and federal law enforcement to support the investigation. The governor condemned the attack and called for the suspect to be prosecuted to the \"fullest extent of the law.\"\n\n\"My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured by this heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community. Boulder is strong,\" Polis said. \"We have overcome tragedies together and will get through this together as a community.\"\n\n\"As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,\" the governor added. \"Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League said it was monitoring the situation “as we approach the holiday of Shavuot.”\n\n\"We are aware of reports of an attack at today's Boulder Run for Their Lives event - a weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages kidnapped on 10/7,\" the organization said on X.\n\nAccording to Jewishcolorado, a Denver-based non-profit that is part of the Jewish Federations of North America, the Run for Their Lives walk is a repeating event in downtown Boulder.\n\n\"We have been walking in Boulder, CO since Thanksgiving 2023 to show solidarity for the plight of the hostages still being held in Gaza,\" according to the organization’s website. \"We will continue to walk until all hostages are released.\"\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nContributing: Christopher Cann, Joey Garrison and Charles Ventura, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/02/boulder-colorado-terror-attack-live-updates/83987003007/", "title": "Boulder terror attack updates: Suspect charged with hate crime", "text": "Editor's Note: This article has been updated to accurately reflect the mission of Run for Their Lives to raise awareness about the hostages held in Gaza.\n\nBOULDER, CO − The man accused of setting 12 people aflame at a gathering by a group that supports the return of Israeli hostages in Gaza has been charged with a federal hate crime after telling investigators he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished all of them were dead, according to an FBI affidavit released Monday.\n\nMohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is accused of attacking the weekly \"Run for Their Lives\" demonstration on Sunday with a makeshift flamethrower and fire bombs while shouting \"Free Palestine.\" The victims, ages 52 to 88, suffered injuries ranging from serious to minor.\n\nA total of 12 people were burned in the incident, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said in a news conference on Monday. Authorities previously said there were eight victims, but four more came forward, Redfearn announced.\n\nSoliman was unrepentant, telling authorities he learned about the demonstration from an online search and wanted to keep them from taking over \"our land\" − Palestine, according to the affidavit. It says Soliman told investigators he planned the attack for a year and waited for his daughter to graduate before executing it.\n\nSoliman was taken into custody at the scene. He appeared in court on Monday, where a judge set bond at $10 million, according to Shannon Carbone, a spokesperson for the Boulder County District Attorney's Office. Soliman is due back in court on June 5, Judge Nancy Salomone said.\n\n\"The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.\n\nSoliman also faces several state-level charges of attempted murder, assault, and possession of an incendiary device, according to an arrest affidavit. More charges are expected due to the four additional victims, authorities said.\n\nWitness recounts putting out flames on the victim\n\nAbout 24 hours after the attack, witness Lisa Turnquist returned to Pearl Street to lay flowers and a small Israeli flag at a small memorial. Turnquist, 66, said she’d been a regular attendee at the Sunday marches, rain, snow, or shine, and was arriving on June 1 when she saw flames on a woman’s legs.\n\nTurnquist, who is Jewish, said she grabbed a towel from her dog Jake’s stroller and used it to smother the flames on the elderly woman’s legs. Turnquist said she provided a statement to investigators after the incident.\n\nShe said she had seen Soliman moments before and thought he looked out of place because he was wearing what appeared to be landscaping clothing and carrying a sprayer.\n\n\"Something said keep on walking by him,\" she said. \"All he had to do would have been to spray me. It took eight of us to get the fire out on her.\"\n\nTurnquist said she began participating a few weeks after the marches began following the October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel. She said that walkers have long been confronted with allegations that they are complicit in genocide for demanding Hamas release its hostages.\n\n\"We just want them home, and that's why we do this,\" she said. \"I woke up this morning and didn't want to get out of bed. I didn't want to get out of bed and didn't want to talk to my friends who were calling me. But this is when we have to get up and stand up and we have to push back.\"\n\nAuthorities: 12 people burned in incident\n\nFederal and Colorado authorities shared at a news conference Monday afternoon that there were at least 12 total victims of the attack. At least two victims were flown to a hospital in Aurora and remained hospitalized, according to Redfearn.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney for Colorado J. Bishop Grewell said Soliman was charged with a federal hate crime.\n\n\"No one should ever be subjected to violence of any kind but our laws recognize such violence is particularly pernicious when someone is targeted because of their race, ethnicity or national origin,\" Grewell said. The suspect \"acted because he hated what he called ‘the Zionist group.'\"\n\nThe FBI labeled the incident as a terrorist attack, though Soliman has not been charged with terrorism. Grewell said that \"just because there's only one charge doesn't mean we’re not considering other charges.\"\n\nGrewell noted the suspect used Molotov cocktails after being unable to purchase a gun for the attack.\n\nFBI Special Agent-in-Charge for Denver Mark Michalek said authorities found 16 unused Molotov cocktails on Soliman. He credited the police's quick response with preventing the suspect from using the additional fire bombs.\n\nSoliman was not on the police’s \"radar\" before the attack, Redfearn said. \"This is not someone we were aware of.\"\n\nWho is Mohamed Soliman?

Foster said there is some anxiety about safety at the event, but that she’s been in contact with Colorado Gov.

The other four were discharged. One congregation member remains in serious condition, Soloway said.\n\n\"It brings up horrific images of our past,\" Soloway told the news outlet. \"Just the idea of somebody who literally has their body on fire in the middle of the mall in Boulder, Colorado, it just defies belief.\"\n\nCongregation Bonai Shalom was founded in 1981 and has over 250 families registered as members, according to the synagogue's website. The person who remains in serious condition was participating in the walk to raise awareness for Israeli hostages for the first time, Soloway told KUSA-TV.\n\nSuspect says he learned to make Molotov cocktails from the Internet\n\nSoliman is a married father of five who told investigators he learned how to make Molotov cocktails from the Internet and ranted about protecting Palestine, the FBI said.\n\nAccording to investigators, Soliman had been planning the attack for a year and bought 87-octane gasoline the day of the attack as he drove from his home in Colorado Springs to Boulder, about 100 miles north. The FBI said investigators found 14 unused Molotov cocktails in a plastic bin near where police detained Soliman, along with a weed sprayer loaded with gas.\n\nInvestigators said Soliman disclosed he had left at home an iPhone containing messages to his family, along with a journal. Investigators did not immediately release any details of those messages or the journal's contents.\n\nSoliman is being held on a $10 million bond at the Boulder County Jail and is accused of throwing two lit glass bottles of gas at the protesters.\n\n\"Throughout the interview, Soliman stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over 'our land,' which he explained to be Palestine,\" FBI agent Jessica Krueger said in an affidavit. \"He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack.\"\n\n'The definition of antisemitism': People react to fatal Israeli embassy shooting\n\nSoliman entered the United States on a tourist visa in 2022\n\nSoliman, of El Paso County, Colorado, was taken into custody after witnesses pointed him out, authorities said. He was booked on multiple preliminary charges, including first-degree murder and using explosives or an incendiary device while committing a felony.\n\nPolice said Soliman was injured in the incident and taken to a hospital to be medically evaluated before he was booked in the Boulder County jail. Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff, said Soliman overstayed a tourist visa issued in 2022.\n\n\"In response, the Biden administration gave him a work permit,\" Miller said in a social media post. \"Immigration security is national security. No more hostile migration. Keep them out and send them back.\"\n\nCBS News and Fox News, citing unnamed sources, reported that Soliman is an Egyptian national.

This is expected to be an active season, and follows at least two dozen landfalling hurricanes in the mainland U.S. since 2016.\n\nNews of Richardson's remark prompted outrage from former FEMA officials, Democrats in Congress and others concerned about the agency's ability to respond to disasters this year after more than a third of its staff was decimated by Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency cuts.\n\nAsked if Richardson would like to respond, FEMA sent USA TODAY a statement attributed to an unnamed DHS official.\n\nUnder the leadership of Kristi Noem, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and the efforts of Richardson, FEMA is \"fully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season,\" the statement read. “Despite meanspirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy, there is no uncertainty about what FEMA will be doing this Hurricane Season.

After being appointed to replace Hamilton, Richardson told staff in his first meeting that he would \"run right over\" anyone who resisted change.\n\nIn its response to criticism of Richardson, the adminstration again complained about FEMA: \"It’s not a secret that under Secretary Noem and Acting Administrator Richardson, FEMA is shifting from bloated, DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\" the statement read. \"The old processes are being replaced because they failed Americans in real emergencies for decades.\"\n\nJoking or not, cuts are real\n\nOne former FEMA official told USA TODAY on June 3 that even if Richardson was joking in the meeting, it's worrisome the staff couldn't tell.\n\n\"People were immediately confused,\" said Jeremy Edwards, a former FEMA deputy director of public affairs and now a communications advisor at the Century Foundation.\n\nThe staff has voiced concerns about whether the agency is prepared for what may come this year and \"we've seen internal memos that indicated the same,\" he said. \"They've fired or laid off 2,000 of 6,000 (full-time) employees, and they've created a culture of fear and toxicity where they've administered lie detector tests to employees.\"\n\nThe current environment has prompted other senior employees to leave, he said. \"How could they be prepared when they have top-level people leaving en masse? You're losing tons of expertise and knowledge based on the direction they're taking.\"\n\nAlso on June 2, Richardson told staff they were going to scrap a draft strategic plan that had been expected to be released in May and revert back to the strategic plan used last year, Edwards said.\n\nThe budget request put forward by the White House during the last week of May proposed cutting FEMA's budget by almost half from a year earlier.\n\nCarrie Speranza, a disaster executive who serves as president of the USA Council of the International Association of Emergency Managers, said she's hopeful state and local officials can successfully make their case to Congress about the need to restore FEMA's funding.\n\n\"As the shock of grant reductions takes hold, remember this is a budget request. It is NOT the FY 2026 budget,\" Speranza said in a June 2 post on LinkedIn. \"Think of it as the President’s initial negotiation with Congress.\"\n\nThe cuts pose a \"tremendous risk, degrading public safety and national resilience,\" she said. \"My key takeaway?

The panel interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses behind closed doors, including scores of Trump aides who were hardly ever in the headlines.\n\nThe January 6 committee’s report, which came out Thursday, highlights how investigators tracked down little-known insiders – from the Trump campaign to the National Guard to the Republican National Committee – who witnessed key moments and provided critical information to the panel.\n\nOne critical example of the outsize role of little-known figures: The committee’s report mentions an unnamed White House staffer who told Trump around 1:21 p.m. on January 6, 2021, that “they’re rioting down at the Capitol.” This represents one of the first instances of Trump being told directly that the situation was descending into violence.\n\nWith the panel’s report public and witness interview transcripts trickling out on a daily basis, we’re getting a new glimpse into how these obscure figures played big roles in the inquiry. Some of them even provided information that will be useful to the ongoing criminal probes by the Justice Department and state prosecutors in Georgia, who are investigating Trump’s election schemes.\n\nHere are a few lesser-known insiders and what they shared with the committee.\n\nA young RNC staffer who pushed back on bogus voter fraud claims in fundraising pitches\n\nThe committee’s dive into the hundreds of millions of dollars that were made in campaign fundraising off Trump’s bogus election fraud claims includes the story of a young RNC staffer who was fired after he pushed back on some of the assertions being made in fundraising emails.\n\nEthan Katz, who provided testimony to the committee, was an RNC copywriter who made clear to his superiors he was not comfortable with the false claims the Trump campaign and its allies were making after the election, according to the report.\n\nHis direct boss told the committee that she wasn’t sure why Katz was terminated three weeks after the election. However, it came after Katz repeatedly questioned the direction leadership was taking in Republicans’ post-election fundraising messaging.\n\nThe first confrontation – corroborated by multiple witnesses – came in a meeting with the entirety of the Trump digital team, in which Katz grilled a higher-up on how the campaign was saying it wanted to stop the count in several battleground states while keeping it going in another.\n\nIn the second episode in the report, he refused a directive to write an email declaring Trump the winner in Pennsylvania – an email Katz suspected was meant to preempt the election being called for Joe Biden in that state.\n\nAnother copy writer was assigned the task, the report said, and an email falsely declaring a Trump victory in Pennsylvania was sent on November 4.\n\nKatz was one of several lower-level digital staffers who spoke to the committee, shedding light on how the campaign and the RNC tried to walk the line between not putting themselves in potential legal jeopardy by blasting out false claims while exploiting Trump’s fraud narrative for fundraising.\n\nA Trump White House speechwriter who pushed for fake GOP electors early on\n\nAmong the first people the committee identifies as having concocted the fake electors strategy – in which slates of fraudulent Trump electors were put forward as alternatives to Biden electors – is Vince Haley, the deputy assistant to the president for policy, strategy and speechwriting.\n\nTexts and emails that Haley turned over to the committee show how he repeatedly pushed the idea of using illegitimate GOP slates of presidential electors in battleground states to some of Trump’s closest staff members.\n\nSupposed election fraud by Democrats is “only one rationale for slating Trump electors,” Haley told Johnny McEntee, an assistant to Trump, in text messages one week after the 2020 election that he turned over to the January 6 committee.\n\n“We should baldly assert” that state legislators “have the constitutional right to substitute their judgment for a certified majority of their constituents” if that prevents socialism, he said.\n\nThe messages highlight how Trump allies and White House staffers appeared to know that their efforts to overturn the election could be problematic early on but believed they were justified if the plan was successful in keeping Trump in office.\n\nHaley added, “[i]ndependent of the fraud – or really along with that argument – Harrisburg [Pennsylvania], Madison [Wisconsin] and Lansing [Michigan] do not have to sit idly by and submit themselves to rule by Beijing and Paris,” proposing that conservative radio hosts “rally the grassroots to apply pressure to the weak kneed legislators in those states.”\n\nHaley then sent McEntee names and contact information for state legislators in six states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan. Trump later called several of those state officials, according to the report.\n\nLow-profile players in the fake electors plot who are of interest to criminal investigators\n\nTwo not-well-known Trump campaign officials who were already of interest to the Justice Department provided especially helpful testimony to the January 6 committee.\n\nOne of them, Georgia-based staffer Robert Sinners, described how he felt misled by campaign higher-ups about the legal sketchiness around the fake electors plan – evidence that might go to show a corrupt intent.\n\nThe second, Trump campaign associate general counsel Joshua Findlay, described fielding concerns from the activists being recruited to be fake electors and recounted to the committee how the campaign’s core team tried to hand off the scheme to the more fringe Trump lawyers.\n\nFindlay also gave valuable testimony connecting the plot to the former president himself. He told the committee that he was tasked by another campaign official in early December with exploring the feasibility of the plan and that the official conveyed to him that the president wanted the campaign to “look into” the alternative electors proposal.\n\nWhen it was decided that Giuliani would be in charge of the gambit, Findlay was left with the impression that it was because Trump wanted Giuliani to lead it. Findlay testified that Trump campaign leadership backed off the plan a few days after he had been told to look into it, with top lawyers bailing on the idea.\n\nHowever, the campaign’s director of election day operations, Mike Roman, took on a chief operation role in the gambit.\n\nThe role played by Roman – who declined to answer many of committee’s questions in his testimony, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights – was fleshed out by communications handed over to the committee by Sinners. They showed that Roman was organizing information tracking the effort.\n\nSinners told the committee that he would not have participated with the scheme had he known the campaign’s top lawyers were not on board with the plan. He testified that he felt “angry,” according to the report, that “no one really cared if – if people were potentially putting themselves in jeopardy” by doing this, and “we were just … useful idiots or rubes at that point.”\n\nThe Justice Department has been seeking information about Sinners and Findlay. Their committee testimony, along with that of others, showed how the Trump campaign was willing to move forward with the fake electors plot – putting its participants in legal jeopardy – even as its top lawyers sought to distance themselves from the scheme.\n\nAn obscure Trump campaign assistant who gave testimony and documents to the committee\n\nTo get to the heart of what was happening in the White House and Trump campaign war rooms, the committee looked to junior staffers – people who were key observers to the action but didn’t have an orchestrating role.\n\nOne such staffer was Angela McCallum, the national executive assistant on Trump’s reelection campaign.\n\nAfter the election, McCallum was part of the Trump campaign’s operation to contact hundreds of state legislators to ask for their support for efforts to replace state electors.\n\nThough McCallum does not appear to have had a leadership role in the operation, nor was she directly quoted by the committee, footnotes from the report show that she turned over several text messages, campaign spreadsheets and even a script for calling state legislators.\n\nHer insight appears to have given the committee information on the campaign’s outreach efforts to push the fake electors plan. Her notes say that campaign staff tried contacting over 190 Republican state legislators in Arizona, Georgia and Michigan alone.\n\nMcCallum’s text records also show how campaign supervisors viewed the ongoing outreach efforts. In one instance, McCallum provided a text message sent by an operative the committee believes may have brought the fake elector certificates to Washington, based on the message’s photo of the operative in front of the Capitol.\n\n“This has got to be the cover a book I write one day,” the operative, whom the committee could not find to serve a subpoena, said in the message. “I should probably buy [Mike] [R]oman a tie or something for sending me on this one. Hasn’t been done since 1876 and it was only 3 states that did it.”\n\nIn another message, the operative, who was McCallum’s supervisor, celebrated after reporters published a recorded voicemail McCallum left on a state legislators’ phone.\n\n“Honest to god I’m so proud of this” because “[t]hey unwittingly just got your message out there,” the message read, according to the report.\n\nHe continued, telling McCallum that “you used the awesome power of the presidency to scare a state rep into getting a statewide newspaper to deliver your talking points.”\n\nA National Guard colonel whose quick plan to save the Capitol was slowed by bureaucracy\n\nThe long delay in sending National Guard troops to the US Capitol on January 6 was among the most glaring security failures that day. Previously unreported testimony revealed for the first time in the committee’s final report shows that one commander on the ground had his forces ready to respond hours before they were given approval to actually do so.\n\nNational Guard Col. Craig Hunter is not a household name, but as the highest-ranking commander on the ground on January 6, his testimony helped the committee untangle conflicting accounts provided by more senior officials and ultimately arrive at a conclusion about what caused the delayed response.\n\nHunter provided a detailed timeline of his own actions that day, including that he immediately started preparing his troops to respond at around 2 p.m. ET after hearing that shots had reportedly been fired at the US Capitol.\n\n“So, at that point in my mind I said, ‘Okay, then they will be requesting the DC National Guard now, so we have to move,” Hunter told the committee, according to its final report.\n\nWithin the hour, Hunter had a plan in place. Over 100 National Guard troops were already loaded on to buses with their gear, and Hunter informed other responding law enforcement agencies that backup was coming as soon as he got approval from his superiors.\n\n“At 3:10 p.m., Colonel Hunter felt it was time to tell his superiors all that he had done and hopefully get fast approval,” the report says.\n\nBut Hunter was unaware that a looming communications breakdown between senior military leaders – including the acting secretary of Defense and secretary of the Army – would delay approval of his plan for more than three hours.\n\nAt that very moment, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was putting together a redundant plan for transporting those forces to the Capitol and was not aware that he had already been given authority to issue the order himself, the report says.\n\nThe confusion, coupled with a lack of communication between senior military leaders and commanders on the ground, was a key factor in the delayed response, the report says.\n\nIn hindsight, the failures of top military officials are even more glaring considering Hunter had already devised a plan that could have been put into motion hours earlier.\n\nThey also did not occur in a vacuum. Trump could have personally intervened at any time, to hasten and coordinate the military response, but chose not to.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Tierney Sneed Hannah Rabinowitz Marshall Cohen", "Zachary Cohen", "Tierney Sneed", "Hannah Rabinowitz", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/politics/michigan-whitmer-verdict", "title": "Gretchen Whitmer: Jury convicts two men of conspiring to kidnap ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA federal jury on Tuesday found two men guilty of conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020.\n\nAdam Fox and Barry Croft face a maximum sentence of life in prison for the kidnapping conspiracy conviction. They were also convicted of one count of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction.\n\nTheir first trial ended in a mistrial.\n\nProsecutors allege that Fox was the ringleader of a plot to kidnap the Democratic governor from her summer home and Croft was a part of the plan and practiced detonating explosives in preparation.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video appears to show Michigan suspects in training (2020) 03:25 - Source: CNN Video appears to show Michigan suspects in training (2020) 03:25\n\n“There are a lot of things that are complicated today. There’s one thing that’s pretty simple still - kidnapping is wrong. You can’t just strap on an AR-15 and body armor and go snatch the governor. You can’t snatch anybody, and you certainly can’t make bombs that are meant to maim and kill people. And this case is about a plot to abduct Gov. Whitmer. But that wasn’t these defendants ultimate goal,” Prosecutor Nils Kessler said during closing arguments Monday morning.\n\n“They wanted to set off a second American Civil War and the second American Revolution,” Kessler said.\n\nDefense attorneys maintained an entrapment defense, arguing that the FBI coerced the defendants to drive the plot forward through a collection of undercover agents and confidential informants.\n\nFox’s attorney told jurors during closing arguments that he was lured into the scheme by the government’s key witness, a confidential informant called “Big Dan.”\n\n“Adam Fox was not ever predisposed to the crime of kidnapping Gov. Whitmer. He talked a big game but talk is just talk. Adam Fox took no affirmative steps to achieve the ends as Special Agent Chambers and Big Dan pushed so hard to achieve,” Fox’s attorney Christopher Gibbons said.\n\nAn attorney for Croft told the jury Monday that FBI agents lied on the stand about Croft’s participation in an effort to nab him for any crime they could because of his years-long record of extreme anti-government internet chatter.\n\n“Now as we sat here the last couple of weeks together in the trial, the government has shown us time and time again that they don’t care that Barry Croft didn’t actually make an agreement to kidnap the governor. They think it’s enough that some of the things that Barry says scares them,” Croft’s attorney Joshua Blanchard said in court. “They’d like to lock him up in a cage, not because he committed this crime, but because they’re afraid of the things that have come out of his mouth.”\n\nNeither defendant testified in their own defense.\n\nA federal judge declared a mistrial over a hung jury in the first trial for Fox and Croft earlier this year. Two other men acquitted in the first trial, Brandon Caserta and Daniel Harris, ultimately did not testify in the defense case despite being subpoenaed by the defense.\n\nTwo other co-defendants that pleaded guilty before the first trial, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, testified in both trials.\n\nCroft was also convicted Tuesday on an additional weapons possession charge.\n\nDavid Porter, assistant special agent in charge with the FBI Detroit Field Office, said the verdict is a “clear example” that anti-government views do not justify violence.\n\n“Here in America, if you disagree with your government, you have options. You can criticize your government, you can protest, you can vote your elected officials out of office,” Porter told reporters outside the courthouse. “However, what you cannot do is plan or commit acts of violence.

It’s time to start acting,” Jamie Rhome, the National Hurricane Center acting director, told CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray on Monday.\n\nThe sun illuminates hurricane Ian on satellite imagery as it rises Tuesday morning. NOAA\n\nIan made landfall in western Cuba early Tuesday as a Category 3 hurricane with 125 mph winds. “Significant wind and storm surge impacts (are) occurring over western Cuba,” the hurricane center said.\n\nIan’s path takes it off the coast of Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe storm intensified rapidly Monday and is expected to strengthen even more rapidly as it moves into the warmer waters of the Gulf.\n\nRead: Climate change is causing hurricanes to intensify faster than ever\n\nThe crazy thing about this is that the hurricane center forecast this rapid intensification. It has been difficult to predict in the past, but confidence in this storm’s intensity is high.\n\n“The NHC forecast for Ian has shown an unprecedented rate of strengthening from a tropical storm to a powerful hurricane (winds increasing faster than in any previous forecast produced for any other tropical storm) – showing the confidence forecasters have in the potential for explosive growth),” CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nThat confidence is only increasing now that the storm is moving where they expected and at the intensity they expected.\n\nYet, even though we have a better idea of where this storm is going to go – looking at you, Florida – there is still some slight uncertainty about the exact landfall location.\n\nDon’t focus on that middle line shown in the forecast cone here:\n\nAnyone inside the cone is at risk of a landfalling major hurricane, one of last night’s big updates. The hurricane center now says Ian will maintain major hurricane intensity when it hits Florida.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles from the center of Ian. This means that more than 15 million people will likely experience tropical storm-force winds, including all of Tampa metro and other cities such as Orlando, Tallahassee and Jacksonville.\n\nThese are the most likely arrival of tropical storm-force winds:\n\nTuesday afternoon/evening – The Florida Keys\n\nTuesday overnight – Naples\n\nWednesday morning – Tampa\n\nWednesday evening – Orlando\n\nThursday morning – Tallahassee and Jacksonville\n\nStorm surge is a real threat\n\nThe exact location of the hurricane’s landfall will make a dramatic difference in the location of the surge.\n\n“Landfall in the southern part of the cone will take Tampa Bay out of the extreme surge and put Charlotte Harbor in the center of the worst conditions,” CNN meteorologist Chad Myers says. “Landfall to the north of Tampa puts the massive surge right into Tampa Bay.”\n\nWhy coastal communities should fear storm surge\n\nLiterally, 50 miles one way or the other changes everything.\n\nIf it makes landfall north of Tampa, this will push water levels to a height not seen in over 50 years of tide level records in Tampa Bay.\n\n“This is a near worst-case approach angle coming in from the south and west and stalling,” Rhome said.\n\nThat slowing forward momentum will allow for another extreme event to unfold. There are damaging winds in the eyewall and the surge. There is also the potential for flooding rainfalls, said Myers.\n\nThere is “the potential for rainfall totals of 20 to 25 inches as the storm appears to temporarily stall after landfall creating massive rainfall flash flooding,” said Myers.\n\nThe average September brings about 6 inches of rain to the Tampa region.\n\nA broken section of road and destroyed houses are seen in Matlacha, Florida, on Saturday, October 1.

But I’m also mindful that the department must maintain the trust of the people whom we serve.”\n\nOlsen, in a speech at George Mason University’s National Security Institute, announced that the department would pursue a broader strategy to counter not only threats from China but also from Russia, Iran and North Korea. It’s a nuanced change, Olsen told reporters, noting that he agreed with comments recently from FBI Director Christopher Wray, who said that the Chinese government’s activity have become “more brazen, more damaging than ever before.”\n\nThe China Initiative was launched in 2018 under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who early on had decided the intelligence, cyber and repressive threat that China posed to be worse than the Russian threat then dominating the headlines amid the investigation at the time of Russian election interference to aid Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\nThe Justice Department has credited the initiative with some major prosecution victories, including against Chinese spies working to steal US technology. The department’s website lists nearly 60 cases under the initiative ranging from hacking to spying to false statements in grant applications.\n\nBut the initiative also ran into major problems in court, particularly in cases targeting what prosecutors said was grant fraud by university researchers who the government said failed to disclose ties to China.\n\nLast summer, the department was forced to drop charges against a half dozen people who faced charges related to their research grants and what the department said was an attempt to hide ties to China. In Tennessee, a judge dismissed a case against a Chinese Canadian researcher after a jury deadlocked on what prosecutors said was an attempt to defraud the US government.\n\nOlsen, in his speech Wednesday, said his national security prosecutors would more closely supervise cases involving grant fraud, which was the source of many of the complaints about the China initiative. In some cases, instead of criminal prosecution, he said, the department might seek civil or administrative sanctions.\n\nAsian Americans Advancing Justice, an Asian American civil rights group, called the end of the China initiative “an important step towards ending the cyclical and historic racial profiling of Asian Americans and immigrants.”\n\nAnd Zhengyu Huang, president of Committee of 100, a group of prominent Chinese Americans, said in a statement: “The China Initiative is a failed program that has fueled racial animosity, xenophobia, and suspicion towards the AAPI community and Chinese Americans in particular.”\n\n“Today’s announcement is an important step forward, but much more work needs to be done to ensure that all cases being prosecuted are based solely on evidence and not on perception.”\n\nOlsen also highlighted recent Justice Department charges to show how prosecutors would redirect their efforts to broader threats. He noted charges against government officials from Belarus for using a false bomb threat to divert a passenger aircraft in order to arrest a prominent dissident, and charges against Iranian intelligence agents for plotting to kidnap a US-based journalist and human rights activist.\n\nOlsen took pains to say that while he is ending the China Initiative, he doesn’t believe prosecutors and agents were acting with bias in cases that have run into trouble. But ending the initiative may not be embraced by some national security hawks, who believe the Biden administration has eased off the focus on threats from China.\n\nWray, in his January speech, appeared to stake out a prebuttal position against any effort to soften the focus on China.\n\n“There is no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, our innovation and our economic security than China,” Wray said, speaking at the Ronald Reagan Library.\n\nThe FBI echoed Wray’s comments in a statement later on Wednesday saying, “No government poses a broader, more severe threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than the government of China does,” and vowing that it “will remain relentless countering the Chinese government in the long fight already underway. “\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Wednesday.", "authors": ["Evan Perez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-hack-russian-ransomware-gang", "title": "'I can fight with a keyboard': How one Ukrainian IT specialist ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAs Russian artillery began raining down on his homeland last month, one Ukrainian computer researcher decided to fight back the best way he knew how – by sabotaging one of the most formidable ransomware gangs in Russia.\n\nFour days into Russia’s invasion, the researcher began publishing the biggest leak ever of files and data from Conti, a syndicate of Russian and Eastern Europe cybercriminals wanted by the FBI for conducting attacks on hundreds of US organizations and causing millions of dollars in losses.\n\nThe thousands of internal documents and communications include evidence that appears to suggest Conti operatives have contacts within the Russian government, including the FSB intelligence service. That supports a longstanding US allegation that Moscow has colluded with cybercriminals for strategic advantage.\n\nThe Ukrainian computer specialist behind the leak spoke exclusively to CNN and described his motivation for seeking revenge after Conti operatives published a statement in support of the Russian government immediately after the invasion of Ukraine. He also described his desperate efforts to track down loved ones in Ukraine in recent weeks.\n\nTo protect his identity, CNN agreed to refer to him by a pseudonym: Danylo.\n\n“I cannot shoot anything, but I can fight with a keyboard and mouse,” Danylo told CNN.\n\nService members of pro-Russian troops drive armoured vehicles past local residents in the course of Ukraine-Russia conflict in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine March 24, 2022. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nThe trove of data Danylo leaked in late February illustrates why cybersecurity has been such a fraught issue in US-Russia relations. It includes cryptocurrency accounts the Conti hackers used to allegedly reap millions of dollars in ransom payments, their discussions of how to extort US companies and their apparent targeting of a journalist investigating the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny.\n\nBut it also shows how hard it can be to disable ransomware operations. Despite Danylo unmasking their operations, the hackers continue to announce new victim organizations.\n\nDanylo, who has worked as a cybersecurity researcher for years and studied the underground cybercriminal economy in Europe, is just one vigilante in a shadow war that has emerged between hackers and cybersecurity executives who have pledged support for the Ukrainian and Russian governments as the biggest land war in Europe since World War II drags on.\n\nBut by disrupting a group as notorious as Conti, Danylo has gained more attention than others. The FBI, Danylo said, contacted him after he began to leak the Conti files, asking him to stop leaking.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment.\n\nFirefighters work to extinguish a fire at a warehouse after it was hit by Russian shelling on March 28, 2022 in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\nCNN corroborated Danylo’s claim that he was the leaker by reviewing evidence that he had access to the Twitter account that was publishing the Conti data, as well as a website that Danylo and another person, who was granted anonymity for their protection, were using to share data contained in the leaks.\n\nDanylo hasn’t spoken with the media about his motives – until now. He did so while navigating a war-ravaged country he had only recently returned to and could hardly recognize.\n\n“It’s my country,” he said in a phone interview. “If they [the Ukrainian government] provide me weapons, OK, I’ll go fight. But I’m better at typing.”\n\nDigital retribution\n\nDanylo claims that he first gained access to computer systems used by what would become the Conti syndicate in 2016. Though he declined to explain in detail how he did this, independent security experts have verified to CNN the dataset belongs to the hackers. (Conti is both the name of malicious software and the cybercriminal syndicate that uses it. The group is also affiliated with TrickBot, another hacking tool used in numerous ransomware attacks.)\n\n“Sometimes they make mistakes,” Danylo said, referring to ransomware groups. “You need to catch them when they make a mistake. I just was in the right place at the right time. I was monitoring them.”\n\nFor years, Danylo said, he quietly lurked on the hackers’ computer servers and would pass along information on the group’s operations to European law enforcement officials.\n\nConti ransomware has been rampant in the last two years, with the hackers claiming numerous victims a week.\n\nIn September 2020, the hackers claimed to have stolen case files from a district court in Louisiana. In March 2021, Conti ransomware was used in a hack that hobbled the computer networks of Ireland’s $25 billion public health system, disrupting a maternity ward in Dublin.\n\nThe dark work was lucrative: hackers using the Conti ransomware received at least $25.5 million in ransom payments in the span of just four months in 2021, according to Elliptic, a firm that tracks cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nCollapsed building is seen as civilians are evacuated along humanitarian corridors from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol under the control of Russian military and pro-Russian separatists, on March 26, 2022.

The cybersecurity researcher grew up in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union. He didn’t want to see it slip back into Russian hands.\n\nConti members tried to walk their statement back, claiming they weren’t supporting any government, but Danylo had heard enough.\n\nAsked again why he dumped the Conti data, Danylo said with a laugh: “To prove that they are motherf**kers.” He was exhausted from a long day navigating military checkpoints in Ukraine, on the hunt for cigarettes and looking to the sky for signs of the next air raid.\n\nConti is exactly the type of prolific ransomware group that President Joe Biden last year exhorted Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring to heel amid a spate of attacks on US critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Kremlin appeared to dangle the prospect of collaborating with the US to combat cybercrime this January, when the Russian FSB intelligence agency announced the arrest of multiple accused cybercriminals. But the chances of bilateral cooperation on cybercrime have dimmed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has killed more than 1,000 civilians, according to the United Nations, and made Putin an international pariah.\n\nCivilians trapped in Mariupol city under Russian attacks, are evacuated in groups under the control of pro-Russian separatists, through other cities, in Mariupol, Ukraine on March 20, 2022. Stringer/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nAfter he started leaking the data, Danylo said, an FBI special agent contacted him and asked him to stop. Exposing Conti infrastructure could, in theory, make it more difficult for the FBI to track the group because it might set up new computer systems.\n\nDanylo has stopped leaking for now. But he says he still has access to some Conti computer systems.\n\nAt least one law enforcement official who spoke to CNN would have preferred that Danylo had maintained that covert access, rather than alert the ransomware syndicate to his presence by leaking the data.\n\n“Publicly releasing information like [the leaker did] is reckless,” a US law enforcement official told CNN. “Working cooperatively with law enforcement can achieve a more substantial and lasting impact in disrupting the operations of groups like Conti.”\n\nBut John Fokker, a former cybercrime investigator with the Dutch police, said the leak could actually be useful to cops chasing cyber crooks.\n\n“Yes, infrastructure can be burned. However, the amount of data provided in the leaks make me confident that law enforcement got the information they need to write indictments on key individuals,” said Fokker, who works closely with European law enforcement as head of cyber investigations at security firm Trellix.\n\nA catalog of misdeeds\n\nThe Conti leaks are a startling catalog of the alleged misdeeds of a multimillion-dollar criminal enterprise.\n\nCNN evaluated and translated the original cache of documents that Danylo shared with the world via Twitter.\n\nThe communications show Conti members, each going by aliases in the chat logs, discussing the wisdom of extorting US small businesses, seemingly refraining from hacking Russian targets, and taking an interest in a journalist writing about Navalny, the Russian opposition figure who has been jailed and poisoned.\n\nIn April 2021, Conti members “mango” and “johnyboy77” discussed plans to access files belonging to a journalist for investigative outlet Bellingcat, which had published a joint investigation with CNN in December 2020 on the alleged role of the Russia’s FSB intelligence agency in the poisoning of Navalny.\n\n“Bro, don’t forget about Navalny, I flagged it to the boss – he’s waiting for details,” mango wrote to johnyboy77 in Russian.\n\nIt’s unclear who “the boss” is in this exchange. But Christo Grozev, Bellingcat’s lead Russian investigator, tweeted that the leaked chat corroborated an anonymous tip that Bellingcat received stating that a “‘global cyber crime group acting on an FSB order has hacked one of your contributors.’”\n\nConti operatives refer in their chats to Liteyny Avenue in St. Petersburg, which happens to be home to local FSB offices, according to Kimberly Goody, director of cyber crime analysis at security firm Mandiant.\n\n“Generally speaking, it would be relatively unsurprising to learn that an operation as extensive as this would not in some way be leveraged as an asset [by the Russian government] at a point in time,” Goody told CNN.\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman stands among debris after shelling in a residential area in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 18. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The Russian government has long denied accusations that it turns a blind eye to cybercrime.\n\nThere also appears to be a correlation between the Conti leaks and public warnings from US cybersecurity officials, suggesting that federal authorities have been closely watching the group.\n\nOn October 26, 2020, as US hospitals continued to reel from coronavirus cases, a Conti member with the alias Troy wrote to another member in Russian: “F**k clinics in the USA this week … There will be panic. 428 hospitals.”\n\nTwo days later the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a dire warning about ransomware attacks on hospitals, many of which used a piece of malicious software that the leaked documents tie to Conti operatives. It was unclear what specific intelligence prompted the federal warning about the hospitals, but the timing was striking.\n\n‘It’s my work’\n\nCyberattacks have played a supporting role in the war in Ukraine. The White House has accused the Russian GRU military intelligence agency of knocking key Ukrainian government websites offline prior to the invasion. (A charge the Kremlin denies.) US officials are also investigating a hack of a satellite network serving parts of Ukraine, which occurred as the Russian invasion began, as a potential Russian state-sponsored hack, CNN previously reported.\n\nFor its part, the Ukrainian government has encouraged an “IT army” of volunteer hackers in Ukraine and abroad to conduct cyberattacks on Russian organizations.\n\nIn the free-for-all that is Ukrainian cyberspace, combatants like Danylo engage on their own terms.\n\nAn aerial view of the completely destroyed shopping mall after a Russian shelling in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 21, 2022.

Another person in the bunker was mystified that he was focused on his computer amid the shelling.\n\n“What the f**k are you doing?” Danylo recalled the person asking him.\n\nDanylo laughed nervously as he told the story. “It’s my work,” he told CNN. “[I do it] because I can.”\n\nAfter weeks of living the war, Danylo told CNN he slipped safely out of Ukraine with his laptop this week.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/history-refocused", "title": "History Refocused | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThese are the surprising and personal stories, lost and hidden in America’s past, hosted by CNN’s Abby Phillip, Suzanne Malveaux, Omar Jimenez, Athena Jones, Ryan Young, John Avlon and more.

They had gathered there expecting a celebratory speech on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s surrender to Ulysses S. Grant just two days earlier.\n\nBut that evening, Lincoln’s speech was about Reconstruction, readmitting Louisiana into the Union and a proposal for “giving the benefit of public schools equally to Black and White, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the colored man.”\n\nPlantation-owning elites, Southern Democrats and White supremacists, however, would not easily concede political power to those who had so recently been their slaves. That evening among the crowd of listeners was an enraged John Wilkes Booth, who would go on to assassinate the President just three days later at Ford’s Theatre.\n\nFor decades after Lincoln’s death, White supremacists would wage a war of intimidation, murder and massacre on anyone, Black or White, who dared covet a share of their power. Yet, Black people persisted.\n\nAnd between 1865 and 1880, over 1,500 Black men took political office; most not for long, as their efforts were cut down by mobs of violent White men.\n\n1868 Louisiana - African Americans participated in Constitutional Conventions like this across the South where delegates argued over Union demands, drew up new laws and elected new leadership.\n\nOscar James Dunn was one of those determined men. He became the country’s first Black lieutenant governor in Louisiana in 1868 serving under Henry Clay Warmoth on the Republican ticket. Dunn’s first legislative address showed hope and restraint:\n\n“As to myself and my people, we are not seeking social equality. That is a thing no law can govern,” said Dunn. “We simply ask to be allowed an equal chance in the race of life.”\n\nOscar Dunn died mysteriously in office only four years later…\n\nThe story continues…\n\nConnecting a history of racial violence to Black homeownership CNN\n\nBy Channon Hodge, Breeanna Hare, Tami Luhby and CNN Staff\n\nAs the Civil War neared its end, Union General William Sherman had been convinced that newly emancipated slaves needed their own land to secure their freedom. He issued Special Field Order No. 15, setting aside 400,000 coastal acres of land for Black families and stating that, “…no white person whatever, unless military officers and soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside.” A provision was added later for mules.\n\nIn three months, the potential of Sherman’s order vanished with a single shot. That April, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and in the fall President Andrew Johnson reversed Sherman’s order, allowing Confederate planters to regain the land. It demonstrated a ruthless appropriation that would be repeated for decades to come.\n\nStill, Black Americans created pockets of wealth during the Reconstruction years and into the early 20th century. Yet where Black Americans created a refuge, White Americans pushed back through political maneuvering and violence.\n\n“We estimate that there were upwards of 100 massacres that took place between the end of the Civil War and the 1940s,” says William Darity Jr., a Duke University economist who co-authored “From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century,” with writer and folklorist A. Kirsten Mullen. “And they take place North and South, East and West.”\n\nWe looked back through research and news clippings, paying particular attention to around 50 racially charged incidents between 1863 and 1923 when people of color lost property or economic opportunity. The events highlighted here reveal how acts of racial violence of different scope played out across the country and targeted various ethnicities. Historians then helped us examine how and why they had occurred and where we still see the impact today…\n\nThe story continues here…\n\nMay 17th, 1954 - A student-led strike, and the repurcussions of Brown V.

Berryman Jr. was 11 years old when the Supreme Court handed down the landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, which made racial segregation in public schools illegal.\n\nBut supervisors in Prince Edward County, Virginia, where Berryman was attending public school, had no intention of complying. Five years later, in 1959, as Berryman was looking ahead to attending 7th grade, the county shuttered all public schools and opened a private school – for White children only. It would take five years, an intervention by the Department of Justice and another Supreme Court order, before integrated public schooling in Prince Edward County proceeded.\n\nAround the same time, in North Carolina, Dr. E.B. Palmer was working as the executive secretary of state for the North Carolina Teachers Association, advocating for Black teachers after Brown was decided.\n\n“When the school system said ‘separate but equal,’ that was fine,” Palmer recalled to CNN. “But when we moved a little further, they tried to say, ‘We don’t want Black teachers teaching White students.’”\n\nNearly 40,000 teaching positions held by Black teachers in 17 southern and border states would be lost in the ensuring years, according to Samuel B.

Voter intimidation complaints were filed and sent to the Department of Justice.\n\nBut on the pro-Trump internet, plans for this sort of thing had been brewing for months.\n\nA movie released in May alleges without evidence that drop boxes were the scene of mass widespread voter fraud in 2020, enough to steal the election from former President Donald Trump. The film, called “2,000 Mules,” tries to use cell phone geolocation data and surveillance video to allege so-called “mules” stuffed drop boxes with the ballots.\n\nThe claims in the movie have been thoroughly debunked by election and cyber experts. Former US Attorney General William Barr referenced the movie when he told the House Select Committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol that he doesn’t believe the election was stolen.\n\n“I haven’t seen anything since the election that changes my mind on that, including the ‘2,000 Mules’ movie,” Barr said in his testimony.\n\nBut still, the lie persists.\n\n“If you talk to people who don’t believe that the election was fair in 2020, nine times out of 10 one of the first things they’re going to bring up is ’2000 Mules,’” said Garrett Archer, data analyst with ABC15 in Arizona and formerly a senior elections analyst with the Arizona secretary of state.\n\nThe movie uses cherry-picked surveillance footage and misused geolocation data to try to present a convincing case of widespread voter fraud. A lot of it focuses on alleged fraud in Georgia, but an investigator from the Republican-led Georgia secretary of state’s office said in May he had tracked down some people who had been accused of being mules by a group associated with the movie and he found they had voted legally.\n\nOver on Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, people inspired by the movie began organizing to watch drop boxes to ensure the alleged widespread fraud that they falsely believe occurred in 2020 didn’t happen in 2022.\n\nA group calling itself “Clean Elections USA” popped up, organized by a woman named Melody Jennings who said she was inspired by “2,000 Mules.”\n\nSpeaking to Steve Bannon on his radio show, Jennings said, “Really what inspired me was the idea of ‘2,000 Mules,’” adding, that when she saw trailers for the movie she decided to begin organizing to watch vote drop boxes.\n\nWhen drop boxes opened in Maricopa County, Arizona, in October, Jennings posted on Truth Social that she had volunteers watching them. Later, when news broke of men in tactical gear at one of the drop boxes, she posted again, writing, “I am not responsible for individual’s decisions. We are all unique and make plenty as adults. Still a free country last time I checked. Whether I agree or disagree with individuals in how they walk out their patriotism, if they are law abiding, it’s not my call or yours. Optically I don’t love it.”\n\nLawsuits over voter intimidation\n\nJennings and her group Clean Elections USA have been the target of legal challenges attempting to stop alleged voter intimidation at drop boxes.\n\nLast week, the Arizona chapter of the League of Women Voters filed a lawsuit in federal court targeting groups and individuals, including Jennings, that they say are conspiring to intimidate voters in Arizona through a coordinated effort known as “Operation Drop Box.”\n\nIn the lawsuit, the League argues that the conduct of people who have been monitoring drop boxes in Yavapai and Maricopa Counties is part of an “escalating scheme of voter intimidation and harassment in Arizona” that undermines the rights of voters to cast their ballots “free from intimidation, threats or coercion.”\n\nThe Justice Department on Monday filed a brief advising the court that the lawsuit’s allegations “raise serious concerns of voter intimidation,” adding that “vigilante ballot security efforts” and “private campaigns to video record voters” likely violate the federal Voting Rights Act.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge in Arizona imposed new restrictions on Clean Elections USA, blocking members from openly carrying guns or wearing body armor within 250 feet of drop boxes and speaking to or yelling at voters dropping off their ballots in the state. The group is also banned from photographing or filming any voters at the drop boxes or from posting similar images.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Arizona voter says they were intimidated trying to vote.

See surveillance video 02:29\n\nThe order expires in two weeks, covering the remainder of the election season. It came just four days after the judge ruled the other way in a related case brought by an association for retirees and an organization for Latino voters, declining to issue an order restricting the drop box stakeouts.\n\nAt the time, District Judge Michael Liburdi, who is overseeing the litigation, had said there were legitimate concerns about the conduct but there wasn’t enough evidence at that stage to restrict anyone’s First Amendment rights.\n\nDehumanizing\n\nSome have taken issue with how the movie calls voters shown in the film “mules.” Bill Gates, a Republican and chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, said using a term like “mules” is dehumanizing and can lead to violence.\n\nThe word mule is often associated with the transportation of illegal drugs. “They’ve dehumanized folks with this term ‘mule,’” Gates said, “these are people who are going to vote, they’re exercising their right to vote in democracy.”\n\n“This dehumanization that’s going on in our political discourse right now is very dangerous because it does justify the use of violence,” Gates said.\n\nGates himself was the target of conspiracy theories and harassment for his role in calling out lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Sharing a name with the founder of Microsoft who is also a target of conspiracy theories didn’t help the matter.\n\nA lifelong Republican, Gates blames his GOP colleagues for promoting lies.\n\n“What did people think the reaction was going to be? When literally hundreds of Republican elected officials started to attack the election system, they voted to de-certify the election in 2020. They all thought this was a game,” he said.\n\nTrue the Vote\n\nAmong the most important groups in the myriad of those pushing election lies is True the Vote. It’s the group that provided the data for the “2,000 Mules” movie that it alleges shows mass voter fraud.\n\nTrue the Vote, a conservative nonprofit, also provided data to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation in 2021, but the agency concluded that there wasn’t “any other kind of evidence” that tied the provided cell phone and geolocation data to ballot harvesting.\n\n“[F]or example, there are no statements of witnesses and no names of any potential defendants to interview,” said a September 2021 letter from GBI Director Vic Reynold to the Georgia Republican Party and True the Vote. “As it exists, the data, while curious, does not rise to the level of probable cause that a crime has been committed,” the letter said.\n\nAt a public meeting in May, which discussed several claims of voter fraud, Georgia State Election Board member Edward Lindsey, urged people who bring forth allegations to allow an investigation to take place before publishing those allegations.\n\n“I would like for folks who are simply doing, exercising their right to vote and exercising the right of their family to vote, not to have allegations thrown about them,” he said.\n\nLast month, the Arizona attorney general’s office asked for a federal investigation related to potential violations of the Internal Revenue Code by True the Vote.\n\nAn investigator in Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office, Reginald Grigsby, said in a letter that the group “raised considerable sums of money alleging they had evidence of widespread voter fraud” but has failed to provide any evidence to its office, despite publicly indicating they had shared the information with law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn a statement, True the Vote called the Arizona attorney general letter “false” and said it “smacks of retribution for the AG’s own decision to ignore suspicious voting activity.”\n\nTwo leaders of True the Vote were jailed this week after a federal judge in Texas found them in contempt of court. The group’s president Catherine Engelbrecht and onetime board member Gregg Phillips were taken into custody Monday after defying a court order to reveal more details in a civil case about one of their controversial attempts to uncover supposed fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAn attorney for Engelbrecht, Phillips and True the Vote referred CNN to a statement from the group which said that Engelbrecht and Phillips would be held in jail, “until we agree to give up the name of a person we believe was not covered under the terms” of the judge’s order.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Geneva Sands", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Geneva Sands"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/health/how-to-strengthen-intuition-wellness", "title": "Your intuition is real and here's how to strengthen it | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.”\n\nCNN —\n\nMany high performers across sports, business and the arts will tell you they swear by their intuitive sense. It allows them to make decisions, often in a split second, without overthinking and missing opportunities.\n\nLook at baseball players. With the average fastball in Major League Baseball pitched at speeds greater than 90 mph, a hitter has no more than 150 milliseconds, which is literally the blink of an eye, to decide whether to swing. What’s more, the ball is effectively invisible to the batter for the last 10 feet of its journey and in hitting range for a mere 10 milliseconds. Never mind the added complexity of hitting a round ball with a round bat with just the right amount of power and precision.\n\nYet New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge recently broke the American League baseball record in a single season with a whopping 62 home runs. Sure, there is preparation and skill involved, but without some intuitive sense, how else did Judge seemingly defy physics in this complex, lightning-fast set of steps?\n\nFor athletes like Judge, knowing when and how to make the right moves seems to come naturally and, to a certain extent, science confirms that it does.\n\nBut science also confirms that intuition is not simply a special sense possessed by special people, like record-breaking athletes, according to a 2016 study.\n\nIntuition is something we all possess and can strengthen to inform everyday decision-making. Read on to learn why and how.\n\nIntuitive thinking is rooted in neuroscience\n\nAccording to Max Newlon, president of the Harvard Innovation Lab-incubated company BrainCo, which develops products based on brain-machine interface tech, the human brain possesses two distinct thinking modes: analytical and intuitive. These are often referred to as left-brain and right-brain thinking, respectively, because that is where research has shown the different styles of thinking take place, he said.\n\n“Depending on the task, different thinking systems work more effectively. Intuitive right-brain thinking is characterized as more feeling-oriented, creative and bigger-picture thinking,” he added.\n\nNewlon shared the example of someone deciding to buy a house: “A person acting intuitively will affirm their decision with statements about liking the feel of the space, envisioning themselves living there and imagining that their extended family will feel at home when they visit. Conversely, an analytical decision maker will focus on things like the quality of the schools, time and distance commuting to work and overall financial deal.”\n\nBut how about those on-the-spot business decisions CEOs make from the hot seat, or the split-second moves of professional athletes?\n\n“The ability to make quick, intuitive decisions is based on creating and cultivating self-trust,” said Dr. Dehra Harris, assistant director of applied performance research for the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nDeveloping your inner voice, Harris noted, is an ongoing process requiring two steps:\n\n1. Learn to listen to yourself.\n\n2. Engage in a regular reflection process.\n\nStart with a moment of quiet and observe the different voices in your head, advised Harris, a former assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.\n\n“You’ll generally hear two voices. One is fear-based, associated with the racing, looping thoughts, while the other is more quiet and true to your nature,” Harris explained. “The best way to identify them is by noticing how they make you feel. Your inner voice will always calm you, even in the face of big tasks, while your fear-based voice will increase the overwhelm.”\n\nSecondly, Harris noted that listening to your inner voice isn’t a flawless system. She suggested weekly reflection on results.\n\n“It may seem counterintuitive to review intuitive decision-making but if some of the outcomes weren’t successful, there needs to be a strategy shift. Remember that intuition is drawing from a well of accumulated experience and knowledge.”\n\nAllowing your imaginative right brain to flow during meditation could help improve the accuracy of your intuition, according to mind-body coach Dana Santas. Daisy Daisy/Adobe Stock\n\nAlbert Einstein once noted, “Intuition is nothing but the outcome of earlier intellectual experience.” Newlon agreed but took it a step further, suggesting that intuition is not only the result of pattern recognition from the cumulation of your experiences but potentially “from millennia of evolution.”\n\nPractice makes progress\n\nActively working on your intuition and having a daily practice of trusting it will strengthen it — even in the face of stress. “Stress decreases brain resources for decision-making so it helps to go to a skill you’ve already actively applied and been working on for a more reliable result,” Harris said.\n\nAs we consider the ability to strengthen intuitive decision-making with practice, let’s take another look at Aaron Judge. Not only did he beat the home-run record, but he also stole 16 bases in the same season, breaking his personal record. In fact, up until August 9, he was 100% accurate, with 13 for 13 on base-stealing attempts, which is another improbable feat.\n\nWas it coincidence that Judge’s home-run and base-stealing success increased simultaneously? Or was it partially due to regular practice and confidence in his ability to make accurate, split-second intuitive decisions?\n\nAs your analytical mind ponders this, consider that there is very little physical correlation between hitting and base stealing.\n\nTo see if regular practice can improve the strength and accuracy of your own intuitive “hits,” try these three exercises:\n\n1. Breathe into presence\n\nAs a mind-body coach in pro sports, I’ve had the privilege to work with Judge on his breathing and help him integrate a breathing practice into his training regimen. Because your breath is always happening in the present moment, it’s your strongest connection to the here and now, releasing you from thoughts of past or future. In a present state, it’s easier to hear your inner voice. Try this 5-7-3 breathing practice to quiet your own mind, so you can better listen to your intuition.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This 90-second deep breathing exercise will help relieve stress 03:32 - Source: CNN This 90-second deep breathing exercise will help relieve stress 03:32\n\n2. Practice right-brain meditations\n\nRather than trying to keep your mind blank during meditation, try focusing your attention on allowing your imaginative right brain to flow without the judgment of your analytical mind. A good exercise for this would be to consider a question or choice and let your meditative imagination take you through a possible positive outcome. If playing out a decision is too difficult to do without your analytical mind interfering, Harris suggested focusing on a favorite song and letting your imagination take you to whatever experiences that song conjures for you.\n\n3. Play with creative tools\n\nDon’t be afraid to get creative in your attempts to be more creative. You don’t have to be an artist, writer or psychic to play with tools that allow you to tap your intuitive right brain. You can try free-form sketching, use storytelling cards as creative writing prompts or affirmation cards for intention setting.\n\n“Working with whatever practice that helps you to actively use your intuitive brain can be very valuable, and sometimes, even more so, when we strip away the mystique and look at them rationally,” Newlon said.\n\nNow that you’re empowered with the understanding and means to strengthen your intuition, why not begin seeing where your inner voice leads?", "authors": ["Dana Santas"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}]}

Are you an insecure 12-year-old?\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nNothing says indomitable warrior quite like, “I’m afraid of this boat’s name.”\n\nA true warrior would be familiar with American history and would know that Milk served as a U.S. Navy operations officer on rescue submarines during the Korean War, then went on to become the first openly gay man elected to public office in California. He was serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors when he and the city’s mayor were assassinated in 1978.\n\nMilk served in the Korean War and earned his place in history\n\nA true warrior would recognize that U.S. service members throughout history have proudly served, fought and died for the rights of all Americans to speak and live freely.\n\nA true warrior would be appalled to read the statement Milk’s nephew Stuart Milk, who chairs the Harvey Milk Foundation, had to release in response to Hegseth’s pathetic renaming plan, saying of the slain activist: “His legacy has stood as a proud and bright light for the men and women who serve in our nation's military – including those who have served on the USNS Harvey Milk – and a reminder that no barriers of race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or physical infirmity will restrain their human spirit.”\n\nHegseth apparently sees US Navy ship names as 'woke'\n\nThe New York Times reported that there are other ships named after civil rights leaders that might be renamed under Hegseth’s feeble leadership. The names include Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Harriet Tubman and Cesar Chavez.\n\nMake no mistake that behind these decisions is an administration limply fighting back against any incursion on the power of straight, White men, wholly unaware that people with real power don’t need to exert their will on others.\n\nAnnouncing that you’re stripping the name of a gay rights activist from a Navy ship at the start of Pride Month is, of course, a transparent provocation.\n\nTo insecure, whiny, entitled men who spend their days listening to other insecure, whiny, entitled men, it’s a show of strength. It’s something they can smirk about as they exchange awkward high fives.\n\nHegseth and others in the Trump administration don't know true strength\n\nBut that’s not strength. It’s not a “warrior ethos.” Heck, it’s not even an ethos. It’s just a bunch of unconfident losers trying to push others down to make themselves feel tall.\n\nIf Harvey Milk’s name is scrubbed from a Navy ship, it won’t alter his legacy. His name, decades upon decades from now, will still echo in the pages of history, the hearts of students of civil rights and the mind of any soldier with a true warrior ethos.\n\nPete Hegseth's name, on the other hand, will prompt only one response: “Who’s that?

He resigned four years later after being officially questioned about his sexuality, according to the Harvey Milk Foundation.\n\nMilk moved to San Francisco in 1972, where he eventually became involved in politics. After several failed candidacies for roles in local office, Mayor George Moscone appointed Milk to the city’s Board of Permit Appeals, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States, according to the Milk Foundation.\n\nA year after Milk won election to the city's board of supervisors, he and Moscone were assassinated by a disgruntled former city supervisor.\n\nMilk was posthumously recognized for his work advocating for the LGBTQ+ community. A statue of Milk sits in San Francisco City Hall's rotunda, and a terminal in the city's airport is also named after him. In 2009, President Barack Obama awarded him the Medal of Freedom.\n\nWhat is the USNS Harvey Milk? Navy ship is named after gay rights leader\n\nIn 2016, the Navy announced it would be naming a tanker after Milk as part of the John Lewis class of oilers, named after the late Georgia congressman.\n\nThe U.S. Naval Ship Harvey Milk, which is identified by hull No. T-AO 206, was christened in 2021. After successfully completing acceptance trials, the ship was delivered to the Navy in 2023.\n\nIt's unclear when the tanker will be officially renamed. A U.S. official told Reuters it would not be surprising if additional ships in the John Lewis class were renamed, since others also honor civil rights leaders.\n\nStuart Milk, Harvey Milk's nephew and the executive chair of the Harvey Milk Foundation, said in a statement on social media that the organization is \"heartbroken\" to hear of the possible renaming.\n\n\"His legacy has stood as a proud and bright light for the men and women who serve in our nation's military – including those who have served on the USNS Harvey Milk – and a reminder that no barriers of race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or physical infirmity will restrain their human spirit,\" the statement said.\n\nDefense Department pushes to cut diversity, equity, inclusion programs\n\nThe potential renaming of the USNS Harvey Milk would mark the Defense Department's latest move to cut diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the military.\n\nHegseth nixed identity month celebrations, such as Black History Month and Pride Month, at the Defense Department.\n\nIn March, the department pulled down and then scrambled to restore websites on military achievements by veterans such as Jackie Robinson and information on the Navajo Code Talkers.\n\nAt military schools around the world, the department has also pulled books from shelves, barred courses and defunded student clubs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also vocally pushed to abolish diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

The U.S. Park Police said it would fence off an iconic park in a gay neighborhood in Washington, D.C., which is the host city for this year's WorldPride. The FBI solicited tips on medical providers offering gender-affirming care. The president vowed to cut funds to California after it allowed a transgender athlete to compete in a high school track event.\n\nPride celebrations happened long before they were recognized by the federal government, commemorating the Stonewall riots in June 1969, a seminal moment in the birth of a national gay rights movement.\n\nThe federal government first honored Pride Month on the 30th anniversary of Stonewall in 1999 under President Bill Clinton.\n\nUnder the next two Democratic administrations, the federal government recognized June as Pride Month, raising the rainbow flag at some government buildings and highlighting the contributions of LGBTQ+ people. Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump did not recognize it. But this year, the Trump administration stepped up its position, giving the month a new moniker and trumpeting policies that advocates see as “bullying.”\n\n“These attacks on our community as we gather, both in protest and joy and love, will only energize our community and allies to be more visible and engaged,” said Cathy Renna, communications director, National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund. “The country knows this is bullying – plain and simple.”\n\nTrump, like Bush, declined to issue Pride Month proclamations. However, this term, the president's rancor against policies that uplift LGBTQ+ rights appears amplified. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on June 3 that Trump had “no plans” to recognize June as Pride Month. She added, “The president is very proud to be a president for all Americans, regardless of race, religion or creed.”\n\nHere are some of the recent actions the administration has taken in June.\n\nRemoving LGBTQ+ icon Harvey Milk's name from Navy ship\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the U.S. Navy to rename an oil tanker named for slain LGBTQ+ icon San Francisco leader Harvey Milk.\n\nMilk, a civil rights activist and Navy veteran, is frequently cited as the first openly gay elected official in the United States. Milk was pushed out of the Navy in the mid-1950s because of his sexual orientation.\n\nHe won a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. The following year, Milk was assassinated in City Hall along with the city's progressive mayor, George Moscone.\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told USA TODAY Hegseth \"is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief’s priorities, our nation’s history, and the warrior ethos.\"\n\nStuart Milk, executive chair of Harvey Milk Foundation and nephew of Milk, said he was \"heartbroken\" to hear the Pentagon's recommendation.\n\n\"Harvey Milk's legacy is certainly enhanced and celebrated by a U.S. Naval Ship, however, his legacy will not be silenced or diminished by the renaming of that Naval ship,\" he wrote.\n\nJennifer Pike Bailey, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, called the move political.\n\n“At a time when this country faces national security threats from all angles, it's a disgrace that our Secretary of Defense is wasting time and taxpayer dollars on a desperate attempt to divide our country and politicize our military,” she said.\n\nEducation Department announces ‘Title IX Month’\n\nOn June 2, the Education Department announced the administration would honor June as “Title IX Month” as it seeks to “reverse” the Biden Administration rule redefining sex to include “gender identity” and enshrining protections of transgender people.\n\nRepublican lawmakers roundly criticized the Biden rule when it was introduced last year, saying it would effectively force women to “share bathrooms, locker rooms, and other private spaces with biological males” and allow people assigned male at birth to compete in women’s sports, both arguments that have become prevalent among Trump administration officials.\n\n“June will now be dedicated to commemorating women and celebrating their struggle for, and achievement of, equal educational opportunity,” the U.S. Department of Education announced in a statement.\n\nThe department also directed its Office of Civil Rights to launch investigations into the University of Wyoming and Jefferson County Public Schools in Colorado for “allegedly allowing males to join and live in female-only intimate and communal spaces.” The government appeared to be referencing transgender women and girls in both instances.\n\n“Title IX provides women protections on the basis of sex in all educational activities, which include their rights to equal opportunity in sports and sex-segregated intimate spaces, including sororities and living accommodations,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.\n\nRenna, of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said renaming the month “simply reinforces\" the administration’s \"anti-trans agenda.”\n\nDOJ threatens fines after California lets transgender athlete compete\n\nOn May 31, a 16-year-old transgender athlete competed and placed first in two events at the California State Track & Field Championship. Trump responded to the news with threats of “large scale” fines in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe event had two first-place finishers due to a new rule adopted by the California Interscholastic Federation, the state’s governing body for high school athletics. The rule allows girls assigned female at birth to receive medals based on where they would have finished if a transgender girl had not competed in the same event. The rule only applies to young women.\n\n\"Biological Male competed in California Girls State Finals, WINNING BIG, despite the fact that they were warned by me not to do so,\" Trump wrote. \"As Governor Gavin Newscum fully understands, large scale fines will be imposed!!!\" he added, mocking Gov. Gavin Newsom's name.\n\nTrump's Justice Department followed up, threatening legal action, saying that allowing the girl to compete was unconstitutional.\n\n\"Knowingly depriving female students of athletic opportunities and benefits on the basis of their sex would constitute unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause,\" the letter said.\n\nFBI looking for tipsters on gender-affirming care\n\nThe administration's actions have also targeted health care for LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nOn June 2, the FBI posted on X, asking the public for tips about medical providers who offer gender-affirming care to minors.\n\n“Help the FBI protect children. As the Attorney General has made clear, we will protect our children and hold accountable those who mutilate them under the guise of gender-affirming care,” the post says. “Report tips of any hospitals, clinics, or practitioners performing these surgical procedures on children.”\n\nThis outreach follows Trump's executive order on Jan. 28, directing federal agencies to take action against hospitals that continue to provide care such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. The order characterizes gender-affirming care for minors as “chemical and surgical mutilation\" and “sterilizing” children.\n\nSeveral hospitals, such as Denver Health in Colorado, said they had stopped performing gender-affirming surgeries for patients younger than 19, in the wake of this policy. Other facilities, such as the Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, said they were reevaluating their gender-affirming care programs for patients under 19.\n\n“Health care for trans youth is just that – it’s health care,” said Laurel Powell, director of communications at Human Rights Campaign. “Threatening to weaponize the FBI against American doctors who are following medical best practice would undermine parents who just want their children to thrive.”\n\nU.S. Park Service orders Dupont Circle closed\n\nThe U.S. Park Service announced on June 2 that it would close Dupont Circle park during the final weekend of WorldPride 2025 D.C. to prevent “destructive and disorderly behavior.\"\n\nWorldPride is a series of international LGBTQ+ Pride events to promote visibility and awareness. The event is hosted in different cities each year.\n\n“This decision was based on a history and pattern of destructive and disorderly behavior from unpermitted activities happening in the park during past D.C. Pride weekends, including vandalism in 2023 that resulted in approximately $175,000 in damage to the historic Dupont Circle fountain,\" the Washington Blade reported.\n\nThe day after this announcement, Washington Council member Zachary Parker posted on X that, at his request, Police Chief Pamela Smith asked the park service to retract its plan. He also said the park service had agreed to rescind the decision.\n\nHowever, on Friday, Kevin Griess, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Park, sent a letter, signed on June 5, saying the closure was on again and would run from June 5 at 6 p.m. until June 8 at 7 p.m.\n\nThe letter said the United States Park Police, a division of the National Park Service, had made the determination that closure was necessary to “secure the park, deter potential violence, reduce the risk of destructive acts and decrease the need for extensive law enforcement.”\n\nParker said in a post he was \"infuriated\" by the closure.\n\n\"Dupont Circle is sacred ground for the LGBTQ community,\" he wrote. \"A place with a rich history of protest, pride, and joy. Closing it during one of the most significant global celebrations of our community sends the wrong message.\"\n\nOngoing focus on transgender youth\n\nA recurring target of the president's policies on Pride Month – and a steady drumbeat throughout his second term – is curbing young people from being out as transgender (preventing participation in high school track) and deterring adults from supporting them (investigating providers who offer gender affirming care).\n\nHe emphasized this on day one in the Oval Office, in an order declaring there are just two genders, male and female.\n\nHe repeated it at a White House gathering for Women's History Month, saying, \"No matter how many surgeries you have, or chemicals you inject, if you are born with male DNA in every cell of your body, you can never become a woman, you are not a woman.\"\n\nA report from the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, law school looked at the fallout from another early executive order of Trump's that imposed restrictions on transgender students in K-12 schools.\n\nAccording to the report, Trump's policy restricts:\n\nUse of preferred names and pronouns: Federal agencies can cut funding to schools that recognize trans students' preferred names and pronouns.\n\nAccess to shared restrooms in schools: The government can halt funding for schools that allow them.\n\nParticipation in sports: Schools can lose funding if they let transgender students play on teams consistent with their gender identities.\n\nPrivacy: Schools that don't out kids to their parents can lose funding.\n\nLGBTQ+ education: Schools may be penalized if they teach about gender identity.\n\nPunitive social and policy measures are associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes for LGBTQ+ people, the report says. The report highlights research on young adults that shows that trans students who participate in collegiate sports are less likely to experience distress, self-harm and suicidal thoughts.\n\nRepeating history\n\nTrump is not an outlier historically, said John D'Emilio, a professor emeritus of history and women's and gender studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of books in the field.\n\n\"This isn't the first time there has been a hostile attacking response to the LGBTQ community,\" he said.\n\nDuring the Lavender Scare of the early 50s, the federal government prohibited LGBTQ+ people from working for the federal government. The FBI investigated them and the military discharged them. In the 80s, amid the growing AIDS epidemic, President Ronald Reagan told reporters that gay men were a threat to the general population. In the 90s, under Clinton, Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act and many states banned same sex marriage.\n\nIn every era, D'Emilio said, \"These hostile, oppressive actions sparked a response from the LGBTQ community.\"\n\n\"It is too early to tell what the response to the Trump administration's actions will be,\" he said. \"But history suggests that it will motivate and provoke a high level of organizing in response, mobilizing not only the community but its allies as well.\"\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

Service was swiftly restored to the popular short-form video app Sunday, although Apple and Google haven't returned it to their app stores for downloading.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Sunday that he would issue the order on his first day as a second-term president \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\n\"The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\" Trump promised.\n\nWhether Trump's executive order can truly halt the law temporarily isn't clear.

(they) will be considering cuts to government agencies and programs that protect health, benefits, consumer finance, and product safety.\"\n\nAs Trump's return-to-office mandate was expected to get major pushback from federal workers, the president is also threatening to take legal action against the latest AFGE contract which extended remote worker protections until 2029.\n\n“AFGE will not stand idly by as a secretive group of ultra-wealthy individuals with major conflicts of interest attempt to deregulate themselves and give their own companies sweetheart government contracts while firing civil servants and dismantling the institutions designed to serve the American people,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement. “This fight is about fairness, accountability, and the integrity of our government. Federal employees are not the problem—they are the solution.”\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nTrump travels to arena for inaugural rally\n\nDonald Trump was spotted on his way to the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., where he'll hold an inaugural rally with supporters.\n\nHe was supposed to participate in a parade to celebrate the start of his second term, but festivities were moved indoors due to the below-freezing cold in the nation's capital.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nHegseth advances in committee for Defense role\n\nA majority on the Senate Armed Services Committee voted in favor ot Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon.\n\nHegseth, a combat veteran and former Fox News host, will advance to the full Senate following the committee's party-line vote: 14-13.

Mark Milley all received preemptive pardons from Biden on Monday for potential targets of President-elect Donald Trump in an unprecedented move to shield some of the incoming president's top foes from criminal prosecution.\n\nBiden also granted pardons to the lawmakers and staffers from the House committee that investigated the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, a panel the president-elect has railed against for years.\n\n\"These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\n– Holly Rosenkrantz\n\nWhich president's assassin was also at their inauguration?\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth can be seen in a photograph of former President Abraham Lincoln's second inauguration.\n\nSix weeks later, the actor and Confederate sympathizer shot and killed Lincoln inside Ford's Theatre.\n\nHas the inauguration been held indoors before?\n\nTrump's second inauguration was moved inside the Capitol rotunda, due to bitter cold conditions in Washington Monday.\n\nThen President Ronald Reagan's second swearing-in in January 1985 marks the last time the ceremony took place inside.\n\nIn 1909, William Taft's presidential inauguration was held in the Senate chamber due to 10 inches of snow outside.\n\nWho gave the longest inauguration speech? The shortest?\n\nFormer President William Henry Harrison holds the record for the longest inaugural address, at 8,445 words and one hour and 40 minutes, on March 4, 1841.\n\nHarrison also went down in history for having the shortest presidential term. At 68 years old, the ninth president died a month after taking office from pneumonia thought to be the result of bitter cold conditions during his inauguration.\n\nMeanwhile, the briefest inauguration award goes to first President George Washington, who offered just 135 words before his second oath of office.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhen was the first inauguration?\n\nFormer President George Washington was sworn in during the country's first inauguration on April 30, 1789.\n\nStarting with the second president, John Adams, inaugurations were typically held on March 4. The ceremony moved to its current traditional date, Jan. 20, starting with former President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/04/25/trump-100-days-changes-in-america/83042626007/", "title": "Trump's first 100 days bring 100 things that have changed (so far)", "text": "WASHINGTON - From the structure of the global economy to the use of plastic straws, Donald Trump's second term has already overseen a whirlwind of change.\n\nNot since Franklin Roosevelt has a new president driven so many shifts, so fast. Actually, Trump may have FDR beat on the signature first-100-days marker, even though his predecessor was inaugurated with a Great Depression to tackle.\n\nIt takes most presidents months or even years to make a difference in the daily lives of Americans, not to mention those who live around the world. But this time, Trump's unprecedented use of executive powers has already slashed the federal workforce, banned diversity programs, dismantled USAID, divided opposition Democrats over how to respond and prompted longstanding U.S. allies to calculate how to navigate a new global reality.\n\nHe even seems to have had an effect on the most popular baby names.\n\nHere's a look at 100 things that have changed during Trump's first 100 days − the momentous and the less so.\n\n1 - The Dow Jones industrial average has been on a rollercoaster. It plunged with the announcement of tariffs, spiked with news of a 90-day delay, and rose and fell with headlines of an escalating global trade war. The markets faced their worst slide since the coronavirus pandemic and the bond market went into an historic panic.\n\n2 - The number of migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border plummeted since the end of the Biden administration to about 8,450 in February 2025, Trump’s first full month in office, the lowest level in at least 25 years. In December 2024, President Joe Biden’s last full month in office, Immigration and Customs Enforcement had reported 47,000 apprehensions, more than five times more.\n\n3 - Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who gained prominence as a vaccine skeptic, took over the federal health agenda. He banned some artificial food dyes and promised a report by September explaining the rise in autism cases.\n\n4 - The number of deportations by ICE dropped a bit despite Trump administration efforts to step up the pace. More than 12,000 were deported in February 2024, during Biden’s administration, to about 11,000 in February 2025, during Trump's administration.\n\n5 - Eggs are more expensive. The average cost of a dozen large eggs, which became a symbol of inflation during the 2024 presidential campaign, continued to rise amid a bird-flu crisis, to $6.23 in March, though wholesale prices had begun to drop.\n\n6 - Relations with Canada soured as Trump imposed tariffs and suggested making it the 51st state. The debate over the U.S. president became a major factor in Canada's elections on April 28.\n\n7 - The Gulf of Mexico was renamed the Gulf of America – at least in official federal government publications.\n\n8 - DEI programs, designed to address the nation's history of racism, were scrapped across federal government agencies and the military. The Trump administration also targeted the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs at private law firms, public universities and other institutions that receive federal funding or rely on federal approvals. T\n\n9 - Republican victories leave Republicans nervous. Randy Fine and Jimmy Patronis were sworn in as new Republican U.S. House members, holding on to GOP seats in special elections in Florida – but by margins slashed in half since last November’s election that Democrats chalked up to Trump's early controversies as president.\n\n10 - Evidence of that nervousness: Trump backed away from elevating the star of the GOP's attack on college antisemitism because he was worried Republicans couldn't hold on to her House seat. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik was nominated as UN ambassador on Jan. 20 and then un-nominated in March.\n\n11 - The Black Lives Matter Plaza, a two-block stretch in downtown Washington, D.C., pointed to the White House, was dismantled and repainted, a capitulation by the city government to Trump. It was created as an emblem of defiance to him during his first term amid protests over the death of George Floyd.\n\n12 - Susan Crawford won a swing seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, with potential repercussions on everything from abortion rights to legislative redistricting in the battleground state. Billionaire Elon Musk spent $25 million on behalf of her opponent, making it the nation's most expensive judicial race ever. It was a boost for Democrats after November's losses.\n\n13 - The White House overhauled the press pool, the small group of journalists that tracks the president in small spaces and during travel. First the Associated Press, then Reuters and Bloomberg lost their permanent standing in the pool. \"New media\" outlets, including some with MAGA sentiments, were added to the rotation.\n\n14 - Chinese imports −from toys and clothes to furniture and sports equipment − were slapped with an escalating series of tariffs that reached 145%. China responded by imposing a 125% tariff on U.S. goods – a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.\n\n15 - The penguins and seals that are the sole inhabitants of the remote Heard and McDonald islands in Antarctica were hit with 10% tariffs on any goods they might be thinking about exporting to the United States.\n\n16 - The nation’s top military official, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., was dismissed and replaced by retired Air Force Lieutenant General Gen. Dan \"Razin\" Caine.\n\n17 - Two girls died of measles in Texas, the first deaths from the highly contagious virus in the United States in a decade. Neither child had been vaccinated. Across the U.S., two dozen states reported a total of more than 800 cases of measles.\n\n18 - Trump's average job approval rating during his first three months in office was a bit higher than it was during his first term, 45% compared with 41% in the Gallup Poll. He trailed every other post-World War II president at this point in their terms by double digits.\n\n19 - Views of the Democratic Party sank to record lows, with a favorability rating of 27% in an NBC poll.\n\n20 - In the same survey, 39% of registered voters had a favorable view of the Republican Party.\n\n21 - New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker won props for stamina with a no-bathroom-breaks speech on the Senate floor that stretched past 25 hours, beating the record set by South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond. Booker was blasting Trump’s policies; Thurmond had been filibustering the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\n22 - Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired. Tens of thousands more took buyout offers.\n\n23 - Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, designed and led the Department of Governmental Efficiency, which cut a swath through federal agencies. DOGE ordered the firing of tens of thousands of federal workers and gained access to closely-held data systems with information on millions of citizens.\n\n24 - Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican billionaire who was initially Musk’s partner on DOGE, decided to run for governor of Ohio in 2026.\n\n25 - Tesla profits plummeted 71% in the first quarter of 2025 amid a backlash to the brand and Musk, its CEO. Auto tariffs played a role, too. Musk said he would be spending more time at Tesla, less time with DOGE.\n\n26 - Birthright citizenship, guaranteed in the Constitution's 14th Amendment, was ordered ended by executive order. The issue is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n27 - Hundreds of alleged members of the violent Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs were deported to El Salvador’s notorious maximum-security prison.\n\n28 - The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint in the debate over whether the administration's immigration crackdown needed to follow due process rules. He was deported from Maryland to the Salvadoran prison in what U.S. officials acknowledged was an administrative error. The Supreme Court told the administration to facilitate his return. The issue remains in the courts.\n\n29 - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivered an invitation from King Charles III to Trump for an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom. The president accepted on the spot.\n\n30 - Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance went to Greenland to test the waters on Trump’s proposal to take it over. The waters were, well, icy. Trump was undeterred, and United Airlines announced it would become the only U.S. carrier with service to Greenland − starting on June 14, the president's 79thbirthday.\n\n31 - Washington Capitals player Alex Ovechkin broke Wayne Gretzky’s long-standing record for most goals scored in the National Hockey League. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ovi's longtime friend, was among those congratulating the Russian player.\n\n32 - Trump is no longer a federal defendant. Indictments on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election and of mishandling sensitive documents were dismissed at the request of his administration’s Justice Department. Special counsel Jack Smith said in his final report that there was enough evidence to convict Trump.\n\n33 - The U.S. House of Representatives agreed to allow members who were new parents to use \"vote pairing\" to ease the burden of traveling to Washington with newborns. Speaker Mike Johnson had opposed a bipartisan proposal to allow them to vote remotely.\n\n34 - Attorney General Pam Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The Biden administration had imposed a moratorium on federal capital punishment to study how executions were conducted.\n\n35 - Columbia agreed to dramatic concessions after the Trump administration threatened to cancel $400 million in federal funding amid complaints about antisemitism. The university said it would tighten rules on protests and appoint a senior vice provost to oversee the Middle Eastern studies department.\n\n36 - Harvard refused Trump's demands. The administration said it would freeze more than $2 billion in federal funding, and the president said the school should lose its tax-exempt status. Harvard then sued the Trump administration, accusing it of threatening the school's academic independence.\n\n37 - Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP was the first of several elite law firms to cut a deal to avoid threatened penalties from Trump. In all, the firms have agreed to provide about $1 billion worth of free legal work for projects the firm and Trump support.\n\n38 - Perkins Coie, which represented Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, refused Trump's demands, as did Jenner & Block and WilmerHale. Their lawsuits are in the courts.\n\n39 - Environmental regulations on coal production were loosened, part of Trump's priority to increase U.S. energy production. \"Drill, baby, drill\" was a signature promise at his campaign rallies.\n\n40 - Logging was allowed on more than half of national forests, and federal lands in Nevada and New Mexico were opened to the mining of rare minerals, reversing prohibitions Biden put in place during the final weeks of his administration.\n\n41 - A vast Pacific Ocean reserve, 750 miles west of Hawaii, was opened to commercial fishing. President George W. Bush had established the reserve, home to coral atolls and endangered sea turtles, and President Barack Obama expanded it to nearly 500,000 square miles.\n\n42 - The U.S. and Iran opened negotiations in Oman over Tehran’s nuclear program, the first direct talks in a decade.\n\n43 - Economic forecasters increased the odds of a recession in the wake of Trump's trade war. A survey of economists in March raised the probability of a global recession this year to 47%, up from 25% in February.\n\n44 - Consumer confidence plunged, to 50.8% in April from 71.7% in January.\n\n45 - The dollar weakened, falling to a three-month low in April amid economic uncertainty.\n\n46 - Americans are less dissatisfied with the direction of the country than when Trump took office. In January, those polled by Gallup were dissatisfied by 77%-20%, almost 4-1. In March, they were dissatisfied by 62%-37%, less than 2-1.\n\n47 - Most staffers were fired and most contracts cancelled at the U.S. Agency for International Development. The foreign-aid agency was officially moved to the State Department.\n\n48 - The Education Department was largely dismantled, with about half of its staff fired.\n\n49 - Ceasefire efforts in Gaza stalled as Israel carved out a broad \"security zone,\" displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.\n\n50 - The head of NATO credited Trump's demands for spurring a \"staggering increase\" in defense spending by European countries.\n\n51 - Nvidia announced it planned to build AI servers worth as much as $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, seen as a victory for Trump's tariffs in moving manufacturing into the United States.\n\n52 - The Swiss drugmaker Novartis announced plans to build pharmaceutical manufacturing plants in the U.S., one of the goals of Trump’s tariff regime.\n\n53 - China suspended exports of rare earth minerals and magnets, material that is crucial to build cars, planes, robots, missiles and semiconductors. The move was a response to Trump's tariffs.\n\n54 - Federal restrictions on just how much water can flow from shower heads were loosened by presidential executive order, addressing a longstanding Trump pet peeve.\n\n55 - Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who is vice chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in the Middle East. The winner is usually announced in October.\n\n56 - Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, a measure opposed by many dentists and medical organizations but praised by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others who question its safety.\n\n57 - Preorders for the hotly awaited release of the Switch 2, Nintendo’s new video game console planned for April 9, were delayed for two weeks or so after Trump unveiled tariffs, including on Vietnam, where it is made. The company announced that the price would remain at $499.99 but that accessories would \"experience price adjustments.\"\n\n58 - Amazon added reruns of “The Apprentice,” the reality-TV show starring Donald Trump, to its Prime Video streaming service. It ran from 2004 to 2017.\n\n59 - A website called thebump.com reported that the most popular baby name in 2025 was Kai − which happens to be the name of Trump's oldest grandchild.\n\n60 - The number of tornadoes in the U.S. surged to nearly double the historical average, AccuWeather reported. More than 470 had been reported by early April, killing more than 30 people and causing billions of dollars in damage and economic loss.\n\n61 - The number of foreign travelers arriving in the U.S. dropped in the first three months of 2025 by about 4.4%, compared with the last three months of 2024. In a March year-over-year comparison, the National Travel and Tourism Office calculated the drop doubled to almost 10%.\n\n62 - Comedian Amber Ruffin was canceled as the entertainer for the White House Correspondents Association dinner in April as the journalism organization’s leaders said it was reimagining the annual event in Washington, D.C.\n\n63 - Comedian Amber Ruffin was then booked to be the entertainer for the PEN America gala in New York City in May.\n\n64 - Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 in the Superdome in New Orleans.\n\n65 - Trump became the first sitting president to make more than one trip to the Daytona 500. He had also attended the NASCAR race in his first term. President George W. Bush had attended once while in office.\n\n66 - Trump attended the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia. He had attended the championships in Tulsa in 2023, when he was out of office.\n\n67 - Trump attended Ultimate Fighting Championship events in New York and in Miami. During his first term, he became the first sitting president to attend a UFC fight.\n\n68 - Democratic governors sought to find areas of agreement with Trump, a contrast to his first term. During an Oval Office meeting to discuss Great Lakes protection and other state issues, Trump called Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan \"a very good person.\" He had previously referred to her as \"that woman from Michigan.\"\n\n69 - Democratic governors stepped up confrontations with Trump, including several who are considering 2028 president bids. Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2024, called on party leaders to \"do something, dammit!\" Even Whitmer looked less than enthusiastic about being embraced in the Oval Office, at one point holding file folders up to hide her face from news photographers.\n\n70 - Trump showed reporters the mock-up for a laminated \"gold card,\" a special visa that would allow immigrants to buy legal status in the U.S. for $5 million each. The card showed Trump's face, the Statue of Liberty, a bald eagle and the words \"The Trump Card.\"\n\n71 - Presidential golf is back. Trump spent at least 24 days on the golf course between Inauguration Day and April 19. Trump played three rounds of golf the weekend after announcing big reciprocal tariffs on a host of nations, claiming a club championship as financial markets plummeted. Then-President Joe Biden golfed once during his first 100 days in office.\n\n72 - The Saudi-backed LIV Golf league held its first domestic event of the year at Trump National Doral Golf Club in Miami. The president dined with LIV golfers, and his family members attended the tournament. Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, is keen to influence U.S. foreign policy in the region. Trump is keen to host professional golfers at his clubs, having been snubbed by the PGA Tour in the past.\n\n73 - Palm Beach again ranks among world capitals as a major power center. Since returning to the presidency, Trump regularly departs the White House on Friday to spend the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in South Florida. Trump hiked the club membership fee last year to $1 million.\n\n74 - Transgender student athletes are banned from playing women's sports. Trump signed an executive order in the White House surrounded by little girls in sports jerseys.\n\n75 - Smoot-Hawley is a thing again. The 1930 tariff act, which is name-checked in a famous scene from the 1986 movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", is being mentioned as part of the political debate around Trump's tariffs. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul is warning that Smoot-Hawley, blamed for worsening the Great Depression, led to a GOP political massacre that kept the party out of power for six decades.\n\n76 - Crypto is king! Trump signed an executive order to promote cryptocurrencies, staging an event with crypto leaders in the White House. The president even has his own crypto business. But Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, lost 14% of it's value between Inauguration Day and April 21.\n\n77 - Gold prices rose above $3,300 an ounce for the first time as investors looked for safe havens amid turmoil in the stock markets.\n\n78 - Trump's business interests are expanding. The president launched a meme coin, a type of cryptocurrency, shortly before taking office and its value soared. It has since sunk in value, but still has a market capitalization of $1.6 billion.\n\n79 - Trump's face could be on Mount Rushmore and a proposed new $250 bill. Both of those ideas were proposed by GOP lawmakers in legislation filed in the House this year.\n\n80 -Fort Bragg, which had been renamed Fort Liberty during the Biden administration, was re-renamed Fort Bragg. The original Fort Bragg honored a Confederate general; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the new Fort Bragg honored a World War II hero. He was barred by law from naming it for someone who had served in the Confederacy.\n\n81 - Move NASA to Ohio? HUD to Houston? State and local officials had until April 14 to vie to relocate federal agencies away from Washington and across the country. Decisions are pending.\n\n82 - The federal government is consolidating massive personal records about individual Americans which had been held separately at the Social Security administration, the Treasury Department and elsewhere. Trump signed an executive order to take the step, proposed by Musk and DOGE, despite concerns about privacy and security.\n\n83 - Trump fired the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., and named himself as chairman. The new leadership announced the exterior lighting of the building would permanently feature red, white and blue. The Broadway hit \"Hamilton\" canceled its upcoming performance. \"I never liked 'Hamilton' very much,\" the president said.\n\n84 - States were told they could no longer use Medicaid funding to pay for gender-affirming care for minors.\n\n85 - The U.S. Naval Academy's library was purged of books that officials said violated the Trump administration's ban on DEI, among them \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" by Maya Angelou. Left on the shelves was \"Mein Kampf\" by Adolf Hitler.\n\n86 - Paper straws? Out. Plastic straws? Back. Biden last year had ordered the federal government to phase out the purchase of single-use plastics, such as straws, by 2035. Within weeks of his inauguration, Trump ordered the federal government to stop buying paper straws.\n\n87 - Federal prosecutions for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act are on hold. Trump signed an executive order arguing that bribery prosecutions hurt U.S. companies trying to compete overseas. Among those convicted was Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chair in 2016. Trump pardoned him in the final days of his first term.\n\n88 - Funding for the Voice of America was slashed. Trump accused it of being a voice of \"radical propaganda.\" His attempt to fire its workers is in the courts.\n\n89 - TikTok has avoided the chopping block − that is, the congressionally mandated deadline for the popular app to be separated from its Chinese owner or be banned in the USA. Trump is trying to strike a deal, though that effort has become entangled in the trade war.\n\n90 - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ceased operations in February on order from its acting director, Russell Vought. The bureau, a top cause of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, was created in the wake of the Great Recession to help fight financial fraud. Now it's one of the federal agencies being dismantled by DOGE, but a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to halt efforts to shutter the CFPB.\n\n91 - Governing by tweet is back. Except now it's governing by Truth, as Trump takes to his social media platform, Truth Social, to announce all manner of administration actions. His big 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs? Announced first on Truth Social.\n\n92 - The presidential press conference is reborn. Trump took questions from the media while signing executive orders on his first day back in office. He hasn't stopped talking since. Trump's media availabilities have been constant, and are coming in all forms, including during Oval Office events, while meeting with world leaders, on Air Force One and in actual press conferences. It's a big contrast with Biden, who was tightly scripted and had limited media availability.\n\n93 - American diplomacy looks a lot different. Just ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump berated Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and later told him to leave the White House, a shocking moment in the annals of U.S. foreign relations.\n\n94 - Bilateral negotiations between Ukraine and Russia may loom. The conflict wasn't settled in a day, as Trump had promised during the campaign, but the administration has pushed for progress or threatened to \"move on.\"\n\n95 - Dozens of court cases have been filed to block administration actions at least temporarily, according to a Lawfare tracker. That is a record use of the court system as a recourse by states, unions, activist groups and individuals.\n\n96 - Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders became the most prominent politician ever to speak onstage at Coachella and, at 83, probably the oldest. He and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez drew big crowds across the country with their \"fighting oligarchy\" tour.\n\n97 - Former Democratic presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden spoke out against Trump, at odds with a general tradition. Biden, who had largely disappeared from public view after Trump's inauguration, delivered a speech in Chicago on April 15, accusing his successor of \"taking a hatchet\" to the Social Security administration.\n\n98 - For 132 years, presidents who won two terms served them back-to-back. With Trump's inauguration, he dislodged Grover Cleveland's solo standing as the only president to win a term, lose an election, then win another term. \"It's kind of weird, and it's kind of fun,\" said Cleveland's grandson, George Cleveland, of Tamworth, N.H.\n\n99 − An addition to the White House grounds: 100-foot flag poles to display the American flag that Trump announced he would have installed on the North Lawn and the South Lawn.\n\n100 - Trump suggested he might run for a third term, despite the Constitution's 14th Amendment barring it. His company is selling \"Trump 2028\" hats for $50. He has encouraged the speculation and declined to endorse Vice President JD Vance as his successor. But does he mean it?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/25"}]}

Longstanding department policy prohibits prosecuting a sitting president.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida dismissed the classified documents case against Trump, Nauta and De Oliveira, by ruling Smith was appointed illegitimately.\n\nBut federal prosecutors under former Attorney General Merrick Garland asked the appeals to overturn her decision for the remaining charges against Nauta and De Oliveira. Prosecutors argued the special counsels have been upheld for decades to conduct independent criminal investigations.\n\nTrump was charged with mishandling classified documents, including by willfully retaining national defense information after his presidency. Those documents allegedly included information on U.S. and foreign military capabilities.\n\nTrump has remained critical of the Justice Department and the FBI for the search of Mar-a-Largo in August 2022, when the documents were seized.\n\nThe appeals court didn’t immediately react to O'Byrne's request, but the motion essentially brought an end to the long-running case.

The federal court docket had not been updated to reflect the change by the time Adams spoke. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office, Nicholas Biase, declined to comment.\n\nIn his speech, Adams said he was innocent, calling the bribery charges \"baseless\" and saying he never traded his power for personal benefit. Adams, who is seeking reelection this year, also vowed to regain the public's trust. “I thank the Justice Department for its honesty,” he said. “Now, we can put this cruel episode behind us and focus entirely on the future of our city. It’s time to move forward.”\n\nHis remarks came one day after acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told prosecutors for the Southern District of New York to drop the bribery charges against Adams as soon as possible, multiple news outlets reported, including the New York Times, Reuters and The Associated Press.\n\nBove said in a two-page memo the case distracted Adams from focusing on immigration, crime and his reelection campaign. Bove also wrote that the move did not concern the merits of the case and criticized former President Joe Biden and former U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, a Biden appointee who brought the charges against Adams last year.\n\nThe directive came after mounting speculation that President Donald Trump would seek to end the case against Adams, to whom he has grown increasingly sympathetic. The president has previously suggested that Adams was a victim of a political prosecution and said he would consider pardoning the mayor. Last month, Adams met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida and attended his Jan. 20 inauguration.\n\nThe move also demonstrated the willingness of the Trump administration to intervene in criminal cases against his allies. On his first day in office, Trump pardoned nearly 1,600 people involved in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nIn September, Adams was indicted for federal bribery, fraud and campaign finance charges, making him New York City's first mayor to be criminally charged while in office. Prosecutors alleged that Adams received more than $100,000 worth of illegal campaign contributions and free luxury travel in exchange for favors for the Turkish government.

I hope it was worth it.\"\n\nIn Tuesday's press conference, Adams again proclaimed his innocence, saying he never traded his power for personal benefit and calling the charges and allegations against him “baseless.”\n\n“I thank the justice department for its honesty,” he said. “Now, we can put this cruel episode behind us and focus entirely on the future of this city. It’s time to move forward.”\n\n\"Justice is dead in America,\" says state senator\n\nWith the Democratic primary for New York City mayor slated for June 24, challengers to Mayor Eric Adams have already drawn lines of attack to present to voters. In the summer, New Yorkers will vote in a ranked-choice system, choosing in order their top candidates for the city’s top job. Adams was already seen as vulnerable in his re-election campaign, with polling showing the moderate Democrat as deeply unpopular in the heavily Democratic city.\n\nState Sen. Zellnor Myrie, who represents central Brooklyn, said “Justice is dead in America,” as he called for a special prosecutor to handle the case against Adams.\n\nIn a morning briefing near City Hall, city Comptroller Brad Lander, another challenger, said he planned “to lay out the dangers to New York City in light of news that Mayor Eric Adams' personal and legal fate is now 100% beholden to the whims of President Donald Trump.”\n\nOne voice absent from the latest critiques of Adams is his most formidable challenger, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Polling shows Cuomo, who resigned from the governor’s office after sexual harassment allegations, as a clear favorite for mayor. An Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill survey in early February gave him three times more support than Adams.\n\nA spokesperson for Cuomo didn’t immediately respond to an email request for comment.\n\nNYC may become \"beholden\" to Trump: Comptroller Brad Lander\n\nComptroller Brad Lander, a Democratic candidate for mayor, said the federal corruption charges against Adams were warranted, though said New Yorkers can render their judgment in the Democratic primary in June. But in the meantime, he said, the decision by the Department of Justice just leaves Adams and, by extension, New York City federal funding, beholden to the Trump administration.\n\n“When the president harms or threatens New York City, the mayor will be unable to fight back,” Lander said outside of the David Dinkins Manhattan Municipal Building. “Because he clearly cares about staying out of prison more than he cares about the well-being of New Yorkers.”\n\nLander said this extends to New York being threatened with service cuts or cuts to school and hospital funding.\n\n“New Yorkers demand leadership that’s accountable to them and not to President Trump,” he said.\n\nThe day before, Adams was seen gathering city commissioners at the municipal building.

Instead of pleading guilty, Boeing would receive a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe apparent agreement would halt a scheduled June 23 trial date for Boeing. The airliner faced charges it misled U.S. regulators about a crucial flight control system on the 737 MAX, its biggest-selling jet. The deal would need a judge's approval.\n\nPaul Cassell, an attorney for the victims’ families and a University of Utah law professor, said in a statement that the Justice Department \"conveyed their preconceived idea that Boeing should be allowed to escape any real consequences for its deadly lies.\"\n\nCassell added that family members expressed outrage at the DOJ's proposed non-prosecution deal and urged the department to reject it. Cassell asked the DOJ if he could submit additional written arguments against this proposal, explaining the families’ position by May 23. The DOJ responded that it would get back to the families.\n\n\"We hope that this bizarre plan will be rejected by the leadership of the Department,\" Cassell said. \"If not – and if the Department moves to dismiss the case – we will strenuously object before Judge O’Connor.\"\n\nBoeing declined USA TODAY's request for comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to USA TODAY seeking comment.\n\nThe apparent decision comes as the families have pushed the Justice Department to hold Boeing accountable for the deaths. The airline manufacturer has paid billions in settlements resulting from Lion Air Flight 610, which killed 189 people in 2018, and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which killed 157 people in 2019. The crashes were caused by faulty flight control software issues just minutes after takeoff.\n\nBut Boeing has largely avoided criminal prosecution. Boeing reached a deal with the Justice Department regarding its criminal investigation in January 2021 and was placed on corporate probation.\n\nHowever, federal prosecutors claimed Boeing violated the deal in 2024. The Justice Department said in a court filing that Boeing failed to \"design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.\"\n\nThe government was weighing whether to pursue prosecution of Boeing, as lawyers representing families of the victims who died in the crash had hoped to see further action.\n\nVictims' families and lawyers appalled by apparent DOJ decision against Boeing\n\nThe latest DOJ proposal with Boeing has left the victims' families frustrated and angry, their lawyers said.

Both claimed to have been unfairly targeted by former President Joe Biden's Justice Department.\n\nNew York politicians praised Sassoon. \"The stench of this corrupt deal was apparently too much for the prosecutor who’d have to carry it out,\" State Sen. Zellnor Myrie, who is challenging Adams in the 2025 Democratic primary, said on X. \"But not for the Mayor it’s designed to help − and control.\"\n\nSassoon, a Republican who clerked for the late conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, said the Justice Department’s decision gave Adams leniency in exchange for doing the administration’s bidding on immigration enforcement.\n\n“Rather than be rewarded, Adams’s advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case,” she said in the letter published by the New York Post.\n\n“The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie,\" Adams attorney Alex Spiro said. \"We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\"\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Thursday night, Gov. Kathy Hochul said the allegations against Adams are extremely concerning. But she said she won't have a \"knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction\" to Sassoon’s letter.\n\nHowever, Hochul stopped short of saying she wouldn’t remove Adams, which she can do under the City Charter.\n\n“I have to do what’s smart, what’s right, and I’m consulting with other leaders in government at this time,” she said. “We’ve gotta have one sane person in the state who can cut through all the crap.”\n\nOne person who did call for Adams to step down: Hochul's lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado, who said on social media, \"New York City deserves a Mayor accountable to the people, not beholden to the President.\"\n\nThe departures mark the latest sign of resistance from career Justice Department officials to President Donald Trump's efforts to overhaul the agency to end what he calls its weaponization against political opponents. Critics say Trump's changes threaten to subject criminal prosecutions to political whims.\n\nIt's bewildering to some city leaders.\n\n“We are now at the beck and call of the Trump administration,” City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams told reporters. “We don’t know what this looks like.”\n\nJohn Keller, the acting head of the Justice Department's public corruption unit, also resigned over the Adams case, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Kevin Driscoll, a senior official in the department's criminal division, has also resigned, Reuters reported.\n\nA Justice Department official confirmed the resignations to Reuters. It was not immediately clear who would take Sassoon's place.\n\nOn Monday, Bove ordered Sassoon to drop corruption charges against Adams, a Democrat who has forged ties with Trump, in what former prosecutors called a sign of political interference.\n\nReuters reported Sassoon refused to comply with the directive to dismiss the case, and Trump's administration then directed Keller's office to do so. Keller resigned rather than comply, Reuters reported.\n\nSince Trump began his second term in the White House on January 20, the new administration fired more than a dozen prosecutors who pursued criminal charges against him in two cases brought in 2023, paused all civil rights and environmental litigation, and ordered criminal investigations of state and local officials who interfere with his hardline immigration initiatives.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, in her first day on the job last week, issued a directive stating that Justice Department lawyers who decline to appear in court or sign briefs would be disciplined and possibly fired.\n\nSouthern district has tradition of independence\n\nThe Southern District of New York, known for bringing high-profile cases on financial crimes, public corruption and national security, has long been known for its independence from the Justice Department in Washington.\n\nLast September, Sassoon's predecessor Damian Williams - a Biden appointee - charged Adams with accepting bribes from Turkish officials as part of a string of high-profile corruption cases - including the trial conviction on bribery charges of former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, also a Democrat.\n\nMenendez is appealing.\n\nAdams pleaded not guilty and has argued the charges were brought as retaliation for his criticism of Biden's immigration policies. Trump, whose two federal cases were dismissed after his election victory but who was convicted on separate state-level charges, has expressed sympathy for Adams.\n\nIn a memorandum to Sassoon ordering Adams' case be dismissed, Bove said the directive had nothing to do with its merits. Instead, he wrote that the case was distracting Adams from helping Trump crack down on illegal immigration, one of the Republican president's top priorities.\n\nA half-dozen former SDNY prosecutors told Reuters this week that the order from Bove, himself a former SDNY prosecutor who also served as Trump's personal criminal defense lawyer, raised questions about whether the office can remain independent of political pressure during Trump's second White House term.\n\n\"The U.S. Attorney must have concluded that she could not dismiss these charges while also carrying out her oath of office,\" said Harry Sandick, a former SDNY federal prosecutor. \"She displayed courage and a respect for the traditions of the office by declining to follow an order that she apparently viewed as unjust.\"\n\nProsecutors in the Southern District have not yet filed a formal motion seeking to have the case dismissed three days after Bove's Monday order that the case be dropped.\n\nDriscoll, who has been with the department for more than two decades, oversaw the criminal division's money laundering and asset recovery and public integrity sections.\n\nKeller has been with the department since 2010.

The filing had no explanation for the reversal, which was issued just after Josue Santos' high-profile arrest in Northern Virginia in late March.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that Villatoro Santos will now face removal from the country.\n\nTop Trump administration officials had accused Villatoro Santos of leading East Coast operations for MS-13, a transnational gang, and one of the gang's three top leaders in the U.S. Along with Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin held a press conference highlighting his arrest and indicated they'd seek to deport him.\n\nIn a filing late Wednesday, Villatoro Santos’ lawyer, Muhammad Elsayed, requested that the court delay ordering a dismissal of the case for at least two weeks.\n\nElsayed acknowledged the “unusual nature” of a defense lawyer opposing the dismissal of charges against his client. “But these are unusual times,” he said.\n\nIf the judge dismissed the case, Elsayed argued, Villatoro Santos would immediately be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody and subsequently be deported to El Salvador without due process.\n\nOnce there, Villatoro Santos would likely be placed in “one of the worst prisons in the world,” Elsayed said, citing migrants sent to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT.

Even as most other defendants in custody left jail, Pollock and Hutchinson remained locked up Thursday as the Department of Justice worked to determine whether Trump's order applied to additional charges of failure to appear in court levied against the pair last year.\n\nThe Department of Justice, now headed to an interim Trump appointee, first signaled Thursday that it would dismiss the charges against Pollock and Hutchinson based on their actions at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but would not drop the counts of failure to appear in court from 2023. By late afternoon, though, the Department of Justice had changed its position and sought to drop the final charges against the co-defendants.\n\nA federal judge promptly ordered the remaining charges dismissed.\n\nFBI agents arrested Pollock and Hutchinson in June 2021 after their indictments on multiple felony charges, including assaulting or interfering with police officers. They were given conditional release while awaiting trial.\n\nShortly before their scheduled trials in March 2023, Pollock and Hutchinson disabled their GPS monitors and fled, according to the Justice Department. FBI agents captured them in January 2024 at a ranch in Lake County, along with Pollock’s younger brother, Jonathan Pollock, who had been a fugitive for 2½ years after eluding arrest following his indictment.\n\nProsecutors added charges of failure to appear in court to those already filed against Olivia Pollock, 34, and Hutchinson, 28, both former residents of North Lakeland. Since their capture, the Pollock siblings and Hutchinson were being held at a jail in Washington, D.C.\n\nA federal public defender filed an emergency motion Wednesday for Hutchinson, who had been representing himself in court. The motion asked to join a motion filed by Olivia Pollock to dismiss all charges and grant immediate release from jail.\n\nOlivia Pollock’s lawyer filed a motion to Judge Carl J. Nichols on Wednesday.\n\nQuestions over what charges Trump's pardon covered\n\nIn the motion for Hutchinson, the public defender wrote: “The government has represented that it has yet to decide whether to file a motion in his case despite the instructions of the President as they are seeking clarification as to whether the Executive Order covers related charges, i.e., charges for failure to appear. Mr. Hutchinson submits that they are covered and seeks an order of dismissal and immediate release for all of the reasons cited by his codefendant Olivia Pollack (Pollock).”\n\nThe motion raised the question of whether Trump’s order for pardons covers alleged crimes that did not occur at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nNichols issued an order Wednesday directing prosecutors to respond to Pollock’s motion by 3 p.m. Thursday.\n\nU.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. filed a motion Thursday morning to dismiss eight counts against both Olivia Pollock and Hutchinson. But the filing said that prosecutors have not chosen to dismiss the charges of failure to appear.\n\n“At this time, the government is not moving to dismiss Counts Twenty-Five and Twenty-Six, which charge Olivia Pollock and Joseph Hutchinson with Failure to Appear … for conduct that occurred in 2023,” the motion said.\n\nMartin is a lawyer who advocated for Jan. 6 defendants before Trump appointed him as interim leader of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, D.C., NBC News reported.\n\nReversal follows lawyer's plea for immediate release\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, though, the Department of Justice had reversed itself. In a motion signed by Martin, prosecutors moved to dismiss the counts of failure to appear against Olivia Pollock and Hutchinson. The agency cited Trump's executive order as the reason for the dismissal.\n\nNichols then issued an order granting dismissal of the remaining charges.\n\nPollock’s lawyer, Elita C. Amato of Arlington, Virginia, had responded to the earlier motion indicating that the charge of failure to appear would stand. In a motion seeking Pollock's immediate release. Amato argued that the charge should also be dropped in response to Trump’s executive order, which directed prosecutors to dismiss all charges for “conduct related to the events at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.”\n\n“The Failure to Appear charge here is directly related to the conduct stemming out of the January 6, 2021, events,” Amato wrote. “It is based upon the January 6 charges, not for failure to appear for an unrelated matter. The prosecution’s motion for dismissal falls short of the President’s directive.”\n\nAmato wrote that Pollock has been held for more than a year. Under federal sentencing guidelines, a sentence on a conviction for failure to appear can be increased if the underlying offense is punishable by five to 15 years in prison.\n\nBecause the underlying offenses will be dismissed, no additional points should be added to the potential sentence, Amato wrote. For someone like Pollock with no criminal history, the base sentence is up to six months.\n\nEven with enhanced points, the recommended sentence would be 10 to 16 months, Amato wrote.\n\n“Ms. Pollock has already served more than the bottom of that range,” the lawyer argued.\n\nAmato noted that her brother and co-defendant, Jonathan Pollock, has been released with a full dismissal of charges even though it could be argued that he was “avoiding prosecution” for more than two years. Olivia Pollock should be released during any continued litigation of the dismissal of the failure to appear charge, the lawyer wrote.\n\nJonathan Pollock released Wednesday\n\nThe Pollocks and Hutchinson were the only defendants from Polk County being held in custody while awaiting trials.\n\nJonathan Pollock, 25, had been released from jail by Wednesday night, according to multiple news reports. In a video posted on YouTube, Pollock said that it was the first time he had “seen fresh air” in six months.\n\nPollock, who was captured on video fighting with police officers, according to prosecutors, said that the Biden Administration had been “just criminalizing patriots for standing for what was right.”\n\n“And now, here with all these other Americans, and just seeing your country turn around seeing Donald Trump and his Cabinet getting in … and just having that feeling of being proud to be an American again, and not being ashamed every time you saw your president, or every time you turn on the news and you were slandered because you stood on your rights, and be able to hug your family again,” he said.\n\nPollock said that he would not have left the jail if he had known that Olivia was not also being released.\n\nFive other current and former Polk County residents had either been convicted or pleaded guilty to Jan. 6 charges or were still awaiting trials when Trump issued his order. Judges have ordered all of the pending cases to be dismissed.\n\nGary White can be reached at gary.white@theledger.com or 863-802-7518.

DOJ moves to drop federal charges against ...", "text": "New York Mayor Eric Adams Tuesday addressed the news of the Trump administration's Justice Department intervening into Adams' federal criminal case.\n\nAdams' tenure as mayor has been embroiled in scandal, as he was the target of a lawsuit alleging sexual assault and multiple investigations. In September, Adams was indicted on federal charges alleging corruption dating back at least a decade. He has denied wrongdoing.\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump's Justice Department directed prosecutors in the corruption case to drop the charges against Adams, according to multiple reports.\n\n\"As I said from the outset, I never broke the law and I never would,\" Adams said in the address. \"So, I thank the Justice Department for its honesty. Now, we can put this cruel episode behind us and focus entirely on the future of our city.\"\n\nThe federal court docket had not been updated to reflect the change by the time Adams spoke. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office, Nicholas Biase, declined to comment.\n\nHere is what to know about the mayor of the nation's largest city as the situation develops:\n\nWatch live: NYC Mayor Eric Adams holds press conference after DOJ moves to drop charges\n\nWho is Eric Adams?\n\nEric Adams is the mayor of New York City, which includes five boroughs: Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, The Bronx and Staten Island.\n\nAdams has been in NYC's public eye for decades, formerly serving as an NYPD Captain, a state senator and Brooklyn borough president. He was elected as mayor in 2021.\n\nThe next mayoral election is slated for later this year.\n\nWhat the news means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nWhy was Eric Adams indicted?\n\nAdams was indicted on five counts of corruption charges for alleged activity involving foreign nationals starting as Brooklyn Borough President in 2014.\n\n\"Thereafter, for nearly a decade, Adams sought and accepted improper valuable benefits, such as luxury international travel, including from wealthy foreign businesspeople and at least one Turkish government official seeking to gain influence over him,\" the indictment reads.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the charges Adams faces:\n\nCount 1: Conspiracy to commit wire fraud, federal program bribery, and to receive campaign contributions by foreign nationals\n\nCount 2: Wire fraud\n\nCounts 3 and 4: Solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national\n\nCount 5: Bribery\n\nAdams pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nWhy is Donald Trump's DOJ moving to drop the charges against Adams?\n\nIn a memo reviewed by Reuters, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan the indictment improperly interfered with Adams' re-election campaign. The memo directed the prosecutors to dismiss the case promptly, but Adams must sign an agreement that charges could be brought in the future.\n\nCourt records as of Tuesday morning show no indication the prosecutors have filed to drop the case.\n\nAdams leads an overwhelmingly Democratic city and once aligned himself with former President Joe Biden. But Adams became critical of Biden when the city received a wave of migrants, and he has suggested his indictment is retribution for falling out with the Biden administration.\n\nTrump, who has argued criminal charges against him were politicized, has appeared to have grown sympathetic towards Adams. Trump previously said he would consider pardoning the mayor.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nContributing: Ben Adler, Bart Jansen USA TODAY; Reuters\n\nKinsey Crowley is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign machine switched gears to benefit the vice president.\n\nTrump, 78, reckoned with a new November opponent, one almost 20 years his junior, as some Democratic donors celebrated what one called the \"shot of adrenaline\" Harris could bring to the pivotal race.\n\n\"Now we have to start all over again,\" Trump complained in a Truth Social post Sunday evening.\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY's updates.\n\nSenate fundraising arm triples individual donations\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee tripled its fundraising record for the cycle in “individual grassroots” donations in a single day on Sunday, a DSCC aide told USA TODAY, though they did not provide exact fundraising numbers.\n\nOther major fundraising arms, including the House’s Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, are reporting big fundraising hauls the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nDifferent biographies\n\nTo make her case against former President Donald Trump, Harris, in a visit to her new campaign headquarters, sought to highlight their sharp biographical differences.\n\n\"As a young prosecutor, when I was in the Alameda County District Attorney's office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse,” said Harris, a former prosecutor. \"Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse.”\n\nHarris continued: “As attorney General of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges and put it out of business. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college, Trump University, that was forced to pay $25 million to the students it scammed.\"\n\nSimilar to Biden’s agenda, Harris vowed to fight for “reproductive freedom” if elected, take action to ban assault weapons and work to pass the John Lewis voting rights bill, among other policies.\n\n“Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. We here know when our middle class is strong, America is strong. And we know that's not the future Donald Trump is fighting for,” Harris said.\n\nShe ended her remarks saying, \"God bless you all and God bless the United States of America -- and Joe Biden.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\n‘I’m watching you, kid,’ Biden tells Harris as she takes over campaign\n\nPresident Joe Biden dropped in by conference call as Vice President Kamala Harris met with her full campaign staff Monday evening for the first time since taking the torch from Biden as the likely Democratic presidential nominee\n\n“I watching you, kid. I’m watching you, kid. I love ya,” Biden, 81, told 59-year-old Harris before she delivered remarks to her campaign staff – which was previously Biden’s campaign staff – at the campaign’s headquarters in Wilmington. Del.\n\nIn remarks that lasted about 20 minutes, Harris praised Biden’s accomplishments as “unmatched in modern history.”\n\n“I know it's been a rollercoaster, and we're all filled with so many mixed emotions about this,” Harris said. “I just have to say: I love Joe Biden. I love Joe Biden.”\n\nHarris announced that she retained Jen O’Malley Dillon, who served as chair of the Biden campaign, to lead her presidential campaign. She said Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, will remain in her role as well.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nHarris trails Biden in battleground states\n\nLess than a day after President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement, the national political landscape has dramatically shifted. While Biden had been slipping in the polls, particularly after his disastrous debate performance, a new national poll indicated that Harris could secure a victory against the Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, in all seven battleground states that are likely to decide the election's outcome, Trump has maintained a slight lead over his Democratic rivals.\n\nHere’s how Harris would fare against Trump in the seven key swing states, according to the most recent polls.\n\nArizona: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Biden-Trump race, an InsiderAdvantage poll showed 9% supported Trump, 44% favored Biden, 4% chose a third-party candidate, and 3% undecided.\n\nGeorgia: An exclusive poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution released hours after President Joe Biden announced his departure from the ticket showed former President Donald Trump with a slight lead over Harris, with a 51% to 46% rating respectively, and a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nMichigan: Recent polling from the Clean and Prosperous America PAC, a left-leaning environmental advocacy group, showed that voters preferred Trump to Harris, with 46% voting for him and 41% choosing the Vice President.\n\nNevada: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Trump-Biden poll that offered a hypothetical matchup against Harris, Trump received 50% of the vote compared to Harris’ 40%\n\nNorth Carolina: There are currently no polls pitting Harris against Trump.\n\nPennsylvania: No current polls show Harris-Trump results but before Biden announced his departure from the race, figures from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling showed that voters were more enthusiastic about Harris than they were for Biden, putting her only two points behind Trump.\n\nWisconsin: A Civiqs survey of 514 voters in Wisconsin showed Trump and Harris tied at 48%, with a 4.8% margin of error.\n\n-Maya Homan\n\nHarris fundraising boom continues, campaign says\n\nThe Harris campaign announced $81 million in donations in the 24 hours since the vice president announced her bid Sunday.\n\nThis number includes money raised through the campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees.\n\n“The historic outpouring of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections,” Kevin Munoz, campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nAlong with Democratic lawmakers, major donors had raised concerns about Biden following his debate performance and threatened to withhold their financial support if the president continued toward the nomination.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate Republican campaign arm hits Harris\n\nThe National Republican Senate Committee, the fundraising arm for Senate Republicans, released a messaging memo to candidates Monday titled: \"Harris creates strong down-ballot opportunity.\"\n\nThe group argues that the case against Biden − that he was \"mentally unfit to hold office\" − didn't work well against down-ballot Democrats. But Harris \"owns the Biden Administration's baggage,\" they write, making her \"arguably a bigger threat to Democrats' Senate majority than Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe memo details Harris' policy positions and concludes with a section titled \"weird,\" including noting that she laughs at \"inappropriate moments\" and loves Venn diagrams.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nKamala Harris quickly securing votes to become Democratic nominee\n\nA USA TODAY count of delegates shows the 59-year old Harris is more than 40% of the way to the 1,968 delegates needed to become the party's nominee in the first round of voting. There are 3,936 Democratic delegates in total, including former presidents, state and local party leaders, members of Congress and governors.\n\nAfter announcing Sunday afternoon that he no longer sought the nomination, the 81-year-old Biden endorsed Harris, a move that likely inspired delegates pledged to him to endorse her.\n\nIt will ultimately be up to the delegates to pick the nominee, but it remains unclear whether that decision will come by a remote roll call vote early next month as was originally planned by the party or at the Democratic National Convention that's scheduled to run August 19-22 in Chicago.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSchumer, Jeffries praise Harris in statement, stop short of endorsing\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a joint statement Monday saying that Harris is \"off to a great start\" with her pledge to pursue the nomination \"in a manner consistent with the grassroots and transparent process\" set forth by the DNC.\n\nHarris is \"rapidly\" gaining support from delegates, they said, but stopped short of endorsing her for president themselves.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nVance mocks Harris over debate\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is already taking more than a few shots at Harris, including her debate skills.\n\n\"I was told I was gonna get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump's gonna get to debate her?!\" Vance said during a homecoming speech in Ohio.\n\nHe added: \"I'm kind of pissed off about that if I'm being honest with you.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nJeffries, Schumer to meet with Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris \"shortly,\" Jeffries told reporters Monday.\n\nThere's no exact time for that meeting yet, he said, but they're waiting for Schumer to get back into town. The Senate doesn't return until Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm excited for that meeting,\" Jeffries said when asked why he has not yet endorsed Harris for president, as many of his high-profile Democratic colleagues have. Harris \"has excited the community, she's excited the House Democratic Caucus, and she's exciting the country.\"\n\nHe said he and Schumer will have more to say about \"the path forward\" once that meeting is over.\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nPelosi backs Harris as the vice president locks up congressional support\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., endorsed Kamala Harris on Monday as she continues to pick up key support from Democratic lawmakers.\n\n“Today, it is with immense pride and limitless optimism for our country’s future that I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris,” Pelosi said in a statement. “My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for president is official, personal and political.”\n\nPelosi played a key role in Biden’s eventual exit from the race. The former speaker served as a sounding board for Democratic lawmakers who were concerned with Biden’s campaign. Her comments on Biden that were hardly enthusiastic endorsements of Biden over the past weeks gave the green light to Democrats to publicly come out against the president.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n'You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?' Kamala Harris meme resurfaces after Biden drops out\n\n\"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\"\n\nNo, that isn't a quote from an ancient philosopher or a classic author. It's from Kamala Harris.\n\nAs rumors swirled in recent weeks over Joe Biden's ability to win and complete a second term in office, and following the recent news of him stepping down as the Democratic nominee, Harris (as well as the internet-famous coconut tree) has drawn increased interest in the political sphere as voters look to her as Biden's potential replacement on the Democratic side of the ticket.\n\n− Emily DeLetter\n\nHarris celebrates student athletes at the White House\n\nHarris on Monday spoke at an event celebrating college athletes, her first public appearance since Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nNCAA Sports Day brings championship teams from the National Collegiate Athletic Association to the White House. Harris also spoke at the event in 2023, which saw more than 1,000 student athletes from nearly 50 teams, according to Harris' remarks.\n\n\"Some of you have represented our nation on the international stage in world cups and world championships, and later this month six of you will represent our nation at the 2024 Olympics in Paris,\" Harris said.\n\n\"When you play, you inspire people across our nation. You remind all of us what can be achieved with hard work and ambition,\" she added.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIn first remarks since launching campaign, Kamala Harris pays tribute to Joe Biden, Beau Biden\n\nIn her first public remarks since she became the de facto presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris payed tribute to Joe Biden and his son, Beau Biden.\n\n\"Joe Biden's legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history. In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office,\" Harris said during an NCAA event at the White House.\n\nSaid she first met Joe Biden through his son Beau Biden. Beau Biden was the attorney general of Delaware while Harris served in the same role in California. Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015.\n\n\"Back then, Beau would often tell me stories about his dad. He would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is,\" Harris said. \"The qualities that Beau revered in his father are the same qualities that I have seen every day in our president. His honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family. His big heart and his deep love of our country.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nFlorida Democrats endorse Harris\n\nSamuel Vilchez, chair of the Orange County Democratic Party in Florida, said in a press call Monday that the Florida Democratic National Committee is endorsing Harris.\n\n“I’m thrilled to announce a unanimous endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris by the Florida Democratic National Committee members, all 15 of us, we have come together and a resounding show of unity and purpose to stand with (the) Vice President.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKamala Harris expected in Delaware Monday afternoon\n\nKamala Harris, who Joe Biden endorsed Sunday after announcing he will no longer seek reelection, is coming to Delaware, according to U.S. Sen. Tom Carper.\n\nHarris is expected to arrive in New Castle County Monday afternoon, where she will meet with members of the Delaware delegation and go to Biden's campaign headquarters in Wilmington, which is expected to transition to hers as she mounts her presidential campaign.\n\nIt's unclear whether the president will be joining the meeting, as today is Day 5 of COVID isolation after he tested positive Thursday. He's been in Rehoboth Beach battling his latest round of COVID and is expected to address the nation later this week regarding his decision to bow out of the presidential race.\n\n– Isabel Hughes and Esteban Parra\n\nTrump's strategy (so far): Link Harris to Biden\n\nThe Trump campaign is making its opening bid in the new campaign against Harris: Linking her to Biden.\n\n\"Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden,\" said a memo from Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, describing the vice president as an \"enabler\" for Biden.\n\n\"They own each other’s records, and there is no distance between the two.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nInside KamalaHQ: How Harris quickly began plotting campaign after Biden's shocking exit\n\nKamala Harris was at the vice president’s residence when she got the call from POTUS. President Joe Biden was ending his reelection campaign. And he was endorsing her.\n\nHarris got to work immediately. Still in her Howard University hoodie, workout sweats and sneakers, she whipped up a statement. She placed calls to lawmakers, governors, civil rights leaders and union bosses.\n\n– Francesca Chambers and Rebecca Morin\n\nHow to pronounce Kamala Harris\n\nDespite decades in the public spotlight, mispronunciations of the vice president's name have not gone away. Several of her political opponents at the Republican National Convention last week called her \"Camel-a,\" \"Kuh-MAHL-a,\" or \"Kuh-MEL-a\" – none of which are correct.\n\nIt's \"COM-mah-la,\" with emphasis on the first syllable. When pronounced correctly, the vice president's name sounds like comma-la.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nUAW thanks Biden, says Trump did nothing as workers were 'left for dead'\n\nThe United Auto Workers issued a statement Sunday reacting to Joe Biden's announcement he would drop his reelection bid. The UAW, behind President Shawn Fain, endorsed Biden in the race, though Fain earlier this month expressed concern about Biden's ability to defeat Donald Trump.\n\n\"Today, the United Auto Workers thanks President Joe Biden for his incredible term of service, and the leadership he has shown in putting country before self, once again, in passing the torch to a new generation,\" the organization based in Detroit, Michigan, said in a statement.\n\n– Detroit Free Press Staff\n\nMike Pence says Biden made right decision for country\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden made the “right decision” for the country in dropping out and thanked him for “putting the interests of our Nation ahead of his own.”\n\n“After the assassination attempt on President Trump and President Biden’s decision to end his campaign, now is a time for leaders in both parties to project calm and send a message of strength and resolve to America’s friends and enemies alike that, whatever the state of our politics, the American people are strong and our American military stands ready to defend our freedom and our vital national interests anywhere in the world,” he added.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMinnesota governor backs Harris nomination\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz endorsed Harris’ bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in a post to X Monday.\n\n“Thanks for the call,” Walz wrote. “You have my full support.

Gretchen Whitmer endorsed Kamala Harris on Monday, telling voters in the Democratic swing state \"let's get to work.\"\n\n\"In Vice President Harris, Michigan voters have a presidential candidate they can count on to focus on lowering their costs, restoring their freedoms, bringing jobs and supply chains back home from overseas, and building an economy that works for working people,\" Whitmer said, calling Harris a \"stark contrast to Donald Trump.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWill Joe Biden speak at the Democratic convention?\n\nYes, Biden is expected to speak at the DNC next month, a senior Democratic official confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\n\"I can assure you that Joe Biden is our North star,\" the official said.\n\n– Susan Page\n\nIllinois Gov. Pritzker endorses Harris\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, often mentioned as a possible presidential contender, has joined the growing chorus of Democrats backing Harris.\n\n“I am proud to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president of the United States,” Pritzker said in a statement released Monday.\n\nPritzker said Harris has proven at every point in her career that she possesses the “skills, strength and character to lead this country” and that she has the vision “to better the lives of all Americans.”\n\n“She represents our party’s best chance to defeat Donald Trump in November, and I will work my heart out to help her do that,” he said.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nDonations surge with Biden exit, Harris launch\n\nActBlue, the Democratic fundraising platform, raised almost $50 million hours after President Biden announced an end to his reelection bid.\n\n\"This has been the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle,” the nonprofit said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe $46.7 donation haul includes the total amount donated to the nonprofit, not just to Harris' campaign.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Julia Gomez\n\nKamala Harris’ campaign is embracing the memes, 'Brat' summer\n\nHarris’ campaign already launched their response team on X, formerly Twitter - and they’re fully embracing brat summer.\n\nThe header image on the page is a neon green background reading \"kamala hq,\" in the style of \"Brat,\" the 2024 album released by the singer Charli XCX that has led to what people are calling a \"brat summer.\"\n\nCharli XCX, who is British, acknowledged Harris' jump into the race and seemingly endorsed her candidacy Sunday, posting \"kamala IS brat.\"\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Emily DeLetter\n\nWes Moore endorses Harris\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore is among the latest to back Kamala Harris.\n\n“Vice President Harris has the experience, record, vision, and wisdom to unify the country,” Moore said in a statement Monday. “She will have the unique ability to energize the Democratic Party base and mobilize a unique coalition, and we must rally around her and elect her to serve as the next President of the United States.”\n\nMoore, a rising star in the party since winning election in 2022, told CBS last month he would not seek the presidential nomination himself. On the rumored list for Harris’ running mate, Moore said he had “lengthy conversations” with both her and Biden Sunday.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHouse Democratic campaign chair endorses Harris\n\nRep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats’ campaign arm, endorsed Harris on Monday morning as scores of top Democratic lawmakers come out in support of the vice president’s campaign.\n\n“To continue to move our nation forward and fulfill the promise of the American dream for everyone, it’s absolutely essential we return the House majority to Democrats and together with President Kamala Harris, we’ll deliver real results for working families and everyday Americans,” Delbene said in a statement.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho is Kamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff?\n\nKamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is an American lawyer. He quit his law practice in 2020 to take on the responsibilities of his new role as second gentleman.\n\nEmhoff and Harris met on a blind date in 2013 after being set up by a friend and married the following year. Harris became “Momala” to his two children, Cole, 26, and Ella, 21, from his first marriage.\n\nEmhoff traveled to key battleground states to campaign for Biden and Harris before the president dropped out of the race. He's also the first Jewish spouse of a vice president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat’s next for the upcoming presidential debate?\n\nJoe Biden’s announcement that he will not seek another term has cast uncertainty on yet another facet of the election year: The upcoming presidential debate.\n\nBack in May, ABC News announced that a debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden was scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. ET. But with Biden exiting the race Sunday and endorsing Kamala Harris, the debate schedule may not go on as planned.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Sunday evening, Trump called for Fox News to host the debate, rather than “Fake News ABC.”\n\n“Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,” he wrote.\n\nABC News has not issued an update on the debate schedule.\n\n– Maya Homan\n\nAs Biden leaves 2024 election, Trump and Democrats need to court these 10 voter groups\n\nPresident Joe Biden's announcement Sunday that he's dropping out and backing Vice President Kamala Harris shakes up the 2024 presidential election in many ways. Perhaps most significantly: Biden's decision could bring millions more voters to the polls, according to a new analysis of the U.S. electorate.\n\nResonate, a consumer data and intelligence company, released exclusively to USA TODAY a new set of 10 distinct voter groups. From its database of 250 million Americans, the 10 groups emerged as company's AI data engine culled and matched thousands of U.S. voter attributes.\n\nEricka McCoy, chief marketing officer for Resonate, predicted Friday that a new Democratic nominee would likely reenergize Gen-Z Zealots, based on insights from these groups. They're the largest of the 10 groups, which include younger, independent voters who advocate for environmental regulations and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n– Jim Sergent and Veronica Bravo\n\nUS allies react to Joe Biden dropping out of 2024 election race\n\nPraise, acknowledgment it was a difficult decision, maybe a little relief.\n\nThese were some of the reactions from world leaders and officials to Joe Biden's Sunday announcement that he was dropping out of the presidential race. Biden had been under intense pressure to step aside after a poor performance in a June debate against former President Donald Trump that highlighted concerns about his age.\n\nWhile diplomatic protocol tends to limit what American allies will say in public about an active U.S. election, many international officials applauded what Biden had, in their view, done to give new energy to the NATO military alliance, his administration's support for Ukraine and for democratic principles around the world.\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nBiden news leaves some voters feeling panicked. If you're stressed, read this.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, President Joe Biden ended his bid for reelection. It's a move many voters have called for on social media and around their dinner tables. Yet, the news that Biden was dropping out had many expressing anxiety and nerves, rather than relief.\n\n\"I'm so nervous now,\" one commenter wrote Sunday beneath an @UnderTheDeskNews summary of day's events. \"Very scary times. I have no words. I'm shaking,\" another added.\n\nExperts say the ups and downs of the political world can cause serious stress for people who feel like all they can do is watch helplessly. \"We're in a state of flux, and brains really don't like ambiguity,\" psychotherapist Stephanie Sarkis says. \"They like knowing what to expect, and so this one more thing that's changed. For a lot of people, it triggers a lot of turmoil.\"\n\n− Charles Trepany\n\nHow old is Joe Biden?\n\nJoe Biden is 81 years old. He was the oldest candidate to run for president before he ended his campaign on Sunday.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho is Wes Moore?\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore has yet to publicly throw his support behind Harris, though his name has been floated as a potential VP pick.\n\nMoore, 45, told CBS last month he would not pursue the nomination himself.\n\nMoore became Maryland’s first ever Black governor after being elected in 2022. He's only the third Black person to be elected governor in the country.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is Mark Kelly?\n\nArizona’s junior senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly quickly cast his support for Harris as nominee Sunday, fueling speculation that he could be tapped to become her running mate.\n\nKelly, 60, has been in Congress since 2020.

He did win Democratic primaries across the country earlier this year.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nTop Democratic leaders come out for Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Whip Katherine Clark D-Mass., and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 2 and No. 3 ranking House Democrats, respectively, endorsed Harris on Monday morning.\n\n“While Donald Trump campaigns on dividing the American people and rigging the system for the rich, Kamala Harris will grow the economy by growing the middle class and defend our core principles of democracy and justice for all,” Clark said in a statement.\n\nAguilar said in a statement he will “do everything I can to elect Kamala Harris the 47th President of the United States.”\n\nHarris is quickly locking up support from congressional Democrats for her campaign. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has yet to weigh in though.– Ken Tran\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear endorses Harris\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear suggested Monday he would be open to joining the Democratic presidential ticket as Harris’ running mate.\n\n“If somebody calls you on that, what you do is at least listen,” Beshear said during an interview on MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nBeshear, often mentioned as a potential candidate for president or vice president, endorsed Harris for president and pledged to do everything he can to support her. Harris “is smart and strong, which will make her a good president,” he said, “but she's also kind and has empathy, which can make her a great president. The contrast between her and those running on the other side couldn't be clearer.”\n\nBeshear, who is in second term as Kentucky governor, said while it’s flattering to be mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, “the only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believed I could further help my people and to help this country.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nHunter Biden shares emotional post on his father\n\nHunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, gave an emotional tribute to his father after he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday.\n\n“For my entire life, I've looked at my dad in awe. How could he suffer so much heartache and yet give so much of whatever remained of his heart to others?” Hunter Biden wrote. “Not only in the policies he passed, but in the individual lives he's touched.”\n\nHe said that over a lifetime, he’s seen his father “absorb the pain of countless everyday Americans who he's given his personal phone number to, because he wanted them to call him when they were hurting.”\n\n“That unconditional love has been his North Star as a President, and as a parent. He is unique in public life today in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years,” Hunter Biden wrote. “I'm so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho is Gavin Newsom?\n\nGavin Newsom has served as California governor since 2019.\n\nNewsom had been seen as a potential presidential candidate to replace Biden, until the 56-year-old came out in support of Harris Sunday evening.

JD Vance.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow old is Donald Trump?\n\nTrump is 78 years old. He is currently the oldest candidate running for president, after Biden dropped out of the race. He formally received the GOP nomination last week at the Republican convention.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the next presidential debate?\n\nThat's complicated. Before Joe Biden's decision to step down, he and Donald Trump agreed to debate on Tuesday, September 10.\n\nHowever, that date could change with Biden's exit from the 2024 election and Harris launching her campaign.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is Kamala Harris' approval rating?\n\nAccording to a 538 average of polls, Kamala Harris has a disapproval rating of 50.4% and an approval rating of 38.6%. Still, those numbers are based on Americans' attitude toward Harris before she launched her second presidential bid, so they could change in the coming weeks and months.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs Biden's exit the latest episode of the 'worst reality TV show in the world'?\n\nIn Oakland, Calfornia, grocery store checker Erica Guthrie burst into tears when she heard the news. In Philadelphia, the Rev. Carl Day says we're living in \"the worst reality TV show in the world right now.\"\n\nAnd in Colorado, stormchaser Jen Walton wants a vacation \"from unprecedented times.\"\n\nAfter months of a seemingly inevitable clash between two long-known and well-understood presidential candidates, President Joe Biden's Sunday decision to halt his reelection effort upended both the campaign and the day-to-day lives of Americans still reeling from the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump the weekend before.\n\nIt all comes atop years of nonstop political turmoil, and many Americans say they're exhausted, excited, anxious and baffled, sometimes all at once.\n\n− Trevor Hughes, Terry Collins and Lauren Villagran\n\nJoe Manchin says he won’t run for president\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin says he won’t seek the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nManchin, an independent who left the Democratic Party in May, reportedly had considered registering again as a Democrat and seeking the party’s presidential nomination after Biden announce he won’t run for a second term.\n\nBut Manchin told CBS News on Monday he’s not running. “I’m not going to be a candidate for president…,” he said. “I don’t need that in my life.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nIs Kamala Harris eligible to run for president?\n\nYes, Harris is eligible to run for president.\n\nShe fulfills all the requirements needed to run for president, which is that a candidate must be 35 years or older, a natural born U.S. citizen and a resident of the U.S. for 14 years. Harris is 59 years old and she was born in California.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow does Harris fare against Trump in the polls?\n\nSome polls show Harris beating Trump by one or two points and others showing her almost neck in neck with the former president.\n\nA Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted between July 5 and July 9, found that 49% of registered voters would choose Harris while 47% would choose Trump.\n\nBut an NBC News poll conducted after the debate found Trump leading Harris 47% to 45% among registered voters. Likewise, a Fox News poll conducted between July 7 and July 10 found that 48% of registered voters would choose Harris if the election were held today compared to 49% for Trump.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden Cabinet members praise his leadership\n\nTwo of President Biden’s Cabinet secretaries – Attorney General Merrick Garland and Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of Homeland Secretary – praised his leadership for following the rule of law and protecting the country.\n\nThe praise contrasted with years of Republican attacks against Biden and his administration. Republicans have investigated the president’s son, Hunter Biden, who was convicted of gun charges and who still faces tax charges. Biden didn’t block the prosecutions.\n\nBiden sat for an interview with a special counsel for investigated how classified documents were found at his home and former office. Republicans are fighting for the recording of the interview, despite the Justice Department releasing the transcript.\n\n“From the beginning of his tenure, President Biden has made clear in both word and deed that he stands for the rule of law and for the Justice Department’s critical mission to protect the safety and the civil rights of everyone in our country,” said Garland, who was held in contempt by the House after refusing to release the recording.\n\nRepublicans have also accused the administration of weakening border security, allowing unprecedented waves of undocumented immigrants to enter. But Mayorkas said the country and world are better for Biden’s leadership in protecting the American people.\n\n“When it comes to homeland security, he has taken and directed bold, innovative, and decisive actions to help safeguard our communities, secure our borders, harness the power of artificial intelligence, advance our cybersecurity, eradicate the scourge of fentanyl, and more – all while standing up for our nation’s values,” said Mayorkas, who was impeached by the House over border security. “It is a privilege to advance his vision of and for a strong, secure, and prosperous America.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHarris is frontrunner to become Democratic nominee\n\nThe Democratic Party won’t officially name its presidential nominee until its convention in August, but Harris is the immediate frontrunner.\n\nBiden, who chosen Harris as his vice presidential running mate four years ago, emphatically endorsed her to be the party’s nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nSome other prominent Democrats also endorsed her, including Bill and Hillary Clinton. Others, including Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued statements lauding Biden but without explicitly endorsing Harris to succeed him.\n\nHarris, however, has several advantages. She has already been vetted for national office during her tenure as Biden’s second-in-command. She has also been a part of Biden’s reelection apparatus for months.\n\n–Karissa Waddick and Michael Collins\n\nDelegates will pick Democratic nominee\n\nBiden endorsed Harris to become the Democratic nominee for president, but it’s the party’s 3,896 delegates who will pick their candidate.\n\nDelegates can vote for someone other than Biden even if he won their states’ primaries earlier this year.\n\nThat's possible because of a section in the DNC rules referred to as the \"good conscience\" clause, which states delegates shall \"in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\" The word “sentiment” is where much of the delegates' support will hinge and opens the door to interpretation.\n\nSo delegates could vote for Biden, Harris or someone else. There is no system to automatically transfer the delegates from Biden to Harris.\n\n–Kathryn Palmer and Michael Collins\n\nSecond gentleman Douglas Emhoff: Biden 'a true patriot'\n\nHarris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, has offered his thoughts on Biden’s withdrawal from the race.\n\n“I am deeply grateful to @POTUS and @FLOTUS for their years of friendship and support,” the second gentleman wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “President Biden is a true patriot who leads our nation with honesty, decency, and integrity. Alongside @VP, they have fought tirelessly for families and communities, delivering for Americans across our nation.

A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans,\" Harris told a cheering crowd at the Democratic convention.\n\nHarris spent much of 2024 campaigning as President Joe Biden's running mate. But on Thursday, she talked to the party that swiftly rallied around her after he ended his reelection bid. She laid out how she would address the major debates facing the nation, ranging from abortion rights to the southern border and the economy.\n\nThe vice president's speech comes after her own running mate, Minnesota Gov.

And as president I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.”\n\nOn the war in Gaza, Harris said “now is the time to get a hostage deal and a cease-fire deal done.”\n\n“Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself,” she said. “Because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on Oct. 7.”\n\nShe also said “what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating.”\n\n“The scale of suffering is heartbreaking,” she said. “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages is released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nReproductive rights get center-stage moment in Harris’ speech\n\nBashing her opponent and the GOP’s record, Harris highlighted reproductive rights as a key issue in the first presidential election since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\n“Simply put, they are out of their minds,” Harris said of Trump and Republicans. “And one must ask, why exactly is it that they don’t trust women?”\n\n“Well, we trust women,” she continued, adding that as president she would “proudly sign” legislation to enshrine abortion access.\n\nAs vice president, Harris has been the leading voice in the current Biden administration on reproductive rights and abortion access – a winning issue for many Democrats since 2022.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris vows to bring back bipartisan border deal Trump bashed\n\nHarris said that after decades in law enforcement, she knows the “importance of safety and security, especially at our border.”\n\n“Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades,” she said. The bill was killed by Senate Republicans in February after pressure from Trump.\n\n“Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal,” she alleged. “Well I refuse to play politics with our security.

She said her term would also also allow Americans to “fully make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home,” she said, referring to reproductive rights and other matters.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump hits Harris and her speech\n\nNot exactly breaking news: Donald Trump gave bad reviews to Kamala Harris' acceptance speech.\n\nIn a constant stream of Truth Social posts, Trump assailed the vice president's remarks on items ranging from the condition of her former home city of San Francisco to inflation, immigration and relations with other countries.\n\nAfter Harris accused him of wanting to be an autocrat, Trump concluded by saying: \"The Tyrants are laughing at her, she’s weak and ineffective, and for three and a half years she has done nothing except enabled them to get STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!\"\n\nAt another point, Trump pointed out that Harris and President Joe Biden have ignored the issues that came up in the speech: \"No specific programs, ALL TALK, NO ACTION - Why didn’t she do it three and a half years ago.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHarris zeroes in on Trump in convention address\n\nKamala Harris called out former President Donald Trump by name in her acceptance speech, saying the former president is “in many ways ... an unserious man.”\n\n“But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious,” Harris said.\n\nPointing to what she called the “chaos and calamity” of his first term, Harris raised alarms about her 2024 opponent.\n\n“Consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol,” she said, referring to Trump’s comments about potentially pardoning January 6, 2021 rioters.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris lays out her record as a prosecutor\n\nHarris walked the crowd through her history as a prosecutor, both at the local level and as California's attorney general. \"As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them,\" she said.\n\n\"As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation,\" she said.\n\nHarris said she stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by for-profit colleges and workers who were cheated out of their wages.\n\n\"I fought against the cartels who traffic in dugs and guns and human beings, who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities,\" she said. \"And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices.

Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said the DNC’s decision not to platform a Palestinian-American speaker at the convention was a “huge mistake.” That had been a key ask of the protesters seeking to push the Democratic Party towards a more pro-Palestinian stance.\n\n“I think it undermines our messaging about unity, about diversity,” said Omar, one of the most vocal critics of Israel in Congress.\n\nOmar said she spoke with the DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, multiple times in an effort to push the committee to change their mind. \"Last I heard from the Harris campaign was for us to be patient,” she said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Harris has touted her and Biden’s efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

And when it came to Kamala and me, Mommy had great expectations for us, but she had even greater expectations of us.”\n\n“She raised us to believe that we could be and do anything, and we believed her.”\n\nMaya Harris said that she wishes her mom, who died in 2009, could have attended the convention.\n\n“ I can just see her smiling, saying how proud she is of Kamala,” said Maya Harris.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDon't bet on a Beyoncéappearance\n\nBeyoncé's publicist Yvette Noel-Schure shut down speculation about Beyoncé appearing at the DNC, despite reports.\n\nMinutes before fans hoped to see the \"Cowboy Carter\" singer on the convention stag, Noel-Schure posted to her Instagram.\n\n\"At home watching and anticipating the VP’s historic speech,” she wrote. “Focus on the win and register to vote.

Adam Kinzinger acknowledged the “awkward alliance” between himself and Democrats.\n\n“I never thought I’d be here, but listen,” he told the audience, “you never thought you’d see me here, did you?”\n\n“The Republican party is no longer conservative. It has switched its allegiance from the principles that gave it purpose to a man whose only purpose is himself,” Kinzinger added, referring to former President Trump.\n\nA turning point, Kinzinger said, was January 6, 2021. He was one of two Republicans to serve on the House committee investigating the insurrection at the Capitol. “How can a party claim to be patriotic if it idolizes a man who tried to overthrow a free and fair election?” Kinzinger asked.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nEva Longoria calls on Democrats to say ‘she se puede’\n\nActress Eva Longoria put a new twist on a popular chant as she urged the crowd to root for Harris’ success.

It was hard, but not extraordinary. It's life. Those nights reminded me who I was fighting for, people just trying to make it. Kamala Harris knows who she's fighting for too,” she said.\n\nWhitmer also knocked Trump in her remarks, saying he can’t relate with everyday families.\n\n“You think he understands that when your car breaks down? You can't get to work? No, his first word was probably chauffeur. You think he's ever had to take items out of the cart before checking out? Hell, you think he's ever been to a grocery store?

These veterans represent the best of our country. We stand united as veterans, Democrats and patriots to fight for everyone who serves.”\n\nGallego said “politicians like Donald Trump” don’t stand with veterans. He referred to Trump’s frequent insults to the late Sen.

Twenty-six people were killed at the school in a mass shooting on Dec. 14, 2012.\n\nKim Rubio recalled when her daughter Lexi walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, for the last time.\n\n“It’s 10:30am at Robb Elementary in Uvalde,” Rubio said. “The school is recognizing my 10 year old daughter, Lexi, for receiving all A's. She receives a good citizen award, and we pose for photos. She wears a St Mary's sweatshirt and a smile that lights up the room.”\n\n“30 minutes later, a gunman murders her 18 classmates and two teachers. We are taken to a private room where police tell us she isn't coming home,” Rubio said.\n\nMelody McFadden told convention attendees about when her niece was shot in Myrtle Beach. “10 years of waiting, and Sandy's murder is still unsolved.

In 1972 she became the first Black candidate to run for a major party’s nomination and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party’s nomination.\n\n“Fifty-two years ago I was one of the youth directors in her campaign for president,” Sharpton said of Chisholm. “And 52 years after she was told to sit down, I know she’s watching us tonight as a Black woman stands up to accept the nomination for president of the United States.”\n\nHe contrasted Harris’ record with Trump’s on voting rights, civil rights and more, as the crowd chanted “won’t go back.”\n\n“I see one candidate who wants to protect the right to vote while the other has tried to cook up 11,000 votes in Georgia,” Sharpton said. “I see a candidate who, with Joe Biden, brought leaders to the White House to confront violent hatred, running against a man who said neo-Nazis in Charlottesville were fine people.

And that is the difference between a criminal and a prosecutor.”\n\nWarren said Harris will work to make life more affordable for working families.\n\n“Donald Trump, the felon, has no plans to lower costs for families,” Warren said. “He doesn’t know how. And basically, he doesn’t really care. When did he ever fill up a gas tank or worry about a grocery bill? The only bills he worries about are from his criminal defense lawyers.

They're selling you a lie. It's in the bag with the diapers. Prices are up because these corporations are scheming to drive them up.”\n\nHe added that “most companies are good companies. It's the food conglomerates that sit behind the supermarkets, the faceless wholesalers, they're the ones who are extorting families at the checkout counter.”\n\n“I've been fighting to ban price gouging on food, and next year, when she's president, Kamala Harris will sign a bill to do just that,” Casey said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHarris shares wedding anniversary date with eldest senator\n\nVice President Harris and husband Doug Emhoff celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary Thursday, on the final night of the Democratic convention.\n\nAlso celebrating today: Sen.

Originally from Brooklyn and raised in New Jersey, Emhoff became an attorney in Los Angeles, focusing on entertainment and intellectual property law. In 2013, one of Emhoff’s clients – who also happened to be Harris’ best friend – set the pair up on a date.\n\nHarris and Emhoff were married in 2014 in Santa Barbara, California where Harris’ sister, Maya, officiated.

There was no coup, however; the party turned to Vice President Harris after Biden withdrew from the race last month.\n\nTo be sure, Trump did use most of his remarks Thursday to criticize the Bush-Harris administration's record on border security. The event that lasted more than an hour also featured family members who have lost loved ones in crimes committed by people who are in the country illegally.\n\nIn criticizing Harris, Trump said Harris \"will not mention the victims\" in her acceptance speech on Thursday night.

Josh Shapiro as a “highly overrated Jewish Governor” and slammed his support for Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump, in a post on Truth Social Wednesday night after Shapiro spoke at the Democratic National Convention, wrote that Shapiro “made a really bad and poorly delivered speech” for Harris – someone who Trump said “hates Israel and will do nothing” to help Israel survive.\n\n“Yet Shapiro, for strictly political reasons, refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had,” Trump wrote. “I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close. Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will.”\n\nShapiro, who is Jewish, was among the final contenders for Harris’ vice-presidential running-mate before Harris ultimately picked Minnesota Gov.

The GOP broadly supports an agenda of low taxes and light regulation.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden’s big-spend infusions into the U.S. economy have been welcomed by some industries, he and other Democrats have taken a more aggressive tone towards large companies, blaming corporate greed for some of Americans’ affordability issues. Vice President Kamala Harris recently announced a proposal to ban price-gouging in the food and grocery industries.\n\nDaniella Ballou-Aares leads the Leadership Now Project, a business group focused on “protecting American democracy.” She said executives are split between the two parties, and argued the prospect of an authoritarian turn is making some in that group nervous.\n\n“Do business leaders like all Democratic policies?

Amy Klobuchar suggested those shifting fault lines could be a good thing for antitrust-minded Democrats.\n\n“There is a lot of competition about competition,” Klobuchar said. “When you look through history, that actually is what’s gotten things going. … When you’ve got some buy-in from both sides.”\n\nVance, the Republicans’ vice presidential nominee, has praised the current Federal Trade Commission Chair, Lina Khan, who is controversial even among Democrats for her strong anti-monopoly intervention.\n\nSo far, Vice President Kamala Harris has signaled she will embrace a populist economic platform, arguing large corporations have helped drive Americans’ affordability issues. Though key details of her platform remain in flux: some of Harris' big donors have been pushing her to replace Khan.\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nMaggot probe continues in Chicago\n\nAuthorities are still investigating whether saboteurs put insects into a breakfast buffet for delegates at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, sickening one person.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday morning, Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling declined to discuss specifics of the investigation at the Fairmont Chicago hotel.

When Georgia was called on to cast their votes, the cameras panned to Lil Jon atop the United Center stadium stairs in Chicago.\n\n\"YEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHH,\" the Atlanta rapper said as the intro to \"Turn Down for What,\" played on the speaker.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nMuslim Women for Harris-Walz disbands\n\nThe group Muslim Women for Harris-Walz announced it is disbanding after the campaign refused a request from the uncommitted movement to give a Palestinian American a speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"We cannot in good conscience continue Muslim Women for Harris-Walz,\" the group said in a statement. \"We pray that the DNC and VP Harris’ team makes the right decision before this convention is over. For the sake of each of us.”\n\nThe uncommitted movement has for months pushed Democratic leaders to implement an arms embargo to Israel and work toward a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Delegates from the group organized a sit-in outside of the convention on Wednesday, saying they would stay put until Harris' campaign allowed a Palestinian speaker on stage.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWhat Shyamala Gopalan's legacy means to Kamala Harris\n\nIn the story of Kamala Harris’ life, her mother steals the show. The vice president would have it no other way.\n\n“Mommy, you are the star of this book because you are the reason for everything,” Harris wrote in her 2019 memoir “The Truths We Hold.” “There is no title or honor on earth I’ll treasure more than to say I am Shyamala Gopalan Harris’ daughter.”\n\nGopalan, a breast cancer researcher who died in 2009 at age 70 of colon cancer, won't see her daughter accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president on Thursday, but she will be a strong presence.\n\nGopalan set out on her own across the world at the age of 19, defying her native culture. She raised two girls to identify both with her own background and one that was totally alien to her. She encouraged them to excel and exceed expectations but not leave others behind. And she did it all while performing important scientific work of her own.\n\nRead more on Harris and her mother's legacy in her life.\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nDNC schedule Thursday: See full list of events, where to watch Democratic convention\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz visits home delegation, touts importance of today\n\nFresh off his convention floor speech, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz joked with Minnesota Democrats that Thursday was an important day.\n\n\"Look, it's an important day. The eyes of the world are focused on this day because it's the day that the Minnesota State Fair opens up,\" Walz told delegates at the Fairmont Chicago.\n\nWalz thanked his home-state delegates for supporting him and his wife Gwen in recent weeks.\n\n\"We're ready to take the Minnesota values that you all taught us,\" Walz said. \"Everybody who I talk to across this country, when I talk to them, they want to be Minnesota.\"\n\n— Jessie Balmert\n\nWhat people are saying about Kamala Harris: 'A vibe I’m feeling'\n\nPolls suggest millions of Americans are changing their presidential voting plans with Harris currently topping the Democratic ticket, signing up for who she is and what they feel she represents.\n\nMany voters interviewed by USA TODAY find themselves surprised to be supporting the new Democratic candidate for president this year, swept up in the excitement and \"vibes\" of her campaign.\n\nThere are at least four distinct groups of Harris supporters: The Democrats who would have voted for whoever their party put at the top of the ticket; the Democrats who weren't sure they would have bothered to vote for Biden, but are enthusiastically behind Harris; the undecideds who have come down on the side of Harris; and the former Trump supporters who are excited about someone new.\n\nRead what Americans are saying about the Harris campaign.\n\n— Terry Collins, Deborah Barfield Berry and Trevor Hughes\n\nPoet Amanda Gorman, comedian Kenan Thompson among Wednesday highlights\n\nAmanda Gorman, the country's first national youth poet laureate, delivered a poem that drew applause and cheers from the audience at the Democratic convention on Wednesday night.\n\nGorman debuted a new poem called \"This Sacred Scene\".\n\n“Only now approaching this rare air are we aware that perhaps the American Dream is no dream at all, but instead a dare to dream together,” she said in one of her lines.\n\nComedian Kenan Thompson took the stage to continue criticizing Project 2025, a policy blueprint from the Heritage Foundation for potential new Republican administration, though Trump has continually denied association with the it.\n\n“You ever seen a document that can kill a small animal and democracy at the same time?” the comedian said while holding a large hardback copy of the project.\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi, Amaris Ecinas and Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris ushers in a new Democratic era, stepping out of Biden shadow\n\nAs President Joe Biden gave a tearful goodbye to the Democratic Party this week, a liberated Kamala Harris stepped out of his shadow and commandeered the national stage.\n\nThe handoff at the Democratic convention, one of several Biden farewells, was a visceral example of how the country is changing, with the first Black and Asian American woman topping a presidential ballot.\n\nNow, Harris has less than three months to convince the rest of America to entrust her with a four-year presidential term. She has raced to lay out an agenda that hits on Americans’ most pressing problems that excites the party’s base and is palatable to moderates.\n\nAfter years of quiet inroads on issues she cares about without undermining the president’s agenda, the pressure is on for Harris to provide a detailed vision of her own coming out of the party’s four-day gathering in Chicago.\n\nRead more as Harris prepares for her acceptance speech tonight.\n\n— Francesca Chambers and Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump: I'd be 'honored' by Kennedy endorsement\n\nDonald Trump wouldn't say whether he has spoken with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in recent days, but made clear he would welcome an endorsement from the independent candidate.\n\n\"If he endorsed me, I would be honored by it — I would be very honored by it,\" Trump said during an early morning interview on \"Fox & Friends\" otherwise devoted to attacking Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\n\nTrump praised Kennedy during the Fox interview, quite a change from earlier this year when he denounced the independent candidate as a \"Radical Left Liberal\" whose candidacy would hurt him and help the Democrats.\n\nKennedy is expected to withdraw from the presidential race later this week.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nJewish Democrats have party loyalties tested in 2024 election\n\nJewish Democrats have had their party loyalties tested this election year as the left flank's support for the plight of the Palestinians has, at times, seemed to have taken on anti-Semitic undertones in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks and the subsequent Gaza war that's led to an estimated 40,000 Palestinian deaths.\n\nThe pushback from the left has been on display during protests at this week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Democrats nominated Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nThe split among Democrats and progressives over the war in Gaza is partly generational − with even some young Jewish Americans opposing Israel's war in Gaza. The right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has caused some younger Jewish Americans to push back at Israel.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll in March found that 42% of American Jews between the ages of 18 years old and 34 believe the way Israel is carrying out its war against Hamas is \"unacceptable.\" Only 27% of Jewish Americans ages 50 to 64 years old said it is \"unacceptable.\"\n\nRead more on the divisions facing some Democrats.\n\n— Joey Garrison and Rebecca Morin\n\nGus Walz in Wednesday night's most touching moment: 'I love you, dad.'\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the vice-presidential running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, has spoken openly and lovingly about his neurodivergent 17-year-old son Gus, who has ADHD, along with a non-verbal learning disorder and an anxiety disorder. Walz and his wife, Gwen, both former teachers, said recently in a statement to People magazine that they never considered Gus’ conditions an obstacle.\n\nWhen Walz delivered his acceptance speech inside the packed United Center arena Wednesday night, Gus watched from the audience with his mother and sister, Hope, and sobbed.\n\n“Hope, Gus and Gwen – you are my entire world, and I love you,” Walz said.\n\nGus Walz sprung from his seat, moved by his father's words.\n\nHe pointed his index finger, saying \"I love you, dad.\"\n\nRead more about Gus and how advocates for Americans with learning disabilities believe the Walz family's openness about their son and their willingness to speak publicly about the experience will raise much-needed visibility that could help others who are going through similar issues.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nWalz hometown view: Locals at DNC watch party cheer on their former football coach\n\nDemocratic National Convention highlights: Tim Walz makes everyman pitch\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz played up his role as the everyman on the Democratic ticket on Wednesday night by talking about his time as a high school teacher and coach while accepting his party's nomination for vice president.\n\nTaking the stage as the night's keynote speaker, Walz revved up the crowd by bragging about his policy record as governor. He talked up cutting prescription drug costs and establishing free school lunch for students while defending abortion rights and establishing firearm regulations. But the 60-year-old Democrat also underscored how the heart of his progressive values — and differences with the Republican ticket — are about respecting others.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from Wednesday night:\n\n'A dad in plaid' Walz speech: Democrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar introducing her home-state governor as a “dad in plaid.” They even brought out former students and football players on the stage sporting jerseys while playing up his military service (which has come under attack by the GOP). The message was clearly aimed at Midwest voters across the blue wall, particularly in rural white working-class areas where Democrats have struggled.\n\nDemocrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen.

Bill Clinton's complicated legacy with modern Democrats: In the 1990s, William Jefferson Clinton was the boss of the Democratic Party, and considered one of the best political communicators of the age. the former president is still thought of fondly by a segments of the party who believe he could be an asset this cycle. Still showcasing the 42nd president could also backfire and aggravate younger generations of Democrats, who find it hard reconcile with Clinton's tenure scarred by an extramarital affair with an intern. That sort of misbehavior is looked at much differently among progressives, especially in the post-#MeToo era.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey and Joey Garrison\n\nTim Walz speech: VP pick chooses a folksier intro to voters\n\nCall him Coach.\n\nNever mind that Tim Walz has been governor of Minnesota for the past five years and a congressman for a dozen years before that. As he seeks a promotion to vice president, he chose a folksier introduction Wednesday to Americans who had no idea who he was until Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate two weeks ago.\n\nNot a pol, not at heart. Instead, a husband and father, a deer hunter and a car guy, a social studies teacher and a basketball coach from the Gopher State who helped turn his high-school team from losers to state champions.\n\n\"I haven't given a lot of big speeches like this, but I have given a lot of pep talks, so let me finish with this,\" Walz declared to cheers as he accepted the vice-presidential nomination on the third night of the Democratic National Convention. \"It's the fourth quarter.

And listen to Greg Tish’s morning show on Real Talk 93.3 where we'll discuss the legacy of these history makers.\n\nThe only condition is that those featured below must be deceased. Ten names will be added periodically, so be sure to check back for updates into 2025.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the first 100 names.\n\nJustice James Diament Westcott, Jr. (1839 - 1887)\n\nTallahassee born James Diament Westcott III, who preferred “Junior” rather than James the Third, had a knack for law and politics.\n\nBy the age of 28, Westcott served as the Assistant Secretary of the Florida Senate, the private secretary of Governor Madison S. Perry, and as a captain in the Confederate States Army.\n\nAfter the war he was elected as a Leon County representative to the Florida House.\n\nThe year he turned 30, he was elected attorney general. It was a remarkable feat because Westcott ran as a Democrat in the year a new Florida Constitution gave voting rights to freed slaves who registered as Republicans and the GOP won in landslides up and down the ballot.\n\nWithin a few weeks of the election Republican Gov. Harrison Reed appointed Westcott to the Florida Supreme Court, making him the youngest justice in Florida history.\n\nHe would serve for 17 years and would write 267 opinions – the most in Florida history.\n\nWestcott received his entire academic education at West Florida Seminary – which would become Florida State University, for which he was eternally grateful.\n\nUpon his death, he left his entire estate to West Florida Seminary. The principal would produce about $69,000 annually.\n\nThat was enough to provide a financial lifeline for the struggling institution – the stability needed for the school to evolve into a state-supported university. Today, a portion of the proceeds goes toward financial assistance for low-income students.\n\nWestcott died in 1887 and is buried in Tallahassee’s Old City Cemetery. In 1936, Florida State University named its administration building in his honor.\n\nGilbert Chandler (1889 - 1978)\n\nIn 1925, a Minnesota asparagus farmer was disappointed when he stopped for a night in Tallahassee – he found no place to stay, not even space to pitch a tent.\n\nThe disappointment would lead Gilbert Chandler to build a Tallahassee landmark, The Cottages of Lake Ella.\n\nChandler had $2,000 in his pocket when he ventured out of the land of lakes to seek his fortune as a “Tin Can Tourist,” the nickname for motorists touring the countryside at the dawn of the auto age.\n\nIn California, he stayed at an “auto camp,” cottages furnished with a bench, table and electric light.\n\nChandler told Susan Poplin for a Florida State University history thesis that the two-room cabins cost $750 to build and produced a 400% annual profit.\n\nChandler considered himself a Horatio Alger up-from-the-bootstrap character and after a quick look around a tiny state capital city that would soon be located at the intersection of two proposed U.S. highways (27 & 90), he decided to stay and pioneer auto camping in Florida.\n\nFirst, he paid $400 for some lots along the railroad tracks on Gaines Street. He built 10 cabins and a communal washroom and charged $1 a night to stay.\n\nTwo years later, he bought five acres north of town and built the Tallahassee Tourist Camp along a dirt road at Lake Ella. Once the road was paved and became U.S. 27, he expanded his camp with the Tallahassee Motor Hotel on the west side of the highway and the Lake Ella Motor Court on the east side.\n\nThe motor court consisted of 15 cottages. They were converted into apartments during a World War II housing shortage and rented for $30 a month.\n\nChandler used the money to upgrade the cottages with carpets, steam heat and the latest innovations. At war’s end and a tourism boom underway, Chandler promoted the Lake Ella Motor Court with hand-made billboards across the southeast.\n\nHe posted 4-by-8 feet red and yellow silkscreen painted signs advertising a motor court on the shore of Tallahassee's “beautiful Lake Ella,” every 10 miles on roads leading into and out of Birmingham, Atlanta, Daytona Beach, Tampa and the panhandle.\n\nOne night while out posting signs, “Dad called home to ask about business and Mom said they were full. People told her they’d been following the signs for hundreds of miles just to stop for the night,” Gilbert Chandler Jr., told the Tallahassee Democrat’s Andy Lindstrom in 1995 for a history of the Lake Ella cottages.\n\nAfter Gilbert Chandler passed, his heirs retired from the hospitality business. What had grown into the 92-room Tallahassee Motor Hotel on the west side of Monroe was torn down in the 1990s to make room for a Golden Corral restaurant.\n\nAcross the street, 11 of the original 15 cottages still stand, converted into specialty shops for the bustling Midtown neighborhood.\n\nTheir once white trim now is blue and grey, the multi-colored shingles replaced with brown ones, but they still sport marble facades. It is said, when a ton of marble was accidentally delivered to Tallahassee, Chandler bought it for a bargain to spruce up his cottages.\n\nChandler was a World War I veteran, Free Mason, and a Shriner who built an iconic Tallahassee destination after a disappointing first night in town.\n\nAquilina Howell (1917 - 2000)\n\nAquilina Howell was born on West Georgia Street and would go on to spend 42 years working in Leon County schools as a teacher and administrator.\n\nWhat's in a name? The historic figures and educators behind Leon County school names\n\nHowell was the first woman to serve as an Assistant Superintendent in Leon County and is credited as the driving force behind the peaceful desegregation of Tallahassee's public schools\n\n“Aquilina had unbelievable processing skills,\" said former school superintendent Charles Couch who appointed her assistant superintendent. “She could take angry people, get them to look at the issues calmly, and solve the problem in win-win fashion for everyone.”\n\nCouch, and others, recall how Howell led Leon schools during desegregation without the discord and violence that plagued other communities.\n\n“She could always make you calm down and see the other person’s point and make you think you did all the solving,” her sister Lucille Alexander told Gerald Ensley at Howell’s passing. “I used to say to her, ‘All right, Mr. Ralph Bunche.’” (Bunche was the first Black to win the Nobel Peace Prize.)\n\nHowell was married for 51 years to Tallahassee insurance agent Sam Howell, who passed in 1994. Howell died in 2000.\n\nThe Taylor House, where she was born, is now a museum celebrating Frenchtown and the Tallahassee Civil Rights movement.\n\nIn recognition of the path, she set a path for educators, civil activists, and community leaders, supporters created the Aquilina C. Howell Education Scholarship at Florida A&M University for first- and second-year students who graduated from a Leon County high school.\n\nAnd Howell’s name can still be spotted around town; including the Leon County schools administrative building on West Pensacola Street, and the Carter-Howell-Strong Park in Frenchtown.\n\nCarrie Meek (1926 - 2021)\n\nCarrie Meek, the grandchild of a slave and a sharecropper’s daughter as a child, was not allowed to enter the Florida State Capitol because she was Black.\n\nAs a 12-year-old Girl Scout, Meek was blocked at the front door when white members of her Girl Scout Troop delivered home-made brownies to Florida lawmakers. As a Lincoln High School and Florida A&M University graduate, she would be the first Black woman to represent Florida in the U.S. Congress since Reconstruction.\n\nWillie and Carrie Pittman’s daughter broke many racial, gender, and educational barriers.\n\nIn a 1992 interview with the Washington Post, she recalled in Jim Crow Tallahassee there weren’t any decent recreational facilities for Black people, and because she was Black, she couldn’t try on shoes in stores or pursue a master’s degree in her hometown.\n\nMeek earned a Master of Science at the University of Michigan after being awarded a B.S. in biology at FAMU in 1948, and after a career as a South Florida educator she would win a 1979 special election to represent Miami in the Florida House.\n\nIn 1982, she became the first Black woman elected to the Florida Senate.\n\nAs a politician, Meek was an unapologetic Democrat firebrand with an agenda rooted in the inequities she lived and witnessed.\n\nShe is remembered as an advocate for minorities, immigrants, and the working poor. And as someone who routinely intensified the debate.\n\nIn Tallahassee when Meek wanted to kill a bill, she would stand on the floor and wave a black flag of death adorned with a skull and crossbones.\n\nIn 1994, Meek provoked a massive argument with new Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. She chided Gingrich for negotiating a multi-million-dollar book deal with a publishing company that had a stake in telecommunications legislation.\n\nMeek said Gingrich stood “to make a whole lot of dust” from the deal.\n\nRepublicans struck Meek’s comments from the Congressional Record. The argument that followed dominated the coverage of the New York Times, Washington Post, and the television news networks.\n\n“The only thing missing up here is my black flag,” Meek told the Miami Herald at the time.\n\nCarrie Meek never lost an election. She retired from politics in 2002.\n\nThe Carrie Meek – James N. Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum in Tallahassee, Florida, on the campus of Florida A&M University, is co-named in Meek's honor.\n\nHenry Livingston Rutgers (1810 - 1861)\n\nIn 1836, Henry Livingston Rutgers, direct kin of the namesake of Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey, married Jane Barnwall and the two moved to Tallahassee.\n\nFlorida Territorial Gov. William P. Duval had appointed Henry the Territorial Administrator and Treasurer.\n\nRutgers would go on to serve the territory and city for more than two decades. And although he was an early and apparently prominent settler, little is written about him.\n\nIn 1845, Rutgers cast a vote as an elector for the first Florida State Governor, William Dunn Moseley.\n\nRutgers also served two terms on the Tallahassee City Council and Circuit Court Judge Jesse J. Finely appointed him as an investigator in the renowned Croom-Smith Case of 1857 – which decided ownership of Goodwood Plantation’s 200 enslaved workers.\n\nIn 1856, the Floridian and Journal newspaper, according to the Tallahassee Heritage Foundation, reported the opening of a new state bank on Monroe Street, to which the paper added, \"We are indebted to Mr. H. L. Rutgers.\"\n\nThe Foundation suggests that druggist B. C. Lewis, who opened his own bank that year had bought the building from Rutgers.\n\nRutgers hired freedman George Proctor to build him two homes in Tallahassee – the Randall-Lewis House at 424 North Calhoun St., and the Rutgers House across Calhoun and now the Tallahassee Garden Center.\n\nIt was in a cabin on Rutgers’ Calhoun St property where Antonio Proctor, the scout and interpreter for the Simmons/Williams expedition that selected the site for Florida’s capital city, would pass in 1855.\n\nFredrich R. Cotten (1819 - 1878)\n\nFredrich R. Cotten had big plans for Florida when he came to Tallahassee in 1845. He got himself elected to the first Florida House of Representatives and then he developed a vast section of land that is today upper-middle class neighborhoods in north, northwest Tallahassee into the second largest cotton plantation in Leon County.\n\nSixty years later his grandson, Fred Cotten Elliot, would have even bigger land use plans.\n\nHe would try to drain the Everglades.\n\nBy 1850, Virginian Fredrich R. Cotten had transformed a wide swath of what is now north Tallahassee and west Leon County into a $12 million – in today's money – cotton growing operation.\n\nThat land today is a collection of upper middle class subdivisions, a country club, and Lake Jackson boat landings.\n\nCotten’s Burgesstown Plantation took in more than 8,000 acres from the Ochlocknee River and Lake Iamonia south to the Luna Pines neighborhood, east through Phipps-Overstreet Park and the eastern shore of Lake Jackson to Miller's Landing, then north to Golden Eagle Plantation, and Killearn Lakes Plantation.\n\nAccounting records indicate that shipments of cotton went regularly from Burgesstown via St. Marks to New York with proceeds credited to Cotten.\n\nThe Leon County Florida 1860 Agricultural Census shows Cotten was the single largest slaveholder in the county, with 275 enslaved workers.\n\nWhen Cotten passed in 1878, he was buried at Saint John's Episcopal Church Cemetery.\n\nCotten's heirs would sell Burgesstown to Lloyd Griscom of Philadelphia who in 1901 converted the land into a quail hunting plantation. Griscom’s son, Lloyd Carpenter Griscom, would purchase the Tallahassee Democrat in 1929 and the family would own the paper until 1965.\n\nCotten's grandson Fred Cotten Elliot became the state's chief civil engineer at the Internal Improvement Fund, now the Department of Environmental Protection. In 1913, Elliot developed a plan and directed an effort to drain the Everglades to create farmland.\n\nElliot joined a team of eight that hack through sawgrass to clear a path for barges, and he designed the first giant swamp buggies that allowed construction crews and farm workers to operate in the marshes of the Everglades.\n\nWhen he got back home after his Everglades adventure, Elliot laid out the first few holes of the Capital City Country Club golf course.\n\nThe state-owned Elliot Building, on the SE corner of Pensacola and Monroe, across from the Capitol was named for him. It is scheduled to be demolished and the site will become a Memorial Park, whose purpose is to honor Florida history and commemorate victims of slavery and the Holocaust.\n\nJayleen Woods (1934 - 2006)\n\nIn 1972, Jayleen Woods was included in a Tallahassee Democrat story about women who had “invaded” “men only” professions like public relations managers, commonly referred to as \"spokesmen\" by the media.\n\nWoods was a wordsmith. She was a writer and editor for the Florida Flambeau, Tallahassee Democrat and Tampa Tribune. Woods also worked 17 years as the Director of Information Services at Florida State University, where she served as the university’s spokesperson, and later as the editor of the Florida Hotel and Motel Association magazine for 30 years.\n\nWoods said she had “printer’s ink in her veins.”\n\nShe got a big infusion of it after a poem she wrote as a 12-year-old, about a volunteer group called The Red Feathers, appeared on the front page of her hometown newspaper in Bristol, CT.\n\nFive years later, she accepted a writing scholarship to Florida State University, where she would become a member of the Flying High Circus and edit the student newspaper the Florida Flambeau.\n\nAfter graduating from FSU, Woods took a job with the Tampa Tribune and then met Tom Woods of Tallahassee. That would lead to a move back to the Capital City and Woods breaking glass ceilings as she moved into management positions that previously were a male domain.\n\nTom and Jayleen were married for 48 years and had two daughters. He preceded her in death.\n\nIn retirement, Jayleen created fund-raising brochures for the Girl Scout Council and its Apalachee Camp for All Seasons. She also remained active with the League of Women Voters, Springtime Tallahassee, the Women’s Club of Tallahassee, and the Seminole Boosters.\n\nThomas DeSaille Tucker (1844 - 1903)\n\nA native of British Sierra Leon, Thomas DeSaille Tucker was a lawyer and missionary who became the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students, which became Florida A&M University.\n\nHe was a graduate of Oberlin College in Ohio and taught at schools for emancipated slaves in Kentucky and Louisiana, before opening a law office in Pensacola.\n\nTucker devoted his life to combatting slavery, according to a Oberlin College biography.\n\n\"The colored men in this country have no voice in the general government; even in some of the States they have no voice in the State government,\" he wrote to a friend in Africa. \"It would fairly sicken you to be here on a fourth of July and hear guns firing and 'starspangled banner' waving 'over the land of the free and the home of the brave' while there are this day 4,000,000 of slaves in their possession. O what a hypocrisy. God will not always sleep but will yet come in judgment against this country except they speedily repent.\"\n\nIn 1887, Tucker accepted appointment as the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students in DeFuniak Springs. With an infusion of federal money, Tucker moved the school to Tallahassee onto property once owned by Gov. Willliam Duval.\n\nWhen the State Board of Education selected Tucker to be the school’s first president, the editor of a local newspaper wrote:\n\n“We have known Professor Tucker for about 18 years and we have never met a more genial, broadminded and sterling gentleman. He possesses first-class qualities as a friend, gentleman and scholar, and commands the respect of all who know him. He is a strong man, morally and intellectually, and the new Normal has a security of success under his charge.”\n\nTucker served as president until an argument with William N. Sheats over the school’s direction. Sheats wanted Tucker to focus on agricultural and industrial education, Tucker insisted on a liberal arts education.\n\nSheats was appointed Superintendent in 1895 and slowly reduced Tucker’s authority and reduced the school’s budget and questioned spending until Tucker was finally ousted in 1901.\n\nTucker moved to Jacksonville where he practiced law until his death in 1903.\n\nThe Sims; Robert (1924 - 1966), Helen (1932 - 1966), Joy (1954 - 1966)\n\nThree members of the Sims family are the victims in a story that local lore holds as the moment Tallahassee lost its innocence.\n\nOctober 22, 1966, was a football Saturday and that night 30,000 people, more than half of the city’s population, attended the Mississippi State University vs. Florida State University football game at Doak Campbell Stadium.\n\nRobert Sims, the director of data processing for the Department of Education, Helen Sims, a former secretary for First Baptist Church, and their 12-year-old daughter Joy did not.\n\nVicious killers invaded their home in a quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood and the three were found bound, gagged and shot shortly before 11 p.m.\n\nRobert and Joy passed at the scene. Helen was rushed to the hospital and never regained consciousness to provide any clues to the killers. She died nine days later.\n\nSixteen-year-old ambulance attendant Rocky Bevis was among the first responders to the crime scene. He cut the bonds on all three victims at their ankles and wrists.\n\n\"We just woke up one morning in Tallahassee and we were part of an evil world,” he recalled to the Miami Herald for a story marking the 50th anniversary of the crime.\n\nBefore that October night, Tallahassee was a place where people did not lock their doors.\n\nBut as word of the murders spread, homes started to be kept locked at all hours, doors not opened to strangers, shades were drawn at dusk. And when no arrests were made, people bought watchdogs, hardware stores ran out of locks and safety door chains, and there was a rush at gun shops.\n\nFear spread through the city to the extent that Trick or Treat was cancelled that Halloween.\n\nA Tallahassee Democrat editorial stated, “This is no night to send young children in masks and costumes into the street.”\n\nA $16,000 reward was never collected. The murder weapons were never found. A motive never established.\n\nSheriff deputies had two suspects in their sights, and nearly 1,000 fingerprints collected at the scene but never secured enough evidence to bring any charges.\n\nThe late Leon County Sheriff Larry Campbell investigated the murders as a deputy and continued to probe the case through a 53-year law enforcement career.\n\n“I’ve done everything I think I can do,” he told the Miami Herald in 2006. “The big frustration is that I feel very confident that I know who did it.”\n\nThe case remains unsolved. Campbell passed in 2014.\n\nEd Ball (1888 - 1981)\n\nFrom the dark days of the depression and until his death in 1981, Ed Ball was one of the most powerful and feared men in Florida.\n\nBall owned a 7,500-acre farm outside of Tallahassee that today is the Southwood subdivision.\n\nThe brother-in-law of Alfred I. du Pont, Ed Ball managed du Pont’s finances and once Alfred died grew a $56-million du Pont trust into a $2-billion Florida empire, according to the Wall Street firm A.G. Becker.\n\nA du Pont grandson filed suit against Ball for spending too much money to make more money instead of on the charitable organizations the elder du Pont included as the trust’s beneficiaries.\n\nAmong the trust’s holdings were more than 1 million acres of north Florida timberland, the St. Joe Paper Company, Florida East Coast Railway, Apalachicola Northern Railroad Co., Florida National Bank, Talisman Sugar Corp, Florida Sugar Refinery Inc., and St. Joseph Telephone and Telegraph.\n\nThe news wire service UPI remembered Ball as a quick-witted man with “the courtly manners of a Southern gentleman” who loved a good scrap.\n\nHe was the father of the state sales tax, lobbying 20 years for it as a substitute for property taxes.\n\nA political kingmaker, Ball supported financially the so-called “Porkchop Gang,” a group of rural legislators who couldn’t have been elected without him. In the 1960s the group opposed legislative reapportionment because as Ball explained it would mean “the two organized minorities, the NAACP, and the (labor) unions will control the state.”\n\nWhen Florida East Coast Railway workers went on strike in 1963, Ball defied the Justice Department and a presidential emergency board and refused to budge on the wage issue which triggered the strike.\n\nThe strike continued until 1976.\n\nBall founded the St. Joe Paper Company in 1936. The company’s extensive use of water (35 million gallons daily) and clear-cutting of forests (98% of the region’s longleaf pine) led the U.S. Department of Interior in the 1970s to designate parts of North Florida a “Critically Endangered Ecosystem.”\n\nBall purchased 4,000 acres surrounding Wakulla Springs in 1937 and constructed the 27-room Wakulla Springs Lodge as a guest house. He used dynamite to open a channel to the Wakulla River so guests could arrive by boat. And he fenced off the water passage to keep out the “riff raff.”\n\nThe state acquired the land in 1986 and created Ed Ball Wakulla Springs State Park.\n\nRuth Chapman (1918 - 1983)\n\nWhen Ruth Chapman passed away it was big news; “Tallahassee activist Chapman dies at 65.”\n\nChapman studied at Northwestern University School of Journalism and worked at newspapers in Illinois and Florida before arriving in Tallahassee in 1946.\n\n“Ruth was sort of a crusader for the improvement of Tallahassee,” said former AP writer Hendrix Chandler upon Chapman’s death.\n\nRuth and Harold Chapman moved here after the war, Harold had been stationed in Pensacola and Ruth reported for the Pensacola News Journal.\n\nIn Tallahassee, Ruth was the Women’s Editor for the Tallahassee Democrat for seven years and then editor of the Department of Education Florida School Magazine for 14 years.\n\nAway from journalism, Chapman was a member of at least 12 civic groups, including being a charter member of boards for the Tallahassee Junior Museum, Leon County Public Library, and Tallahassee Junior College, along with being president of the League of Women Voters and serving two terms on the Tallahassee-Leon County planning commission.\n\nRuth was respected as a literary craftswoman. Laurence R. Campbell, who was a 1936 Northwestern classmate, wrote at the time of her passing that Chapman was, “an architect of perceptive and penetrating prose.”\n\nChapman wrote lengthy policy letters to former Gov. LeRoy Collins. Collins said he never threw away any of them.\n\n“The one thing I attach more to Ruth than anything else is her beautiful, beautiful letter writing . . . She was a professional person, and she knew English and could express herself very well,” said Collins in 1981.\n\nEventually Collins had Chapman review his speeches and letters. He said since she was so intent on telling him what she thought, he thought he would let her know what he was thinking.\n\n“She was an excellent neighbor,” Collins said.\n\nJack Crow (1939 - 2004)\n\nJack Crow completed the longest of long shots.\n\nIn a scientific competition with the renowned private Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its $23.5 billion endowment, a little-known physicist from a state school (endowment $947 million) won the world’s most powerful magnet and brought it home to Tallahassee.\n\nIt was 1990 and MIT had run the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory for three decades. But Crow and others developed a plan that included a consortium of Florida State University, the University of Florida and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to move the lab to FSU.\n\nThe Maglab, as its called, uses up to 30 megawatts of power – roughly the amount needed to power a community of 50,000 – to create high-level magnetic fields for experiments that further the understanding of matter and living structures.\n\nSmaller labs are in Moscow; Amsterdam; Grenoble, France, and cities in Poland and Japan.\n\nAt Crow's passing, former FSU president T.K. Wetherell recalled being lobbied for millions of dollars by Crow to move the lab to Tallahassee.\n\n“He had the ability to talk molecules and the ability to talk dollars in a way that made sense to an old politician,” said Wetherell.\n\nThe lab draws thousands of scientists to Tallahassee annually to conduct experiments that help develop new technologies and materials.\n\n\"The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory truly is the house that Jack built, \" said Greg Boebinger, who replaced Crow as head of the lab director in 2002.\n\nWhile the public knew Crow as a stellar scientist, a visionary, and a persistent lobbyist, family and friends knew a man with a soft touch.\n\nThey said Crow would return from international trips with fewer clothes than when he left – having given away shirts to struggling scientists elsewhere.\n\nHis sons recalled a dad who regularly ate peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches with them, liked to fish and build sandcastles with his grandchildren, and enjoyed a good story about someone beating the odds.\n\n“He needed a towel to cry in while watching the movie ‘Rudy,’” his son Garth Crow said at his passing.\n\nJoan Heggen (1930 - 2016)\n\nJoan Heggen was a game changer with a quick wit. In 1972 she became the first woman elected to the city commission.\n\nHeggen had taught speech at Utah State University before she moved to Tallahassee when her husband accepted a position at Florida State University in 1969.\n\nShe ran a grass-roots campaign out of an abandoned gas station with volunteers going house-to-house explaining why Tallahassee had to do things differently – at the time the commission was made up of businessmen who often conducted city business from their private offices.\n\nHeggen beat Lee Everhart, who had just finished a term as mayor, 59% to 41%.\n\nIn office, the Eau Claire, Wisc., native did things differently.\n\nHeggen became the first commissioner to have an office at City Hall and her presence forced immediate changes.\n\nAt the time women were not allowed to wear pants or boots to work. But Heggen routinely wore pants suits and boots. And the city clerk was unable to dictate a commissioner's dress, so the prohibition fell for all employees.\n\nAs mayor in 1974, Heggen formed a “kitchen cabinet” of citizens to advise her, initiated the city's first applications for federal grants, and Tallahassee became nationally active in the League of Cities.\n\nHeggen would join with commissioners Russell Bevis and Johnnie Jones to replace longtime city manager Arvah Hopkins with the professionally trained Dan Kleman.\n\nTwenty years later, Bevis would tell Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley, “I don’t know if I ever saw a person better prepared for meetings.”\n\nHeggen read, studied, and asked questions. She credited her dogged determination to the parochial school she attended growing up in Wisconsin.\n\n\"I was taught by Benedictine nuns, so I have G.U.I.L.T. tattooed across my boobs,\" Heggen told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nHeggen did not run for reelection in 1975. She became deputy director and then secretary of the Department of Community Affairs and then the Broward County's Director of Health and Public Safety.\n\nShe returned to Tallahassee in 1987 and joined Leon County as the assistant administrator.\n\nJoan Heggen retired in 1994. Upon her retirement the Leon County Commission issued a proclamation naming Joan Heggin “mother emeritus” of the Leon County Courthouse.\n\nWally \"Famous\" Amos (1936 - 2024)\n\nTallahassee’s most famous maker of chocolate chip cookies was born on Lafayette Street in the raised Smokey Hollow neighborhood where the Department of Transportation building and Cascades Park is today.\n\nWhen he was 12 his parents divorced, and Amos was sent to live with an aunt in New York City. She loved to bake, and aunt and nephew bonded while baking her specialty; the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nAfter a stint in the Air Force, Amos took a job in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency and began to work his way up.\n\nHe became William Morris’ first African-American talent agent. He would get his foot in the door of potential clients with his home-made chocolate chip cookies.\n\nIt was an effective ploy. Amos’ clients would include Simon & Garfunkel, Marvin Gaye, Helen Reddy.\n\nGaye and Reddy thought so highly of the cookies that they urged Amos to open a store and lent him the money in 1975 to start baking out of a Sunset Blvd storefront in Los Angeles.\n\nIn its first year, Famous Amos Cookies generated $300,000 in revenue. Within six years, there were dozens of Famous Amos stores across the country, boxes of cookies on supermarket shelves and annual revenue of more than $12 million.\n\nWhile the cookies were delicious, the New York Times would report at the time of his passing, the big draw also was Mr. Amos himself.\n\n“An energetic, ever-smiling pitchman, known for his Panama hat and colorful Indian gauze shirts, he loved the hustle of building a brand, going on the road to promote it for weeks at a time. (Today both his hat and one of his shirts are held by the Smithsonian Institution.)”\n\nAmos was relentlessly optimistic and made regular appearances on sitcoms and entertainment shows such as Famous Amos.\n\nAs his fame grew, he made peace with his Tallahassee roots. His childhood memories were of a broken home in a segregated city, but when he returned as Famous Amos, he embraced the city of his birth.\n\n\"For years, I didn't have fond memories of Tallahassee - I grew up during segregation. But when I came back in 1981 to visit, and went back to my old neighborhood, I realized that a big part of who I was came from here. That community. Now I'm proud to be from Tallahassee,\" Amos told the Tallahassee Democrat in 1994.\n\nA fervent advocate for childhood literacy, Amos publicly visited the city to promote reading and other initiatives in 2006, 1995 and 1994.\n\nFinancial troubles forced Wally to sell Famous Amos cookies in 1988, at the time, he didn’t realize he had also sold his name.\n\nStripped of the company he started from scratch and forbidden to use the Famous Amos handle; he moved to Hawaii and became Uncle Noname, the baker of Gourmet Muffins.\n\nAmos also wrote an autobiography, “Man with No Name: Turns Lemons into Lemonade,” detailing how he lost the Famous Amos nickname.\n\nSheriff Phillip Decourcey (1846 - 1875)\n\nPhillip Decourcey, sometimes spelled DeCoursey, was born a slave on a plantation in Jefferson County. After the Civil War, he moved to Tallahassee, where he found work as a blacksmith, teacher and preacher.\n\nHe apparently was well liked, winning election to be the city’s tax assessor in 1873. Two years later DeCourcey was appointed Leon County Sheriff.\n\nAs the county’s leading law man, De Courscey earned praise from white and Black people, but he served only nine months.\n\nHe died in office with his death attributed to pneumonia.\n\nThe Tallahassee Sentinel newspaper wrote: “He was known as one of the most intelligent colored men in this county and during the last term of the circuit court he exhibited convincing evidence of his ability to perform the duties of the sheriff’s office in the most acceptable manner.”\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam ( * - 1967)\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam managed to keep her age out of numerous newspapers stories in which she appeared during her three decades in Tallahassee. Despite the best of our abilities, her streak remains intact.\n\nThe Camden, N. J., native arrived in the city 1941 and 21 years later was the Junior Woman’s Club nominee for Tallahassee Woman of the Year.\n\nGilliam is remembered as a humanitarian, for the work she provided to the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital Auxiliary and as a friend for those afflicted with chronic illness.\n\nGilliam organized and trained the city's first class of Candy Stripers, teen age hospital volunteers.\n\nDuring World War II, she was president of the local Chaperone Club, which organized dance nights and raised funds for social clubs for soldiers training at Dale Mabry field.\n\nGilliam was the only lay member of the district board of directors of the American Cancer Society.\n\nShe served as director of volunteers for the Easter Seal Society and ran fundraising campaigns. And she was the region's director of sales for the Christmas Seal campaign to raise money for charitable groups.\n\nAnd, Gilliam organized and was the director of the Tallahassee chapter of Beta Sigma Phil, the international sorority of working woman.\n\nFather James Page (1808 - 1883)\n\nJames Page was born into slavery in Richmond, V.A., brought to a Tallahassee plantation and grew up to become Florida's First African-American Itinerant preacher and the founder of one of Tallahassee’s most influential churches.\n\nPage was raised on the Bel Air plantation, south of town. There he met Elizabeth, a fellow slave. They married and Bel Air would be their permanent home.\n\nPlantation owner John Parkhill owned Bel Air, Page and Elizabeth. Page became Parkhill's chief assistant.\n\nParkhill was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, who provided religious instruction to Page. At the time, the Presbyterian Church did not admit Black congregants. Nonetheless, Page would plant the seeds that would become the missionary Baptist church in Florida.\n\nIn 1850, he started a ministry at Bel Air and led the enslaved community to organize the first known Baptist African-descendent congregation in Florida, and the origin of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nParkhill supported Page’s missionary. He donated land on Belaire Road for the church, raised funds among other slaveowners to build the church. He also provided Page the freedom and documents to travel throughout middle Florida to preach the gospel.\n\nWhen he died in 1859, Page was designated business manager and confidant for Parkhill’s widow.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Page became one of the most influential and respected religious leaders of the day.\n\nHe advocated for Black self-determination and independence through ownership of land and political participation. Page traveled throughout the South, converting hundreds of thousands to the Baptist faith.\n\nIn 1868, he built a school at Bel Air called the Page School Society, which was one of the first schools for African-Americans in Florida.\n\nIn 1879, Page helped African-American Bethlehem Baptist Association #1 establish a African-American Baptist school in Live Oak that was the forerunner of the present Florida Memorial College located in Miami.\n\nPage remained an active preacher into the final week of his life. The Weekly Floridian reported that he died “quietly and peacefully” at his home.\n\nPage is buried in Tallahassee’ Old City Cemetery, across Call Street from the church he founded as a ministry to enslaved workers.\n\nIn 2024, a historical marker honoring Father James Page was erected in front of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. (1884 - 1970)\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. was one of the most influential city fathers at the turn of the 20th century and for some reason a park dedicated to his memory features a giant bronze sculpture of a Komodo dragon.\n\nHe wrote the city charter approved by the Florida Legislature in 1919. He also was the last mayor of the old system (1919), first mayor of the new system (1920-1922), city attorney from 1927 to 1936, and clerk of the Florida Supreme Court from 1938 to 1964.\n\nTallahassee saluted McCord in 1970 and named a park with canopy trails in his honor. It's at the southeast corner of the intersection of Thomasville and Armistead Roads.\n\nWhen a shopping center and gas station was proposed for the six-acre site in 1965, McCord led the opposition and spoke at a hotly contested zoning meeting.\n\n“You ought to put an end to this. This property ought to be bought for a city park,” he told the commission he once led.\n\n“There should not be further business along Thomasville Highway with more filling stations and sandwich stands. We are spending millions to make the Capitol Center beautiful but spending nothing for parks,” said McCord.\n\nThe Guyte P. McCord Park, features green spaces, a flowerly walking path, and a canopied walking path encircling a pond that attracts various bird species. Throughout the park are seven bronze sculptures of children and dogs at play and a giant Komodo dragon by Sandy Proctor. It is unclear why Proctor included the dragon in the McCord collection, but it is regarded today as one of the park's treasures.\n\nFrederick S. Humphries (1935 - 2021)\n\nFred Humphries was born in Apalachicola on Dec. 26, 1935, grew up in the segregated South and was inspired by a high school math teacher “to do better.”\n\nHumphries became a champion of education, especially for disadvantaged young people.\n\nHe graduated with honors from FAMU in 1957, with a degree in chemistry, then earned his master’s and doctorate degrees in physical chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. He was Pitt’s first African-American Ph.D. in chemistry. Humphries taught at Minnesota but returned to FAMU as a chemistry professor in 1968. He left to become president of Tennessee State University in 1974, overseeing that HBCU’s merger with the predominantly white UT-Nashville campus — the nation’s first successful merger of two such institutions, with TSU maintaining its administrative autonomy. Humphries became FAMU’s eighth president in 1985 and set the university on a path of unprecedented growth and national acclaim.\n\nThe Humphries’ years, 1985-2001, saw FAMU enrollment and national standing boosted by Humphries' unorthodox recruitment of scholars and donors and pursuit of academic grants.\n\nHumphries would approach young people on the streets of Europe and Africa touting the FAMU brand.\n\nHumphries was a Rattler from the moment he saw the Marching 100 perform at halftime of a game he saw as a high school student on a field trip.\n\nA student chemistry professor Fred Humphries recruited would later be a FAMU president. Larry Robinson (2017 –2024) eulogized Humphries as “a visionary, whose brilliance was on constant display.”\n\nThe number of National Achievement Scholars President Humphries enticed to enroll at FAMU recruited led the nation, outpacing Harvard, Yale, and Stanford in 1992, 95, 97 and tying Harvard in 2000.\n\nThe school’s enrollment increased from 5,100 when Humphries was hired to nearly 12,000 by the time he retired and included 657 National Achievement Scholars.\n\nThe amount of annual grant money the school secured increased during his tenure from $8 million to $62 million.\n\nAnd in 2000, with Humphries as president, the Florida Board of Regents restored the FAMU law school, closed in 1968, with a campus in Orlando.\n\nRuby Diamond (1886 - 1982) and Smiley Bruce (1919 - 2002)\n\nRuby Diamond was one of 13 members of the Florida State College’s 1905 graduating class and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry.\n\nMiss Ruby, as she preferred to be called, once deadpanned that she \"wasn't taught to do a blessed thing on earth but smile.”\n\nHowever, Diamond had a reputation as a shrewd businesswoman. And it appears her passion was to give away her wealth.\n\nRuby’s father, Julius Diamond, was a wealthy Tallahassee merchant.\n\nWhen Julius died, Ruby inherited a large fortune. She sold the family business and home and moved into the Floridian Hotel, where she assembled a collection of antique snuff bottles shipped in from all over the world.\n\nDiamond is representative of a class of wealthy, single, 19th century progressive women philanthropists. Columbia University philosopher John Dewey, a spokesman for that era of progressives and creator of the Dewey Decimal System, was a friend who visited and corresponded with Diamond.\n\nShe never married. The city became her family. Tallahasseans would often see Ruby Diamond taking drives around the city in a 1963 powder-blue Cadillac, chauffeured by Smiley Bruce, a former custodian for the state, bus driver and ice man.\n\nShe and Bruce were inseparable in his 25 years chaufering Miss Ruby. His recollection of their relationship informs E. Lynne Wright’s novel “It Happened in Florida: Remarkable Events That Shaped History.\" Others drew comparisons of Diamond and Bruce to the 1987 play “Driving Miss Daisy,” a story about another single, elderly, eccentric, Jewish woman.\n\nMiss Ruby fought for lower taxes and racial equality, helped establish Temple Israel, and founded the “Diamond Vegetable Basket,” to provide seeds and fertilizer to any Leon County resident who received welfare assistance.\n\n“At Christmastime she sent me out to get people who didn’t have any place to go and had me collect them up and carry them to different cafes,\" Bruce told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nShe always picked up the bill.\n\nRuby Diamond established scholarships at FSU for disadvantaged students and contributed to at least 37 charitable organizations. She was an active member of the Oleander Garden Circle, Tallahassee Historical Society, LeMoyne Art Foundation, and the Tallahassee Junior Museum.\n\nIn 1970 FSU named its largest auditorium in her honor, housed in the iconic Westcott Building.\n\nA year later, Diamond donated property valued at $100,000 to the university. And in 1981, she donated more property to help fund an endowed chair of national excellence in the College of Education.\n\nDiamond died in 1982, bequeathing to Smiley that blue Cadillac. The church leader at Friendship Primitive Baptist Church and foster grandparent then turned his hand to selling boiled peanuts in his retirement.\n\n\"He always liked to do something,\" said his grandaughter Regina Webster. \"He never could stay still. He liked to be around people. He loved to talk.\n\nRobert Butler (1786 - 1860)\n\nRobert Butler was an American military officer, a veteran of the Battle of New Orleans raised by Andrew Jackson after Butler’s parents died of yellow fever.\n\nWhen Spain ceded Florida to the U.S., Butler represented the U.S. at ceremonies in St. Augustine where Spanish Gov. Jose Maria Coppinger handed over possession of the city and territory and left for Cuba.\n\nIn 1824, when Tallahassee was founded and a crew of Jackson’s former officers were seemingly in charge of affairs, Butler was appointed the Survey General of Florida.\n\nHis first job was to establish the prime meridian, which serves as ground zero for all real estate transactions – the reference point for all surveys of property deeds in the state.\n\nInterim Gov. George Walton selected a spot about 200 yards south and east of the Capitol. Walton drove a cedar stake in the ground, next to the ampitheater at today's Cascades Park, and Butler would approve and certify all land surveys in the state until 1848 using the stake as the prime meridian.\n\nButler was a Jackson man. He organized Tallahassee’s first fraternal organization, the Masonic Jackson Lodge.\n\nHe married Jackson's daughter Rachel Hays, and gave Lake Jackson its name. Butler and Hays had a 900-acre plantation that extended from its shore and included the mounds built by Native Americans.\n\nNearby he built a holding pond to power a mill.\n\nWaist high tombstones for Robert and Rachel are located off Crowder Road near Lake Jackson Mounds State Park. They are off of the right fork of the park’s Butler Mill Trail, where a keen eye can spot remnants of the mill project.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown (1785 - 1867)\n\nThomas Brown the pioneer – not Tom Brown, the namesake of Tallahassee’s premier city park – was among a group of War of 1812 veterans who later settled in Tallahassee once it was named the Florida capital.\n\nBefore he moved to town, Brown, as the chief clerk of the Richmond, Va., post office, invented the post office letter box.\n\nIn 1828 Tallahassee, Brown built a hotel on Adams Street, between Pensacola and Lafayette streets, south of the present-day state Capitol campus. Originally called Brown’s Inn, the hotel underwent many name changes, including being called City Hotel for a couple of years.\n\nThe hotel provided the connections that enabled Brown to remain politically active. He served as president of the legislative council in 1838, was a member of the constitutional convention in 1839, and served in the first session of the Florida House of Representatives in 1845.\n\nIn 1849, Brown became the only Whig Party member elected Florida governor. He promoted agriculture and worked to improve the transportation and education systems.\n\nIntrigued by the rich soil in the Lake Okeechobee watershed, he explored whether to drain the Everglades to create more farmland. The initiative resulted in Fort Myers emerging as a bustling village.\n\nHe persuaded the legislature to endorse building a plank toll road from Jacksonville to Lake City. Under his tenure, a steamship line was initiated on the St. Johns River. And in 1853, the East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala. Closed by the Civil War, the school reopened in 1866 in Gainesville and would become the University of Florida.\n\nAt the end of his term as governor, Brown retired from public life. A Mason for more than 60 years, he served as the long-term secretary for the Tallahassee lodge and compiled a book on Masonry.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown is buried at the Old City Cemetery in Tallahassee.\n\nRev. Herbert Clarke Alexander (1929 - 1994)\n\nHerbert C. Alexander was a transitional figure who straddled two eras; between those who tried to work through Jim Crow and those who fought it.\n\nAlexander was a high school dropout from Palatka who joined the U.S. Army and then earned a degree in religion from Florida A&M University in 1957.\n\nHe would teach five years at Bond Elementary, and then at the old Lincoln High before leaving Tallahassee for the University of Tennessee where he would earn a Ph.D.\n\nAlexander would return to Tallahassee as FAMU’s Vice President of Student Affairs in 1969.\n\nIt was a turbulent time with the anti-war and Civil Rights movements flourishing and universities and the city struggling to meet student’s demands.\n\n“Herbert was never at the forefront of activism. But he was a man of impeccable character, who certainly always espoused the goals of the Civil Rights movement,” said the late Charles Smith, FAMU’s then Dean of Graduate Studies at Alexander’s passing.\n\nSmith participated in many of the marches and demonstrations students organized.\n\nAlexander was also a preacher, who ministered at Baptist churches in Valdosta, Quitman, and Tallahassee, where he followed his mentor, the Rev. C.K. Steele as pastor of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church..\n\nYet although Steele was a driving force in the 1956 Bus Boycott, Alexander’s conciliatory nature in the VP role did not always mesh well with the demands of 1970s-era students.\n\nHe said he grew weary in the job and stepped down in 1972.\n\n“I have great faith in young people. I see in them the energy, enthusiasm, that I feel I am losing,” Alexander told the Associated Press.\n\n“If the powers that be will not be unduly restrictive on them, they will find solutions to almost all kinds of problems we struggle with,” said Alexander.\n\nAlexander remained on the FAMU campus as the director of the business ethics program. In that role, his relentless positive voice about the nature of man became a magnet for students. They would line up outside his office to talk and seek advice.\n\n“He didn’t have the talent to turn them away,” said then Dean Sybil Mobley.\n\nAlexander was a recipient of the FAMU Distinguished Alumni Award in Religion and the Martin L. King Jr. Leadership Award.\n\nRob Roy Ashmore (1916 - 2010)\n\nRob Roy Ashmore held court for more than 60 years in a store that evolved into Ashmore Antique’s. Once a drug store, the place became a junktique emporium/pecan shop on West Brevard Street in Frenchtown, across from the Old Lincoln High and just down the street from the Governor’s Mansion.\n\nThe eclectic store with an eccentric owner became a landmark for generations of college students and politicians.\n\nWhen he passed, longtime social services lobbyist Jack Levine wrote of Ashmore, “no one knew more Florida governors more personally than Rob Roy.”\n\nThe reason governors made their way to his store, Ashmore told Levine was, “because I’m famous. I can’t say the same for some of them.”\n\nAshmore Antiques came to be after World War II when Rob Roy took over his cousin’s store.\n\nHe stocked it with funky junk, retro furniture, and abstract odds and ends, and bought pecans from teens and the homeless to sell.\n\nCollege students flocked to the store where the proprietor seemed more interested in spinning tall and small tales than he was in selling anything.\n\nCandidates would ask to put their posters in his window and after the election instead of trashing them, Ashmore used them to paper the store’s walls.\n\nThe place became an improv political museum, decorated with more than 200 posters and framed photographs of a who’s who of politicians from former President Harry Truman to former Mayor John Marks.\n\nAfter the store’s popularity attracted England’s Duke of Windsor in 1952, it became a campaign stop for candidates. In 1968 presidential candidates Hubert Humphrey, Shirley Chisholm and George Wallace visited and snacked on pecans with Rob Roy.\n\nAshmore once spent an afternoon drinking Coca-Cola and munching on fresh-shelled pecans with Gov. Claude Kirk. Kirk persuaded Ashmore to help move his daughter out of an FSU dorm room. A laborer Ashmore brought along asked why he kept calling the other man \"governor.\" The worker did not recognize Kirk, which delighted Ashmore.\n\nAshmore's tales also included cruising around town with Gov. LeRoy Collins in the governor’s limousine and supplying Gov. Lawton Chiles with tobacco snuff for hunting.\n\n“I’m not supposed to tell you because he took on big tobaccy – but he liked to pinch it when he was out shooting birds,” Ashmore said.\n\nA Sopchoppy native, Ashmore credited a lesson he learned working for at an uncle’s Jackson County drug store for his store becoming a Tallahassee landmark.\n\n“I learned quick that being nice back was good for business,” Ashmore said.\n\nAshmore closed his store in 2008. The city has purchased the building with the intent of turning it into a local cultural center and African American museum.\n\nThomas Irwin Brown Jr. (1914 - 1973)\n\nThomas Irwin Brown, no relation to the Floirda Gov. Brown, was a coach, athletic director and longtime county commissioner.\n\nA Pulaski County Georgia native, Brown played football at Clemson. In 1944, he was hired to coach the Leon High School football team. Brown also operated a laundry business, service station and built an apartment complex near Florida State University.\n\nGov. LeRoy Collins appointed Brown to the Leon County Board of County Commissioners in 1958 following the death of Commissioner William Kelley.\n\nHe would serve 14 years, being reelected three times.\n\nAs a politician, Brown followed a conservative philosophy that supported consolidation of city and county governments, expansion of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, construction of the truck route that became Capital Circle, a county library, and an addition to the courthouse.\n\nHe served as the Commission’s chair 1963-1964, 1967-1968, and 1972.\n\nBrown also served as president of the Tallahassee Kiwanis Club and director of the Tallahassee Booster and Quarterback clubs. He coached a Babe Ruth League baseball team for 20 years.\n\nIn 1977, the City of Tallahassee dedicated a 255-acre recreation park in Tom Brown’s memory. As a fitting memory for a coach, Tom Brown Park features several softball and baseball fields, racquet and tennis courts, a disc golf course, a 3.1-mile-long bike and nature trails, and a fenced area for dogs to frolic.\n\nBrown died in 1973, and is buried at Roselawn Cemetery.\n\nEdward Bradford (1798 - 1871)\n\nEdward and brothers Thomas, William, Henry, and Richard arrived in Tallahassee from Enfield, North Carolina, in 1829. Direct descendants of William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, and English statesman Oliver Cromwell, the brothers would establish five plantations along what is now Thomasville Road in north Leon County.\n\nTallahassee’s northeast suburbs were once the site of a Bradford agricultural enterprise powered by the labor of enslaved individuals at Edgewood, Horseshoe, Pine Hill, Walnut Hill, and Water Oak plantations.\n\nRecords of transactions with New York cotton brokers between 1840 and 1866 indicate it was a prosperous business worth millions in today's money.\n\nThe Leon County 1860 Agricultural Census found 130 slaves worked Pine Hills and assessed the plantation’s value at $949,510 when adjusted for inflation.\n\nAccording to the Census, the brothers held 585 people as enslaved workers.\n\nA book titled \"Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum Florida, 1821–1860\" noted that the Bradfords held a large barbecue for its enslaved workers on July 4th and that Christmas week was a time of no work except for tending livestock. Bradford's wife would commission gifts for the \"black folks\" including shawls, brightly colored printed dresses and bandannas, new hats and Sunday shoes, according to the author. It was a different scene at the nearby Chemonie plantation where there was no celebration.\n\nEdward's nephew Capt. Richard H. Bradford was the first soldier killed in Florida in the Civil War.\n\nEdward also owned the Horseshoe Plantation east of Lake Iamonia. When he died in 1871, Horseshoe became known as Bradfordville, which is today an unincorporated village of 19,000.\n\nDale Mabry (1891 - 1992)\n\nDale Mabry is a Florida name most people associate with a Tampa-area highway but Dale Mabry the man was a Tallahassee native, and his hometown didn’t appreciate when Tampa appropriated his name.\n\nMabry was the son of former Florida Supreme Court Justice Milton H. Mabry and Ella Dale Bramlett.\n\nOn February 21, 1922, Captain Dale Mabry lost his life at age 30 when the rudder system malfunctioned on the 410 foot long airship \"Roma\" that he was piloting over Norfolk, Va.\n\nFrom a height of 1,000 feet, the Roma with 43 people onboard, went into a dive straight to the ground.\n\nJust before the airship impacted the ground, it encountered power lines that caused the vessel to burst into flames.\n\nMabry and 34 airmen died in the accident, which at the time was the worst aviation disaster in U.S. history.\n\nWhen Mabry’s body was removed from the twisted and burnt wreckage he was still holding the wheel to steer the airship.\n\nThe US Army would never use hydrogen in any of its airships again.\n\nIn 1929, Tallahassee named its first airfield in his honor. Dale Mabry Field was dedicated on November 11, Veteran’s Day.\n\nA few years later, Tampa wanted to name its airfield after Mabry, but Tallahassee would not agree to change the name of its airfield. Tampa officials finally decided to just name a new road leading to the airfield after Mabry.\n\nMabry will one day have his Tallahassee moment again with the opening of the Dale Mabry Army Airfield Museum on the campus of Tallahassee State College.\n\nHelen Grissett (1916 - 2016)\n\nHelen Turner Grissett was a long-time educator whose love for animals made her a legendary director of what once was the Tallahassee Junior Museum, and today is the Tallahassee Museum – 52 acres of historical buildings and exhibits of animals and natural Florida.\n\nGrissett received a B.A. from Florida State College for Women in 1940 and a M.A. from the University of Florida in 1950. She taught at Caroline Brevard Elementary for two years, at Leon High for five, and Ruediger Elementary for a decade.\n\nIn 1964, she was appointed director of the fledgling Junior Museum and helped make into reality what psychology professor Howard Baker called at Grissett’s retirement in 1971, “the best idea from Tallahassee in our generation.”\n\nGrissett loved animals. Her idea of a mini zoo of petable animals became the Museum’s most popular feature.\n\nToday, the Museum is home to red wolves, black bears, white-tailed deer, red and grey fox, the Florida panther, bobcats, and cougars, along with many birds, and reptiles.\n\nGrissett was the last director to live on site, which made her view her park responsibilities as a 24-hour job.\n\nWhen a veterinarian had given up on a fox and said it would not survive, Grissett stayed up all night and nursed it. The fox lived.\n\nOne time Grissett took a baby goat, another time, a baby fawn to bed with her when they were sick to keep them warm while they recovered. And she used her bathtub as a hospital bed for alligators.\n\nThe Tallahassee Junior Museum held a Helen Grissett Day, June 13, 1971, when Grissett retired. A plaque on the Museum’s early childhood education building recognizes Grissett’s contribution to the Museum.\n\nMrs. Jessie Moon (1904 - 1982)\n\nMarion County’s Jessie Moon may be Leon County school systems' most successful innovator.\n\nJesse Moon earned a degree from Florida State College for Women in 1934 and taught at Kate Sullivan and Hartsfield elementary schools before being named the first principal of W.T. Moore Elementary School.\n\nThe school opened in the fall of 1968 as the county’s first truly integrated school.\n\nStudents still living in the footprint of old plantations where the families had been for generations and neighborhoods built by a nascent “Sun Belt” economic boom, were blended into one student body.\n\n“This was a relatively new concept at the time, but the school made great advances,” said DJ Wright, who joined the faculty in 1974.\n\nMoon wanted her teachers to know their students and each summer loaded them on a bus and drove through the areas where students lived – providing a visual display of a diverse student population.\n\nAnd she wanted students to understand each other. They would participate in daily discussions of their similarities and differences; even learning how each other's hair felt to the touch.\n\nMoon pioneered the open classroom concept for Leon County. The idea employed team teaching techniques. Classrooms consisted of seven large learning centers and two rooms for specialized instruction.\n\nAnd Moon also developed a hearing-impaired program that initially served seven counties. Students were bused from 50 miles away.\n\n“She was ahead of her times,” said Roberta Trowbridge, a student teacher for the program, who would spend all but one year of her career at Moore.\n\n“Mrs. Moon would come visit in our classroom and interact with the children regularly. She had such compassion for these kids,” said Trowbridge.\n\nAway from school, Mrs. Moon was a gardener who made bouquets of flowers for teachers, students, and parents.\n\nToday they are remembered as floral displays of the warm, inviting, positive school culture Moon created at Moore.\n\n“You felt it when you went through the doors. She knew she was creating an institution of learning for children, and it has lived on as a testament to her,” said Wright, who served as Moore’s principal 1994 - 2003.\n\nIn 1980, an addition previously identified as the Hearing Impairment Program’s Center M, was dedicated in honor of Mrs. Jessie Moon.\n\nRichard A. Shine (1810 -1862)\n\nTwenty-year old Richard A. Shine arrived in Tallahassee in 1830 and left a mark on the capital city that remains visible today. They include some notable tourist attractions .\n\nShine was a builder and supervised construction of the 1845 state Capitol, known today as the Historic Old Capitol. Other projects include the First Presbyterian Church, the Bloxham House at 410 Calhoun St., the Chittenden House at 323 Park Ave, and the main house of Goodwood Museum and Gardens.\n\nAccording to Census information from 1840, Shine was listed as the owner of 30 slaves. Historian Andrew Frank said Shine was known to have used slaves on his projects in Tallahassee and also hired them out as skilled laborers.\n\nThe bricks for the construction projects were made at a 50-acre brickyard located between Mahan Drive and Miccosukee Road that Shine owned. Remnants of the kilns were visible as late as 1934, according to the Tallahassee Historical Society Annual.\n\nBut he was also an engineer who made the deep cut along Mahan and under Magnolia Drive to lay the tracks that brought the Pensacola-Georgia Railroad to east Tallahassee in 1857. That cut, dug by enslaved people, is still in use today.\n\nA Quartermaster General of the Confederate army and Florida Militia, died in 1862, at the height of the Civil War. No written account of his death has been found. The Shine family tomb is in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nSeeking clues: Help solve mystery of two portraits found at Goodwood Museum\n\nMarion Franklin Tinsley (1927 - 1995)\n\nMarion F. Tinsley was so good at checkers that he ran out of human opponents. The Florida A&M and Florida State math professor spent the last five years of his life beating increasingly more powerful computers.\n\nTinsley earned a doctorate at The Ohio State University in 1957 and then taught math at FAMU for 26 years and 10 years at FSU. He also served as a part-time minister at Tallahassee Christian Church.\n\nTinsley won the world checkers championship in 1954 and today is recognized as the greatest checker player ever.\n\nHe was world champion from 1954 – 1958, and again from 1975 – 1991. He also claimed four consecutive Florida Open championships, 1974, 75, 76, 77.\n\nHe claimed he was a mediocre checkers player until at age 14 when he stumbled on a book of checkers while researching a math problem at the library.\n\n“Checkers can get quite a hold on you. Its beauty is just overwhelming, the mathematics, the elegance, the precision. It’s capable of wrapping you all up,” said Tinsley, according to a New York Times obituary.\n\nTwo of the seven games Tinsley lost during a 50-year run were to a Chinook computer program. It had a repertory of 250 billion moves and could make 3 million calculations a minute. It beat Tinsley once when he was intoxicated, and again during an exhibition when Tinsley competed in two matches at once.\n\nBefore cancer forced Tinsley to retire from competition, he fought the computer to six straight draws.\n\n“Tinsley was the Mount Everest we wanted to scale,” said program developer Jonathan Schaeffer after Tinsley withdrew from the 1994 world championship competition.\n\nBurt Norton (1943 - 1995)\n\nIt was 1966, about the time the Beatles released the landmark Revolver album, when Burt Norton drove into Tallahassee. He arrived in a Ford station wagon loaded with a 1960 Fender Jazzmaster, a Fender Pro Amp, a stand alone Fender reverb tank, and a few clothes.\n\nThirty years later when Tallahassee music community gathered for a memorial concert in his honor, the Tallahassee Democrat wrote, “no doubt there would have been a music scene in Tallahassee without Burt Norton. But just as certainly it would have been entirely different.”\n\nBurt Norton was the man behind Norton Audio and Music on Jackson Bluff Road. Tallahassee’s first rock n roll music store. It stocked the name brands that powered the Woodstock Generation. It became known as Norton Music, “The Guitar Store;” a mecca for musicians and fans.\n\nNorton provided services for his products, never charged for guitar string installations or setups.\n\n“It was just a given, Burt was always there,” recalled John Paul Waters before the 1995 tribute concert for Norton. “He didn’t make a big deal about it. Whatever you were looking for in the music world, he was a great resource.”\n\nPeople poured into the store – students, musicians, transients – to share stories and talk music.\n\n“I always found it interesting how I could wait on a farmer early in the morning and a state supreme court justice toward closing time,” recalled Ken Norton, who worked the counter at his brother’s store.\n\nEventually Norton decided Tallahassee needed a recording studio. So, he went off to Nashville and toured the studios where Roy Orbison recorded.\n\nHe opened a 16-track recording studio at the Jackson Bluff location.\n\nFor the next 10 years, Sweet Bay studios recorded dozens of local groups. Among those who cut songs or albums at Sweet Bay were LaBamba/Flipside, Meisburg and Walters, Bill Wharton, Drew Reid, BB Jam, Dixie Drive, Rainbow Band, Tallahassee Band, McKenzie Brothers – and a teenage country singer from Quincy, Billy Dean.\n\nIn 1986, amid growing competition from other music stores, Norton closed the store and took a job with the state. He passed away in January 1995 at age 52.\n\nLaura Mae Thompson Dixie (1925 - 2017)\n\nLaura Mae Thompson hailed from the Chaires neighborhood east of town and became a key organizer in the Civil Rights Movement in Tallahassee.\n\n“The Mother of the Movement in Tallahassee,” is how Bethel Missionary Baptist Rev. R.B. Holmes eulogized Dixie.\n\nDixie was an activist. Served as vice president of the Leon County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Was a board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and president of AFSCME Local 2847.\n\nVisiting people who were sick, taking in first-generation Florida A&M students, and feeding people were the foundations of Dixie’s approach to community organizing.\n\nDixie didn’t like speaking in front of crowds and avoided the spotlight. She was the person that others depended on when funds needed to be raised, voters needed to be registered, or when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., needed a place to stay during a Tallahassee stop.\n\nDixie was persistent. When the pace of desegregation at W.T. Edward Hospital proved to be slow, she quietly went to work.\n\n\"I had a long fingernail file and they had these signs also where, you know, they had the patients segregated,\" she recalled in a recorded interview.\n\n\"They had a white wing, black wing, white bathroom, colored bathroom, white eating dining room, colored dining room, and so I took my fingernail file and went 'round and unscrewed every one of those segregation signs off the door ... the supervisor said, 'I can't picture nobody doing that but Dixie,' but they still couldn't prove that I did it. I was acting just as innocent as I could be.\"\n\nCharles Saxon Ausley (1907 - 1972)\n\nThere were some impressive shoes Charles Saxon Ausley had to fill. Tallahassee appreciated the work of his dad, the physician Charles, so much they named Ausley Road on the west side in his honor. And his grandfather George Saxon was the founder of the Capital City Bank, the city’s oldest operating business.\n\nCharlie, who carried both men’s names, set out to be, in the words of the Tallahassee Democrat, a “good citizen.”\n\nHe left his mark on the community. In 1930, he teamed with future Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins to create the Ausley McMullen law firm, one of Tallahassee’s oldest law firms.\n\nAusley wrote the first charter of the Florida State Foundation, founded the Tallahassee Jaycees, served as president of the Chamber of Commerce, and as corporate officer of the Tallahassee Democrat and director of the Orange Bowl committee.\n\nCharlie also was a municipal judge, city commissioner, and state senator – filling in for Collins when he resigned to join the Navy during World War II.\n\nWhen he died, a Tallahassee Democrat editorial acknowledged he served as the newspaper’s legal counsel but also extolled him as a “good citizen.”\n\nWrote the editorial board, “In the 42 years since he returned to Tallahassee with his law degree from the University of Florida, there was hardly a worthwhile project or mission on which his help was not sought and given without hesitation. It is such good citizens as Charlie Ausley who have made Tallahassee the place for the good life it is.”\n\nGene Calvin Cox (1935 - 2009)\n\nGene Calvin Cox is the winningest football coach ever to walk a Tallahassee sideline.\n\nIn a 27-year run as head football coach at Leon High School, the Lions were 238 – 67 and won two state championships, 14 district championships, seven regional championships and eight conference championships.\n\nMore than 100 players would sign a college scholarship.\n\nA Lake City native, Cox played at Columbiana High, and was listed behind Lee Corso on the running back depth chart for the 1954 Florida State University team, which won the Sun Bowl.\n\nAfter coaching at high schools in Jefferson and Suwannee counties, Cox became head coach at Leon and a football legend.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions ran off 25 straight wins in 1968, 1969, and 1970. On two other occasions, Leon won sixteen straight games. And in 1984 –1985 the Lions posted a 19-game winning streak.\n\n“He was so serious about and so intense that when you came to college at FSU, that it was really easier than what we were used to at Leon – the intensity of the workout and at practice. And you knew how to win,” said former FSU quarterback Wally Woodham.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions became a feeder program for Bobby Bowden’s teams at FSU.\n\nThe 1979 11 – 0 Seminoles featured seven Lions, including two quarterbacks, Woodham and Jimmy Jordan, along with QB coach Billy Sexton. The Lion-led Noles only loss was to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl.\n\nCox retired from Leon in 1990 but would return to the sidelines for Aucilla Christian Academy a year later. When he successfully retired as coach after the 1995 season, his 313 wins were the most ever in Florida.\n\nIn 1997, the Tallahassee Sports Commission, the Leon County School Board and the Leon County Commission renamed Capital Stadium to Gene Cox Stadium.\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam (1926 - 2006)\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam dance students started performing revues at halftime of Leon High School football games in 1947. A New York trained ballet instructor, Gilliam had a studio in the Randall-Lewis House where students from age 2-and-a-half to 16 learned tap and ballet.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, troupes of Gilliam students publicly performed in dance reviews to popular songs. Gilliam outfitted dancers in calico dresses and bonnets for a “Gal in Calico” performance, and in Spanish-theme costumes for \"The Lady in Red.”\n\nBefore Tallahassee desegregated Gilliam opened her studio to Black girls for ballet lessons.\n\nCarla Richardson joined the classes in 1964 and said she and about a half dozen other girls were not fully aware of the controversy Gilliam created by agreeing to enroll them.\n\nIt was a bold stance. Gilliam lost a lot of her white students, and ultimately her downtown studio.\n\nLooking back, Richardson said she and her classmates were unaware of the controversy Gilliam provoked by welcoming them into her studio. They were younger than 10 at the time and would learn more about race relations when the city integrated public schools.\n\n“I just think we didn’t realize at the time this woman was a civil rights activist. She was phenomenal. A single woman who risked her business to teach African American girls,” said Richardson.\n\nOne of those girls was Joyce Warner Tobias, Miss Black America 1971.\n\n“Miss Patsy contributed to her winning. Joyce used dance as her talent in the competition,” said Richardson.\n\nGilliam closed her School of Dance in the early 1970s, and worked as the superintendent at Lewis State Bank.\n\nAlexis Roberts McMillian was among the group of little girls who showed up at Gilliam’s studio in 1964.\n\n“I attribute my agility and movement – that is good for a pretty-plus senior citizen – to my ballet lessons,” said McMillian. “I stuck it out through the 11th grade as one of the last students she had until she stopped teaching. Those classes were finally desegregated ... We raise a glass of cheer to Helen Patsy Gilliam.”\n\nAlvan S. Harper (1847 - 1911)\n\nNorristown, Pennsylvania’s Alvan S. Harper studied photography in Philadelphia. A chance meeting with Tallahassee Judge J.T. Bernard at the 1876 Centennial may have led Alvan and Agnes Harper to move to Tallahassee where they set up a studio to take “artistic photographs.”\n\nHarper posed portraits with backdrops in his studio and photographed residences, buildings, farming, hunting, railway activity and political leaders.\n\nHis portfolio includes hundreds of views of late 19th century Tallahassee street scenes, and about 1,300 portraits of men, women, and children taken between 1884 and 1910.\n\nAlvan had a special interest in Tallahassee’s African American community. While Jim Crow was enforced, he portrayed Black people in a way that defied the legal restrictions they faced. The Museum of Florida selection of his photographs has been made into a traveling exhibition, and his quiet contributions to civil rights were recognized by the University of Florida, the NAACP, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n\nIn 2017, a “Trolley ride through Alvan S. Harper’s Tallahassee” was held at the Pensacola Museum of History.\n\n\"Some of Harper's best negatives were lost when his studio was torn down in the 1920s,\" according to a state archives report. \"The negatives had been given to a Tallahassee historian who, because they were dirty, left them on a porch where they were mistaken for trash and taken to the dump.\"\n\nAbout 2,000 Harper negatives were found, however, in 1946 in the attic of a house the Harpers owned. The negatives were turned over to the State Library.\n\nAlvan and his wife Agnes never had children. Both are buried in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence (1918 - 2013)\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence was the final principal for segregated Lincoln High School. Lawrence grew up on a farm near Old. St. Augustine Road and Chaires Crossroad. He and his brother would walk the seven miles to attend Lincoln High School as students.\n\nUpon graduation and service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Lawrence would teach in Live Oak and Quincy before returning to Tallahassee. In 1957, he was named principal of his alma mater and would keep his students focused on education during the turbulent 1960s. Lawrence encouraged both academic and vocational students to pursue the highest level of education. He was Lincoln’s principal until the school closed in 1967.\n\nDuring his 25 and more years as a principal at “Black” elementary, junior high and high schools, Lawrence advocated and promoted a higher level of service and financial commitment for the education of Black children.\n\nAdditionally, he assumed responsibility for his teachers, encouraging them to pursue graduate degrees and to this end, made promotions into leadership positions in the Leon County School System possible.\n\nMany attributed Lawrence’s ability to create alliances and negotiate helped make Leon County’s transition to integrated schools look effortless while integration elsewhere came under duress and sometimes violence.\n\nAfter integration, Lawrence became principal of the newly created Lincoln-Griffin High School. He later moved on to Nims Middle School, before retiring in 1978,\n\nIn 1996, he received a Florida A&M University’s Distinguished Alumni Award, and in 2012 the Tallahassee Urban League bestowed its Legend Award to Freeman D. Lawrence.\n\nHe was remembered in his obituary as \"one of God's best servants.\"\n\n\"I once bought a three-piece suit just so I could look like Mr. Lawrence,\" then Sen. Bill Montford said at his funeral. \"In education, we as a state are always looking for the answer. I would suggest to you, we had the answer at the original Lincoln.\"\n\nMargaret Leonard (1942 - 2022)\n\nJournalism and justice inspired Margaret Leonard.\n\nRaised in Macon and Atlanta by parents who were reporters, Leonard would report for the Chattanooga Times, Miami Herald, and the St. Petersburg Times before she joined the Tallahassee Democrat as a government reporter in the 1980s.\n\nBefore making Tallahassee home, Leonard made history in 1960 as a Tulane University student when she became the “first unmistakably Southern white student\" to join the Freedom Riders to register Black people to vote in Mississippi.\n\nA teenage Leonard was repeatedly arrested as the Freedom Riders registered voters. She was jailed and spent time in the notorious Parchman Prison.\n\nLeonard told an oral history project in 2001 the experience traumatized her and inspired her journalism.\n\n“I wrote a lot about prisons, power stuff,” she said. “That was the question that I was interested in my whole life: What do people do when they have power, and what do you do about it if you don’t have it?”\n\nLeonard was open and frank in discussions with friends. As an editor, her comments were pointed but softened by a lilting Georgia accent.\n\nLate in life, after suffering a brain aneurysm, Leonard carried a dictionary to help her reprogram her brain with words she needed to keep her job.\n\nLeonard had an aversion to the limelight and praise for her work. Before she died, she asked her obituary not to begin with her role as a Freedom Rider.\n\nWhen she passed her family asked in lieu of flowers for contributions to the Equal Justice Initiative.\n\n“We’ve come a long way, but we ain’t through,“ Leonard reflected in 2012, in an article recognizing her wor\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadell (1875 - 1963)\n\nThe roots of Tall Timbers, the research station & land conservancy north of Tallahassee, were nourished by a passion for quail hunting.\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadel of Staten Island, New York, first came to Leon County in 1894 with his father to shoot quail, such as the bobwhite, the number one game bird of the South.\n\nHis uncle, Edward, had purchased a 2,200-acre quail hunting plantation known as Hickory Hill that sat on the north shore of Lake Iamonia. Henry would visit every winter and when Edward passed away in 1919, he inherited the property and built a home he named Tall Timbers.\n\nBeadel then devoted much of his time to scientific wildlife research. And in 1926, he began experimenting with controlled burns to study fire's effect on wildlife and plants.\n\nSix years later, he organized the Cooperative Quail Study Association, made up of 21 owners of quail lands in the Tallahassee-Thomasville-Albany area.\n\nAnd in 1958, Beadel founded the Tall Timbers research station with a mission to study game birds, fire and plant ecology, wildlife, and land conservation among other things.\n\nWhen Gov. Farris Bryan presented Beadel with a plague in 1961 to recognize his contributions to wildlife research, the Tallahassee Democrat observed Beadel possessed an “outstanding color motion film libraries on quail and wildlife in the Southeast.”\n\nToday, the Tall Timbers research station holds 158,000 acres in conservation easements.\n\nJames Cullen Lawrence (1932 - 2024)\n\nJames Cullen “J.C.” Lawrence grew up in the Allen subdivision, a neighborhood north of Florida A&M University. The family home was on Canal Street, now part of FAMU Way, where the Anita Favors Lake and Plaza is today.\n\nCherry Lawrence, a younger sister, said the Bronough Street bridge runs right through her childhood bedroom.\n\nJC was known as “Cowboy” while growing up. He starred in basketball at FAMU High, earned a master’s degree in education at FAMU and when he returned after serving in the U.S. Army, he became a role model for the Allen neighborhood kids.\n\nIn 1959, James Cullen Lawrence was named the first Black supervisor over the City of Tallahassee playgrounds and parks. He was put in charge of two recreation centers and the Jake Gaither Golf Course as well.\n\n“It was huge for a Black man to be named manager of a golf course in Tallahassee. That kind of opportunity did not come easy for Black folks,” said Deloris Harpool, who was a teenager and neighbor at the time.\n\n“His appointment was uplifting. It made us feel like we had a chance,” said Harpool.\n\nLawrence was an all-around volunteer. He initiated the first Black Pee Wee Football League of Tallahassee, coordinated the Jake Gaither Alumni Golf Association, and served as treasurer of the Tallahassee branch of the NAACP.\n\nAt the recreational centers, Harpool and Cherry said he “molded the maturity” of a younger generation.\n\nCherry said JC played the role of “a real big brother” for many. He modeled a standard of behavior that demonstrated respect for others. And he expected his young charges to follow his lead when it came to the rules governing playgrounds, rec centers, and golf courses.\n\n“Although he knew us as kids (from Canal St.), he was pretty strict about that. At the dances we attended, skating activities, and basketball games held there, we were all well behaved. He was someone that we really did look up to and we obeyed,” said Cherry.\n\nDelores said JC received the same level of respect given the principal at school.\n\nIn 2002, the previous Dade Street Recreation Center was renamed the Lawrence-Gregory Community Center to honor James C. Lawrence, retired Recreation Superintendent and Beulah Gregory, Supervisor of the Tallahassee Dade Street facility\n\nWilliam May Walker (1905 - 1974)\n\nThe Honorable W. May Walker was a Crawfordville native who practiced law in Tallahassee and became known as the hardest working judge in Florida.\n\nWalker served as a county judge from 1932 to 1940 and then as a Circuit Court judge until his death in 1974.\n\nTallahasseans of his era remember Judge Walker for ending Miami Sen. Lee Weisenborn’s efforts to move the state capital away from Tallahassee.\n\nFor three years, Weisenborn and allies filed challenges to a bond issue to raise the money to build a new state Capitol complex downtown.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs lost an appeal to the Supreme Court in 1968, Walker issued an injunction against any further challenges, telling Weisenborn anymore lawsuits would be “for what purpose I do not know.”\n\nAnother famous case involved a 1959 sexual assault of a FAMU student by four white defendants. At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Walker denied defense counsel’s motion for acquittal and sentenced all four defendants to life at the Florida State Prison in Raiford.\n\nAt his passing, former Leon County Judge Charles McClure recalled Walker had a talent to get to the crux of a case. McClure said “it seemed as if he could always come up with the right decision. It was second nature to him, and things would very logically fall into place.”\n\nThe 2nd Judicial Circuit Historical Society records Judge Walker as one of the most distinguished jurists ever to serve the state.\n\nGeorge Langford (1923 - 2019)\n\nGeorge Langford, founder of the Municipal Code Corporation, was the 1989 Florida Entrepreneur of the Year. The visionary publisher is also remembered as the father of the Seminole Boosters.\n\nLangford was a World War II veteran and University of Virginia Law graduate. He came to Tallahassee in 1951 with an idea: Codify the regulations of cities and towns, and publish them in books that are called the city codes.\n\nHaving all a city’s ordinances at one’s fingertips in a book turned out to be a hugely successful idea. Langford’s Municipal Code Corporation became a multi-million-dollar enterprise with a 40,000-square-foot printing press near the airport.\n\nThen in the mid-1970s a financial crisis threatened the Florida State University football team. The athletic department was $600,000 in debt and school president Stanley Marshall said if money was not found cuts would be made.\n\nA call was placed to Langford for help. All people can recall is he was “recruited.” In any event, he is credited with resurrecting the Seminole Boosters, which wiped out the debt.\n\nHe would lead the Boosters for three years – a defining moment for FSU athletics that included the hiring of Bobby Bowden as the head football coach.\n\n“The decision to recruit George Langford ... was one of the most important events that has occurred in our 64-year history,” said then Seminole Boosters President Andy Miller when Langford passed.\n\nLangford held a permanent seat on the FSU Foundation Board of Trustees, chaired FSU’s first Capital Campaign, was a founder of Springtime Tallahassee, and involved in dozens of civic organizations.\n\nHe raised money for MaClay School, Tall Timbers, the Monticello Opera House, Springtime Tallahassee, The Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce, the United Way, St. John’s Episcopal Church and St. Peter’s Anglican Church.\n\nThe George and Marian Langford $1 million endowment to FSU’s Department of Classics came about after Langford asked then-president Sandy D'Alemberte which department never had received a financial gift.\n\nLangford was recognized for his unwavering commitment and dedication to FSU in 2000 when the Boosters named a grassy area outside Doak Campbell Stadium where fans and vendors gather The Langford Green.\n\nNic Gavalas (1922 - 2014)\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old Nicholas George Gavalas arrived in Tallahassee after World War II and became a founding member of several civic-minded organizations and created the iconic Florida tie.\n\nThe son of a master tailor, Gavalas and his wife Janet opened Nic’s Toggery downtown at Monroe Street and Pensacola Street.\n\nThe store catered to college students and turned into a college hangout. Nic was warm and engaging with customers. He carried the latest fashions. The store quickly joined the ranks of Esquire Magazine’s Top 100 Men’s Store in the United States.\n\n“It was a gathering spot,\" former FSU football player Ron Schomburger, told Tallahassee Democrat’s Gerald Ensley when Gavalas died.\n\n“We’d go in to look at the clothes but have a good conversation with him and his employees. It was like talking to an old friend,” said Schomburger, about Nic.\n\n“To my generation, Nic was a legend,” said ESPN broadcaster Lee Corso, a former Seminole quarterback. “He was like a father figure to me.”\n\nA founding member of Seminole Boosters, Nic designed a Sammy Seminole tie to promote Florida State University athletics.\n\nBut it was his Florida tie that features an outline of the state that became ubiquitous, especially when the Legislature was in town. Former U.S. Senator and Gov. Bob Graham claimed to have worn one for more than 20 years.\n\nNic Gavalas’ legacy continues with Nic’s Toggery, the Official Clothier of the Florida State Seminoles, and with two stores, one downtown and a second one in north Tallahassee.\n\nWilmoth H. and Kathleen Baker (1928 - 2006 and 1929 - 2007)\n\nWhen Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker opened Baker’s Pharmacy in 1958 only one other pharmacy in town would hire a Black pharmacist and there were only certain stores where Black people could shop.\n\nKathleen had a pharmacy degree from Xavier University, and she convinced her husband Wilmoth to pursue one at Florida A&M University where she taught.\n\nThe couple then decide to open a pharmacy in a duplex where Wilmoth’s father had a practice. Sort of a one-stop medical facility for a segregated community.\n\nMoney was tight. When the couple opened their store in August 1958 on South Adams Street, the shelves were stocked with only one of each item – because that was all the Bakers could afford.\n\nWilmoth and Kathleen worked 12-hours a day, seven-days a week to make the pharmacy what former FAMU interim-President Henry Lewis III would call a “beacon of light for this community.”\n\nIt was eclectic. The Bakers sold medicine and almost everything else – from sewing thread to birthday and Christmas gifts.\n\nThe counter at their soda fountain drew college students, professionals, the elderly and unemployed. There they swapped news, traded gossip, and sold tickets to social events.\n\nBaker’s Pharmacy was also the internship training ground for nearly 200 FAMU pharmacy students, including Lewis, who would go on to become a Leon County Commissioner, Dean of the College of Pharmacy and a FAMU interim president.\n\nThe pharmacy closed in 2002. Here is an excerpt from a letter to the editor Lewis sent to the Tallahassee Democrat at the time.\n\n“Baker’s Pharmacy was a safe and clean place to take your girlfriend. It was a place where health care was a fundamental right, regardless of your ability to pay. Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker were mother and father away from home for hundreds of FAMU students in their quest for a college degree. The Bakers were a shining example of how a married couple should be and how to raise a family.”\n\nPaul Dirac (1902 - 1984)\n\nPaul Dirac may be the most distinguished Tallahassean ever.\n\nThe 1975 Compton Encyclopedia Yearbook declared him an equal to Sir Isacc Newton and Albert Einstein.\n\nEinstein once said about a Dirac paper, “this balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.”\n\nDirac won the 1933 Nobel Prize in physics for his Relativistic Wave Equation. He anticipated the string theory in 1962 with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and the Dirac membrane.\n\nTheoretical physicist Stephen Hawking said Dirac “changed our picture of the universe.”\n\nIt was a twist of fate, and lakes, that made him a Tallahasseean.\n\nDirac held the Lucasian Chair in Mathematics at Cambridge University in England – Newton was the first to hold the chair. As Dirac was approaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, FSU offered him a visiting professorship.\n\nIt was 1969. He liked the place. Became a familiar face at seafood restaurants. Would walk to work. Was often spotted swimming at Silver Lake and Lost Lake.\n\nDirac didn’t want to retire so he said goodbye Cambridge, hello Florida. He joined the FSU faculty full time in 1971.\n\n“FSU has a good physics department,” said Dirac when asked why he was here.\n\n“Here I escape the harsh winters of the North. I like swimming in the lakes, rivers, sinkholes and the sea. There are lots of swimming opportunities around Tallahassee. To some extent that is what brought me here.”\n\nDirac received many honors, including the Royal Medal, the Copley Medal, the Max Planck Medal and the inaugural J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize. He once turned down a knighthood because he did not want to be addressed by his first name but later consented and became a member of the Order of Merit in 1973.\n\nPaul Dirac passed away in Tallahassee and was buried at Roselawn Cemetery. His papers are held at the Paul A.M. Dirac Science Library at Florida State University. The street in Innovation Park where the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is located is named Paul Dirac Drive in his honor.\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos (1907 - 1977)\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos is the mother of Vo-Tech education in Leon County.\n\nWhen she was named principal of the Lively Continuation School in 1935, the Vienna, Ga., native was one of just two female vocational school directors in the country.\n\nCsikos would travel throughout Florida to construct a bureaucratic infrastructure for vocational education and became a stalwart lobbyist for job training in the Legislature.\n\nCsikos was born in 1907 and moved to Tallahassee eight years later. She graduated from Leon High School in 1926.\n\nShe was one of two teachers hired by Lewis M. Lively in 1931, one of two for 52 students at his school who trained office skills to students not college bound. She taught shorthand and typing.\n\nEvelyn also worked as a stenographer for the Legislature. When she was named director of what would become Lively, World War II was on the horizon and she would change the focus of vocational education.\n\nNorth Florida became a hub of activity for wartime preparation. Aircraft mechanics would join shorthand and accounting in the Lively curriculum, along with the operation of new technology like mimeographing.\n\nCsikos embraced the change and wangled millions of dollars from the federal and state governments to fund vocational and technical education for students not bound for college but wanting skills to earn a living.\n\nUpon her retirement in 1973, Csikos predicted the future of vocational education would be in middle and high schools because she said many college graduates “are learning a college diploma alone won’t get them a job.”\n\nIn retirement, Csikos developed the curriculum for the Pat Thomas Law Enforcement Program.\n\nCsikos died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital while recovering from a heart attack in 1977.\n\nRear Admiral David Betton Macomb (1827 - 1911)\n\nDavid Macomb was the youngest son of David Macomb Sr., and Mary Tiffin Worthington. Mary’s father was the governor of Ohio, and her family opposed the marriage.\n\nThe couple moved to Tallahassee in 1824. They settled along Lake Iamonia, and had five children, David B. the youngest.\n\nThe senior Macomb gained notoriety for a duel with Prince Murat, shooting off Murat’s little finger. He then moved the family to Texas. Tuberculosis claimed Mary and the senior Macomb ended his life by slashing his throat a few months later.\n\nAt age 9, David and his siblings were left orphaned, and raised by family in Ohio.\n\nWhen he was 22, David was appointed a third assistant engineer in the U.S. Navy and explored the North Pacific and the Sea of Japan. When the Civil War broke out, Macomb would be aboard one of the first Union vessels to enter the conflict, and at war’s end he was on the ship that fired the final shots.\n\nHe also distinguished himself as an inventor.\n\nMacomb was the chief engineer of the USS Niagara in April 1861 when it became the first U.S. Navy ship to form up the blockade of Charleston. Niagara would later participate in the bombardment of the Pensacola Naval Yard.\n\nHe returned to Charleston in 1865 aboard the USS Canonicus, which fired the final shot as the rebels retreated to Sullivan’s Island as the South surrendered.\n\nThe Canonicus was then sent in pursuit of a Confederate ironclad, the chase took the Canonicus to Havana where she became the first American ironclad to enter a foreign port.\n\nAmong the inventions Macomb contributed to the U.S. Navy were a hydraulic lift used aboard ironclads, and he made and installed the first fresh-water maker used on a U.S. Navy vessel.\n\nMacomb retired February 27, 1889, with the rank of commodore. He was later promoted to rear admiral.\n\nA street in the Frenchtown neighborhood, and the destroyer the USS Macomb – known as the Mighty Mac by its crew – are named in honor of Rear Admiral Macomb.\n\nDr. Kamal Abdou Yousef, aka King Love (1936 - 1999)\n\nKing Love was someone no one understood but everyone talked about. He reigned in Tallahassee for six years.\n\nKing Love was the creation of Kamal Abdou Youssef. A child prodigy pianist who played for the King of Egypt at the Cairo Opera House in 1949, Yousef graduated from medical school in 1956, moved to New York City in 1969, and then West Palm in 1977.\n\nYoussef, a pathologist, established a successful practice.\n\nPeople say Youssef changed when the first Gulf War started in 1991. He became involved with an anti-war group, was diagnosed with manic depression and then became estranged from his family.\n\nThat’s when King Love came to be, a man with a white beard, a golden crown and a red cape holding a megaphone, and waving signs at intersections around town.\n\nOne would find the King at the corner of Tennessee and Monroe streets during the morning commute and at Apalachee Parkway and Magnolia Street in the afternoon. An electronic megaphone amplified shouts of “Yip, Yip, Yip,\" as he skipped through the crosswalk with signs that promoted love, denounced God, and one adorned with photos of JFK and Princess Diana that encouraged people to “Return to Camelot.”\n\n“I think it was the Gulf War that pushed him over the edge. Before that, he was a normal, very loving person,” his son Anwar told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter who tracked down the family after Yousef’s passing.\n\n“It was like his heart was being torn out. We lost all contact with him after the Gulf War,” said Anwar. “It was all quite sudden.”\n\nKing Love arrived in Tallahassee around 1993 and endeared himself to Tallahasseeans.\n\nTallahassee Police arrested him several times on petty theft, trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. Two college students who took him in briefly said Yousef was knowledgeable, a good conversationalist, but could become agitated and erratic.\n\nYousef’s Florida arrest record dates to 1991. A FDLE report listed eight different spellings of his given name and listed his occupation simply as “King.”\n\nHe used his monthly social security checks to publish “love declarations.” They were a mix of brotherhood tinged with paranoia.\n\n“I realize that people have been cheated of real paradise on Earth,” the King told break magazine in 1995. “They have been cheated of their innocence, falsely convicted as sinners and their wages of sin is hell and everlasting fire and wailing and gnashing of teeth. For some, hell is here and now.”\n\nWhen his health began to decline and in his final year, Youseff gave up the King Love persona.\n\nHe shaved his beard, stopped wearing crowns and robes, and quit ranting about politicians. Kamal Abdu Yousef began attending Baptist Celebration Church, which invited an Egyptian priest when it held services for Yousef after he died alone in his apartment.\n\n“I wish to thank the people of Tallahassee from the depth of my heart. People here tolerated him and didn’t harm him. In other societies they would have clobbered him to death. I know it,\" said his brother Nagaui A. Michael, a retired New York City attorney, before the service.\n\n“If I could say one thing to him right now it would be I’m sorry. Because I did not believe in him. Fortunately, the people of Tallahassee did.”\n\nFred Mahan (1886 - 1960)\n\nOn the east side of town where Hillcrest Avenue meets U.S. 90 there’s a 76-year-old marker that designates the highway from Tallahassee to Monticello as Fred Mahan Drive.\n\nFred Mahan was a horticulturist from Dodge City, Kansas, who had a passion for highway beautification.\n\nHe also created the Mahan Pecan, a pecan with a bigger nut and lighter shell, at his Monticello nursery.\n\nIn the 1920s, he would own the second-largest pecan and ornamental shrubs business in the southeast.\n\nCoronet Magazine described him as a “strange philanthropist who bestows beauty instead of dollars\" while \"spreading scenic bounty across the state he loves.”\n\nAt the height of the Great Depression, Mahan donated thousands of plants to the county unemployment relief commissions for beautification projects to employ the jobless.\n\nWhen a road company got a contract to remove tree stubs and make other road improvements along U.S. 90 between Tallahassee and Monticello, he contributed thousands of crepe myrtles, camelli", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/05/thinking-out-loud/83984090/", "title": "Thinking Out Loud: Random ideas and commentary", "text": "Rockland/Westchester Journal News\n\n\n\nHere's what we're thinking: Lots goes on in the lohud region.

We'll frequently add fresh views to the list — including reader-generated TOLs.\n\nWeek of Dec. 25\n\nWe’d like to wish our readers a happy New Year! We hope 2017 brings great news, active reader participation, and thoughtful commentary that will broaden all our perspectives.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo has commuted the sentence of Judith Clark, the getaway driver in the 1981 Brinks robbery/murder in Rockland. Now 67, she will go before the Parole Board in early 2017; her original sentence was 75 years to life. Now the Parole Board must make a tough but fair choice.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo plans to give six regional 2017 State of the State addresses, ignoring protocol, and the state Legislature. One wonders if legislators, whose long-awaited raise was scuttled by Cuomo appointees, will miss him.\n\nThe flu is back in New York — declared “prevalent” by the state. Influenza usually peaks in February. The Health Department recommends a flu shot for everyone 6 months of age and older. Yeah, that’s you.\n\nDemands for the dismissal of Buffalo school board member Carl Paladino are coming from every quarter, including his board peers. His gross, overtly racist comments about President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama offend everyone. The state should step in and dismiss him. If not, voters can accomplish that, too, next election.\n\nWeek of Dec. 18\n\n‘Tis the season of family, friends and renewed faith for so many in our region. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Joyous Kwanzaa to all who observe.\n\nClarkstown’s sandstone Onderdonck House and 1820 Traphagen House are recommended for the State and National Registers of Historic Places. Meanwhile, the Historical Society of Rockland County lost county funding.\n\nStudents from 13 high schools, including three in Yonkers, were in Albany to watch New York’s Electoral College members cast their votes. At a time of deep pessimism about politics, we hope some of those students were inspired to consider public service. Make things better, youngsters.\n\nFellowship of Reconciliation, an international peace organization, is readying to sell its Upper Nyack headquarters, a riverfront mansion called Shadowcliff. FOR has long been generous with its programming and property for the greater Rockland community. A local loss.\n\nWeek of Dec. 11\n\nWeek of Dec. 4\n\nWe lost a space-age icon Thursday with the death of John Glenn, the first Amercian to orbit the Earth. From serving as a Marine Corps flighter pilot to pathbreaking astronaut to a dedicated U.S. senator, his 95 years on Earth were a true inspiration. Godspeed, John Glenn.\n\nOur hearts go out to all who knew and respected Dr. John Salimbene of Scarsdale, who died in a house fire. The 85-yar-old served as Tuckahoe’s village-appointed physican for over 50 years and was a well-known figure in his community for decades. Sounds like a throwback in all the good ways.\n\nThe easy passage of East Ramapo School District’s $58 million bond plan for capital repairs — 1,641-375 — indicates growing public confidence in the district, thanks to the deep involvement of state monitors. Now the school board and administrators must keep the momentum by making necessary repairs efficiently and transparently.\n\nThe Yankees have announced that Derek Jeter’s No. 2 will be retired on Mother’s Day. Hours later, Jeter happened to be speaking in Westchester, talking about the competitive fire that drove him. The guy’s only 42. We hope he can find a productive outlet for that fire in “retirement.”\n\nWeek of Nov. 27\n\nWeek of Nov. 20\n\nOh, phew! We made it through the first of the big holidays this season. Now, though, there’s gift drives everywhere. What to do? Remember how good those food pantry dropoffs felt and give some more.\n\nLayoffs have started and another administrator is out at the College of New Rochelle, which faces at least $31.2 million in ‘unmet financial obligations.’ We just hope that the college can protect students while dealing with this crisis. Ninety six percent now receive financial aid.\n\nIt was a tough start to the holiday season for 13 Ossining High students who suffered minor injuries after their school bus hit a pole. We’re just thankful they weren’t hurt worse. Remember to thank your kid’s driver, once in a while, for doing an important job that’s easy to take for granted.\n\nMaybe you haven’t noticed. But we doubt it. A big social (and standard) media push is on to send the message: Drink cartons — think milk and OJ — are recyclable. What does that mean to you? Recycle your cartons, of course.\n\nWeek of Nov. 13\n\nThe plug’s been pulled on a 47 percent legislative pay raise, thanks to the governor’s appointees to a special panel. During the last election, candidates said they didn’t want the pay raise. But now there’s plenty of recriminations for Cuomo, who legislative leaders said was acting like a ‘king.’\n\nNew York’s own Sen. Chuck Schumer, now Senate minority leader, will be one of President Trump’s chief adversaries. The Democrat will need both his tenacity and sense of humor moving forward.\n\nWeek of Nov. 6\n\nGathering up those supermarket ‘points’ that add up to a free turkey or a big discount on your Thanksgiving shopping spree? Consider, when you stock up, sharing the wealth with a local food pantry.\n\nKudos to Cullen Malzo, the 19-year-old who saved two teens from murky Lake Mahopac after their car crashed, flipped and landed in the water. Just like Cullen, we need to look out for each other.\n\nRIP, Leonard Cohen. The singer-songwriter died at 82; he had just released his 14th album. Cohen’s song, ‘Hallelujah,’ was cast aside by his label; it is now ubiquitous. His richly symbolic writings touched so many.\n\nVeterinarians can now offer free spay-and-neuter programs as a way to fulfill state continuing education requirements. More spays performed, fewer strays. Good deal.\n\nWeek of Oct. 30\n\nVarious signs, touting New York as a tourism draw, now dot state highways. The Federal Highway Administration says they are illegal, and has warned the Cuomo administration numerous times. The real issue is: do they actually help drivers or bring tourism dollars? Doubtful.\n\nGarbage trucks are now covered by the state’s Move Over Law, which requires drivers to change lanes or slow down when passing key vehicles. It’s a dangerous job, with impatient drivers adding to the risks. Good move.\n\nThe good news: colleges are offering you aid! But now you have to figure out which package makes the most financial sense. Thanks to the state’s new rule that mandates all New York schools use a uniform Financial Aid Award Information Sheet, it should be easier to make smart choices.\n\nWeek of Oct. 23\n\nNew to the collection at the Museum of Modern Art? The original ‘emoji’ released in 1999. There were 176 pixel images that could be employed to express your feelings. Yes, that’s art, and that’s history. Who feels old now?\n\nAfter another parent was found at the wheel, in the throes of a heroin overdose, with a kid in the back seat, a town marshal told the Indianapolis Star that this scenario is ‘a new norm for drug users’ because it’s ‘away from someone who is going to disapprove.’ A crisis, on top of a crisis.\n\nClose to 74 percent of guns used in crimes in New York came from other states, according to the state Attorney General. Having strong gun-control laws in some states and lax laws in others undermines local law enforcement. Congress should make gun trafficking a federal crime and expand data tracking of guns.\n\nState troopers have launched a pre-Halloween Pumpkin Patrol and local residents brace for Gate Night. Too bad such measures are needed; those ‘tricks’ can lead to property damage and even physical injuries. Be careful, and focus on the treat.\n\nWeek of Oct. 16\n\nThis year’s Al Smith dinner, which is supposed to offer some levity during the final stretch of the campaign, came just 24 hours after the final debate. One candidate elicited boos during the usually lighthearted affair, quite a departure from the usual tenor. A precursor to Nov. 8? Only time will tell.\n\nRamapo Central School District leaders are considering changing the district’s name to Suffern Central. Why? To stop confusion with East Ramapo. Aligning the name with the high school makes sense, but will residents want to break with tradition?\n\nAlmost $55 million in settlements and expenses have been paid related to an awful series of Metro-North accidents. Only a piece of the total is connected to last year’s Valhalla crash. So far. With 80 claims pending from five accidents, Metro-North has to deal with budgetary implications and improving safety.\n\nThe UN has named Wonder Woman as an Honorary Ambassador for Female Empowerment. Not all are thrilled about the star-spangled fictional choice. Sure the Lasso of Truth is cool, but plenty of real-life heroines are speaking truth to power, and fighting to protect women and girls worldwide.\n\nWeek of Oct. 9\n\nDoes Bob Dylan write literature, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But there’s no category for revolutionizing what popular song can be. Could a Nobel Peace Prize be ‘Blowin’ in the Wind,’ too?\n\nLegislators are rethinking a 2011 decision to remove state comptroller review of SUNY contracts. With the former president of SUNY Polytechnic Institute facing criminal charges for alleged bid rigging, SUNY’s desire for flexibility takes a back seat to the need for oversight and transparency.\n\nLacrosse teams across the country have rallied in the memory of Robby Schartner, a Manhattanville College player who was killed by an alleged drunk driver in White Plains. They’re using the hashtag #TeamThree — Robby’s number — to raise awareness of drunk driving’s lethal danger. Schartner was 21.\n\nA suggestion for the Oct. 19 presidential debate: If the candidates answer questions quicker than the time allowed, the extra time is given back to them at the end, for a\n\nWeek of Oct. 2\n\nWe’ve had enough of this clowning around: someone in a clown costume trespassing at a school; another driving around Ossining while wearing a clown mask; Rockland and Westchester schools sending letters home about clown-themed social media ‘threats.’ And it isn’t even Halloween.\n\nNew York City FC plays at Yankee Stadium, but soccer practice will soon be in Orangeburg. The Major League NYC FB has purchased 17 acres on the former Rockland Psychiatric Center for a new training facility. The property stays on the tax rolls — a goal for taxpayers.\n\nAfter years of ‘Black Friday’ shopping creeping into Thanksgiving dinnertime, many stores are fighting back. From Minnesota’s Mall of America to T.J. Maxx and more, the list of retailers that are shutting for Thanksgiving grows. Bargain hunters can be thankful for the shopping break.\n\nLauren Shields, whose lifesaving heart transplant inspired the law that requires driver’s license applicants to indicate whether they want to be added to the state’s donor registry, is turning 16 next month. No surprise then that the Stony Point teen plans to check the “yes” box. Among states, New York is at the bottom of the list in the percentage of residents enrolled as organ donors. Have your registered?\n\nWeek of Sept. 26\n\nGov. Cuomo has signed a bill creating a new authority to oversee the rebuilding of Yonkers’ old, dilapidated schools. Now the state and city have to figure out how to fund the first, $520 million phase of what could be a $2 billion project. The city says the state’s normal reimbursement rate won’t cut it. Somehow, the work must get done.\n\nKnow someone going to college in the 2017-2018 academic year? FAFSA, the federal student financial aid form, can be filed beginning Oct. 1, instead of in January. It’s based on last year’s tax returns, instead of upcoming tax information. Get to it! Visit fafsa.gov.\n\nHow did only half a Suffern duplex end up aquired by New York Rising, which buys up properties in ‘floodways’? Officials called it a ‘mistake’ and now the state’s negotiating to buy the other side of the Lonergan Drive home. A remediation for the remediation effort.\n\nThe Town of Mamaroneck has been certified by New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation as a ‘Climate Smart Community.’ Its green-friendly ways include energy-saving lighting and land-use policies protect local trees, wetlands and waterways. Smart choices for the Sound Shore.\n\nWeek of Sept. 19\n\nU.S. Attorney Preet Bharara returned on his white horse, delivering what he called the ‘gory details’ of corruption tainting Albany’s upstate development projects. He unveiled charges against 10, including a former top aide to Gov. Cuomo. Will New Yorkers become enraged by more stories of Albany’s culture of personal enrichment — or will we become numb to it all?\n\nCongratulations to Croton resident and singer-actress extraordinaire Audra McDonald, who received the National Medal of Arts on Thursday evening (even though the citation went missing at the ceremony). A well-deserved honor for a woman of stunning talent and an admirable voice for social justice.\n\nFeel that fall crispness in the air? Not yet? Well soon.

Get some fresh air and support your local farm economy.\n\nGood luck to NBC’s Lester Holt, who will moderate Monday’s presidential debate. Can Donald Trump skip the superlatives? Can Hillary Clinton counter Trump’s braggadocio without coming off as condescending? Watch for #lohudvotes to follow our discussion of the #debates.\n\nWeek of Sept. 12\n\nAre you registered to vote? New Yorkers must register to vote by Oct. 14 to be eligible to cast ballots in the Nov. 8 election. It’s easy to register (or change enrollment information) at the New York DMV’s website: dmv.ny.gov and click ‘More info/register to vote.’\n\nAttempts to sell Rockland’s dilapidated Sain Building embody County Executive Ed Day’s and the Legislature’s rocky relationship. After Day announced a buyer, legislators sought their own bids; they ended up with the same bidder. The Legislature is now ‘evaluating its options.’ Find a way to sell it already.\n\nThere. He said it. After years of feigning uncertainty on whether President Obama was born in the U.S., birther-in-chief and Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, finally put the matter to rest Friday by saying Obama was indeed a natural born citizen. For Trump, it seems, the idea finally outlived its purpose.\n\nOn Thursday, Donald Trump downgraded his earlier assessment of upstate New York from ‘war zone’ to ‘death zone’ during a radio interview. But the GOP presidential hopeful failed to finally settle the “where does upstate begin” controversy. We hope he knows that lohud’s #notupstate.\n\nWeek of Sept. 5\n\nA new state law will require all school districts to test drinking water for lead by Oct. 31. It’s concerning that so many schools across New York tested positive for high lead levels in recent months. Given the dangerous health implications for children, it’s good to hear that the state will be picking up most of the tab for the testing and remediation.\n\nState park attendence jumped this summer — more than 1 million spent time at Bear Mountain State Park. That’s a good thing. More interest means more support for the open spaces that showcase New York’s beauty.\n\nWhen it comes to planning Playland’s future, Rye Mayor Joe Sack says he feels like Westchester County’s seated him at the kids table at Thanksgiving. Now the little city and county are headed to court over the amusement park’s overhaul. Like a Merry Go Round.\n\nChina’s stunning ‘glass bridge’ has become so popular, it closed just two weeks after opening and attracting thrilled (and terrified) hordes. Maybe the new Tappan Zee Bridge walking path should consider the clear-view option? No thanks.\n\nNew York just made a dozen and a half changes to the state’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. What does that mean for you? Mimosas for Sunday brunch! The ‘brunch bill’ also eases rules for the state’s burgeoning winery industry, too.\n\nWeek of 8/29\n\nThe state could soon let nurse practitioners prescribe medical marijuana, and make it easier for patients to find a qualified prescriber. Those steps make sense. New York has been understandably cautious with its medical marijuana rollout. But patients who need treatment must to be able to find the medical professionals who can help.\n\nThe kids on the Maine-Endwell Little League, in New York’s Southern Tier, have gained international acclaim as the 2016 Little League World Series champs. It’s the first World Series victory by a New York team since 1964. To paraphrase Drake, all’s well that’s (Maine) Endwell.\n\nIt looks like the French-American School of New York and White Plains Common Council have come up with a compromise for a scaled-down version of the private school campus to locate at the former Ridgeway Country Club. Let’s hope this is a path to ending long and costly litigation.\n\nAnother motorcyclist has died on local roads, this time a 38-year-old Nyack man, killed Wednesday on the Tappan Zee Bridge. Recent National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration data show a 7.7 percent jump of road fatalities between 2014 and 2015. Think safety, always, for all on the road.\n\nWeek of 8/22\n\nAn historic marker commemorating Blauvelt’s place in rock history was unveiled last week. It marks the spot where Brooks Arthur’s 914 Sound Recording Studios once stood. Many classic tracks, including Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run,” were laid down there. Kudos to the hamlet and to lohud’s Robert Brum, who made the tribute happen.\n\nSeven athletes with ties to the Lower Hudson Valley competed for the United States in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. Brewster’s Mclain Ward contributed to a silver medal in equestrian team jumping and Salesian High School alum Daryl Homer won silver in men’s sabre fencing. Congratulations, you all did us proud!\n\nIt’s more than a little disturbing that the feds seized 65 pounds of heroin from a trailer parked on a quiet Cortlandt street. The drugs came from Mexico and were set for distribution throughout the region. But we can’t be surprised by international trafficking reaching into the Lower Hudson. If there is a demand, the supply will be there.\n\nA 20-year-old motorcyclist from Ossining died last week after striking a car in Mount Pleasant, becoming only the latest motorcycle fatality. Last year, 154 motorcyclists were killed in crashes in New York state. Veteran riders have been calling on the state to require more training for newcomers, as accident victims are often in their 20s. What a waste.\n\nWeek of 8/15\n\nA promising coffee klatch aimed at building police-community relations is in the works. Yonkers’ Coffee with a Cop starts Tuesday. Residents and police officers get a chance to interact in a casual setting. Shouldn’t every community copy this idea?\n\nSoon, under New York law, dogs and cats once used for medical research could get a chance to be your pet. Animals deemed OK for placement by a veterinarian could get a new lease on life, instead of being euthanized. That’s the least we can do for our four-legged friends helping us to enhance our lives.\n\nThe newly signed Tiffany Heitkamp’s Law requires judges to consider past DWI convictions when sentencing those convicted of boating while intoxicated. The link makes sense: Dangerous and irresponsible drunken driving is drunken driving, no matter the vehicle.\n\nAssemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, R-Staten Island, pledges a bill to stop the state from imposing income tax on the stipend Olympic athletes receive when they win a medal. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, has similar federal legislation. We should salute such ‘earnings’ — not tax them.\n\nWeek of 8/8\n\nMarijuana remains a Schedule I drug, a DEA designation that means it has no accepted medical use, even though half the states have medical marijuana programs. The feds’ decision maintains a chilling effect on research.\n\nIt’s silver for U.S. fencer Daryl Homer! The Salesian High grad and Bronx native learned about fencing from the dictionary, when he was 5. See, reading can make you a champion.\n\nNew York’s become the first state to offer certification of products grown in the state. The ‘New York State Grown & Certified’ program is designed to boost state agriculture, and consumer confidence. Look for the logo at a market near you.\n\nWeek of 8/1\n\nIt’s a no-brainer that the state should allow East Ramapo school board trustee Sabrina Charles-Pierre to keep the two-year term that voters granted her in May, even though she wasn’t given the oath of office by the deadline. The real question is why the school board didn’t ask for the state’s help earlier.\n\nOdell Beckham, anyone? New York’s fantasy football fans can prepare for their drafts now that Gov. Cuomo has signed a bill regulating giants like DraftKings and FanDuel. The companies will have to pay registration fees and taxes. We love football, but it’s a fat cash cow before anything else.\n\nNew York has one of the lowest rates of organ donor registration. Yet the state Health Department has failed to spend one penny of the $1 million raised through ‘Donate Life’ license plates to promote organ donation. Thanks to the state comptroller for pointing this out. Now, let’s fix it.\n\nRockland County police exams are Nov. 19. There’s a big push to diversify local police forces. As one community activist said: ‘Be the change you want to be or you want to see.’ Find out about the exam at mycivilservice.rocklandgov.com.\n\nWeek of 7/25\n\nNo matter what you think of Hillary Clinton, she’s made history as the first woman to win a major-party presidential nomination. How fitting: from Seneca Falls to Chappaqua. She even addressed the DNC after Tuesday’s rollcall vote from Crabtree’s Kittle House, a beloved Westchester institution. All that stands in her way is another New Yorker.\n\nA former men’s basketball coach at Westchester Community College has been indicted, accused of forging student transcripts to help players jump to Division I schools. Such a scheme damages students-athletes. Even if some succeeded on the court, educational opportunities would be trashed, making them less prepared for long post-basketball lives.\n\nA new federal rating system ranks hospitals with one to five stars – likes movies. The ratings are based on dozens of metrics, from infection rates to patient surveys, but it’s hard to gauge their accuracy. Northern Westchester Hospital (a 4-star rating) probably likes the system better than Westchester Medical Center (1 star).\n\nNew York joined the court battle challenging North Carolina’s “bathroom bill.” Why? Because New Yorkers who are transgender or don’t fit the traditional gender binary could be endangered during visits to that state. And, as Gov. Cuomo said, because “divisiveness and discrimination encouraged by this law directly undermine the core values of this nation.”\n\nWeek of 7/18\n\nWestchester’s 2009 affordable housing settlement drags on, but the court-appointed monitor is moving on. In his resignation letter, James Johnson says his replacement ‘should recognize that the assignment may extend for months, if not years, beyond the end of this year.’ Ugh.\n\nRemaining 9/11 artifacts have been removed from a hangar at JFK, so it can be returned to aviation use. The items, salvaged from the destruction at Ground Zero, will be readied for display, so the history, and the tragedy, can always be remembered. Still, nearly 15 years later, we mourn.\n\nMelania Trump’s speechwriter apologized for inadvertently including key phrases used by Michelle Obama in 2008. Ah well. Worth noting the phrase left out of Trump’s GOP convention speech, about showing respect for people “... even if you don’t know them, and even if you don’t agree with them.\"\n\nOrangetown now wants out-of-towners to pay a hefty fee to use local parks. Residents-only policies are growing. Various towns are citing fiscal pressure from the state’s tax cap, saying residents’ taxes maintain facilities, so other users need to kick in. The neighborhood just got smaller.\n\nWeek of 7/11\n\nThere are renewed calls for communities to encourage young black men and women to join their police forces. A force that is reflective of the community it serves will increase trust and pave the way for better understanding and more empathetic police-community relations. The time is right to put new energy into this goal.\n\nIt’s a bummer when a longtime local business closes. So a tip of the hat to Sitzmark ski shop in Pearl River, shutting down after 48 years. There’s internet competition, of course. Fewer people ski. Less snow. The shop’s in a former Episcopal church. The chapel’s still there. Local history.\n\nPokémon GO is everywhere at once. Players are using phone apps to hunt for characters all around you. Have fun, people, but be careful out there. Think before you go.\n\nWith all the local governments in Westchester, it’s not surprising that compensation for public officials is all over the place. Who can say what a fair package looks like in a small village or town? Here’s one good deal: In at least 19 communities, part-time council members get health and/or retirement benefits. How do you get on the ballot, anyway?\n\nWeek of 7/3\n\nRecording criminal interrogations protects people being questioned and the interrogators doing the questioning. We laud the state’s dedication of $500,000 in grants to outfit more police with such recording abilities. It protects the integrity of the system.\n\nMobile ticketing is on track for Metro-North. Now, Hudson line riders can use e-tickets through the MTA’s eTix app. That’s a convenience for rushed travelers. The Harlem line should be app-ready in a couple weeks, and New Haven line comes on board in August.\n\nDrivers stuck on the Sprain Brook Parkway on Wednesday night after a chemical spill said they were given no information from authorities. Yes, this was an unusual situation, but state and county police should learn how to do better next time.\n\nGrand View Village Hall, perched along the Hudson on stately River Road, is no more. The building, severely damaged in Superstorm Sandy, has been torn down. A new Village Hall will meet federal standards to weather the next storm. Still, a loss.\n\nWeek of 6/27\n\nResidents of Pearl River in Orangetown and Edgemont in Greenburgh are seriously considering incorporating their hamlets into villages. Town zoning decisions are cited for their ire. More layers of government in New York? Seems counterintuitive.\n\nNot one bill was defeated on the floor of the state Legislature this year. That’s because leaders don’t allow votes unless passage is guaranteed. Not surprisingly, 38 out of 63 state senators voted in favor of at least 95 percent of all bills. Democracy in action.\n\nSpring Valley Village Board bickering has pretty much sunk any progress in the village. Finally, though, trustees provided funding for a summer camp program at the Martin Luther King Multipurpose Center, and funding to send village kids to Ramapo town camp. Progress, but hardly enough.\n\nTennessee’s legendary Pat Summitt, the winningest D1 college baskeball coach of all time, died Tuesday at age 64 after a battle with early onset Alzheimer’s. The Olympic medalist (as both a player and coach) demonstrated leadership, and portrayed bravery and a commitment to educating people about dementia.\n\nWeek of 6/20\n\nSmall firework sales are now legal in Rockland and Putnam, but not Westchester. With Independence Day coming up, sales are picking up, retailers say. Remember that even sparklers, when handled unsafely, can bring a serious burn. Have a safe and happy Fourth of July.\n\nNew York plays a bit part in lots of TV shows, and provides a backdrop for many movies. In the first quarter of this year, the state dished out nearly $128 million for its film tax credit program. Critics slam the credits, but the state says it supports jobs. Another benefit: showcasing the Empire State’s beauty and diversity.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans on the Westchester County Board of Legislators are battling over when to hold a special election to replace the retiring Bernice Spreckman, whose district includes parts of Yonkers and Mount Vernon. What makes sense, politics aside? To hold it Sept. 13 — already primary day in Mount Vernon. A separate August vote would be hard to justify.\n\nOne summertime tradition we could all do without: the seasonal shortage of blood donations. With many people away on vacation, and schools out of session, community blood drives dwindle. But the need continues. Give, if you can.

The 4-foot-by-2-foot crucifix had been on the high altar since 1937. But it’s sad that the church now has continuously running cameras to discourage future crimes.\n\nWeek of 6/13:\n\nThe massacre in Orlando has been called a hate crime and terrorism, and an example of a gun culture gone wild. It is all of those. But we cannot gloss over the fact that people in the LGBT community were the target. People face a constant and growing threat, simply for who they are. We must acknowledge it if we have any hope of stopping it.\n\nThe Legislature has passed the Research Animal Retirement Act, known as the Beagle Bill, which requires state-funded research facilities to make the dogs and cats used for testing available for adoption. A vet checks out the animal to make sure a home placement is appropriate. The governor should sign the bill and provide that measure of hope for lab animals.\n\nHave you taken a minute to see if the state has money owed to you? The state is sitting on $14 billion in unclaimed funds from old accounts, including 620,000 accounts in the Lower Hudson Valley. Go here before you forget: nydatabases.com/database/unclaimed-funds\n\nIt’s good to see Purchase College finally moving ahead with plans for senior-citizen housing on campus. Residents can audit classes and attend cultural events. And the college can use the money for scholarships and faculty hirings. Students can learn from elders with real-life experience. No wonder that college-based retirement communities are popping up nationwide.\n\nA big shoutout to North Salem High School baseball! The Class C state champions won with style in Binghamton last weekend. Go Tigers! Plus, Iona Prep’s Gaels went unbeaten (even a no hitter!) to take the CHSAA AA championship.\n\nWeek of 6/6:\n\nHere comes the mansplaining: After a Stanford swimming star’s six-month jail sentence on three counts of felony sexual assault, the talk started up about alcohol use as some kind of mitigating circumstance. Really, still? Here’s the best advice to combat rape: Don’t rape.\n\nA Clarkstown teacher has started a movement to convince Yankee fans to boycott the team since it’s no longer affordable to attend games. Prices are outrageous — as they are for all pro sports team, concerts, Broadway, you name it. If anyone stepped up to offer quality, affordable entertainment, they could make a mint (before, likely, hiking ticket prices).\n\nWho wasn’t enchanted by Grace VanderWaal, the 12-year-old from Suffern who knocked everyone’s socks off when she sang and played ukulele on “America’s Got Talent.” ‘Ol Simon Cowell called her the next Taylor Swift. Wouldn’t that be great? One bit of advice: stay off the social media, kid.\n\nThe end-of-school swirl of activity is upon us. Concerts, awards ceremonies and field days at every turn. That smarmy parenting adage — the days are long, the years are short — really is true. Enjoy the bustle while it lasts.\n\nChappaqua resident Hillary Clinton made history Monday as she became the first woman to clinch a major party’s presidential nomination. We congratulate the former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state on this achievement. Would she make history once again come November? We wait and watch.\n\nWeek of 5/30\n\nAs Rockland County began inspecting private schools, at the behest of the state, some yeshiva administrators declined access to their buildings. Some Orthodox Jewish leaders question County Executive Ed Day’s motivations. The state Education Department drew up the list of schools, and enlisted the county’s help. Let’s focus on safety, not political squabbling.\n\nThe state Attorney General’s Office found Domino’s Pizza underpaid about 750 minimum-wage employees from 2007 to 2013. Under a settlement agreement, the franchisees will now be required to institute complaint procedures for employees and provide bilingual written handbooks. If franchisees of a national chain can be found guilty of wage theft, one shudders to think how pervasive the problem actually might be.\n\nWhat a shameful act, this past Memorial Day, when American flags decorating gravestones in the historic Rye African American Cemetery were damaged by vandals. The holiday is rooted in Decoration Day, and honors those who gave their lives in service to our nation.\n\nSUNY Chancellor Nancy Zimpher is leaving next year. She’s expanded SUNY’s degree offerings and stature, but her salary and benefits drew criticism. While Zimpher advocated for permission to hike tuition $300 a year for five more years, the Legislature gave SUNY students a one-year tuition freeze and boosted state aid. Let’s hope there’s more of that to come.\n\nAfter two previous vetoes, Gov. Cuomo has signed a bill that allows all veterans to purchase up to three years of credit in the state’s retirement system, an option once only offered combat vets. Offsets for the estimated $14.8 million a year cost still must be found, since the governor, for the third time, left funding out of the budget.\n\nWeek of 5/23\n\nOn Memorial Day, we honor those who served and died for our country. Parades and ceremonies around the Lower Hudson Valley will pay tribute to our fallen troops; watchfires in Rockland will remember our lost troops. We remember, and are humbled by, and grateful for, their sacrifice.\n\nNew York’s so-called ‘tampon tax’ is soon no more. The Legislature passed, and Gov. Cuomo pledges to sign, a bill axing sales tax on feminine hygiene products. So, for tax purposes, they will be treated like medical supplies. That’s fair, finally.\n\nAmerican Cancer Society and other groups seek a statewide ban on e-cigarette use in indoor, public places. Smart move. Ex-smokers are already used to that; those who start with e-cigs can curb the habit before ‘graduating’ to smoking; plus, vape juice varies, so who knows what’s in that mist?\n\nIt’s up to Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano whether to support or veto landmark status for a mansion slated to be a mosque. The City Council approved a community group’s landmark application, which could restrict exterior changes to the building. Spano better explain his decision well, as some believe that the goal here is simply to derail a mosque.\n\nThe League of Women Voters of White Plains has elected a president named Stephen. Yes, Stephen Cohen, who did yeoman’s work for the League on voter registration, is their first male chief. We have to ask: Is this a case where choosing a white male is a progressive move?\n\nWeek of 5/16\n\nA bill that orders a statewide survey of railroad crossings heads to the governor. Other proposals: putting cameras at railroad crossings, adding points to a driver’s license for breaking traffic laws at crossings and mandating that traffic controls at crossings be inspected every other year. We need safe crossings, and safe drivers.\n\nDonald Trump’s declined to release income tax records. Our David McKay Wilson and USA TODAY provided a picture of Trump’s rocky payment record in New York: dozens of times, the state has sought liens to collect overdue bills. No one likes taxes, but most still pay them. On time.\n\nLauren’s Law, named for a Stony Point teen, encourages organ donation by requiring those filling out a drivers license application to indicate whether or not they want to be added to the state’s “Donate Life” registry.

Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday signed into law the $1.3 billion construction plan to build two 4,000-bed prisons and a new prison for women and to renovate other facilities. The plan taps $400 million from the American Rescue Plan – money the state has already received – and could steer the construction contracts toward companies that previously qualified for the work. Those include Birmingham-based construction giant BL Harbert International and Montgomery-based Caddell Construction. Caddell and BL Harbert are expected to be the main contractors for the two prisons, Republican state Sen. Greg Albritton said. Lawmakers said working with those companies will allow the state to incorporate prior work. “This is going to enable us to start these projects 12 months in advance, and time is money,” said the bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Steve Clouse. Officials will have the money to start construction after lawmakers approved $400 million in coronavirus funds and another $150 million from the state’s general fund, in addition to agreeing to borrow $785 million through a bond issue.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A Canadian mining company has been looking for precious metals on Chichagof Island in southeast Alaska. Millrock Resources, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based company, several years ago applied to the U.S. Forest Service for drilling permits to renew exploration on claims that once made up the historic Apex and El Nido gold mines. However, the exploration never happened. CEO Gregory Beischer said the company wasn’t able to secure financing. The mines produced precious metals in the early 20th century. Some exploration resumed in the 1980s. “But it really has been dormant since the mining activity took place in the ’20s and ’30s,” Beischer told CoastAlaska. Millrock has formed a partnership with another company, which has allowed it to take soil samples on claims less than 3 miles from Pelican, a community with fewer than 100 year-round residents. The operator of Kensington Mine north of Juneau, which is a subsidiary of Coeur Mining, invested about $200,000 for a small team of geologists based in Pelican. Beischer said soil sample results are pending. But he said geologists hope they will show that gold-bearing quartz veins continue down the mountain. Taking soil samples doesn’t require permits, according to state and federal regulators.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema said Monday that activists who confronted her outside an Arizona State University classroom and filmed her inside a restroom were not engaging in “legitimate protest.” The Democratic senator said the immigration reform activists unlawfully entered the suburban Phoenix campus building, which was only open to ASU students and faculty, and recorded her and her students. Sinema, a former social worker, is a lecturer at ASU’s School of Social Work. “In the 19 years I have been teaching at ASU, I have been committed to creating a safe and intellectually challenging environment for my students,” Sinema said. “Yesterday, that environment was breached. My students were unfairly and unlawfully victimized.” Living United for Change in Arizona posted video of the Sunday encounter on social media. The video showed LUCHA members chastising Sinema on accusations that she did not adequately support expectations of a pathway to citizenship for people in the country illegally and has not been supportive enough of President Joe Biden’s $3.5 trillion infrastructure proposal. LUCHA said its members were forced to confront Sinema at ASU because she has been inaccessible. Sinema said in her statement she has met with the group multiple times since she was elected to the Senate.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Senate has advanced a measure that would require an exemption process for workers who face a COVID-19 vaccine mandate from their employers. The vote Monday came during a special session that was called to redraw the state’s congressional maps. The measure from Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, says any employer that mandates the vaccines must also offer an exemption process that includes coronavirus testing or proof of antibodies. If enacted, the requirement would end July 31, 2023, unless extended by lawmakers. Republican lawmakers have filed numerous bills targeting vaccine mandates for the special session, which began last week. The proposals are primarily in response to President Joe Biden’s order requiring workers at businesses with at least 100 employees to get vaccinated or tested regularly. The discussion about vaccine requirements comes as coronavirus cases continue to decrease from their summer peaks in Arkansas. According to Johns Hopkins University, the state had 529.7 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, which ranks Arkansas 28th in the country for new cases per capita.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Weeks before a leak from an oil pipeline fouled beaches to the south in Orange County, Los Angeles County supervisors voted unanimously to phase out oil and gas drilling and ban new drill sites in the unincorporated areas of the nation’s most populous county. Over 1,600 active and idle oil and gas wells could be shuttered after last month’s 5-0 vote by the board of supervisors. Among the sites is the Inglewood Oil Field, one of the largest U.S. urban oil fields. The sprawling, 1,000-acre site, owned and operated by Sentinel Peak Resources, contains over half the oil and gas wells in the county’s unincorporated areas. The field produced 2.5 million to 3.1 million barrels of oil a year over the past decade, according to the company. “The goal is to provide direction to county departments to begin addressing the variety of issues, environmental and climate impacts created by these active and inactive oil and gas wells,” said Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell, who represents the district where most of the Inglewood Oil Field is located. The California Independent Petroleum Association, representing nearly 400 oil and gas industry entities, opposed the measure.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Three Front Range ski areas vying for the annual distinction of being the first to open for the season could begin snowmaking operations very soon. They just need Mother Nature to cooperate. In 15 of the past 20 years, at least one of those areas – Arapahoe Basin, Loveland and Keystone – has opened during the second or third week of October, usually relying heavily on manmade snow, The Denver Post reports. But October this year is likely to have above-average temperatures with average or slightly below-average precipitation, said Kari Bowen, a National Weather Service meteorologist. That doesn’t necessarily mean the resorts won’t be able to make snow, but a cold October doesn’t appear to be in the forecast. Beyond that, the weather service’s Climate Prediction Center says there is a 60% chance of above-normal temperatures for the northern and central mountains over the next three months, with a 60% chance of below-normal precipitation. From the early 1980s through 2001, the rivalry to become the first Front Range ski area to open was between Keystone and Loveland. Then, in 2002, Arapahoe Basin installed snowmaking equipment, and the race became a duel between A-Basin and Loveland. In 2019, Keystone added 53 automated snow guns with 11,000 feet of pipe and 15 miles of electrical cable.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s attorney general is asking leadership of TikTok, a video-sharing service, to come to Connecticut and meet with educators and parents to discuss the “harmful impact” the popular app is having on the mental and physical safety of students and educators. Attorney General William Tong, who sent a letter Monday to TikTok’s CEO, said there’s concern that a current viral challenge known as “Slap a Teacher” could put educators at risk. His request comes after New Britain High School temporarily closed last month due to student misbehavior that was attributed in part to the viral “Devious Licks” TikTok challenge, which led to damage at schools across the U.S. Students took videos of themselves vandalizing school bathrooms and stealing soap dispensers, among other acts of destruction. “With new reports of the “Slap a Teacher” challenge, it is clear that TikTok is unable to control the spread of harmful content,” Tong wrote, noting that TikTok had identified and removed “Devious Licks” content from its platform. “Simply put, whatever TikTok has been doing to enforce its terms of service has not been working and merits serious review and reform.” A message was left seeking comment with a TikTok spokesperson.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: A school bus with students on board crashed into parked cars, went off the road and struck a pole Tuesday morning as it pulled into a school campus, but there were only minor injuries, police said. The crash happened just before 9 a.m. at the Newark Charter School campus on Patriot Way, Newark police said in a news release. Elementary and middle school students were on the bus at the time of the crash. When police officers arrived, a school nurse was treating some students who received minor injuries, but no students needed to be taken to a medical facility, police said. The school notified parents of the incident. The driver was not injured, police said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A plan to remove homeless encampments at two underpasses in the NoMa neighborhood near Union Station paused Monday after a bulldozer driver began clearing out a tent with an unhoused resident still inside, WUSA-TV reports. Witnesses described the moment as a chaotic scene, with advocates rushing to prevent the man from getting seriously hurt. Community advocates said he was taken to a hospital by ambulance for extra medical attention and was expected to be OK. “They had to cut a hole to make sure this person was OK, and they brought in the fire department, who actually got him out,” witness Andrew Anderson said. “They didn’t actually take any time to make sure anyone was in there; they just grabbed the tents and took them out.” Anderson is part of the nonprofit organization People for Fairness Coalition, which provides services to homeless encampments. He and other activists spent much of the day at the sites at the L and M Street underpasses – one of four areas on which the city is focusing as part of the new Coordinated Assistance and Resources for Encampments pilot program aimed at relocating more than 100 unhoused residents to apartments and connecting them to resources while closing down the homeless encampments for health and public safety reasons.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Florida first lady Casey DeSantis has breast cancer, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday. DeSantis, 41, is the mother of the couple’s three children, the youngest of whom was born after the governor took office in January 2019. “As she faces the most difficult test of her life, she will … not only have my unwavering support but the support of our entire family, as well as the prayers and well wishes from Floridians across our state. Casey is a true fighter, and she will never, never, never give up,” Ron DeSantis said in a statement. Casey DeSantis has played an active role in her husband’s Republican administration, advocating for people with mental health issues. She often appears with him, children in tow, at bill signings and other official events. Republican and Democratic leaders put partisanship aside during an outpouring of support for Mrs. DeSantis on social media. “As a #breastcancer survivor also diagnosed at 41 and a 14 year survivor, I’m wishing you the strength you need to fight and win this battle,” Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz wrote on Twitter. “The breast cancer survivor sisterhood knows no party. Please reach out if I can help in any way.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A new photo and video project celebrates Hispanic workers in the state who were required to keep going to their jobs during the pandemic, even when a lockdown let many other employees stay home. Photographers Hector Amador and Miguel Martinez document the experiences of these essential workers in the online exhibition “Our Essential Heroes,” the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The project, which includes interviews with a farm worker and janitor, is part of the Latino Community Fund Georgia’s Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations. “We realized a lot of people were sort of invisible when it comes to essential work,” Amador told the paper. “Miguel and I are both immigrants. We know what it’s like being trapped between two cultures. We know what it’s like being treated like a second-class citizen sometimes.” Maria Fajardo, a farmworker in Glennville who contracted the coronavirus, said in an interview featured in the project that work harvesting crops is not appreciated, and farmworkers are not valued. “We have to be here,” she said. “We could be sick, but we are still expected to keep working, harvesting the food so that people can eat.” To view the project, visit unidosgeorgia.com/heroes.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Tourism Authority plans to seek $64 million from the state’s capital improvements budget to fix a leaky rooftop deck at the Hawaii Convention Center. That’s more than double what the agency had last anticipated it would cost to complete the largest deferred maintenance project at the building, which opened in 1998, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. It’s a substantial reinvestment in a center that cost $200 million to construct. Julian Anderson, who presented recommendations to the Hawaii Tourism Authority board Thursday on behalf of Honolulu-based property manager Rider Levett Bucknall, said the deck was still structurally safe. However, he said, components of contractor Nordic/PCL’s design were guaranteed for only 15 to 20 years, so it’s well past time to address the leaky rooftop. “This is an issue that has existed since the building was designed. Repair is not an option; replacement is required,” he said. “If work is not done, the amount of damage will continue to increase, and more rentable space will be taken out of inventory.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A constant barrage of misinformation has health care workers facing increased animosity from some patients and community members, officials say. It’s gotten so bad in northern Idaho that some Kootenai Health employees are scared to go to the grocery store if they haven’t changed out of their scrubs, hospital spokeswoman Caiti Bobbitt said. Some doctors and nurses at the Coeur d’Alene hospital have been accused of killing patients by grieving family members who don’t believe COVID-19 is real, Bobbitt said. Others have been the subject of hurtful rumors spread by people angry about the pandemic. “Our health care workers are almost feeling like Vietnam veterans, scared to go into the community after a shift,” Bobbitt said. Similar instances are happening across the state, said Brian Whitlock, president of the Idaho Hospital Association. “We’ve had reports of physical violence, verbal abuse, demands for alternative treatment that are not acceptable or approved. And those become very difficult conversations to have as the patient continues to decompensate,” Whitlock said. “We’re not frustrated with the misinformed. We’re frustrated with those who propagate the misinformation because it’s costing people their lives.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A federal agency has recommended that Tootsie Roll Industries pay more than $136,000 in fines after a machine at its Chicago plant cut off part of an employee’s finger earlier this year. In a news release, the U.S. Department of Labor said its Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued one willful violation “for inadequate machine guarding” and proposed the fines after an investigation into the April 19 incident. According to the release, a 48-year-old employee had reached into a machine to remove stuck paper debris when a bag sealer snapped shut on one of his fingers. And the Labor Department said the incident happened after the company had allowed the machine’s access doors to remain unguarded. “Hundreds of workers are injured needlessly each year because employers ignore safety guards, often to speed up production, and that’s exactly what happened in this case,” OSHA Chicago South Area Director James Martineck said in the release. Calls to the company for comment were not immediately returned Tuesday. According to the Labor Department, the company has 15 business days to comply with the recommended fines, request an informal conference with OSHA’s area director, or contest the findings before the independent OSHA review commission.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor gave his approval Monday to the Republican redrawing of the state’s congressional and legislative districts that critics argued gives the party an excessive election advantage for the next decade. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s signature was the final step in the redistricting for Indiana’s nine congressional seats and 150 seats in the Legislature that were drawn by Republican leaders behind closed doors and adopted Friday in the Legislature without any support from Democrats. The maps faced intense criticism as diluting the influence of minority and urban voters in favor of white voters living in rural areas to bolster the election prospects for Republicans. That came after the 2020 census found that the state’s white and rural populations both shrank over the past 10 years. Holcomb said in a statement he believed that legislators completed the redistricting work in “an orderly and transparent way.” Political analysts say the new maps that will be used through the 2030 elections protect the Republican dominance that has boosted them to a 7-2 majority of Indiana’s U.S. House seats and commanding majorities in the Legislature. Opponents pointed to Donald Trump winning 57% of Indiana’s presidential vote last year as Republicans captured 71 of the 100 Indiana House and 39 of 50 state Senate seats.\n\nIowa\n\nDavenport: The city is making a million-dollar investment in a riverside park as part of an effort to get ready for an expected increase in cruise ship traffic. The Quad-City Times reports the city has repaired the seawall and is extending the river walk and promenade that runs the length of the riverfront at River Heritage Park. The promenade includes a decorative walkway, lighting and benches. The latest Mississippi River cruise schedule shows large passenger vessels from two cruise lines anchoring simultaneously next year along the seawall. Davenport was a stop this year for boats from American Cruise Lines, including classic paddlewheelers and modern riverboats. Passengers typically get off the boat at Davenport and board buses for tours of Quad City destinations. New riverboats from Viking Cruise Lines also will be anchoring next season in Davenport.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Some local governments are operating with 10% of their positions unfilled, making it hard to deliver the services that citizens expect. Across the state, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that Kansas has seen a 4.7% drop in the number of public-sector workers, which translates into about 12,000 vacant jobs, but some towns are being hit harder. The pandemic has compounded the situation because the competitive labor market has made it hard to replace older employees who decided to retire. And private companies, which are also struggling to hire, have more flexibility in pay and benefits than city governments generally do. In Concordia, city manager Amy Lange said the government is down to the bare minimum needed to perform city functions, but with six positions open – which accounts for 10% of its workforce – workers are stretched thin. The problems become more serious in the area’s pool of emergency medical technicians, where the pool of part-time EMS workers has dwindled. Elsewhere, Lawrence has over twice the normal number of vacant positions. In Winfield, the city had to overhaul its pay structure for utilities workers in an effort to avoid being short-staffed. And officials in Shawnee County and across Kansas have struggled to hire corrections and public safety workers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear recommended Monday that the state use $400 million in federal pandemic relief assistance to provide bonuses next year for beleaguered health care staff and other front-line workers who provided essential services during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Democratic governor said he intends to send a framework of the plan to the state’s Republican-dominated Legislature within the next 10 days. Lawmakers would make the final decision on appropriating the federal aid. Beshear’s recommendation comes as many Kentucky hospitals continue struggling with chronic staffing shortages to treat an influx of coronavirus patients – most of them unvaccinated against COVID-19. Some prominent Senate Republicans have urged the governor to call lawmakers into a special legislative session this year to direct immediate aid to hospitals to overcome staffing woes. The governor said Monday that the federal money won’t be available until next year, when lawmakers are back in regular session. Beshear also expanded the number of workers potentially eligible for bonuses, mentioning emergency responders, grocery store workers, educators and factory workers employed by companies deemed essential during the pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Sixteen of the 49 Louisiana hospitals that regularly deliver babies have met new standards aimed at improving the state’s poor performance involving deaths resulting from pregnancy. The Louisiana Department of Health said Monday that 11 hospitals in the state are “Birth Ready,” and five others met the higher designation of “Birth Ready+” under standards set by the Louisiana Perinatal Quality Collaborative, a network of public health experts, advocates, doctors and other care providers. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports the classifications grade hospitals on whether they meet certain benchmarks related to maternal blood loss, cesarean sections, staff education and other factors that contribute to improved outcomes during pregnancy. “These 16 hospitals went above and beyond,” said Dr. Veronica Gillispie-Bell, director of the collaborative. The effort seeks to make births safer using metrics to judge whether a hospital is doing everything possible to ensure births don’t end in death or serious complications. Louisiana’s rate of pregnancy-related deaths in 2018 was 25.2 deaths per 100,000 live births – compared to the national rate of 17.4.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The headlining event of next year’s Maine Science Festival will be a musical exploration of climate change. The organizers of the festival said they commissioned composer Lucas Richman to create a symphony about hope in the era of climate change in the Gulf of Maine, which is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. The organizers said the Bangor Symphony Orchestra will perform the premiere of the work, called “The Warming Sea,” at the Maine Science Festival on March 19. Festival organizers said Richman’s work was informed by discussions with scientists, researchers, experts and Maine middle school students. The performance will also include a women’s and children’s choir. It will take place at Collins Center for the Arts in Orono. The Maine Science Festival began in 2015 and hosts dozens of events during its five-day March festival.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Dundalk residents and some preservationist groups fear that a developer’s plans to build storage units on one of the last undeveloped pieces of battleground land from a key War of 1812 battle may destroy human remains that they believe are yet to be unearthed on the property. The proposed 13,600-square-foot building would be an extension of a Prime Storage facility in the Baltimore County community. The county approved the project as a limited exemption from standard development processes because it’s a minor commercial structure, so neither public notice nor hearings were required. The property is near the site of the former Patapsco Neck Methodist Meeting House, used as a field hospital during the Battle of North Point in September 1814. About 70 American and British soldiers were killed during the two-day battle, and, as the story goes, British bodies were buried in unmarked graves near the long-gone church that was used as a makeshift hospital. A 1990s archaeological survey found no evidence of remains on the property where the project is proposed. But community groups and state and federal agencies want to halt the development for a more thorough investigation they say would determine the truth.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBarnstable: A hydrologist who researched the levels of contamination in Cape Cod’s bodies of water found there were human-made chemicals in 21 ponds he tested. Tom Cambareri collected water samples from ponds around town, finding a group of chemicals known as PFAS polluting the town’s clean water supply. The chemicals have been linked to several health problems and often do not break down into the environment easily. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances are unregulated at the federal level, but Massachusetts is beginning to put safeguards on drinking water. Last year, the state enacted a safeguard that would allow 20 nanograms per liter for a group of six PFAS compounds in drinking water. The contamination of local water supplies can be traced to the Barnstable County Fire Rescue and Training Academy and the Cape Cod Gateway Airport. The two locations used PFAS-filled firefighting foam for decades. Even though in 2015 city water officials began cleaning up the pollution from the airport and training academy, Cambareri’s report found that the pollutants spread across the village through contaminated well water before that treatment began. Local officials said they can’t do anything further because there is no state or federal standard for exposure to PFAS in surface water bodies.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Aretha Franklin was given a bit of posthumous R-E-S-P-E-C-T on Monday when a post office was named after the late singer in her hometown. Members of Franklin’s family as well as postal and elected officials visited the former Fox Creek post office to celebrate the name change honoring the Queen of Soul. “Her legacy lives on in her music, in her family. But we have added to that list of her legacy a post office with her name on it,” said U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, a Michigan Democrat and longtime postal service worker. Lawrence also was a friend of Franklin and introduced the bill in Congress that resulted in the name change. That legislation, signed by President Donald Trump in January, sailed through Congress, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters said. “Sometimes people wonder if Congress can come together,” the Democratic senator said to laughter during the dedication ceremony Monday. “Congress can come together when it comes to standing up and recognizing this amazing person.” The post office is located about 5 miles east of downtown and not far from a concert amphitheater on the Detroit River that also is named for Franklin. It now will be known as the Aretha Franklin Post Office Building.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: An appeals court has ruled in favor of a retired botany and physics professor whose unmanicured yard was declared a public nuisance. Ed Borchardt wanted a natural yard, filled with native plants and flowers that would attract birds, bees, butterflies and other wildlife. The city of North Mankato disagreed with his vision and said the yard doesn’t meet the standards of a new local ordinance that encourages naturally managed lawns. The appeals court on Monday said a city cannot declare a nuisance “based on little more than neighbors’ displeasure with the property’s appearance.” The court said the city failed to produce enough evidence that Borchardt’s yard was a hazard to public health or safety, the Star Tribune reports. In recent years, health problems have prevented Borchardt from keeping up with the yardwork, and neighbors began to complain about an explosion of vegetation. City Administrator John Harrenstein said that despite the appeals ruling, the case is not closed. “The property in question still remains, in our opinion, a nuisance according to our existing code,” he said. The appeals court decision faulted the city for not offering enough evidence to back its contention that Borchardt’s yard is a nuisance, and Harrenstein said the city will be consulting with its lawyers on how to proceed.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The largest physician group in the state will pursue options to expand Medicaid despite opposition from two top political leaders. The Mississippi State Medical Association recently adopted a resolution to explore and pursue options including a Medicaid waiver program and or amending the state’s Medicaid plan to ensure more people have access to health care. “Mississippi has been saddled with a health care access issue long before the COVID-19 pandemic. The current landscape has demonstrated how urgent and critical the need to increase access to health care for Mississippians is,” MSMA President Dr. Geri Lee Weiland said. Mississippi is one of the dozen states that have not expanded Medicaid despite the federal government picking up 90% of the cost. The Mississippi Hospital Association also supports expanding Medicaid. Its president, Tim Moore, has said the state’s decision not to expand Medicaid has hit rural Mississippi particularly hard. He said six rural hospitals have closed their doors for good in recent years, and nearly half of all rural hospitals are now at risk of closure. Hospitals in the state spent over $600 million on uncompensated care in 2019, Moore said. Joint House and Senate Medicaid committees have four hearings scheduled this month on Medicaid at the state Capitol.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Former U.S. Rep. Todd Akin, a conservative Republican whose comment that women’s bodies have a way of avoiding pregnancies in cases of “legitimate rape” sunk his bid for the U.S. Senate and became a cautionary tale for other GOP candidates, has died. He was 74. Akin had cancer for several years, his son Perry said in a statement. He died late Sunday at his home in Wildwood, a St. Louis suburb. “As my father’s death approached, we had people from all different walks of life share story after story of the personal impact he had on them,” Perry Akin said in a statement. “He was a devout Christian, a great father, and a friend to many.” Akin represented a Republican-leaning eastern Missouri district that included St. Louis-area suburbs for 12 years, giving up a safe seat to run for the U.S. Senate in 2012. He emerged from a crowded GOP primary to challenge then-incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, only to seriously hurt Republicans’ chances of recapturing a Senate majority less than two weeks later. Akin, a strong abortion opponent, was asked during an interview by a St. Louis television station whether he supported allowing abortions for women who have been raped. He answered that “from what I understand from doctors,” such pregnancies are “really rare.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A plan designed to test whether boosting water releases from Fort Peck Dam in the spring could help endangered pallid sturgeon successfully spawn has been approved. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released its environmental impact statement Sept. 24 outlining its proposed path forward as well as the predicted economic impacts. Under its chosen alternative, when reservoir water levels allow, the Corps would request that Fort Peck Dam begin increasing releases in April to see if mimicking spring runoff will attract pallid sturgeon into the Missouri River. The concept is not a new one, U.S. Geological Survey research fish biologist Pat Braaten noted. In the early 2000s, fisheries and biologists worked on test flows from Fort Peck to gather data, but the push evaporated around 2007 when water levels dropped due to drier weather. Mother Nature eventually provided proof of concept in the high-water years of 2011 and 2018, Braaten said, as pallid sturgeon females moved up the river below the dam. Without managed flows like the Corps’ proposed tests, such opportunistic runoff scenarios provide the best chance for the fish to successfully spawn in the wild, he said. Under the Corps proposal, the tests would fluctuate dam releases between April and July.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two women sued the state’s public health agency Monday after it denied their request to list both their names as parents on their children’s birth certificates. Erin Porterfield and Kristin Williams, of Omaha, allege in their lawsuit that state officials treat unmarried, same-sex couples differently from unmarried, opposite-sex couples, in violation of their due process and equal protection rights. The women argue listing them both is critical because it could affect their children’s eligibility for government benefits, should something happen to one of them. They also accuse the state of sexual discrimination because it allows men to voluntarily acknowledge they are parents to get onto a birth certificate but doesn’t allow women to do so. “Our sons are our entire world, and we want to make sure we’re doing right by them,” Porterfield said. “Our boys have a right to the security of having both parents on their birth certificates, a required document in so many life changes and decisions.” Porterfield and Williams began a romantic relationship in 2000 and used an anonymous sperm donor to have two children, according to the lawsuit. Porterfield gave birth to their first son in 2002 and Williams to their second in 2005. They ended their romantic involvement in 2013 but continued to share parenting duties.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: State health officials as of Monday are counting results from rapid antigen tests in the coronavirus data they present to the public and use to determine whether the pandemic is prevalent enough to trigger mask and capacity mandates. The state updated its health response dashboard, adding more than 600,000 tests to its count. The dashboard started displaying “cumulative tests” on its testing page and dividing the new infections into “confirmed cases” and “probable cases” on its page that reports total cases. Unlike the traditional molecular tests that are considered more accurate, antigen tests detect viral proteins rather than the coronavirus itself. They can return results in about 15 minutes instead of days. Rapid tests have become increasingly common throughout the nation, particularly in high-risk settings like nursing homes, schools and prisons. Nevada’s updated tally counts molecular tests as confirmed cases and rapid tests reported to the state as probable cases. State health officials said the fact that the tests are now being used more commonly prompted them to change their data reporting practices. As of February, CNN reported five states including Nevada only reported publicly reported confirmed cases from molecular tests, contrary to guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. All but Maryland now report both.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu is calling for the removal of a state representative, a fellow Republican, from his position as head of the legislative fiscal committee, saying the lawmaker is continuing to spread COVID-19 misinformation. Last month, Rep. Ken Weyler, of Kingston, told state Health Commissioner Lori Shibinette at a committee hearing that he doubted the state’s figures showing 90% people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are unvaccinated. Shibinette said his assessment was incorrect and was misinformation. On Monday, Democratic committee member Rep. Mary Jane Wallner released a statement saying Weyler sent the entire committee an email containing a 52-page “report” with disinformation on COVID-19, including claims that live creatures with tentacles are entering people’s bodies through the vaccine and that technology was placed in the vaccine to control people’s thoughts. Sununu said in a statement Monday that he has “repeatedly expressed” to House Speaker Sherman Packard the need to remove Weyler from his leadership position, calling the latest emails “absurd” and saying they have “accelerated the urgency that the Speaker needs to take action.” Sununu added: “Disseminating this misinformation clearly shows a detachment from reality and lack of judgment.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state eliminated a carve-out Tuesday in its law against discrimination that permitted employers not to hire or promote workers who are 70 or older. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the legislation into law, saying that “discrimination of any kind has no place in New Jersey.” New Jersey’s law bars discrimination or harassment based on disability, gender, national origin, race, religion or age. But the law contained provisions that said the law shouldn’t be construed to block employers “from refusing to accept for employment or to promote any person over 70 years of age.” The new law eliminates that provision and also does away with a section that permitted colleges and universities to require retirement at age 70. “Seventy is the new 50, and older individuals are continuing to work either due to financial need or because they still have the energy, skills, and experience,” Democratic Sen. Shirley Turner said in a statement. One of the bill’s sponsors said the measure was necessary to update the state’s anti-discrimination statutes. “As in many places around the country, New Jersey’s workforce is aging, and we need to be proactive in protecting those older workers against age discrimination,” Senate Democratic Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg said in a statement. The bill had passed without any opposition.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Democratic governor is seeking legislation to help jump-start hydrogen production from natural gas in her state – a process that generates harmful greenhouse gases but could one day be harnessed to provide environmental benefits. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham outlined the effort briefly at a convention of oil executives Monday in a speech that acknowledged New Mexico’s reliance on industry tax revenue while pledging to enforce pro-environment regulations. It’s the latest tightrope walk for the governor who has promised action on climate change while also working to shield the state’s oil and gas producers from a federal drilling moratorium on public lands issued by fellow Democrat President Joe Biden. After waiting for the executives to put on their masks, citing her emergency regulations in response to the coronavirus, Lujan Grisham launched into a 20-minute speech thanking oil and gas producers for their contributions to the economy and tax revenues that form the backbone of state education funding. She pledged to kick-start the hydrogen fuel industry in New Mexico with legislation in February. The bill could include taxes and incentives to produce hydrogen, legal frameworks to facilitate production and storage, refueling corridors for truck traffic and training programs for workers in the industry.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s public libraries will no longer charge late fees and will waive existing fines for overdue books and other materials, officials announced Tuesday. Late fees had already been suspended since March 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic and will now be permanently eliminated, elected officials and leaders of the city’s three library systems said in a news release. “This announcement is another major step towards making our public libraries, the heart of so many communities, accessible to all,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “Eliminating fines will let us serve even more New Yorkers, allowing them to enjoy all of the resources and programs that public libraries offer to grow and succeed.” In 2019, the city’s libraries collected about $3.2 million in late fees. No late fees were collected in 2020 because of the pandemic, and libraries made up the lost revenue in other fines. New Yorkers will still need to pay replacement fees if they lose books or other materials, the library officials said. A book is considered lost after it is overdue for a month, though if it is returned, there will no longer be a fee. The new policy covers the New York Public Library, with branches in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, as well as the Brooklyn Public Library and the Queens Public Library.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Janice Covington Allison, a transgender woman who became a strong Democratic activist on behalf of LGBT rights, has died at age 74. Allison died Friday at Atrium Health Mercy hospital in Charlotte, according to a friend, September McCrady. McCrady, who had been in contact with Allison’s wife, said Monday that her health had declined with kidney troubles. Allison became the first transgender woman to represent North Carolina at the Democratic National Convention when she was elected a delegate to the 2012 convention in Charlotte, The Charlotte Observer reports. Allison also ran unsuccessfully for North Carolina Democratic Party chair in 2015 and was the party’s diversity and outreach chair. A Delaware native, Allison served in the military and moved to the Charlotte area in the 1970s. Dressed as a man, she was a volunteer fire chief in Cabarrus County. “I was living two lives, yelling at men to get on a ladder and put out a fire by day and going to clubs at night as Janice … wearing a miniskirt and heels,” Allison told the Observer. In a statement over the weekend, North Carolina Democratic Party leaders called Allison “a fearless LGBTQ+ advocate and champion for the transgender community.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Passenger traffic at the state’s eight commercial airports declined in August after a more robust July. “July is historically one of our busiest months out of the year for air travel, and so it can be expected to see lower passenger numbers heading into the fall as leisure travel begins to slow down,” said Kyle Wanner, the executive director of the North Dakota Aeronautics Commission. A total of 82,371 passengers boarded planes in August, nearly double the same month last year but well below the 101,784 boardings in August 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The airports in Bismarck, Minot, Williston, Dickinson, Grand Forks, Fargo, Devils Lake and Jamestown all saw an increase in passengers this August from the previous year. Bismarck’s 19,272 boardings were 77% higher than the same month last year yet 26% down from pre-pandemic August 2019. “Our communities are doing an incredible job in maintaining a high level of air service, and we hope to see passenger demand maintain at current levels and then grow, once the holiday season arrives,” Wanner said. Year-to-date boardings are ahead of the 2020 pace at all eight airports. Statewide, they’re up more than 41%. But they’re down 30% from 2019.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The police officer who shot and killed Andre Hill will stand trial next spring, a judge decided Monday. Hill, 47, who was Black, was fatally shot by Officer Adam Coy, who is white, on Dec. 22 as Hill emerged from a garage holding up a cellphone. Coy has since been fired from the Columbus police department. Coy, 44, has pleaded not guilty to murder and reckless homicide. Franklin County Judge Stephen McIntosh set Coy’s trial for March 7. In August, McIntosh denied a request by Coy’s attorneys to move the trial out of concern that extensive local and national publicity – including news coverage, posts on social media and billboards around Columbus – would make it impossible to assemble an impartial jury for Coy in Franklin County. McIntosh sided with prosecutors, who argued there was no reason to believe that people elsewhere were less likely to have read about the case than were Franklin County residents. In May, the city reached a $10 million settlement, the largest in Columbus history, with Hill’s family.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: COVID-19 vaccinations have helped reduce infections by 7,500 and deaths by 1,100 among Oklahomans ages 65 and older, according to a study released Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The study of Medicare recipients found that as vaccinations increased from January, when the vaccines became more widely available, through May, each 10% increase in vaccination rates resulted in an 11%-12% decline in weekly COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among Medicare beneficiaries. In its weekly report Sept. 29, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said 91.1% of Oklahomans 65 or older had received at least one vaccination, and 79.8% were fully vaccinated. The three-day average of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 on Tuesday stood at 825, the health department reported. The average fell below 1,000 daily on Monday for the first time since mid-August. In other developments, the Yukon School District announced Monday that it will provide its full-time employees with $1,000 stipends from funds it received from a federal coronavirus relief package. The district’s board voted for the stipends Monday night and for prorated stipends for part-time employees.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The summer of 2021 was the hottest on record both in the capital city and statewide. The average temperature in Salem for June, July and August was a record-breaking 71.7 degrees, the warmest since records began in 1892, according to the National Weather Service in Portland. That broke the previous record average of 71.3 degrees, set in 2015. The record heat this summer had severe consequences for Oregonians. More than 100 people died due to the temperature in the June heat wave. Large portions of the state spent the summer in various phases of drought. These conditions threatened water resources and made the state more susceptible to wildfire, which has burned about 800,000 acres this year so far. Larry O’Neill, the state climatologist, confirmed that Oregon’s average temperature of 67.7 degrees was the highest in NOAA’s records dating back to 1895. Summer 2015, which previously held the record, was a degree cooler than 2021. The state’s average for the 1900s is more than 5.5 degrees cooler than this year’s, O’Neill said. He pointed to prolonged periods of higher-than-normal temperatures as being among the biggest factors in this summer’s record-breaking heat.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The corporate developer of a multibillion-dollar pipeline system that takes natural gas liquids from the Marcellus Shale gas field to an export terminal near Philadelphia was charged criminally Tuesday after a grand jury concluded that it flouted Pennsylvania environmental laws and fouled waterways and residential water supplies across hundreds of miles. Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced the sprawling case at a news conference at Marsh Creek State Park in Downingtown, where Sunoco Pipeline LP spilled thousands of gallons of drilling fluid last year. The spill, during construction of the troubled Mariner East 2 pipeline, contaminated wetlands, a stream and part of a 535-acre lake. Energy Transfer, Sunoco’s owner, faces 48 criminal charges, most of them for illegally releasing industrial waste at 22 sites in 11 counties across the state. A felony count accuses the operator of willfully failing to report spills to state environmental regulators. Shapiro said Energy Transfer ruined the drinking water of at least 150 families statewide and released a grand jury report that includes testimony from numerous residents who accused Energy Transfer of denying responsibility for the contamination and then refusing to help.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Two men who authorities say touched off a needless and expensive ocean search and rescue effort when they fired maritime distress flares to celebrate a friend’s wedding have agreed to pay $5,000 each to settle the case, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. The Coast Guard and the town of New Shoreham spent more than $100,000 combined responding to the flares off the coast of Block Island on June 6, 2020, when there was no one in distress, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney’s office in Providence. Perry Phillips, 31, and Benjamin Foster, 33, “knowingly and willfully communicated a false distress message to the Coast Guard,” according to the civil complaint, and “caused the Coast Guard to attempt to save lives and property when no help was needed.” The men borrowed a flare gun and flares, set out on the water in a small skiff, and, when they thought they could by seen by people at their friend’s wedding reception, fired three flares, prosecutors said. They recorded their actions to post on social media, prosecutors said. People who saw the flares reported them to the New Shoreham harbormaster, who in turn alerted the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard deployed a boat and two helicopters for the search.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants lawmakers to set aside $300 million in federal COVID-19 relief and surplus money to pay for the first segment of a long-desired interstate link between Interstate 95 and Myrtle Beach. The full 60 miles of new freeways and upgrades would cost $1.6 billion, and McMaster and other leaders hope by building the first segment, the rest of the road will follow. “It may be the most significant step we can take toward making I-73 a reality,” McMaster said during a news conference Monday. The Republican governor wants to spend $100 million in coronavirus relief funds and $200 million left over from last year’s state budget that lawmakers set aside in case the economy tanked because of the pandemic. The first segment of I-73 would run from I-95 in Dillon County south of Latta to U.S. Highway 501. The project has permits and has been successfully defended in court. Work could begin as soon as the money is in place, officials said. I-73 has been a dream of tourism boosters and highway builders, as those coming to Myrtle Beach run into stoplights and a few small towns where the speed limit drops, and police officers with radar may await. Environmentalists have opposed the road as unneeded and say it would destroy wetlands and farms.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A growing grass fire north of the city prompted officials to warn residents they may need to evacuate. Abnormally high temperatures, gusty winds and extremely dry conditions fueled a fire that began Monday afternoon. By Monday evening, the fire torched between 250 and 300 acres and burned uncontained, according to authorities. Rapid City police helped evacuate the Marvel Mountain neighborhood earlier Monday and helped divert traffic around road closures. An unknown number of residents were evacuated. It’s not known what ignited the fire, and no structures had been damaged as of Tuesday morning. Early Monday evening, the fire crossed into Meade County, prompting officials there to warn residents that additional evacuations may be needed. “Any residents who live north of the Pennington County line, west of Erickson Ranch Road, and south of Elk Creek Road are encouraged to be ready to evacuate if an order is given,” Meade County Emergency Management said in an alert sent Monday evening. Single-engine air tankers were dropping fire retardant on the north and west flanks of the fire. Additional air support was being summoned, officials said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: It’s out with the old and in with blue for the state’s new license plate, moving away from its green mountain design to a new dark blue plate with white text and Tennessee’s three-star emblem displayed in the center. State law requires the reissuing of a new license design at least every eight years, but the green one first introduced by former Gov. Phil Bredesen in 2006 has been essentially unchanged over the past 15 years. In September, Gov. Bill Lee’s office asked the public to vote on four new designs in a contest to determine the new plate. His administration said the winning license design received 42% of the 300,000 total votes cast. A picture of the new plate provided by Lee’s office in a press release Tuesday contains the phrase “In God We Trust,” but Tennesseans can choose a plate with or without that language. The new tag will also display the words “Tennessee” and “Volunteer State,” as well as the website “TNvacation.com,” as required by law. New plates will be available online and in person beginning Jan. 3, 2022.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A state agency on Monday approved a request that George Floyd be granted a posthumous pardon for a 2004 drug arrest made by a now-indicted ex-Houston police officer whose case history is under scrutiny following a deadly drug raid. The unanimous recommendation by the seven-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles will now be forwarded to Gov. Greg Abbott, who will make the final decision. Allison Mathis, an attorney with the Harris County Public Defender’s Office who submitted the pardon request in April, said she was pleased by the board’s decision. “A man was set up by a corrupt police officer intent on securing arrests rather than pursuing justice. No matter what your political affiliation is, no matter who that man was in his life or in his death, that is not something we should stand for in the United States or in Texas,” Mathis said. The board’s recommendation was first made public on Monday by a reporter with The Marshall Project. The May 2020 killing of Floyd, who was Black, by a white Minneapolis police officer prompted worldwide protests against racial injustice. Floyd, who grew up in Houston, was arrested in February 2004 by Officer Gerald Goines and accused of selling $10 worth of crack in a police sting. Floyd later pleaded guilty to a drug charge and was sentenced to 10 months in a state jail.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin launched a campaign Tuesday to challenge Republican Sen. Mike Lee in the conservative state where McMullin made inroads with voters uncomfortable with then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016. McMullin, a former CIA agent and congressional aide to Republicans, settled in Utah after capturing more than 20% of the state’s presidential vote in 2016. In a tweet announcing his campaign Tuesday, he said that “extremism, division and conspiracy now threaten our quality of life and democratic republic.” The brand of conservatism popular in Utah, by contrast, tends to seek more of a middle ground and values politeness – qualities that initially made many voters uncomfortable with Trump, especially in his first campaign. “I’m not running as a Republican or a Democrat,” McMullin said in a statement. “I’m running as a patriot, as an American committed to defending our nation and changing our politics for the better.” The 2022 Senate race promises to test whether lingering discomfort with Trump-style Republican politics remains a political force in Utah. Lee, a two-term incumbent who first won office during the tea party movement, was skeptical of Trump at first but later became a staunch ally of the president.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state will be represented in a series of new $1 coins issued by the U.S. Mint with an image of a snowboarder. The “American Innovation” series of dollar coins started in 2018 and will eventually include one for each state, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. Vermont’s coin, to be released in 2022, shows a snowboarder holding the edge of her board while doing a trick. While snowboarding was not created in Vermont, many advances in the sport come from the state. Burton Snowboards, started in Londonderry and now headquartered in Burlington, improved foot bindings, and its founder, Jake Burton Carpenter, campaigned to allow access for snowboarders to local ski resorts, WPTZ-TV reports. “In many ways, Vermont is the birthplace of modern snowboarding, and this coin represents Vermont’s contributions to the sport,” Gov. Phil Scott said. The U.S. Mint says it works with the governor or chief executive of each state or territory to choose possible design concepts, which are then developed and vetted. Other states’ designs include a telephone for Massachusetts, the educator and civil rights activist Septima Poinsette Clark for South Carolina, and the first home video game console for New Hampshire.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Much of the hotel industry in the Hampton Roads region has recovered faster from the COVID-19 pandemic than almost any other market in the United States, according to an economic report released Tuesday. The State of the Region, an annual analysis by economists at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, reports that the region’s hotel revenue was 10% higher this June than it was in June 2019, before the pandemic began. Nationally, hotel revenue was down by 12%. One reason for the quick recovery is that Hampton Roads’ hotel industry relies more on people taking vacations than it does on people attending large events, such as conventions, conferences and concerts. ODU economists also told The Virginian-Pilot last year that visitors typically arrive by car instead of flying, a method of travel that fell out of favor for many during the pandemic. Virginia Beach is typically a 3 1/ 2 -hour drive from Washington, five hours from Philadelphia and about seven hours from New York. There is one exception, however. The Williamsburg hotel market has not done as well, according to the report. The COVID-19 pandemic had temporarily shut down attractions like Busch Gardens and Water Country USA. And Colonial Williamsburg was already experiencing a downturn in visits prior to the pandemic.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A female Sumatran tiger from Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium has died after another tiger attacked her during a breeding introduction, officials said. Six-year-old Kirana, who was born at the zoo, died Monday, The News Tribune reports. Dr. Karen Wolf, the zoo’s head veterinarian, said in a news release that a necropsy completed Monday confirmed Kirana died from substantial trauma from injuries and a bacterial infection. Zoo staff had slowly introduced Kirana and Raja, the zoo’s 2-year-old male Sumatran tiger, as part of a plan to help save the endangered species. The two were closely monitored and separated by a mesh door, staff said. When zookeepers removed the barrier to allow the tigers to meet physically Friday, Kirana was attacked, and staff moved quickly to separate them, officials said. “We’re devastated by the loss of a very special tiger and by the loss to the tiger population as a whole,” said zoo general curator Dr. Karen Goodrowe, who is also coordinator of Species Survival Plan programs for Sumatran, Malayan and Amur tigers. She said some aggression is natural in tiger breeding, but this level was far beyond expectations. There are only about 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Fewer than 80 live in North American zoos.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMonongah: Amid shortages of emergency medical technicians at a time the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed many medical systems to the brink, a state program is training workers to fill the critical need. West Virginia Public Service Training trains more than 45,000 first responders every year, with trainers traveling all around the state to run affordable classes that help residents earn certifications in specific fields, the Times West Virginian reports. Recently, Monongah Volunteer Fire Department was filled with about 12 prospective EMTs, ready to take part in the state’s 155-hour program to put participants on track to get certified. The EMT courses are some of the most rigorous in Public Service Training’s repertoire, requiring a commitment of about 155 hours of class instruction, though the hours can vary depending on how ride-alongs go, according to instructor Brian Potter. Once participants finish the classes, they’re able to take the national registry exam for the position and can become nationally registered EMTs before applying for the state certification. “This is a job that’s always in need,” instructor Randy Corbin said. “A lot of (EMTs) move on to become paramedics, doctors and nurses and move on somewhere else in the medical field, and COVID has hurt our numbers.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A report published by the Wisconsin Policy Forum shows the state’s bars and restaurants are recovering but have not reached pre-pandemic levels. It’s not due to a lack of customers or jobs, according to the report, but because restaurant and bar owners can’t find enough willing workers. “We have seen customers coming back, and we’ve seen a lot of our long-time regulars coming back. The biggest problem that we’re having is staffing and having enough staff to handle the demand,” said Chris Wiken, owner of The Packing House in Milwaukee. On a busy night, Wiken has to let tables sit empty, simply because he doesn’t have the staff to serve them. Food service has been one of the hardest-hit industries from COVID-19, with employment at bars and restaurants plummeting by nearly 50% in April 2020. According to last week’s report, employment was still down 8.8% in August compared to pre-pandemic levels in August 2019. “Overall, what we’re seeing is the restaurant and bar industry in Wisconsin has recovered quite a bit but that its recovery is not quite as strong as the economy overall,” said Joe Peterangelo, a senior researcher at the Wisconsin Policy Forum and author of the report. Still, July sales tax revenues in the industry were actually up 6.8% compared to July 2019, according to the report.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A woman suffered burns from her shoulders to her feet when she tried to rescue her dog from a Yellowstone hot spring. Park rangers and firefighters cared for the 20-year-old woman from Washington state before she was taken to the burn unit at Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls, park officials said in a statement Tuesday. The woman’s name, the intensity of her burns and her condition weren’t released after she was burned Monday afternoon in the Madison Junction area. The woman and her father had stopped to look around when their dog jumped out of their car and into Maiden’s Grave Spring near the Firehole River. After the woman tried rescuing the dog, her father pulled her out of the spring and drove her to West Yellowstone, Montana. Somebody else rescued the dog, and the father said he planned to take it to a veterinarian, park officials said. The woman was the second burned in a Yellowstone thermal feature in recent weeks. A park concessions employee suffered second- and third-degree burns to 5% of her body near Old Faithful Geyser in September, park officials said. Yellowstone has more than 10,000 thermal features, which can be as hot as 280 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/28/prairie-power-beer-pig-bystander-honor-news-around-states/50782545/", "title": "Prairie power, beer pig: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A coastal environmental group filed suit Monday trying to block a decision by Alabama Power Co. to leave millions of tons of coal ash along a riverside in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, where opponents say a spill could devastate a huge ecosystem. The federal lawsuit by Mobile Baykeeper was filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center, which announced plans to sue the electrical utility in July. The group wants to force Alabama Power to give up what it contends is an illegal plan to permanently leave more than 21 million tons of coal ash in an unlined pit at Plant Barry, located north of Mobile along the Mobile River. Environmentalists argue the ash pond is polluting groundwater and could destroy a verdant, biologically diverse region should it be breached by heavy flooding, a hurricane or some other disaster. “Plant Barry is the only coal ash lagoon of a major utility left in a low-lying coastal area of the Southeast that is not already cleaned up or on track to be recycled or removed to safe storage, away from waterways,” Barry Brock, director of the law center’s Alabama office, said in a statement. Alabama Power declined to comment on the lawsuit. Plant Barry opened in 1965 about 25 miles north of Mobile. The company contends moving the material farther away from the plant site would pose a hazard in itself.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A U.S. Coast Guard ship on routine patrol in the Bering Sea came across a guided missile cruiser from China, officials said Monday. But it turned out the cruiser wasn’t alone as it sailed about 86 miles north of Alaska’s Kiska Island on Sept. 19. The patrol boat, known as a cutter called Kimball, later discovered there were two other Chinese naval ships and four Russian naval vessels, including a destroyer, all in single formation. The Honolulu-based Kimball, a 418-foot vessel, observed as the ships broke formation and dispersed. A C-130 Hercules provided air support for the Kimball from the Coast Guard station in Kodiak. “While the formation has operated in accordance with international rules and norms, we will meet presence with presence to ensure there are no disruptions to U.S. interests in the maritime environment around Alaska,” Rear Adm. Nathan Moore, Seventeenth Coast Guard District commander said. The Coast Guard said Operation Frontier Sentinel guidelines call for meeting “presence with presence” when strategic competitors operate in and around U.S. waters. The Kimball will continue to monitor the area. The Chinese and Russian formation came a month after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned about China’s interest in the Arctic and Russia’s military buildup there.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A massive expansion of the state’s private school voucher system will likely go into effect after public school advocates failed to gather enough signatures to block the law, a conservative think tank that supports the expansion said Monday. The Goldwater Institute, a conservative and libertarian public policy think tank in Phoenix, said Save Our Schools Arizona “submitted just 88,866 signatures, according to petition sheets made available by the Secretary of State’s office.” That’s “significantly short of the requisite 118,843 signatures needed to overturn the reform via ballot referendum.” Although Save Our Schools Arizona said it “will await accurate numbers” from the Secretary of State’s office regarding its challenge to the law, the head of the grassroots group acknowledged it’s probably well below the threshold. Monday’s developments appear to be a major victory for “school choice” advocates in Arizona and across the nation who argue that parents should be able to use public tax dollars to send their children to schools that best serve their needs. Voucher opponents say they drain money from long-underfunded public schools that serve the vast majority of children, sending public money to unaccountable private and religious schools and mainly benefiting the wealthy.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Deer season for archery is underway in western Arkansas, though drought may have affected the population and growth of deer this summer. A healthy population of deer and bear has been noted by those in the field during the opening days since the season began Saturday. Lack of vegetation can affect growth of deer during a drought. Young bucks may have smaller antlers, wildlife experts say, should the drought persist. That has not been the case in Arkansas this year. But the deer harvest this year in western Arkansas should be strong because the drought did not start until mid- to late June, said Ralph Meeker, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission’s statewide deer program coordinator. The does were able to produce enough milk for fawns that can adapt. The number of deer harvested could increase because visibility increases for hunters when drought causes foliage to die off, taking away the cover for the deer. But the deer so far are healthy, Meeker said. Antler growth has not been affected, he has observed. “Whitetail deer are a very adaptable species,” Meeker said. “We had a good growing season before the drought started in mid to late June. Fawn production was phenomenal.” The bear population – for which archery season is underway – has also reportedly increased this year in western Arkansas.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Beyond what they learn academically in kindergarten, students learn everyday routines: how to take care of class materials and how to be kind to their peers, according to Golden Empire Elementary School kindergarten teacher Carla Randazzo. And nearly two-thirds of students at the Sacramento school are English learners. “Those kids just start out having to climb uphill,” she said. “They need a lot of support to be successful.” Randazzo always thought it was “peculiar” that kindergarten is not mandatory in the state. For now, though, California won’t join 20 other states with mandatory kindergarten. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, vetoed legislation Sunday night that would have required children to attend kindergarten – whether through home-schooling or public or private school – before entering first grade at a public school. As he has with other recent legislative vetoes, Newsom cited the costs associated with providing mandatory kindergarten, about $268 million annually, which he said was not accounted for in the California budget. Newsom had supported similar legislation in the past. Proponents of mandatory kindergarten say it could help close the academic opportunity gap for low-income students and students of color, as well as help children develop important social skills before the first grade. Kindergarten enrollment in California dropped nearly 12% in the 2020-21 academic year compared to the previous year, according to the state Department of Education.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A bystander who intervened during the rough arrest of an elderly woman with dementia has been recognized as the only one who “did the right thing.” Reidesel Mendoza had stopped his car to confront the police officers arresting 73-year-old Karen Garner on June 26, 2020, because “the way they were handling that situation was not the right way,” he said in an interview Sept. 17, after receiving a citizenship award for his actions that day. Garner was accused of leaving Walmart without paying for $13.88 worth of merchandise, but staff stopped her and retrieved the items before she left. Garner was walking home when Officer Austin Hopp stopped her, soon forcing Garner to the ground and trying to arrest her. Mendoza saw how Hopp and two other officers were treating Garner and decided he needed to intervene. “Do you have to use that much aggression?” Mendoza could be heard saying in Hopp’s body camera footage. Hopp told him: “Get out of here; this is not your business ... this is what happens when you fight the police.” Mendoza continued to speak up. The award was presented in part by the Community Trust Commission, formed by the Loveland City Council to aid in rebuilding trust with the community and its police department. Interim Loveland Police Chief Eric Stewart applauded Mendoza’s courage in stepping up that day and said the public plays a key role in successful policing. “We certainly didn’t do a great job that day,” Stewart said. “I’m sorry we let you down that day.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Ian Hockley testified Tuesday that he was ridiculed online as a “party boy” and an actor after posting a video of the memorial service for his 6-year-old son, who was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre. Hockley is the latest family member of the 26 victims of the shooting to testify at the defamation trial of Alex Jones, in which a jury is deciding how much the conspiracy theorist must pay for spreading the lie that the shooting was a hoax. Hockley, who lost his autistic son, Dylan, in the shooting, testified that he became the target of conspiracy theorists because he smiled during what he found as an uplifting memorial service. “That is what that video started to attract is people saying this must be fake,” he said. “ ‘He’s an actor. He’s smiling. Oh, you’re out of character’ – all of those things started to appear until we took our video down.” Earlier in the trial, other victims’ relatives gave often emotional testimony describing how they endured death threats, in-person harassment and abusive comments on social media by people calling the shooting a hoax. Some moved to avoid the abuse. The jury of six will determine how much in damages Jones and Infowars’ parent company, Free Speech Systems, should pay relatives of five children and three adults killed at the school for saying the shooting didn’t happen and inflicting emotional distress. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting also is a plaintiff.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A man was killed when he was pinned beneath a truck, police said. Officers were called to Beehler Court in the Wilmington area Sunday for a report of a person hit by a vehicle, New Castle County Police said in a news release. When officers arrived, they found a 46-year-old man pinned beneath a Ford F-350 pickup truck, police said. Officers and paramedics tried to resuscitate the man, but their efforts were unsuccessful, and police said he was pronounced dead on the scene. The initial investigation revealed that the man got out of the truck while it was still in gear, and he was hit by the truck, then became pinned beneath it, police said. His body was turned over to the Delaware Division of Forensic Sciences.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: First lady Jill Biden paid tribute Friday to Jacqueline Kennedy, a predecessor 60 years ago, for her pivotal role in preventing the teardown of historic buildings on iconic Lafayette Square near the White House. Biden helped the White House Historical Association, an organization that Kennedy helped spearhead, unveil a medallion of the former first lady, designed by American artist Chas Fagan, in front of the association’s office on the square. The wife of President John F. Kennedy is widely credited with ushering in an emphasis on historic preservation at the White House during her 1,036 days as first lady. Lafayette Square, just north of the White House, over the years has become a gathering place for protesters, from suffragists in the early 20th century to Vietnam demonstrators in the 1960s to Americans speaking out for policing reform in 2020. In quieter daily times, it is a city oasis for tourists and for office workers on lunch breaks. The bas relief of Kennedy sits in a new garden at the front of the association’s office, known as Decatur House. It includes one of her best-known quotations: “The White House belongs to the American people.” Jill Biden said Kennedy worked to save the park and surrounding historic townhouses “because we all deserve to experience our rich history, the full, complex and beautiful story of who we are.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Prosecutors in the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz began their rebuttal of the defense case Tuesday by showing the jury swastikas he drew on a gun magazine and his boots, his online racism and misogyny, and his online searches for child pornography. Prosecutors are trying to show that Cruz’s murder of 17 people at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School four years ago was driven by antisocial personality disorder – commonly known as being a sociopath – and not fetal alcohol spectrum disorder as the defense contends. Cruz, 24, pleaded guilty last October to the Feb. 14, 2018, murders – the trial is only to decide whether he is sentenced to death or life without the possibility of parole. Detective Nick Masters, an online investigator, then testified about racist and sexist searches and comments Cruz made starting about eight months before the shootings. Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer only allowed prosecutors to present a fraction of the searches and comments Cruz made, saying more would be excessively prejudicial. Jurors were told Cruz wrote that “the Nazi party will rise again.” He made searches and comments using a racial slur directed against Black people. He wrote that he punched his widowed mother and called her a slur used against women. He wrote that “women are less important than a dog.” He also made comments extolling animal abuse, saying he had killed 12 cats and writing: “I am glad when animals die. It makes me happy.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State regulators began hearings Tuesday on Georgia Power Co.’s request to raise rates by 12% over the next three years, setting up clashes over how much profit the utility should earn, how much solar panel owners should be paid and how rates should be structured. The five elected members of the Public Service Commission are scheduled to decide in December on the company’s request to collect a cumulative $2.8 billion more from its 2.3 million customers beginning in January. Changes are likely before any vote. The company says it needs more money to improve the grid, retire old coal plants, acquire electricity from new sources and upgrade customer-facing computer systems. A residential customer who uses 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month pays Georgia Power an average of $128 a month now, the company has said. Under the plan, that would rise by $14.32 a month in 2023, reaching a total of $16.29 more over the three-year period. That’s nearly $200 a year more by 2025. However, electricity bills are likely to go up even more. Commissioners have already approved plans for the company to increase rates by $3.78 a month when the first of two new nuclear units being built at Plant Vogtle starts generating electricity, likely early next year. A bigger increase could follow the second new reactor coming online, possibly in 2024.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man pleaded not guilty Monday to charges he kidnapped and sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl and forced her to smoke meth. Duncan Mahi, 52, also requested a trial by jury. Judge Wendy M. DeWeese maintained bail for Mahi at $2 million and set his trial date for Feb. 7. According to an indictment filed Wednesday, Duncan forced the girl to tie up her boyfriend at a Anaehoomalu Beach in Waikoloa, put a knife to her throat and kidnapped her. He’s charged with 11 counts, including kidnapping, terroristic threatening, robbery, sexual assault and methamphetamine trafficking. If found guilty, he could face life in prison without the possibility of parole because he was convicted twice for two separate 2018 cases of terroristic threatening. Police issued an Maile Amber Alert, similar to the Amber Alert for missing children in other states, shortly after the girl’s kidnapping on Sept. 16. Police said the girl managed to get free one day later after she convinced Mahi to take her to a restaurant in Hilo to get something to eat, and people recognized her from the alert.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Universities across the state are warning staffers not to refer students to abortion providers, and at least one public university is barring employees from telling students how to obtain emergency contraception or birth control as well. It’s the latest restriction in a state that already holds some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation. “This is going to have a very broad impact,” said Mike Satz, an attorney and former faculty member and interim dean at the University of Idaho’s College of Law. “It’s going to have a very strong chilling effect on free speech, and it’s going to scare people. I’m afraid it’s going to scare people from going to school here or sending their kids to school at Idaho institutions.” The prohibition against referring students to abortion providers or “promoting” abortion in any way comes from the “No Public Funds for Abortion Act,” passed by Idaho’s Republican-led Legislature in 2021. Boise State University, like the University of Idaho, told faculty members in a newsletter earlier this month that they could face felony charges for violating the law. Idaho State University did not respond to messages asking if it had issued similar guidance. The law also bars staffers and school-based health clinics from dispensing or telling students where to obtain emergency contraception, such as the Plan B pill, except for in cases of rape.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Tuesday that the state’s relatively low jobless rate will help him keep his promise to pay off coronavirus-era debt in the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund by year’s end. The Democrat announced he will transfer $450 million from the account set aside to pay jobless benefits toward the debt that ballooned to $4.5 billion during business closures forced by COVID-19. That decreases the remaining balance of the federal loan to $1.8 billion, which Pritzker pledged will be eliminated by the new year. Illinois joined dozens of other states in borrowing money to pay unemployment claims, which in Illinois surged in spring 2020 to levels not seen since 1982. “With the COVID-19 pandemic came a disaster of a different kind,” Pritzker said at a Chicago news conference. “All across the United States, to make sure eligible individuals could get access to unemployment benefits, extraordinary measures were taken by state unemployment trust funds because nearly none … were funded enough to cover that kind of an emergency.” The General Assembly, controlled by Democrats, and Pritzker agreed last spring to use $2.7 billion in federal pandemic relief funds to more than halve the debt. Republicans argued for paying the entire balance with federal money while it was available.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Satanic Temple is suing the state on claims a near-total abortion ban violates the rights of its Hoosier members who want abortions after their birth control failed. A lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana by the Massachusetts-based religious association says it brought the lawsuit on behalf of anonymous women from Indiana who say they became pregnant by accident despite using contraceptives. Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita are listed as defendants. The new law bans abortions except in cases of rape or incest up to 10 weeks post-fertilization, when pregnancy poses a risk to the life or long-term health of the mother, or in cases of fatal fetal anomalies. Enforcement of the law was put on hold last week by a Monroe County judge who found that it may violate the Indiana Constitution. Rokita has already appealed the judge’s decision. The Satanic Temple has more than 11,300 members in Indiana, according to its lawsuit. The group “venerates, but does not worship,” the allegorical Satan as featured in the 17th-century epic poem “Paradise Lost” by John Milton. Members follow a set of tenets including the belief that a person’s body is subject to their will and their will alone, the lawsuit says, and that beliefs should “conform to one’s best scientific understanding of the world.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Cattle producer Bryan Sievers thinks the black-eyed Susans, purple coneflowers and native grasses in his eastern Iowa prairie can help warm homes and tackle water pollution, erosion and other pressing environmental problems in the state. Thanks to a five-year, $80 million federal grant, Sievers will work with Missouri business Roeslein Alternative Energy, Iowa State University and a dozen other groups to test whether U.S. farmers can make money turning prairies and manure into renewable fuel. Sievers and his partners plan to mix harvested prairie, cover crops and conservation grassland with cattle manure in an anaerobic digester to make renewable natural gas that will go into a pipeline that feeds homes and businesses or be compressed to power trucks and other vehicles. The project is one of 70 that the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently awarded $2.8 billion, a total the federal agency nearly tripled after receiving about 450 requests. The projects seek to create new carbon markets that pay farmers for work to reduce the environmental impact of commodities like corn, soybeans, beef and pork. Sievers and his partners expect their project will help pave the way for more on-farm digesters that can reduce odor from cattle, pig and other livestock operations; cut harmful methane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; and encourage farmers to plant prairies, conservation reserve grasses and annual cover crops on marginal farmland, as well as buffers along rivers, lakes and streams.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A man was sentenced Monday to 18 months in prison for his role in a hoax phone call that led police to shoot and kill an innocent man in 2017. Shane Gaskill was sentenced after pleading guilty in May to wire fraud, KSN reports. He was originally placed on probation but faced renewed prosecution after violating the terms of his probation. Prosecutors said Gaskill got into an argument in December 2017 with Ohio gamer Casey Viner over a $1.50 bet. Using an old Wichita address Gaskill had given him, Viner persuaded Tyler Barris in Los Angeles to call Wichita police and say a kidnapping and shooting had happened at the address, prosecutors said. It’s called “swatting,” a form of retaliation in which someone makes a false report to police to send first responders, including SWAT teams, to someone’s address. Andrew Finch, 28, who lived at the address, was shot and killed by police after he opened the front door to see what was going on outside. Barris was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to 51 counts of making fake emergency calls and threats around the country, including the one that led to Finch’s death. Viner served 15 months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a woman who shoplifted about $80 worth of items from a Walmart self-checkout station should not face a felony that carries five to 10 years in prison – a punishment that Attorney General Daniel Cameron defended. All seven justices instead agreed with the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which had said it was “inherently unfair to convict somebody of a class C felony for theft of goods worth $80,” and the high court sent the case back to Pulaski Circuit Court, where a jury had initially found Chasity Shirley guilty of “unlawful access to a computer.” Shirley, 34, will now likely receive a directed verdict, which would see her felony conviction dismissed in court. While shopping in 2018 at a Walmart in Somerset, Shirley pulled what retailers call a “switcheroo” by switching the bar codes from a toothbrush holder with those from a more expensive children’s rug and slipcover before checking herself out of the store. A loss-control associate caught her, and the cost difference between the item she paid for and the two items she tried to take was $80.80. She also allegedly “pushed and elbowed” a loss prevention manager as she exited the store but was later found not guilty of a fourth-degree assault charge at trial, the Kentucky Supreme Court noted.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A social services nonprofit long called the Kingsley House renamed itself Tuesday, dropping the name of a Victorian clergyman who is perhaps best remembered as the author of a children’s fantasy novel but held profoundly racist views. For 126 years it was Kingsley House, named both for author and social reformer Charles Kingsley and for the founder’s son Kingsley Warner, who died as a toddler. Now the nonprofit will be called Clover. Officials knew Charles Kingsley had been a chaplain to Queen Victoria, tutor to the boy who became King George V, and had written about 20 books. “And he was quote-unquote a social reformer who helped create the settlement house movement,” said Keith Liederman, CEO of Clover, shortly before Tuesday’s announcement. The Rev. Beverly Warner of New Orleans’ Trinity Episcopal Church founded Kingsley House in 1896 as a settlement house, an inner-city institution dedicated to fighting poverty. The organization’s programs now help children in need, families and community. Its prominence made it a stop in Democrat John Edwards’ unsuccessful campaign for president in 2007. Its community outreach was why former Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush visited there in 2006 to announce $9.7 million in grants to help victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Congressional candidates in a hotly contested race snipped at each other Tuesday about a contribution from the leader of a conservation group that has discouraged consumers from buying lobster. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is defending his seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District against Republican former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin and independent candidate Tiffany Bond. Poliquin’s campaign on Tuesday called on Golden to return a contribution of $667 from Julie Packard, the executive director of Seafood Watch. The group based at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California that Packard helped found added American and Canadian lobster to its “red list” of seafood species to avoid this summer because of the risk fishing gear poses to endangered whales. Poliquin’s camp said that listing has caused economic hardship for fishermen in Maine, where most of the nation’s domestic lobster comes to the docks. “Seafood Watch’s warning to consumers to avoid Maine lobster, on top of forty-year high inflation and fuel prices, have gouged Maine lobstermen’s paychecks,” said Roy Matthews, a Poliquin spokesperson. Golden’s campaign said he has no intention to return the money and cited Golden’s opposition to new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration whale protection regulations as evidence that he has the fishing industry’s interests at heart.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A judge granted an emergency petition Friday filed by the Maryland State Board of Elections to enable the counting of mail-in ballots earlier than they were during the state’s July primary. Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge James Bonifant granted the petition, which will allow local elections officials across the state to begin canvassing mail-in ballots on Oct. 1. Bonifant wrote that with so many mail-in ballots, local boards of election would not be able to verify the vote count within 10 days of the general election as required. “There is no doubt that the increased number of mail-in ballots will have an enormous affect on the process of this election,” Bonifant wrote in his ruling. “Mandatory deadlines will be missed if the Court takes no action.” The state elections board said the ruling provides election officials with additional time to canvass and tabulate mail-in ballots to ensure that all critical election-related deadlines established by law are met. “It also enables elections officials to return to a well-established process of canvassing mail-in ballots prior to Election Day, which was allowed in the 2020 General Election,” the board said in a statement.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: A Harwich pig that had long been overshadowed by a diva sibling has risen to celebrity status and beer label glory. A stirring portrait of Bartholomew, a 200-pound half-Julianna, half-mini pig, now graces the cans of a new offering from the Provincetown Brewing Co. The high hog honor has not affected Bart one bit. “He’s kind of like an old man in a sport coat with sneakers on,” owner Emma Bankman said. “He doesn’t care what anyone thinks.” “Bartholobrew,” billed as “a classic wheat ale with sweet, caramelly notes,” is the frothy result of a summer-long pet label contest to benefit Provincetown’s Carrie A. Seaman Animal Shelter. Sherry Brec, CASAS board president, said there were more than 65 animal entries, and the donate-to-vote system generated more than $17,000 for the no-kill facility that places dogs and cats with folks on the Outer Cape. Meanwhile, in Harwich, Bartholomew has finally eclipsed the renown of his domineering half-sister Matilda. According to Bankman, Matilda has long been the boss hog in the house and often shuts the door on Bart, leaving him outside. And Matilda even tried to nose in on Bart’s bowl of celebratory Bartholobrew, a sudsy incursion that was nipped in the bud by an alert Bankman.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: General Motors is stepping back a bit on a return-to-work policy after a backlash from salaried employees. CEO Mary Barra sent out a note to the salaried workforce Tuesday offering an apology of sorts for the timing of putting out a new policy late in the day Friday saying employees would have to return to working in the office three days a week. She said in the update that GM’s plan still will include a more regular in-person presence, but it will not implement any changes to its return-to-the-office policy this year as the company continues to listen to worker feedback. The plan still will ask employees to work in-office three days each week. “The initial letter was a notification, and the purpose of the update is to provide clarification and additional details,” GM spokeswoman Maria Raynal said Tuesday. “The timing has shifted slightly; however, the overall plan has not changed.” In Tuesday’s note sent to employees, Barra wrote: “We want to take the opportunity to address some of the questions, concerns, and misconceptions that we’ve heard. We acknowledge that the timing of the message, late on a Friday afternoon, was unfortunate. It was also unintentional.” GM will communicate more information on its plan next month, Barra said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Republicans attacked Democratic Gov. Tim Walz on Monday after a judge took the rare step of disputing the administration’s claim that the judge prevented the state from cutting off payments to Feeding Our Future, which is the target of a $250 million federal fraud case. The GOP candidates for governor, attorney general and state auditor – Scott Jensen, Jim Schultz and Ryan Wilson – said Walz and other top Democrats should have done more to stop the alleged fraud before it became what federal prosecutors last week called the largest pandemic-related fraud in the country. But the warring political sides disagree on how far Ramsey County District Judge John Guthmann went toward compelling the Minnesota Department of Education to resume payments to Feeding Our Future. A court statement issued late Friday said the judge “never issued an order” for the state to resume payments, but the department produced a hearing transcript showing the judge threatened to hold one attorney in contempt if the state failed to restore the flow of funds. The Republican candidates largely accepted the judge’s version of events. Jensen called for an independent investigation to report back before he and Walz hold their next debate Oct. 18.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The federal government wants to work with officials in the city to reach a legal agreement that ensures Jackson can sustain its water system in the future, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said Monday. Federal attorneys also sent a letter to city officials Monday threatening legal action if Jackson does not agree to negotiations related to its water system. Regan returned to Mississippi’s capital city Monday to meet with Jackson officials about the city’s troubled water system. At the meeting with Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and U.S. Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim, Regan said the federal government would work with the city to “deliver long overdue relief for Jackson residents.” “The people of Jackson, Mississippi, have lacked access to safe and reliable water for decades. After years of neglect, Jackson’s water system finally reached a breaking point this summer, leaving tens of thousands of people without any running water for weeks,” Regan said. “These conditions are unacceptable in the United States of America.” In a Monday letter sent to city officials and obtained by the news station WLBT-TV, Kim and attorneys for DOJ’s Environmental Enforcement Section said they were “prepared to file an action” against the city under the Safe Drinking Water Act but hoped the matter could be resolved through an “enforceable agreement.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: As abuse allegations mount against a Christian boarding school, the way “troubled” children are often whisked away to facilities far from home is under fire. Within what’s known as the secure transport industry, it’s called “gooning.” Brawny men show up under the cover of darkness and force a teenager into a vehicle, taking them against their will to a boarding school, foster home or treatment center. They might be restrained with handcuffs or zip ties. They could be blindfolded or hooded. Criminal charges are rare because the little-known industry is virtually unregulated. In Missouri alone, more than 100 Christian boarding schools promise hope for wayward teens. The former doctor at Agape Boarding School, in Stockton, which serves about 60 teenage boys, was charged last year with multiple counts of sexual abuse of children, and five staff members are charged with abuse. In nearby Humansville, Circle of Hope, a Christian boarding school for girls, closed amid an investigation in 2020. The husband-and-wife co-founders were charged with 99 abuse counts last year, including sexual abuse. The allegations of wrongdoing at Agape and Circle of Hope led state Rep. Keri Ingle, a Democrat, to sponsor a measure signed into law last year that requires more rigorous oversight in Missouri. Now, Ingle said she’ll seek stricter regulations on companies transporting the kids against their will.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Authorities said Tuesday that they were investigating the shooting of a 6-month-old dog by a woman who skinned the animal and posted pictures of herself with the pelt, apparently believing she had killed a young wolf. The animal was among more than a dozen dogs that local residents reported abandoned last week on national forest land in northwestern Montana near Kalispell, according to the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office. The hunter who shot one of the dogs posted images of herself smiling on social media in front of the animal’s head and hide, which were taken by the sheriff’s office and turned over to a state wildlife biologist, said Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Greg Lemon. The biologist determined the remains belonged to a domestic dog about 6 months old, Lemon said. Officials were investigating if the woman was properly licensed to hunt wolves, he said. The sheriff’s office is investigating both the shooting of the dog and the abandonment of the other dogs but declined Tuesday to release any further information. Lemon said accurately identifying animals before they are shot is a core tenet of hunting. “The vast majority of hunters are very deliberate about when they pull the trigger that the animal in their sights is the animal they are licensed to hunt,” he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: With Memorial Stadium on the cusp of its 100th anniversary, the University of Nebraska athletic department on Thursday set the stage for a massive renovation that will make the venue more fan-friendly for decades to come. University leaders also announced a new multimedia rights deal that would bring in more than $300 million over 15 years and said that alcohol would be sold at men’s and women’s basketball games at Pinnacle Bank Arena starting this season. The athletic department must get approval from the university Board of Regents, which is expected to approve the plans. The next board meeting is Friday. Nebraska is scheduled to open a $160 million football facility next year, and the Big Ten’s billion-dollar-a-year media rights deal announced this summer will bring unprecedented windfalls to league members. The announcements came less than two weeks after Nebraska began its search for a new football coach following the firing of Scott Frost. Athletic director Trev Alberts said discussions about stadium upgrades and the rights deal have been going on for months, and the timing is coincidental. The Cornhuskers have played in Memorial Stadium since 1923, and incremental improvements have been made over the years, including luxury suites in 1999 and an expansion to more than 85,000 seats in 2013.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A dolphin habitat at a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip has been temporarily closed after the third mammal death at the attraction in five months. Officials at the Mirage Secret Garden and Habitat said an 11-year-old bottlenose dolphin named K2 died Saturday. The cause of death remains unclear, but officials told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the mammal had been receiving treatment for a respiratory illness. They say Maverick, a 19-year-old bottlenose dolphin, died Sept. 2 following treatment for a lung infection, while 13-year-old Bella died in April after undergoing treatment for gastroenteritis. According to the international organization Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums’ website, a bottlenose dolphin’s life expectancy is about 28 to 29 years. Mirage interim President Franz Kallao said officials were working closely with veterinary and pathology experts to determine the cause of death for K2, who was born at the Secret Garden. “We are also working with additional outside veterinary, water quality, behavioral, animal welfare, and environmental experts to help us conduct a thorough review and inspection of both the animals and the facility,” Kallao said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: A local woman who found herself with an unexpected inheritance and the desire to “do the most good” with the money is helping to make housing for domestic abuse survivors possible. She received more than half a million dollars following the sale of real estate her late uncle’s family business owned. Knowing her family was financially comfortable and living within their means, she did something unexpected: She became an angel investor with a $500,000 investment into Dover Housing Authority-owned property. This income assures the future of the Haven at the Falls project to house domestic abuse survivors, said Ryan Crosby, executive director of the authority. The investment will serve as seed funding to build the affordable housing units. The proposed six-unit apartment development is planned in the Dover Housing Authority’s Whittier Falls neighborhood. The new project was born out of a partnership between the Dover Housing Authority and Haven, a domestic and sexual violence prevention agency. “Our angel investor is a lot like me – frustrated with how little affordable housing there is and how little there is we can do about it,” Crosby said. “This investment allows us to both make a direct, measurable impact in that fight. We both share the belief that housing is a human right.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: After months of calls to eliminate a state-mandated expensive teacher licensing test blamed for worsening the teacher shortage, Gov. Phil Murphy did away with it – sort of. The Murphy administration said the educative Teacher Performance Assessment would no longer be required in New Jersey, but it must be replaced by a similar test to be used to certify graduates. Murphy issued a conditional veto Thursday to legislation that shifts the burden of certifying teachers from the state’s shoulders to the colleges that train them. Starting in spring 2024, colleges and universities will be required to use their own tests as a final step to certify graduates before they may join the workforce. The conditional veto was welcomed by many of the state’s education-related groups, including the state superintendents’ association, teachers’ unions and school principals’ associations. Some said Murphy waited too long to make a decision about the test. The New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, welcomed the move to remove the edTPA but indicated in its statement that the decision could have come earlier and that it continues to delay teacher candidates who are otherwise ready to start working.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators are reconsidering how they evaluate complaints of sexual misconduct against colleagues, amid outrage about the handling of a complaint against an influential senator. A panel of leading lawmakers met Monday to discuss possible changes to ground rules for harassment investigations at the Legislature. “It has become clear that our anti-harassment policy is not working,” said Democratic state Rep. Daymon Ely of Corrales, co-chairman of a legislative ethics committee. “This is intended to start a discussion.” Harassment complaints against lawmakers are often assigned for an initial investigation to a panel of four legislators, which may deadlock on a 2-2 vote. Ely proposed the changes that would assign an outside expert to break any tie vote, with public notice of the outcome. Ely outlined proposals that would remove secrecy provisions that currently prevent people who complain of harassment by legislators from publicly discussing any investigation that has been dismissed without a finding of probable cause. “How do we fix that so that we have closure for those people?” said Democratic Sen. George Muñoz, of Gallup. “It can’t come out in a tie. There has to be closure for both sides.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State investigators have substantiated more than 1,600 instances of corporal punishment in New York schools over the past five years, The Times Union in Albany reports. A substantial number of the complaints were in New York City public schools, according to the newspaper. Other incidents included a substitute teacher in Watertown who was fired and arrested for grabbing a student by the throat and forcing him against a wall and a teaching assistant in Syracuse who was transferred and retrained for spanking a nonverbal student. Corporal punishment is generally banned and can be classified as child abuse. In all, the state Education Department documented nearly 18,000 complaints of corporal punishment in public and charter schools from 2016 through 2021, according to the Times Union. The newspaper said it found that school districts have underreported cases of corporal punishment to the federal government and that state Education Department records are not readily available to the public.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Four people pleaded guilty Monday to misdemeanors for their roles in absentee ballot fraud in rural North Carolina during the 2016 and 2018 elections. The convictions stemmed from an investigation that in part resulted in a do-over congressional election. Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway accepted the plea agreements, which resulted in no active prison or jail time, in Wake County court. Cases against six other defendants remained pending, with hearings scheduled through the end of next month, Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said. All 10 defendants, according to indictments handed up in 2019, had a common involvement with Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., a longtime political operative in rural Bladen County. Dowless also was indicted on more than a dozen state charges, with his case scheduled last year to go to trial last month. He rejected a plea agreement and looked forward to his day in court, according to a friend. But he died in April after being diagnosed with lung cancer. Freeman said at the time that the prosecution of the other cases would continue. Dowless worked in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris, who appeared to have received the most votes in the general election for the 9th District seat in south-central North Carolina. But allegations against Dowless surfaced, and testimony and other information revealed at a State Board of Elections hearing described him running an illegal “ballot harvesting” operation.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A prison guard was fired over the suicide of a man who was serving life sentences for killing four people. Sgt. Deandre Adams violated corrections policy in failing to adequately check on Chad Isaak, according to a termination letter from the warden at North Dakota State Penitentiary. Adams was fired Thursday. Warden James Sayler noted that Adams had received two previous written reprimands, for failing to report that he had left a missing inmate in a recreational area and for not intervening when two prisoners were potentially exchanging contraband, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “Your credibility, professionalism, and the trust I had in you as a sergeant are irreparably damaged,” Sayler wrote. “This level of trust, which is expected of every team member, is something I no longer have in you, due to your misconduct.” Isaak, 48, died July 31. An investigative report from the state Highway Patrol released last month found that Adams said he failed to adequately check on Isaak twice. It also said Isaak had covered his cell with cardboard. Adams knew inmates were not allowed to cover their cell windows but allowed it as a “courtesy in case they were naked in their cells,” the report said. “He stated they could enforce it but that they would just get more window coverings.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state has officially signed off on its biggest package of incentives tied to job creation – potentially totaling as much as $650 million over 30 years for Intel for its $20 billion investment in Licking County. The Ohio Tax Credit Authority on Monday approved the incentive package, one of six projects the panel approved. As is the case with most projects that come before the authority, there was little discussion about the Intel project before the four members approved it. The $650 million approved Monday is part of a total incentive package from Ohio to Intel that is expected to top $2 billion. Unlike the other state incentives for Intel, the one approved by the authority is based on how many jobs it creates. The incentive begins in 2024; Intel has said in anticipates production of semiconductors to begin in 2025. Intel announced in January its plan to create 3,000 jobs as part of its $20 billion investment in New Albany, the biggest single economic development project in state history. Those jobs will have an annual payroll of $405 million, according to Intel. Intel has said it expects to start recruiting this fall from college campus as it anticipates ramping up hiring in advance of the opening of the two plants.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-1 Tuesday to deny clemency for a man sentenced to die for killing his 9-month-old daughter in 2002, moving him a step closer to his scheduled lethal injection next month. Attorneys for Benjamin Cole, 57, did not dispute that Cole killed Brianna Cole by forcibly bending the infant backward, breaking her spine and tearing her aorta, but they argued that he both is severely mentally ill and has a growing lesion on his brain that has continued to worsen while he has been in prison. Cole has refused medical attention and ignored his personal hygiene, hoarding food and living in a darkened cell with little to no communication with staff or fellow prisoners, his attorneys told the panel. “His condition has continued to decline over the course of this year,” Cole’s attorney Katrina Conrad-Legler said. The lesion on Cole’s brain, which is separate from his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, has grown in size in recent years and affects the part of his brain that deals with problem-solving, movement and social interaction, Conrad-Legler said. Cole declined to speak to the panel. Attorneys for the state and members of the victim’s family told the board that Cole’s symptoms of mental illness are exaggerated and that the brutal nature of his daughter’s killing merits his execution.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two ships that have been abandoned in the Columbia River for years are being removed, and the U.S. Coast Guard is working with state agencies to clean up the fuel and oil that leaked from the vessels. The ships – a Navy tug called the Sakarissa and a Coast Guard cutter called the Alert – first arrived in Portland in 2006 and were brought near Hayden Island in hopes that they could be turned into a museum. But the funding for that project dried up, and they have been abandoned for more than a decade.Both of the ships sunk two years ago. Bill Ryan with the Oregon Department of State Lands said it’s not yet clear why the Alert sunk, but the Sakarissa foundered after someone salvaging metal cut through a pipe, causing it to flood. The Coast Guard raised the 100-foot Sakarissa from the river last week and towed it to a repair service to remove the remaining oil waste from the ship. Metro Council, a regional government agency that serves three counties in northwest Oregon, is spending $2 million to have the ships removed, and the Coast Guard is spending more than $1 million to clean up. The state estimates that there are more than 300 vessels abandoned around Oregon. Removing them all would cost an estimated $40 million.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney signed an executive order Tuesday banning guns and deadly weapons from the city’s indoor and outdoor recreation spaces, including parks, basketball courts and pools. The order is the latest attempt by Philadelphia officials to regulate guns inside city limits – something made difficult by Pennsylvania’s preemption law that bars municipalities from enacting or enforcing their own stricter gun regulations. Attorneys for the city said the executive order is the city managing its facilities as a property owner, making it different from previous legislation passed by the City Council and struck down in court. The ceremonial signing also comes the day after Kenney spoke at the funeral for Tiffany Fletcher, a 41-year-old mother of three, who was struck and killed by crossfire earlier this month outside of the city recreation center where she worked. A 14-year-old, who was firing at another group of teens, has since been charged in Fletcher’s shooting death. “I watched (parks and recreation workers) yesterday line up on Lehigh Avenue like police officers burying one of their own. … I saw what I usually see when a police officer or firefighter dies in the line of duty. They were all out there lined up like they were on the front line, and they are,” Kenney said, fighting back his emotions.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBarrington: The owner of the historic Belton Court mansion has applied to demolish the deteriorating buildings on the 37-acre property. While the demolition permit has not been granted, there is little Barrington can do to prevent issuing the demolition permit once all the requirements are met, including such items as a plan to dispose of asbestos. Barrington Town Manager Phil Hervey said the mansion, once occupied by the Zion Bible College, was the centerpiece of the town’s 2016 master plan, as well as zoning rules passed specifically for the property that would allow it to become age-restricted housing. He is trying to set up a meeting with the project’s managers to discuss the demolition, but no date has been set. “We cannot prevent the teardown,” Hervey said. “If it meets the technical requirements, I don’t see any way to not issue it at a certain point.” The property has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976. It was once an 800-acre estate, the country house of Frederick Peck, designed by the Providence architecture firm Martin & Hall. The property is owned by a Chinese investor and holdings company who bought it atpublic auction in 2011 for $3.85 million after town officials backed out of a plan to purchase it from the Zion Bible Institute for $5.2 million. Barrington College occupied the campus in the 1950s until it was bought in 1985 by the Zion Bible Institute, which vacated the property in 2007.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservative lawmakers voted Tuesday not to make changes to the state’s abortion laws after this summer’s U.S. Supreme Court decision, meaning rules on abortion likely will not become more restrictive. South Carolina was for decades at the forefront of passing more restrictive abortion laws that challenged Roe v. Wade, before the landmark case was overturned this summer. But the state that helped lead the nation through requiring ultrasounds, parental consent and 24-hour waiting periods before abortions is at an impasse during a special session. The Senate could only muster enough votes to tweak South Carolina’s current six-week ban – which isn’t even in effect at the moment because of a state Supreme Court challenge. The House started its session Tuesday by rejecting a proposal by Democratic Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter to have the right to abortion placed before voters in a constitutional amendment. “Why are you afraid to let the people decide?” Cobb-Hunter asked. “Are you afraid you are going to be proven wrong? I think that’s it.” The rejection of the Senate’s version allows a group of three lawmakers from each chamber to work on a compromise between the Senate bill and the House version, which banned almost all abortions with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest or that threaten the life of the mother up to 12 weeks after conception.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: For the first time this year, anthrax, a serious bacterial disease, has been found in a herd of livestock in western South Dakota. State Veterinarian Dr. Beth Thompson confirmed the presence of the disease in a press release from the South Dakota Animal Industry Board on Tuesday. The disease was found in several deceased cows that belonged to a herd of 160 unvaccinated cattle in Meade County. South Dakota State University’s animal disease laboratory confirmed the disease from samples submitted over the weekend. Anthrax is a pervasive disease that can devastate herds of livestock in a short amount of time, “and much of South Dakota has the potential of experiencing an outbreak,” Thompson said in the release. Cattle that catch anthrax may sudden perish without any visible symptoms. Russ Daly, state public health veterinarian with SDSU, said the general public is not at risk of infection, but farmers need to avoid making direct skin contact with carcasses containing anthrax. Drought, floods and winds can spread anthrax spores to grazing livestock. Spores can also persist indefinitely in contaminated soil and may vegetate in grazeland, which could further spread the infection among South Dakota’s cattle.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s textbook commission may need additional staff and its own attorney to deal with the aftermath of a new, controversial Tennessee law requiring schools to catalog and publicize a list of all available library and classroom materials. Textbook and Instructional Materials Quality Commission chair Linda Cash told a legislative subcommittee on Tuesday the law has added a lot of work “to people who already have a full load.” Cash suggested the commission should have an independent attorney who can answer commission questions, as the commission is currently seeking legal answers from the Tennessee Attorney General’s Office. “The way that we’re designed currently, it’s hard to get an opinion,” Cash said. The commission faces a Dec. 1 deadline to issue statewide guidance on the library materials law, which the General Assembly passed this year in response to pushback from conservatives alleging students were being exposed to “inappropriate” school materials. The commission must provide schools’ guidance on determining what is age-appropriate, which is not settled in state law, in addition to establishing an appeals process for local decisions on contested materials.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton ran out of his house and jumped into a truck driven by his wife, a state senator, to avoid being served a subpoena to testify Tuesday in an abortion access case, according to court documents. A process server wrote in an affidavit that he was attempting to deliver the federal court subpoena Monday at Paxton’s home and ultimately had to leave the document on the ground. He said the Republican avoided him for more than an hour from inside his house, then dashed toward the truck, and the couple drove off. Paxton, who is facing a variety of legal troubles as he seeks to win a third term in November, said he avoided the server out of safety concerns and said the news media should be ashamed for reporting on what happened. “It’s clear that the media wants to drum up another controversy involving my work as Attorney General, so they’re attacking me for having the audacity to avoid a stranger lingering outside my home and showing concern about the safety and well-being of my family,” Paxton wrote on Twitter on Monday night. On Tuesday, a judge hearing the lawsuit by nonprofit groups that want to help Texans pay for abortions out of state granted Paxton’s request to quash the subpoena.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: State wildlife officers are launching a new drone team to help prevent vandalism and provide law enforcement on public lands. Five Division of Wildlife Resources officers completed various licensing and training requirements with the Federal Aviation Administration to become certified law enforcement drone operators and staff the first Unmanned Aerial Systems team. “Using drones will help us more effectively solve wildlife crimes, and having trained law enforcement drone pilots will also allow us to assist other law enforcement agencies with search-and-rescue efforts or any other investigations,” DWR Captain Wade Hovinga said. The specialized drone officers function similarly to a K-9 officer team, called in to help with situations like search-and-rescue operations, searching for evidence of illegally taken wildlife, assisting biologists with wildlife surveys and investigating hunting-related shooting incidents. “Utah conservation officers are public servants, and these new tools will help us better serve the public, whether we’re solving poaching crimes or locating lost hunters,” Hovinga said. DWR officers patrol Utah’s mountains, lakes and unpopulated areas, often on foot or on off-road vehicles or even on horseback, investigating wildlife-related violations.\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: A student at a military college who sued top Pentagon officials after he was deemed unfit for service because he tested positive for HIV has settled his lawsuit and plans to pursue his dream of becoming an Army officer, his lawyers said Tuesday. “I am incredibly grateful to be back on track to obtain a contract with the ROTC and then commission as an officer,” Eddie Diaz, a student at Norwich University, said in a statement released by Lawyers for Civil Rights. “I just want an opportunity to serve my country, and I believe that should be available to all eligible Americans.” The plaintiff in the lawsuit filed in Burlington in May was listed as John Doe, but Diaz is now using his real name publicly. Diaz, 21, of Revere, Massachusetts, said in the complaint that he tested positive for HIV in October 2020 during his sophomore year at Norwich, the nation’s oldest private military college. He was deemed unfit for service and dropped from the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps and the Vermont National Guard in violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal law despite being “healthy, asymptomatic and on a treatment regimen that renders his viral load undetectable,” according to the suit. Military officials never asked him how he manages his HIV or spoke to his treating physician, and he was never examined by a military doctor, the suit said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The Albemarle-Charlottesville Historical Society is creating a database with the information it has uncovered about enslaved people in the area so descendants can make connections. The goal is to allow descendants’ voices to guide the process for creating some kind of memorial for the site, The Daily Progress reports. Charlottesville native Diane Brown Townes knew some of her family history from records kept in an old tattered family Bible passed down for generations, and she knew she had ancestors who were enslaved in the region. But until recently, she had no idea some of her people may be buried in unmarked graves in a city park she’d spent lots of time in over the years or that she’s been living next door to relatives without knowing it. The Charlottesville officials believe there are at least 43 enslaved people buried at Pen Park in unmarked graves. The graves are adjacent to a cemetery belonging to the Gilmer family, which owned a tobacco plantation on the land where the city-owned park and golf course are today. The Albemarle-Charlottesville Historical Society started researching the probable identities of the people buried in the park last year. Members have been able to identify and connect with several area residents likely to have ancestors buried in the park. “For me, it’s finally being able to understand your feeling, a sense of being. I really never felt connected to history. I was always taught dates from a more white, patriarchal perspective,” Townes said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The National Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Navy have started efforts to recover the wreckage of a floatplane that crashed in the Puget Sound earlier this month, killing all 10 people on board. A barge that’s been equipped to conduct the recovery entered the shipping channel Monday, KING-5 News reports. It was expected to drop anchors near the suspected wreckage location before a team arrived at the barge Tuesday. The U.S. Navy will use a remotely operated vehicle Deep Drone 8,000, a barge and a crane in recovery efforts. The remotely operated vehicle will collect smaller pieces of wreckage into baskets for the crane to lift, the NTSB said. Some items from the plane have already been recovered, including foam fragments, a seat cushion, a seat belt, dispatch paperwork, flooring structure remnants and some personal items belonging to the victims, according to the NTSB. The plane was traveling from Friday Harbor on San Juan Island to the Seattle suburb of Renton when it crashed Sept. 4. Only one body was found, identified as Gabby Hanna, of Seattle. Officials say determining the probable cause of the crash could take 12 to 24 months.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A protester who was forcefully removed from the House of Delegates gallery after allegedly disrupting debate on a bill to ban abortion earlier this month was arrested more than a week after she and others rallied against the ban at the state Capitol. Lindsey Jacobs, a 38-year-old lawyer from Morgantown, was arrested Friday and charged with three misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, willful disruption of governmental processes, and disorderly conduct against “the peace and dignity of the state,” according to a copy of the arrest warrant. Jacobs, who runs advocacy programs for a nonprofit legal services organization, was removed from the House chamber’s gallery Sept. 13 while listening to lawmakers discuss legislation that bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with few exceptions. Republican Del. Margitta Mazzocchi said people who want to protect against pregnancy can buy emergency contraceptives – known as “Plan B” pills – over the counter. “Not if you’re poor,” Jacobs shouted down at lawmakers, followed by shouts from others sitting in the gallery. Jacobs said she became frustrated listening to Mazzocchi’s speech because she felt like the lawmaker was overlooking that the pills cost between $40 and $50, an amount she said is “cost-prohibitive for a lot of people.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: All records from the closed Republican-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election in the state are being uploaded to a website “for all to see,” an attorney told a judge Tuesday. The investigation was led by former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who was fired in August by Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. He fired Gableman just days after Vos won his primary over an opponent whom Gableman and ex-President Donald Trump endorsed. But the office Gableman led still exists after he was fired. American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, has filed four open records lawsuits against Gableman, Vos and the office seeking records created during the investigation. On Tuesday, during a hearing over a lawsuit American Oversight filed seeking to stop the deletion of records, attorney James Bopp said that all electronic and paper records from the office have been turned over to the Assembly chief clerk’s office. The files are being uploaded to a website that will soon be available “for all to see,” said Bopp, who represents the office, which he said has no employees. Hundreds of pages of documents have already been made public as the result of other American Oversight lawsuits. Bopp said the data yet-to-be made public that’s being processed now includes text messages on cellphones used in the course of the investigation.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Gov. Mark Gordon plans to propose spending $25 million in federal pandemic relief on affordable housing projects, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The governor’s office plans to submit its proposal to a legislative committee for a grant program aimed at funding “shovel-ready” projects with the American Rescue Plan Act money, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/12/coronavirus-vermont-live-updates-cases-closures-covid-19/5023835002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Vermont: Latest news and impact", "text": "Free Press Staff\n\nAs the situation surrounding the COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus continues to evolve in Vermont, here are updates and information.

The rating, according to Moody's, means the airport's obligations are medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk, but that it has a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\n\n________________\n\nProperty taxes for Williston residents will be a bit higher than expected this year due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic delayed construction in the town, which impacted property values, the town stated in a news release. As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15. The other two deadlines will remain the same.\n\n________________\n\nMonday, July 20, 2020\n\nThree full-time staff were laid off at Colchester Parks and Recreation due to diminished demand for camps and recreation programs during the pandemic, Town Manager Aaron Frank announced last week.\n\n\"Please do what you can to help towards positive changes in COVID outcomes that will allow us to bring back these valuable programs and staff that help make Colchester a great place to live, work and play,\" Frank wrote in a newsletter.\n\nOn a more upbeat note, the town announced that rehabilitation work on the Colchester Causeway is moving along ahead of schedule.

Eight hospitalizations are under investigation. Deaths remain at 56.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,099 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease, with a total of 77,624 people have been tested.\n\n_________\n\nA preliminary outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Windham County was announced by state officials Tuesday during Gov. Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15. The second round is expected to launch in October, and will cover between June 16 to Sept. 30.\n\n_________\n\nBurlington School District will host a series of town hall meetings this week, inviting community members to learn about and participate in the district's plans to reopen schools this fall.\n\nThe meetings will be conducted virtually via Zoom and split between two days to allow both families and staff the opportunity to ask questions and hear from school administrators about the reopening.\n\nThe town hall meeting for families will meet 7 p.m. on July 15, whereas a meeting for staff will be conducted the following day, at 7 p.m. on July 16.\n\n“This is a key moment in our planning process,\" said Tom Flanagan, the new superintendent for Burlington School District when began his tenure on July 1st.\n\n\"We need to hear from the community in order to finalize our plans and inform our families so they can start planning their lives.\"\n\nFor more information, those interested can visit the district's website via this link.

Eight hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,096 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n76,581 people have been tested for the virus.\n\nNOTE: The Free Press noticed the numbers regarding new and total case counts didn't align from July 11 to July 13 and subsequently reached out to the Health Department. Ben Truman with the department said in an email that this is why there is a notice that this data is preliminary. He provided an example: A person who tested positive might no longer get counted if it is learned that they don't live in Vermont.\n\n_________\n\nSunday, July 12, 2020\n\nFourteen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,296.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day.

Those interested in receiving assistance can begin applying online starting Monday July 13 for the rental assistance program or mortgage assistance program.\n\nRenters' assistance money could be used for rent or security deposits as well as make up for landlord losses from the period starting March 1, 2020. Funding can be re-applied for and is given out on a first-come, first-served basis. Proof of payment delinquency will be required.\n\nThe mortgage assistance program prioritizes the lowest income, highest risk of foreclosure homeowners who have missed at least two payments. Homeowners could apply for up to three missed mortgage payments; funds will be paid directly to the mortgage lender.\n\n__________\n\nKinney Drugs and a Walgreens in Essex will soon begin COVID-19 testing at their pharmacies.\n\nGov. Phil Scott asked other local companies to join the effort.

The airport has added thermal imaging that can pick up abnormally high body temperatures, indicating a fever, in groups of up to 20 people.

Phil Scott this week to write letters to bar owners in the state to remind them of COVID-19 compliance rules.\n\nThis comes after four Burlington bars received written warnings accusing them of breaking rules put in place through an executive order signed by Scott. These rules were set to ensure health and safety within bars during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nScott's letter also informs bar owners that the Department of Liquor and Lottery would be conducting compliance checks to ensure they are following the rules, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\nWeinberger has expressed concern about these violations, saying that COVID-19 transmission can easily occur in bars. He said the guidelines are restrictive, but they must be followed to ensure patrons' safety.\n\n\"I want to be clear: these are important businesses for Burlington,\" Weinberger said. \"They've been an important part of Burlington's economic successes, they're a part of the vibrancy of Burlington.

Travelers must travel by personal vehicle, and cannot fly or take a bus or train.\n\nVermont has already allowed travel without quarantine from low-risk counties in New York, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.\n\n__________\n\nThursday, June 25, 2020\n\nSeven new cases of COVID-19 reported in Vermont on Thursday brought the total number of positive cases to 1,191, according to Health Department data.\n\nThree people are hospitalized with COVID-19, while 12 people are hospitalized and under investigation for the virus. The state said that 938 people across the state have recovered.\n\nThe number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 remained at 56. A total of 60,709 people have been tested for the virus.\n\n__________\n\nThe Chittenden Solid Waste District's drop-off center in South Burlington will be reopening on Saturday, June 27 after being temporarily closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCustomers will be required to wear facial coverings and vehicles will be metered into the facility, according to the organization's website. The facility will be open on Monday, Friday and Saturday between 8 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.\n\nThe facility is currently not accepting large bulky items such as mattresses, furniture, or construction material. Items that will be accepted and their fees can be found on the Chittenden Solid Waste District's website at cswd.net/facility-locations/south-burlington-drop-center.\n\n__________\n\nWednesday, June 24, 2020\n\nDuring the Governor's meeting Wednesday, Health Commissioner Mark Levine gave updates on outbreaks and clusters of COVID-19 across the state.\n\nWinooski outbreak: The total cases are 114 so far with its peak in early June. According to Levine we are \"clearly on a downward and stable slope.\" He said it takes time for numbers to peter out because of the 7 to 14 day incubation perid.\n\nRutland County cluster: A Rutland County employer in the Fair Haven area has 12 cases within its population. Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro. Levine said the number of cases there is less than 10 but would not give an exact number as to not inadvertently identify the family.\n\nLevine said a cluster is when cases are confined to one main source such as a family, household or business and not distributed across the population. The term outbreak is used when transmission is beyond one particular source, he said.\n\n__________\n\nThere were 20 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state cumulative total to 1,184. Hospitalizations increased to four (from two) and those hospitalized under investigation decreased from 17 to 9 over the last 24 hours.\n\nDeaths remained at 56. Total people being monitored increased by 20 to 1,230.\n\nThose recovered total 930, while 1,296 completed being monitored and 59,860 tests have been performed so far.\n\n__________\n\nThe University of Vermont Medical Center is scaling back some limitations on visitors to the hospital. Every Vermont hospital began restricting visitation in March to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nEffective today, UVM Medical Center is allowing one \"consistent\" family member or support person in inpatient and procedural areas. Outpatient restrictions remain in place, where family and friends are not allowed to accompany patients into their doctors' offices unless patients requires support and assistance to meet with their doctors.\n\nFor pediatric patients, one parent or support person is recommended, but both parents may be permitted to visit when \"necessary and appropriate,\" based on unique care needs and circumstances determined by the care team.\n\nPatients arriving in the emergency department or urgent care may also be accompanied by one consistent family member or support person.\n\n__________\n\nNational Life Group in Montpelier announced it cut 53 jobs in Vermont as a result of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The insurance company also cut 30 jobs in Texas and 12 in \"other remote locations,\" according to a news release.\n\nMehran Assadi, chairman, president and CEO of National Life, said in a statement the company does not anticipate any further job cuts.\n\nNational Life employees have been working remotely since mid-March, with the exception of a few dozen essential workers who continue to report to the office in Montpelier, the news release said. The company is currently planning a phased return to the office, which will not occur before July 20.\n\n__________\n\nTuesday, June 23, 2020\n\nOne new case of COVID-19 brought the state cumulative total to 1,164. Hospitalizations increased to two (from none) and those hospitalized under investigation increased from 8 to 17 over the last 24 hours.\n\nDeaths remained at 56. Total people being monitored are 1,210.\n\nThose recovered total 927, while 1,270 completed being monitored and 59,328 tests have been performed so far.\n\n__________\n\nSmugglers' Notch Resort reopens for travelers and locals June 26. Activities such as pools, water parks, guided hiking, disc golf and 20 miles of mountain biking trails are expected to be open. Food and beverage service will be available on-site. Social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols will be employed.\n\n__________\n\nEmployees of restaurant and retail shops in downtown Burlington can park for free.\n\nTemporary free parking will be available at the Lakeview/College Street garage. Those who haven't done so previously need to sign up for FlexVal and fill out a sign up form.\n\nEmployees will receive a printed reusable validation parking pass to use until the end of July. The period could be extended.\n\n__________\n\nSome Vermonters who apply for unemployment insurance will see an increase to their weekly benefits.\n\nThe announcement came from Gov. Phil Scott and the Vermont Department of Labor Tuesday, as part of a series of changes to the state's Unemployment Insurance (UI) program.\n\nBeginning the first week of July, maximum weekly UI claims will increase from $513 to $531.\n\nIn addition to the benefits increase, Vermont employers will see a lowering of their UI tax rates as of July 1.\n\n“This tax relief will help reduce the burden on employers who’ve had to make difficult decisions to protect the health and safety of their workers and help limit the spread of COVID-19 in Vermont,” said Governor Scott in a news release.\n\n“We know Vermonters made a tremendous economic sacrifice in order to respond to this virus, and we will continue to pull every lever we can to help workers and employers recover from this pandemic.”\n\n__________\n\nChittenden Solid Waste District's South Burlington Drop-Off Center will resume its operations starting June 27.\n\nThe facility will reopen at limited capacity, with new hours (Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) and temporary flat fees while precautions are ongoing for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAll customers and visitors will be required to wear facial coverings when entering the Drop-Off Center. Trailers, wood waste, mattresses, and major electronic appliances (air conditioners, dehumidifiers, refrigerators) are not currently allowed.\n\n__________\n\nMonday, June 22, 2020\n\nFour new cases of COVID-19 were reported Monday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the cumulative total to 1,163.\n\nNo additional deaths were reported — the total remains at 56.\n\nNo people were reported hospitalized for the disease, although eight are under observation in a hospital.\n\nThe number of people being monitored for symptoms stands at 1,142 and the number who have completed monitoring is 1,241. These numbers include close contacts of confirmed cases and people traveling to Vermont from out-of-state who have enrolled in the state's Sara Alert program.\n\n_____________\n\nDarn Tough Vermont announced on Monday that it had to lay off nearly 50 employees.\n\n\"A few months ago we couldn’t grow fast enough,\" the company wrote on its social media account. \"There are larger problems in the world, and we get that. It’s always about people though, and compassion.\"\n\nDarn Tough falls under Cabot Hosiery Mills, Inc. President Ric Cabot had 330 employees in February, the Free Press reported.\n\n_____________\n\nMiddlebury College released a list of expected protocols for the fall semester in light of COVID-19. These include:\n\nA 12-week semester beginning Sept. 8, with no October break.

Students testing positive going to the Munford House for isolation. This rule applies to students living on and off campus.\n\n_____________\n\nState officials said Monday that recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in other states came after residents started to be lax in their compliance with guidelines for health and safety from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nVermont’s Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said 12 states recently set records for the number of new cases in a single day. The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159. No additional deaths were reported, which keeps the state's total at 56.\n\nThere are no people hospitalized with the disease but 11 are currently under investigation. An additional 817 people have been tested statewide, bringing the total to 57,845.\n\nThe number of people being monitored for symptoms stands at 1,018 and the number who have completed monitoring is 1,209.

On May 28, the Vermont Health Department conducted a series of tests on staff and inmates at the Rutland facility, all of which came back negative.\n\n________\n\nThe city of Burlington will begin its \"Open Streets BTV\" initiative this summer starting June 27, closing off a select number of downtown streets to cars and opening them up for restaurants and pedestrians.\n\nThe announcement came during a press conference held by Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger Friday.\n\nThe initiative will occur every Saturday until August 28, and will run from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m., depending on the weather.\n\n\"It could possible be a game changer for some of our small businesses that are in really dire straits right now,\" said Kara Alnasrawi, executive director of Church Street Marketplace.\n\nThe initiative has received positive feedback from business owners, Alnasrawi said, as downtown establishments have seen fewer customers and sales amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAmong the health and safety measures being undertaken for the \"Open Streets\" initiative to ensure physical distancing will include reservation-only dining, increased security, and limits on crowding.\n\nSome of the participating restaurants and streets include:\n\nCollege Street : Pho Son, Stone Soup, Finnigan's Pub, Bento Japanese Restaurant, The Archives, Sweetwaters, Leunig's, Whiskey Room.\n\n: Pho Son, Stone Soup, Finnigan's Pub, Bento Japanese Restaurant, The Archives, Sweetwaters, Leunig's, Whiskey Room.

Bennington, Rutland, Lamoille and Orleans counties each have one new case.\n\nOne more person has recovered from the disease. In addition, 1,142 more people were tested statewide, bringing the total to 55,887.\n\n________\n\nVermont's unemployment rate decreased from 16.5% to 12.7% for May, according to a press release from the Vermont Department of Labor.\n\n============\n\nThursday, June 18, 2020\n\nThe state has received a $2 million grant provide support to substance abuse and mental health services during the pandemic. The grant comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. COVID-19 has disrupted many services of support and recovery for Vermonters struggling with mental health issues and substance abuse.\n\n________\n\nStarting tomorrow, June 19, Vermont will begin the opening of long-term care facilities, according to the Vermont Department of Health. These facilities can allow two guests per resident per day, so long as those visits occur outside and follow social distancing protocols.\n\nVermonters over 65 will no longer be required to stay home. The Health Commissioner suggests that those individuals do continue to take safety precautions if they choose to leave their homes.\n\n________\n\nOne new death related to COVID-19 was reported Thursday by the Vermont Department of Health. The state's total fatalities related to the coronavirus now stand at 56.\n\nSix new cases of the disease were reported in the department's mid-morning update, for a cumulative total of 1,135. Three of the cases are in Chittenden County. Addison, Bennington and Rutland counties each had one new case.\n\nStatewide, about 917 people have recovered from the virus and 54,745 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are hospitalized for the disease, the department said; nine people are hospitalized and under investigation as possible cases.\n\n________\n\nU.S. and state flags will be lowered to half-staff on Friday at all state facilities as part of a monthly observance of Vermonters who have died due to COVID-19, Governor Phil Scott announced.\n\nVermont's first fatality from the new coronavirus took place March 19, 2020. A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

The accelerated semester includes no breaks, with instruction on Labor Day and throughout October. Students will leave campus on Friday, November 20, and are planned to be welcomed back when the spring semester begins on January 19, 2021.\n\n“We know this is different from our normal semester,” college President Elaine Collins said. “The health of the entire NVU community is our number one priority as we prepare to return to campus for face-to-face instruction.”\n\n__________\n\nVermont reported an additional 16 positive cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing its total to 1,110, Health Department statistics show.\n\nAccording to the data, 905 people have recovered from COVID-19 and 47,209 people have been tested for the virus in Vermont.\n\nThe number of people hospitalized with the virus decreased by one on Thursday for a total of three.

I’ve always been fascinated by how Northern Nevada, a metro area of 425,000 people, can’t fill 30,000-seat Mackay Stadium six times a year. Or how just 10,906 and 11,558 fans attended Colin Kaepernick’s second- and third-to-last home games despite the Pack being nationally ranked. Or how a Wolf Pack basketball team with two locally grown future NBA players – Armon Johnson and Luke Babbitt – didn’t draw more than 5,540 fans per home game despite that team winning 20-plus games. Or how Nevada couldn’t sell out Lawlor Events Center when the No. 1 team in the nation, North Carolina, faced off against those homegrown stars in 2008. The tepid fan support has always baffled me (people have told me they don’t go to football games because it’s “chukar season;” apparently it’s more fun to shoot birds than watch the Pack play). But as Nevada has played in the CBI over the last two weeks, I have an admission to make: I’ve been impressed by Wolf Pack fans.\n\nMurray's Sunday List: Top 10 freshman years in Pack hoops history\n\n* THE WOLF PACK HAS DRAWN 5,570 fans in its three CBI home games, starting at 4,524 before inching up to 6,053 and then 6,133. I wouldn’t be surprised to see 8,000 for game two of the championship series Wednesday. Nevada's three attendance figures are the largest of the 14 CBI games this year. In fact, the average attendance outside of the Nevada games has been 1,855 (it’d take three of those games to match one Pack attendance). It’s not often Nevada fans can brag about supporting its team. But, in this case, brag away. Wolf Pack fans have represented their team well.\n\n* FRIDAY MARKED THE ONE-YEAR anniversary of Eric Musselman agreeing to become Nevada’s coach. What a year it's been. He got the community to buy back into its basketball program and turned a nine-win team full of malcontents into a cohesive unit that is at 22 wins and counting. Has a Pack coach ever done so much in his first year on the job? Musselman has squeezed everything he could out of the team’s veterans (Marqueze Coleman, Tyron Criswell and D.J. Fenner are having career years); added one freshman (Lindsey Drew) who does everything right and is a pure winner; added another freshman (Cameron Oliver) who is as talented as any player to wear silver and blue; and loaded up with transfers who are sitting out this season who make the future look even brighter. All in 365 days.\n\n* AT THIS POINT, OLIVER HAS TO test the NBA waters, right? What’s the downside? Given the new NCAA rules, players can enter their name in the draft unlimited times over the course of their career. They can attend the NBA Combine and participate in one private workout for each of the 30 NBA teams. If invited to the NBA Combine, they can work 12 hours per week with their college coaches. And if they want to, they can pull their name from the draft after the combine (by May 25) and keep their college eligibility. It’s a win-win for players. I’m not saying Oliver is ready for the NBA (not many Pack games were scouted this year). He needs at least one more years of seasoning. But NBA teams will love his athleticism, strength, shooting ability and rim-protection skills. Worst-case scenario for putting you name out there is you get good feedback and at least put yourself on the NBA radar so scouts check you out next year.\n\n* THE MOUNTAIN WEST LOST A KEY component this week when Wyoming’s Larry Shyatt resigned. There is not a better coach in the MW, a conference that has taken a few steps back nationally the last couple of years. Wyoming isn’t an easy place to win, but Shyatt won there, taking his team to the 2015 NCAA Tournament and five postseason appearances in six seasons over two stints (he was the head coach at Clemson in between). A good man, a good quote and obviously an excellent coach, the MW needs more Larry Shyatts rather than less of them. He’ll be tough, if not impossible, to replace.\n\nWeek in 1,000 Words: Knuth showing rare patience\n\n* EX-SOUTH TAHOE HIGH STAR Jerod Haase was named Stanford’s coach. It’s hard not to like the hire. Haase took UAB from 16 wins to 18 to 20 to 26. He’s won an NCAA Tournament game (as a No. 14 seed). He mentored under Roy Williams for 17 years, first as a player and then as his assistant. He’s not be the splashiest hire Stanford could have made, but he’ll be a success. Stanford is an excellent job. Prior to Johnny Dawkins, who was fired last week after eight seasons, the Cardinal made the NCAA Tournament in 13 of the prior 14 years. Has can get the program back to that level.\n\n* ALEX RODRIGUEZ SAID HE’LL RETIRE after the 2017 season – apparently he needs a two-year going-away party – which means he won’t catch Barry Bonds as MLB’s home run kind. Rodriguez needs 76 homers to pass Bonds. He’s not doing that in two seasons. Had Rodriguez not missed a full season over a steroid suspension he might have passed Bonds. But without doping how many homers does he hit in the first place? Interestingly, of the top 15 players on the all-time home run list, six were known steroid users – Bonds, Rodriguez, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Rafael Palmeiro and Manny Ramirez. I doubt any of them get into the Hall of Fame.\n\n* ARIZONA CARDINALS COACH Bruce Arians said this week parents who don’t let their kids play football because of the risk of injury “are fools” because football “teaches more values than any other game that you play.” I like Arians and football does teach many great life lessons. But so do baseball and basketball and in those sports you’re not risking CTE while trying to chase paychecks that aren’t even guaranteed at the top level. You could make a stronger case that it’s foolish to allow your kids to play football.\n\nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.

Iisalo, 42, is in a unique situation, because the team is headed to the playoffs even though it fired its coach with only nine regular-season games left. That means Iisalo has only a couple of weeks to get his feet under him as an NBA head coach before the playoffs begin April 15 with the play-in tournament.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the Grizzlies' interim coach.\n\nIisalo had an extensive career in Europe before coming to the NBA\n\nIisalo played professionally in his native Finland before becoming a coach in 2014. He was Paris Basketball's coach in 2023-24 and left to become the Grizzlies' lead assistant, his first job in the NBA. He became the first Finnish-born NBA coach when he arrived in Memphis.\n\nIisalo won the EuroCup in 2024 and was named EuroCup coach of the year.\n\nIisalo has been an NBA head coach . . . for one game\n\nIisalo served as acting head coach for one game earlier this season when Jenkins had to miss a game because of a family situation.\n\nWhat could change with Iisalo as Grizzlies' coach?\n\nIisalo came to Memphis with a reputation as an offensive innovator. The Grizzlies' offense has changed in 2024-25, with an emphasis on ball movement and less on the pick-and-roll game that had benefited star Ja Morant during his best moments in the NBA.\n\nWill Iisalo make any major changes now that he's in charge? There isn't much time before the playoffs, but that'll be something to watch in his first few games.\n\nWill Iisalo be a candidate for permanent head coach?\n\nIisalo was a hot commodity when he came to the Grizzlies last offseason, and he has been well-known in NBA circles because of his success in Europe. While expectations for a team in the playoffs with an interim coach will always be low, Iisalo will have an opportunity to prove himself if Memphis can go on a run in the playoffs.\n\nGeneral manager Zach Kleiman will have time to conduct a thorough coaching search that likely will involve outside candidates and coaches with more experience than Iisalo. But the next few weeks could shape the way that search develops.\n\nReach sports writer Jonah Dylan at jonah.dylan@commercialappeal.com or on X @thejonahdylan.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2018/06/17/detroit-pistons-dwane-casey-tom-gores/707280002/", "title": "Detroit Pistons coach Dwane Casey: 'The time is now'", "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — Seated in the courtyard of the Montage Beverly Hills, excitement and energy exudes from every pore of Dwane Casey’s body.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons’ new coach is dressed neatly for the warm Southern California day, wearing shorts and a short-sleeved dress shirt.\n\nThe proper attire for a day of people-watching in tony Beverly Hills.\n\nBut you can tell he can’t wait to don gym attire and start attacking the work of getting his new team better.\n\nIn a 30-minute introductory meeting with the Detroit Free Press on Thursday, Casey wants to make several things clear.\n\nAny ill will toward the Toronto Raptors, who fired Casey last month, evaporated within days.\n\nHis thought process in contemplating the Pistons job offer had nothing to do with the Raptors still owing him $6.5 million for one more year.\n\nHe has quickly formed a bond with Pistons owner Tom Gores.\n\nHe has no issue with the lack of public clarity in the front office.\n\nAnd he thinks a roster built around Blake Griffin, Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson can not only reach the playoffs — it can advance.\n\nEvery point came with a smile.\n\n“The team is well put together as far as the talent level is concerned,” Casey said. “It’s right there as far as making a jump. It’s a process to get there and when we get there, I don’t want our guys to be satisfied with just making the playoffs. We want to get in and do some damage. Not only get to the playoffs, but get in there and advance.\n\n“The time is now.”\n\nModern man\n\nWhen Raptors president Masai Ujiri fired Casey on May 11, it seemed like it was only a matter of time before the veteran head coach would land with the Pistons, who fired Stan Van Gundy earlier that week.\n\nCasey led the Raptors to a franchise-record 59 victories and helped them earn the top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs for the first time.\n\nHe earned coach of the year honors from his coaching peers. He likely will be a finalist for the media’s coach of the year honor, which will be presented later this month.\n\nThere was steady improvement with the Raptors, who hired Casey in 2011. He was 320-238 in seven seasons and is the franchise’s winningest coach. His playoff record was 21-30.\n\nAs an assistant coach, he was credited with devising the defensive scheme that limited LeBron James when the Dallas Mavericks won the 2011 NBA title in six games over the Miami Heat.\n\nBut there were question marks.\n\nThe fans and media complained about his lack of coaching adjustments, and after seeing James and the Cleveland Cavaliers eliminate the Raptors in three straight postseasons, ownership decided it was time for a change.\n\nA source told the Free Press going into his interview that expectations for Casey were “lukewarm.”\n\nNot necessarily because of the Raptors' shortcomings.\n\nPistons vice chairman Arn Tellem, a strong voice in the search, is naturally drawn to finding new, rising talents in his decision-making process.\n\nCasey, 61, is a known commodity.\n\nThe coaching candidates included rising assistants like San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Ime Udoka and former Fab Fiver and Miami Heat assistant Juwan Howard.\n\nTNT analyst and two-time NBA champion Kenny Smith was a wildcard.\n\nMichigan coach John Beilein was the ultimate wildcard.\n\nCasey was first to formally interview with the search team of Tellem, senior adviser Ed Stefanski and ownership representative Bob Wentworth. Former NBA head coaches Jim Lynam and Bernie Bickerstaff advised the process and sat in on the meeting.\n\n“It probably was to his advantage that he went first and he really knocked the ball out of the park,” Stefanski said. “He was excellent on all our questions.”\n\nHe immediately dispelled notions that he was just a retread.\n\nHe came prepared with detailed notes on how he would seek to develop the roster. There were visuals with video.\n\nAnd despite a coaching career that has spanned five decades, he offered examples of being open to adapting with changing times.\n\nCasey told the search team about how he let a young staffer convince him of the benefits of analytics. He laughed when asked about the Raptors staff member.\n\n“He had a master’s degree in something like water science, molecular science or some crazy degree,” Casey said. “I said, ‘Are you crazy? Are you sure you want to get into basketball? You can make a lot of money (in that field).\n\n“He convinced me and showed me analytically that analytics can improve your efficiency offensively and defensively. We incorporated it and our offensive output went out of the roof.”\n\nThe Raptors finished last in assists per game in 2016-17 (18.5 per game). Last season, they finished sixth (24.3 per game).\n\nThe most important trait displayed in the interview?\n\nHe was inspiring — instantly showing how he will earn the respect of the players.\n\n“He commanded the room,” Stefanski said. “What you want is a presence with the players. The other applicants did a good job, but ‘Case,’ having won on the level he’s won, was very, very important to us and the team we have right now.”\n\nPlaying the kids\n\nTellem also received firsthand intel from his son, Michael, an agent for Raptors center Jakob Poeltl.\n\nPoeltl has steadily progressed in his two seasons — despite needing development like any young player.\n\n“From the time he got in, Casey gave (Poeltl) a real role and he got playing time,” Tellem said. “He’s really developed. Poeltl really felt Casey was really committed and cared about his development as a player and that is really important for a young player to feel that a coach is invested in you.”\n\nCasey had a plan for playing time from the outset — a stark contrast to Van Gundy, who was slow to give young players consistent playing time in many cases.\n\nPoeltl anchored a Raptors second unit last season that many considered the best in the league. Aside from veteran swingman C.J. Miles, the unit was comprised of youngsters.\n\n“(Poeltl) has continued to develop,” Tellem said. “He’s become one of the better young centers in the league and he has a very promising future.”\n\nThe Raptors had NBA finals aspirations as the league’s top seed, but it didn’t stop Casey from playing young players.\n\nStefanski, who was a coaching liaison in the Raptors' front office when Casey first arrived in Toronto, jokes that he had to evolve there.\n\nBut the results speak for themselves.\n\n“Casey had a contending club,” Tellem said. “They were fighting to win their division championship and go far in the playoffs and fighting for their seeding and he still gave his second unit — which is all young players — he’s given them opportunity and playing time.”\n\nThe Pistons don’t have a first-round pick in Thursday’s NBA draft, losing their pick to the Los Angeles Clippers because of the January acquisition of Griffin.\n\nTheir bloated payroll is up against the league’s luxury tax threshold, so a high-priced free agent isn’t coming aboard this offseason.\n\nWith health, a roster built around Griffin, Drummond and Jackson could stumble into 45 victories — good enough to be first-round fodder in the playoffs.\n\nBut for greater improvement from last season’s 39-43 mark, young players Stanley Johnson, Luke Kennard and Henry Ellenson must step to the forefront — making their development crucial.\n\nEllenson hardly has played in his first two seasons — a mistake if you listen to the Pistons’ decision makers.\n\n“Young players need to play,” Tellem said. “They need to get a consistent opportunity and giving them six minutes or so in the first half has no bearing on wins and losses.\n\n“Those players need that, they need it consistently.”\n\nMeeting Gores\n\nThe search team was convinced.\n\nBut Gores had some reservations.\n\nHe understood Casey had options — he could sit out a year to spend time with his wife and two young kids to recharge the batteries.\n\nCasey was going to coach again, but he could wait and see what develops next offseason.\n\nAfter an extensive interview with the search team , Casey met with Gores in his Southern California home.\n\nThe meeting lasted six hours.\n\nThey bonded by talking about their families.\n\nThen they talked basketball.\n\nAnd in going through the process Casey ultimately impressed Gores.\n\n“As much as he brings in experience, we really wanted to make sure that he really liked this team,” Gores said. “He knew our players, he liked the team. He really dove in over different parts so I feel like we were very fortunate, but we didn’t say ‘Dwane Casey, coach of the year, let’s just hire him.’ We really vetted it out and I think he did his homework, too.\n\n“He could have taken any job he wanted next year and he could have easily waited a year, but he thought this was special.”\n\nCasey left excited, but the appeal of sitting out a year was still appealing.\n\nHe sought his wife’s opinion.\n\nThe decision was made for Brenda Casey to spend some time with Gores, but with children aged 7 and 10, flight plans were quickly scuttled.\n\nA teleconference was arranged and Gores spoke to the couple.\n\nGores impressed Brenda when he spoke of the impact the Pistons can have on the revitalization of downtown Detroit.\n\n“Making a difference — not only with basketball — but with the city, the inner city,” Casey said. “(Gores) spoke of the revitalization of downtown, the whole commitment wasn’t just about basketball. My wife was big in a lot of work in Toronto with charity work. That in itself was huge for her.\n\n“It’s not just about basketball. We have a bigger commitment, a bigger responsibility than just basketball.”\n\nIt was initially sold as a sales pitch to the wife, but that’s not how Gores sees it.\n\n“I wouldn’t say I had to sell Brenda,” Gores said. “She’s a great adviser and everything happened so fast for them. They were in Toronto for seven years and it came about so fast. After Dwane and I met, he was very convinced and I think she was surprised.\n\n“It was only a few weeks after his time in Toronto so in a way she was verifying. It was a great gut check. She was taking a gut check. He was and it made the process even better.”\n\nCasey and the Pistons hammered out a deal worth $35 million over five seasons with the potential to earn financial incentives, a source told the Free Press.\n\nQuick start\n\nCasey was hired Monday, but he won’t meet with Detroit media until later this week.\n\nWith roughly half of the roster training in Southern California, he spent a good part of the week meeting players.\n\nGriffin, Jackson and Drummond gathered at Gores’ home Tuesday evening for an initial meeting.\n\nHe watched Griffin, Johnson and Kennard workout Thursday.\n\nHe has many ideas. He wants to continue the growth that started in Toronto. There will be an emphasis on ball movement, playing fast and attacking from the weak side.\n\nHe said you can expect to see fewer post-ups.\n\nAnd he isn’t spending a lot of time looking back — although he did run into some of his former Raptors players at UCLA this week.\n\n“We got a group of tremendous young men,” Casey said. “Well-rounded, full of character, very thoughtful, very intelligent. That’s what struck me at first. At my first introduction, the first thing I said is you guys aren’t going to trust me, you don’t know me, but I want to get to know you. I have to earn your trust, I have to earn your respect and that’s what I plan on doing.\n\n“You need that character and depth when you have adversity.”\n\nThe Pistons and Gores have taken heat for the slow pace of the search. The Pistons' regular season ended April 11. Van Gundy was fired on May 7. Casey was hired June 11.\n\nThe slow pace also underlines the reshaping of the front office, which was necessary since Van Gundy also served as president of basketball operations. (Stefanski has been the only hire on that front.)\n\nStill, it's hard to see a process in which Casey would not have emerged as a top coaching candidate — no matter who is working in the front office.\n\nAnd if the Pistons had made a move shortly after the season, they might have put a coach in place before Casey was available.\n\nInstead, the organization feels fortunate to have the coach of the year prowling the sidelines at Little Caesars Arena next season.\n\n“We never thought in our wildest dreams that Casey would be available,” Tellem said. “When Tom was going through that process, deciding whether Stan would stay or not, no one anticipated that Casey was going to be out there. It was extremely fortuitous that by waiting and going through the extended process in making a decision — a difficult one for Tom — that Casey did become available.”\n\nFollow Vince Ellis on Twitter @vincent_ellis56.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/sec/2022/11/10/former-florida-gator-basketball-guard-major-parker-dies-44/8323953001/", "title": "Former Florida Gator basketball guard Major Parker died last week", "text": "Major Parker, a starter on Florida's 2000 Final Four team and member of former head coach Billy Donovan's first recruiting class, died last week at the age of 44.\n\nParker had a serious heart attack a few years ago that left him in a coma for three weeks and limited his heart function.

This is after Vogel said he had \"full support\" from Suns team owner Mat Ishbia going into Game 4 against the Timberwolves, which they lost at home to end their season.\n\nThe Suns had extensive talks for days in evaluating the team and determining whether to keep or fire Vogel, who has been a head coach with four different NBA teams.\n\nVogel replaced Monty Williams, who was fired after leading the Suns to three consecutive playoff appearances as they reached the finals in 2021. Vogel signed a five-year, $31 million deal with the Suns last summer. The Suns won a franchise-best 64 games in the 2021-22 season and made a third consecutive trip to the postseason last year, but never returned to the finals.\n\nThey were bounced from the playoffs in the second round in 2022 and 2023, losing the elimination games in embarrassing fashion at home to Dallas in Game 7 in 2022 and eventual NBA champion Denver in Game 6 in 2023.\n\nThat factored in the Suns firing Williams a few months into Ishbia's tenure as team owner and hiring Vogel, who coached the Lakers to the 2019-20 title. The billionaire mortgage lender bought the Suns and WNBA's Phoenix Mercury for a record $4 billion in February 2023.\n\nWith Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, the Suns were viewed as having tremendous offensive firepower.

There seemed to be a disconnect between the players and Vogel at various times, but the Suns won seven of their last 10 games of the regular season and entered the postseason with momentum.\n\nThen they were swept by the Timberwolves, a team the Suns went 3-0 against in the regular season with the final victory coming at Minneapolis in the final regular season game.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2024/06/30/j-b-bickerstaff-detroit-pistons-head-coach-cavs/74261326007/", "title": "J.B.

Bickerstaff, league sources confirmed to the Free Press on Sunday morning. The deal is for five years, with a team option for the fifth season.\n\nBickerstaff, 45, previously was the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2020-24, leading them to the first round of the playoffs in 2023 (51-31 record) and the second round last season (48-34). He was fired in May after the banged-up Cavs were eliminated from the postseason by Boston in five games, with leadership wanting a fresh voice and alternative ideas. The Cavs last week hired Kenny Atkinson to replace Bickerstaff.\n\nBickerstaff had a 170-159 record (.517 win percentage) after taking over as interim coach late in the 2019-20 season after former Michigan head coach John Beilein quit. Bickerstaff had his \"interim\" title removed in the summer of 2020.\n\nYoung Cavs players Evan Mobley (third pick in 2021) and 2019 lottery pick Darius Garland both made strides under Bickerstaff's tutelage, with Garland making his first All-Star appearance in 2022.\n\nBickerstaff checks multiple boxes the Pistons wanted in their next head coach, with a track record in player development and organizing and positioning young teams for success.\n\n\"I think you have to have a teacher who can teach the fundamentals of the game, and I don’t mean dribbling and passing,\" team president Trajan Langdon said after his introductory news conference June 21. \"I mean defensive X-outs, box outs and hold these things accountable to those things that impact winning every day. And being able to communicate the 'why' about it, I think that’s essential for this generation of player. You can’t just tell them what to do and expect them just to do it. You have to communicate the 'why' behind it and they have to be aware of how that communication is being received. That’s what we’re all looking for in a head coach, which isn’t always easy, but it’s something we’ll be looking for.\"\n\nThe Pistons have a plethora of former high draft picks in need of molding, including the No. 5 overall pick in Wednesday's draft, Ron Holland, along with franchise leader Cade Cunningham, second-year forward Ausar Thompson, third-year center Jalen Duren and third-year guard Jaden Ivey.\n\nThe Pistons enter free agency Sunday at 6 p.m. with around $50 million in cap space.\n\nThe Pistons fired former coach Monty Williams on June 19, one year into his six-year contract following a failed 14-68 season. The organization has undergone a reset this offseason, with Langdon taking over control of the front office and hiring new staff.\n\nBickerstaff was one of four known candidates the Pistons were after, including New Orleans Pelicans assistant James Borrego, Dallas Mavericks assistant Sean Sweeney and Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Micah Nori — the latter two were both former Pistons assistants under Dwane Casey. Borrego, who worked with Langdon last season, reportedly pulled his name out of consideration Saturday.\n\nPrior to Cleveland, Bickerstaff was the head coach of the Memphis Grizzlies from 2017-19, where he went 48-97. He is the son of former NBA head coach Bernie Bickerstaff, and has previously been an assistant with the Charlotte Bobcats, Minnesota Timberwolves and Houston Rockets, where he briefly served as interim head coach, going 37-34 in 2015-16.\n\nJ.B.

The Denver Nuggets dismissed head coach Michael Malone with just three games remaining.\n\nConsider this: The coaches who won NBA championships in 2019 (Nick Nurse, then with the Toronto Raptors), 2020 (Frank Vogel, then with the Los Angeles Lakers), 2021 (Mike Budenholzer, then with the Milwaukee Bucks) and 2023 (Malone) are no longer with that team.\n\nIt seems unlikely another coach will be fired before the regular season ends, but who knows.\n\nRegardless, there is the possibility other coaches won’t return to the same team next season. Don’t forget, the Sacramento Kings have an interim coach and will be looking for a permanent hire.\n\nLet’s look at other coaches who are on the hot seat:\n\nNBA coaches on the hot seat\n\nWillie Green, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nThe Pelicans have been derailed by injuries. That's not Green's fault. He made the Pelicans a better team, going 36-46 in 2021-22, 42-40 in 2022-23 and 49-33 last season. But this season, they are 21-57 with the fourth-worst record in the league. Green’s future also depends on the future of the front office, led by David Griffin. If Griffin doesn’t return, a new head of basketball operations likely would select a new head coach.\n\nChris Finch, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nFinch is a solid coach who led the Timberwolves to 56 victories and the Western Conference finals last season. However, they won’t reach last season’s win total and they are in a tight race to stay out of the play-in tournament. Playoff success could determine Finch’s future with the team. Also, he was not president of basketball operations Tim Connelly’s hire, and the Timberwolves are about to change owners with a group led by Alex Rodriguez and Marc Lore buying the team from Glen Taylor.\n\nMike Budenholzer, Phoenix Suns\n\nWould the Phoenix Suns really fire three coaches in as many seasons? With the way owner Mat Ishbia has handled Phoenix’s lack of deep playoff runs, anything is in play. Budenholzer was brought in to improve the team after former coach Frank Vogel’s squad got swept in the first round of last year’s playoffs. But with four games remaining in the season, Budenholzer’s Suns have failed to make the Kevin Durant-Devin Booker-Bradley Beal experiment work, are 14 victories behind last season’s record and — sitting 2½ games out of the play-in picture — are dangerously close to crashing out in spectacular fashion.\n\nNick Nurse, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nAfter acquiring Paul George in the offseason, the Sixers came in with massive expectations that were quickly derailed because of injuries. Joel Embiid played just 19 games, George — whose play declined significantly when he was on the court, anyway — appeared in 41 games and Tyrese Maxey played 52 games. The three played together just 15 times, though Philadelphia went just 7-8 in those contests. George and Embiid are very early in onerous contracts that could complicate next season, and beyond.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2024/06/19/detroit-pistons-fire-monty-williams-one-season/73282485007/", "title": "Pistons fire Monty Williams: Why Detroit made the move after one year", "text": "The Detroit Pistons fired head coach Monty Williams on Wednesday, bringing a stunning end to a marriage that began with much fanfare last May.\n\nWilliams signed a historic six-year, $78.5 million contract with incentives that were the biggest for a head coach in NBA history at the time (since surpassed by Gregg Popovich and Erik Spoelstra), and barely made it to the one-year mark.\n\nPistons owner Tom Gores made the determination to part with Williams late Tuesday, per team sources, and new president of basketball operations Trajan Langdon delivered the news to Williams on Wednesday morning. The Pistons hired Langdon in late May to oversee the club's direction, replacing general manager Troy Weaver as the organization's top basketball decision-maker.\n\n“Decisions like these are difficult to make, and I want to thank Monty for his hard work and dedication,” Pistons owner Tom Gores said in a statement Wednesday. “Coaching has many dynamic challenges that emerge during a season and Monty always handled those with grace. However, after reviewing our performance carefully and assessing our current position as an organization, we will chart a new course moving forward.\n\n“I have great respect for Monty as a coach and as a person and I am certain he will be successful in his future endeavors,” Gores continued. “I sincerely wish him and his family the very best.”\n\nFAKE TRADE TO FIX THE PISTONS: Detroit Pistons' NBA draft strategy: 3 trades that make sense with No. 5 pick\n\nAfter taking over, Langdon had sit-downs with Williams and the rest of Detroit's staff. The question that needed to be answered: Is Williams the right person to lead the rebuild? Cracks in the partnership began to show early last season, as the Pistons were mired in an NBA single-season record 28-game losing streak that forced questions about Williams' leadership and game management.\n\nThere was talk of giving Williams another year to figure things out, but the organization wanted to make a final decision before next week's draft and the bulk of the team's free agency negotiations. Talks accelerated after the Boston Celtics won the NBA Finals on Monday, and Langdon ultimately wasn't convinced that Williams was the right coach for the next five years and felt that a young Pistons team needed a new voice.\n\nLangdon wants to prioritize player development, as evidenced by last week's hire of former New Orleans Pelicans assistant coach and shooting guru Fred Vinson. Williams also has a relationship with Vinson, as he was formerly on Williams' staff in New Orleans. Williams' exit days after Vinson's hire illustrates the lack of confidence in Williams' ability to manage an inexperienced roster.\n\nTom Gores now must find his sixth head coach since taking ownership in 2011, as Williams becomes the third under Gores to lose his job without making it past two seasons (Lawrence Frank and Maurice Cheeks; Stan Van Gundy lasted four seasons and Dwane Casey five).\n\n“We are unwavering in our commitment to bring a championship-caliber team to Detroit,” Gores said in Wednesday's release. “We will be diligent and swift in our search for a new head coach to lead our exciting young core of players and will continue our vision towards building a best-in-class front office that will help us achieve sustainable success.”\n\nOwnership's confidence that Williams was the right fit for the team dissolved amid a 2-29 start to the season. His usage of Jaden Ivey early in the season — opting to bring the second-year guard off the bench behind the since-waived Killian Hayes — and refusal to stagger Ivey with Cunningham are among several decisions that confused team officials.\n\n\"We require change,\" Gores told local media members in December. \"We’re not doing well. As far as where we’re going in getting this set of players and flexibility and all that stuff, I think that stuff and the work to get there is still there. But we have to assess what’s not working here. I’m down to Monty and I talking about rotations. I don’t normally do that.\"\n\nHOW DO THE FANS FEEL? Detroit Pistons fans happy to move on from Monty Williams after 'very bad' first season\n\nIn January, Williams acknowledged he was questioned during an organizational meeting about his handling of Ivey, and reluctance to use him as a primary ball-handler. It was a peek into the disconnect between the coach and the front office/ownership that has now culminated with his dismissal.\n\nWilliams' departure is the first of many decisions Detroit's new front office will navigate over the next few weeks. The first round of the draft is Wednesday and free agency will kick off the following week, on June 30.\n\nMake \"The Pistons Pulse\" your go-to Detroit Pistons podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify) or watch live/on demand on YouTube.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/19"}]}

Wade: These are the states where abortion rights are still ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to include the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday, but more than a dozen states have passed laws that will continue to protect a woman’s ability to access an abortion.\n\nAn analysis by the Guttmacher Institute finds 22 states have laws in place to limit abortions, including 13 that have so-called “trigger bans” in place that almost immediately enact near-total bans on abortion now that Roe has been struck down.\n\nStill, there are 16 states that protect abortion access under state law, either by guaranteeing the right to get an abortion up to a certain point in pregnancy or – in just four states and Washington, DC – protecting the right at any stage of pregnancy, according to Guttmacher.\n\nSome state officials have reinforced their commitment to providing a haven for abortion-seekers and are bracing for the potential influx of abortion seekers from neighboring states with restrictive laws.\n\nThese are the states with laws in place to protect abortion rights in the post-Roe era.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe right to obtain an abortion in California is protected until the fetus is considered viable and in cases where the procedure is necessary to save the patient’s life or health, according to the state’s health and safety code.\n\nDemonstrators protest in Los Angeles on Tuesday, March 3, 2022. Ringo H.W. Chiu/AP\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also signed legislation in March that removed some financial barriers to abortion services. Under the law, insurance providers or health insurance plans are banned from requiring cost-sharing payments such as deductibles, coinsurance or copayments for abortions or abortion-related care. The law applies to plans issued after January 1, 2023. For patients with high deductible plans, they would need to meet their deductible before the cost-sharing prohibition applies.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, signed a bill into law in April that guarantees a pregnant woman’s right to “have an abortion and to make decisions about how to exercise that right” and bans public entities from depriving people of that right. The law does not define a time or stage of pregnancy after which abortions can no longer be performed.\n\nThe law also states that “a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent or derivative rights” under state law.\n\nConnecticut\n\nConnecticut law protects the right to receive an abortion until the fetus becomes viable. After that point, the procedure is only allowed to protect the life or health of the pregnant woman. Minors under the age of 16 are required to get counseling before consenting to an abortion, except in the case of a medical emergency.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Ned Lamont also recently signed a bill into law designed to shield from lawsuits medical providers who perform abortions and out-of-state patients who travel to the state to receive the procedure. In part, it blocks state agencies from assisting in interstate investigations or prosecutions that would hold someone civilly or criminally liable for undergoing or assisting an abortion.\n\nThe law also allows people who have “had a judgment entered against them” for receiving or assisting in an abortion to obtain legal damages.\n\nDelaware\n\nIn Delaware, physicians can legally terminate a pregnancy up until the point the fetus becomes viable, after which abortions are banned unless the procedure is essential to protect the pregnant woman’s life or health. Post-viability abortions are also allowed if a medical provider detects a “fetal anomaly for which there is not a reasonable likelihood of the fetus’s sustained survival outside the uterus without extraordinary medical measures,” according to Delaware state code.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback OB-GYN explains the far-reaching effects of Roe ruling 03:34 - Source: CNN OB-GYN explains the far-reaching effects of Roe ruling 03:34\n\nHawaii\n\nIn Hawaii, abortion is legal before a fetus is considered viable, and state law says the state cannot “deny or interfere with a female’s right to choose or obtain an abortion of a nonviable fetus” or an abortion that would protect the life or health of the patient.\n\nIllinois\n\nIn 2019, Illinois passed a law that established the fundamental right to reproductive care, including abortion, and legalized abortions up until the point a fetus is deemed to be viable. After that, the procedure is only legally protected when “the abortion is necessary to protect the life or health of the patient.”\n\nProtestors held a rally in Chicago on May 3 following the leak of a Supreme Court draft that indicated the Supreme Court may overturn Roe v. Wade. Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Chicago Sun-Times/AP\n\nUnder the law, a fertilized egg, embryo or fetus does not have protected individual rights.\n\nThe statute also requires health insurance plans that provide pregnancy-related coverage to also provide abortion coverage and stipulates that out-of-pocket costs for abortions cannot be higher than those costs for pregnancy care under the same plan.\n\nMaine\n\nAbortions are legal in Maine until the fetus is considered viable, though there are additional limitations on minors. A post-viability abortion is legal if the life or health of the pregnant person is at risk.\n\nIf an abortion procedure results in a live birth, however, the law requires that all reasonable efforts are made to preserve the baby’s life. Violation of the law “shall subject the responsible party or parties to Maine law governing homicide, manslaughter and civil liability for wrongful death and medical malpractice,” according to Maine’s Health and Welfare statutes.\n\nIn addition to its existing statute protecting pre-viability abortions, Maine also passed two laws in 2019 that allowed physician assistants and certain highly trained nurses to perform the procedure and required health insurance plans that cover pregnancy care to also cover abortion.\n\nMaryland\n\nIn Maryland, abortions must be performed by licensed physicians and are legally protected up until the fetus is deemed viable. After viability is determined, an abortion can only be provided if it would protect the life or health of the pregnant person or in cases where the fetus is “affected by genetic defect or serious deformity or abnormality,” according to the state’s health code.\n\nIn April, Maryland’s Democratic-controlled General Assembly overrode a veto from Republican Gov. Larry Hogan and passed a bill that will expand the types of health care professionals that can perform abortions and set up a program to train and diversify abortion providers. The bill, which will go into effect July 1, also requires most health insurance providers to cover abortion services.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Woman says the hardest part of aborting her baby was the assumption that she didn't want her baby 03:16 - Source: CNN Woman says the hardest part of aborting her baby was the assumption that she didn't want her baby 03:16\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMassachusetts amended its state law in 2020 to allow abortions up to 24 weeks. The procedure can be performed by a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner or nurse midwife. If the pregnancy has reached 24 weeks or more, the law allows only physicians to carry out abortions to save the patient’s life or protect their mental or physical health. Exceptions are also provided if a “lethal fetal anomaly” is detected or “the fetus is incompatible with sustained life outside the uterus,” the law states.\n\nNevada\n\nIn a 1990 general election referendum, voters in Nevada approved a law that allows a physician to perform an abortion up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy. Because the statute was approved by a referendum vote, it cannot be changed through legislative amendment or appeal, according to the state’s revised statutes.\n\nAfter 24 weeks, abortions may only be carried out to preserve the life or health of the pregnant woman. In cases where the physician believes there is a chance the fetus could survive outside of the womb, the abortion must be performed in a licensed hospital, the law states.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nThe right to abortion is protected at all stages of pregnancy in New Jersey. A bill signed into law in January codified the right to reproductive choice, including abortion, in the state.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York state passed a law in 2019 to preserve access to abortions in the event that Roe v. Wade was struck down. Under the statute, abortions can be legally performed up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy for any reason and can be performed after that if the fetus is no longer viable or the patient’s life or health is at risk.\n\nThe 2019 law also removed abortion from the state’s criminal code, shielding medical providers from being criminally prosecuted for providing an abortion.\n\nOregon\n\nIn 2017, legislators in Oregon passed a bill which said a public body cannot deprive a person of the choice to receive an abortion or interfere with a medical professional providing the service. The law does not define a time or period after which abortions can longer be performed.\n\nIt also required that health insurance plans offered in the state must provide coverage for abortion services, with some religious exceptions.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRhode Island codified abortion protections in the state when its governor signed a bill into law in 2019 that banned the state from restricting abortions before the fetus is considered viable and prohibited the procedure after viability except when the health or life of the patient is at risk.\n\nThe bill also repealed a measure requiring medical providers to notify the husbands of married women before performing the procedure.\n\nVermont\n\nVermont passed a law in 2019 that recognized “the fundamental right of every individual who becomes pregnant” to have an abortion and barred government entities from infringing upon that right. The law does not limit abortions at any time during pregnancy.\n\nWashington\n\nVoters in Washington’s 1991 general election narrowly approved a measure that declared a woman’s right to receive an abortion before the fetus is deemed viable and provided exceptions in cases where the procedure would protect the life or health of the woman.\n\nIn March, the state legislature amended the law’s language to ensure that people are guaranteed access to reproductive rights, including abortion, regardless of gender identity, allowing the statute to apply to transgender and nonbinary people. The new law takes effect June 9.\n\nThe state also requires state-regulated health plans, including college student plans, to cover abortion services if they also cover pregnancy services.\n\nWashington, DC\n\nThe right to receive an abortion at any stage of pregnancy is protected under Washington, DC, law. The statute prohibits the district from denying or interfering with a person’s right to choose to get an abortion and does not provide a limit on the protection past a certain phase of pregnancy.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/08/26/two-people-reported-dead-following-crash-on-i-81-near-hagerstown-maryland/65457590007/", "title": "Three Clear Spring students dead in Thursday I-81 crash; vigil Friday", "text": "Just as the Clear Spring community was gathering Friday night to share their sadness and grief over the deaths of two of their classmates killed in a crash Thursday night on Interstate 81, a third student succumbed to injuries he suffered in the crash.\n\nKannon Shives, 16, of Clear Spring was \"declared deceased\" by hospital personnel shortly after 6 p.m. Friday at R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, Maryland State Police spokesperson Elena Russo confirmed.\n\nThe Fellowship of Christian Athletes had organized a community gathering at the Clear Spring High School stadium to \"process through\" the loss of Tyler Josenhans, 17, of Hagerstown, and Clayton Knode, 16, of Clear Spring, whom Maryland State Police had earlier identified.\n\nJosenhans was the driver of the Lexus sedan, and Knode was the right rear passenger.

Wade may have been offered a glimpse of what’s to come when Politico revealed a draft Supreme Court opinion Monday night that would upend the landmark abortion rights case.\n\nThough the unearthing of the draft has no immediate effect on abortion access, the preliminary opinion, which was confirmed to be authentic by the court, would overturn Roe v. Wade if a majority of justices decided to join, leaving state legislators to weigh their own abortion policies.\n\nThe 1973 Roe v. Wade court decision affirmed the right to receive an abortion under the 14th Amendment, ruling that abortions were constitutionally protected up until about 23 weeks when a fetus could be able to live outside the womb.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban, setting the court up to examine decades of precedent set by Roe. Some state legislatures have enacted policies to increase abortion access, including in California, which passed a law in March to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for abortion services covered by health plans, and in Colorado, where Democratic lawmakers codified the right to receive an abortion in the state.\n\nBut many Republican-led state legislatures have already moved to limit abortion access and others are poised to enforce restrictive laws that have remained unenforced since Roe was passed. In total, an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute finds that 23 states have laws aiming to limit abortion access, including some states that have multiple provisions in place.\n\nStates including Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia had abortion restrictions before the Roe ruling that have never been removed. Others have approved near-total bans or laws prohibiting abortion after a certain number of weeks – but many of them have been blocked by courts, including those in Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina.\n\nLegislators in 13 states have passed so-called “trigger laws,” which are bans designed to go into effect if Roe is overturned. In some cases, the law requires an official such as an attorney general to certify that Roe has been struck down before the law can take effect.\n\nThese are the states with “trigger laws” poised to go into effect almost immediately if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas has a law on the books that would ban nearly all abortions in the event that Roe is overturned, except for in the case of a life-threatening medical emergency. A medical provider who violates the law could face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $100,000 or both.\n\nLast year, a federal judge blocked another bill passed by state legislators which aimed to block nearly all abortions and made no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho’s trigger ban would make providing abortions a felony punishable by up to five years in prison if Roe is struck down. Exceptions are provided to prevent the death of the pregnant person or in the case of rape or incest.\n\nIn March, Idaho legislators passed a separate bill modeled after Texas’ restrictive law, which prohibits abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected, which can happen as early as six weeks. The law also allows family members of the fetus to sue the medical provider who performed the procedure.\n\nThe ban was temporarily blocked by the state Supreme Court last month after abortion providers challenged it in a lawsuit.\n\nKentucky\n\nKentucky’s legislature passed a bill in 2019 which would ban abortions and make performing them a felony offense if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. Very limited exceptions would be provided to prevent the death or serious injury of the person giving birth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLouisiana has a law in place that would ban a medical provider from performing an abortion procedure or providing drugs intended to induce an abortion in the case that Roe is overturned. The ban would not apply to life-threatening or serious medical emergencies, but requires the physician makes “reasonable medical efforts” to preserve the life of the adult and the fetus.\n\nMississippi\n\nMississippi law states that within 10 days of the state attorney general confirming Roe has been overturned, abortions are prohibited in the state. Limited exceptions are provided in cases of rape or when the procedure would preserve the mother’s life.\n\nMississippi passed a separate 15-week abortion ban in 2018, which is the source of the case currently in front of the Supreme Court. The court is expected to announce its decision in June, but a draft opinion revealed by Politico suggests a majority of the justices may be poised to strike down Roe.\n\nMissouri\n\nMissouri approved a law in 2019 that would make it a felony for medical providers to perform or induce an abortion except in cases of medical emergencies if Roe is struck down.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nA law approved by the North Dakota legislature in 2007 would ban abortion and make it a felony to perform the procedure except in cases when it would save the life of the mother. The law would go into effect “as a result of new decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States” that would make the provision constitutional.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill last month that would make performing abortions illegal in the state, only allowing exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person. The measure makes performing an abortion or attempting to perform one a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both.\n\nA second bill signed into law last week sets a timeline for provisions to go into effect, depending on how the Supreme Court rules.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSouth Dakota has had a trigger ban on the books since 2005, when a law was passed to set up an almost outright ban on abortions in the event that Roe is overturned. The law would make it illegal to perform an abortion except in life-threatening medical emergencies and would become effective “on the date states are recognized by the United States Supreme Court to have the authority to prohibit abortion at all stages of pregnancy.”\n\nTennessee\n\nTennessee law contains a provision that would prohibit all abortions except those that would prevent the death of the mother and would go into effect 30 days after Roe is struck down. Medical providers could be charged with a felony for violating the law.\n\nTexas\n\nTexas’ so-called trigger ban was signed into law in June 2021 and would make abortions illegal unless the pregnant person’s life is threatened or they are at risk of serious injury. The law would go into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issues a judgment overruling Roe.\n\nUtah\n\nUtah passed a law in May 2020 banning almost all abortions if Roe is overturned. Exceptions include cases of rape or incest, detection of severe birth defects, or prevention of the death or serious injury of the person giving birth. Performing an abortion in violation of the law is a second-degree felony.\n\nWyoming\n\nSigned into law last month, Wyoming’s bill added a provision that would make it illegal to perform an abortion if Roe is overturned, with extremely limited exceptions for cases of sexual assault, incest, or the risk of death or severe injury to the person giving birth.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2025/01/04/i-70-shut-down-west-of-manhattan-as-freezing-rain-turns-roads-to-ice/77458499007/", "title": "LIVE BLOG: Topeka nears record-high for snowfall in one day", "text": "The Capital-Journal\n\nTopeka Capital-Journal\n\nTopeka is in a blizzard warning until midnight Sunday, with daytime snow accumulation of 9 to 13 inches possible.\n\nParts of Topeka and Shawnee County started seeing sleet early Saturday afternoon, with forecasters predicting the Topeka area could accumulate up to a foot of snow before the blizzard-like conditions end Monday morning.

The closure was announced on the department's KanDrive website and app, which said the closure was due to \"icy roads.\"\n\nAt 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Trooper Ben Gardner, of the Kansas Highway Patrol, posted on his X account that there were already a \"significant number of crashes\" in the area.\n\n\"These incidents include passenger cars, semi-truck rollovers, and even a fire truck that rolled over — thankfully, the first responders are okay,\" Gardner said.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2019/06/19/lebanon-man-sentenced-prison-triple-fatal-dui-crash/1498551001/", "title": "Lebanon man sentenced to 19 years in prison for triple-fatal DUI crash", "text": "A 32-year-old man was sentenced Wednesday to 19 years in prison for causing the death of his girlfriend and two of his co-workers while driving drunk on Highway 22 near Gates.\n\nDavid Trimble, of Lebanon, previously pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree manslaughter and DUI.\n\nAccording to police records, his blood-alcohol content was 0.27 percent — more than three times the legal limit— following the crash.\n\nThe night of the Oct. 1 crash, Trimble was driving four people in a silver 2004 GMC Envoy after spending the day driving from Sweet Home, through the Willamette National Forest, to Highway 22 using backroads.\n\nWith him were his girlfriend, Amanda Salmon, 23, his brother, Brandon Mims, 34, and two of his Walmart co-workers, Daniel O'Neal, 24, of Foster, and Stacie Williams, 41, of Ocala, Florida.\n\nThroughout the day, Trimble drank \"copious amounts of alcohol,\" according to court records, and later said he didn't remember anything after stopping for lunch near Green Peter Reservoir.\n\nWitnesses reported spotting Trimble driving erratically and speeding at about 90 mph in a 55 mph zone.\n\nAs Trimble drove back to Salem along Highway 22, he veered off the road. The SUV struck several trees before the vehicle's roof was ripped off and it came to rest in a ditch.\n\nAccording to Oregon State Police, two occupants were ejected from the SUV and died at the scene. Another person was found unresponsive inside the vehicle and also was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nMims and Trimble, the only two wearing seatbelts, were seriously injured, according to court records.\n\nMims was transported to the hospital with life-threatening injuries including a broken vertebra, fractured spleen, broken arm and bowel injuries.\n\nAlcohol, speed investigated\n\nShortly after the incident, police announced they were investigating alcohol and speed as possible causes of the crash.\n\nThe vehicle's event data recorder put the vehicle speed at 72 mph.\n\nInvestigators found an empty hard lemonade can underneath the gas pedal in Trimble's vehicle. A half-empty bottle of vodka was also found on the rear floorboard.\n\nAccording to police records, a blue metal water bottle fell out Trimble's vehicle. The fluid leaking out of the bottle smelled of fruit and alcohol.\n\nState police's investigation later revealed that Trumble allegedly routinely drinks alcohol while driving and bragged in the past about never getting caught. Andrew Salmon, Amanda's brother, told police that Trimble also boasted about getting in several previous crashes while intoxicated.\n\n\"I trusted this guy with my sister,\" he said. \"I told him not to drink and drive and he did it anyway.\"\n\nAndrew Salmon and more than a dozen of the victims' family members filled up Marion County Judge Courtland Geyer's courtroom during Wednesday's sentencing.\n\nMost asked for the longest possible sentence.\n\n\"I truly believe he has no remorse ... he's bragged about (drunk driving) before,\" Andrew Salmon said.\n\nSupport local journalism: Get the latest on crime and criminal justice news. Become a Statesman Journal subscriber and get unlimited digital access to stories that matter.\n\nState agrees to limit sentence\n\nProsecutor Melodie Dickey argued for a prison sentence of 25 years with a lifetime driver's license revocation.\n\nAlthough Trimble could've faced more than 30 years in prison, the state agreed to cap its sentencing recommendation to 25 years in exchange for his guilty plea.\n\nShe said although Trimble had no prior criminal convictions, he pleaded no contest to an assault or battery charge in Florida in 2014.\n\nThree months before the crash, Trimble came out of \"nowhere\" while riding his bicycle in Lebanon and collided with a car exiting a parking lot, according to a witness. He admitted to police that he drank two-thirds of a bottle of vodka, which he typically consumed on his days off.\n\nHe was not arrested, but the officer believed he had probable cause for a DUI.\n\nCompassion returned: Inmates repay former prison officer in his hour of need\n\nDefense attorney Olcott Thompson said Trimble is an alcoholic who was already planning to start alcohol treatment before the crash.\n\n\"There is no way to estimate the worth of the three people who were killed,\" Thompson said. \"No value can be placed on their lives. Their lives were invaluable. There is no way to eliminate the pain and loss the families feel.\"\n\nHe argued for a sentenced of 15 years.\n\n\"By that time Mr. Trimble will either have learned his lesson (he actually already has) or not,\" Thompson said. \"Further incarceration will not assist with learning that lesson.\"\n\nFamily asks for justice\n\nFor more than an hour, friends and family members of the victims stood up and spoke in court, voicing their hatred, forgiveness and sadness to Trimble and asking Geyer for justice.\n\nDickey played a video with photos of both O'Neal and Salmon as infants, opening presents at Christmas, graduating high school, smiling at the Coast, riding roller coasters and snapping photos in the snow. Then she played a video of Salmon's mother, Buffy Dove, walking through a cemetery.\n\nDove addressed Trimble in the video, leading him to her daughter's gravesite.\n\n\"There you go,\" she said. \"There's your handiwork ... I wanted you to see.\"\n\nDove said she can't bear to walk past her daughter's room or look at her photo.\n\n\"You took my baby girl away, my only daughter,\" she said. \"I'll never get to talk to her again or hear her voice again.\"\n\nFamily described Salmon as loving, brave and kind. The Central High School graduate and Linn-Benton Community College student worked in an assisted living facility, loved baking and crafts and wanted to open an animal sanctuary.\n\nTrimble spent much of the sentencing in tears. When Geyer asked if he wanted to address the court, he stood and apologized to the families.\n\n\"May the families find closure,\" Trimble said. \"May the spirits rest in peace.\"\n\nJoy Stackhouse said the crash severely mangled her son, Daniel O'Neal, to the point that they could not have a viewing. Her last image is of him draped in a body bag.\n\n\"As a mother, I couldn't hold his hand for the last time or kiss him goodbye,\" she said.\n\nO'Neal was a hard-working Walmart employee looking to rise in the ranks. He loved camping, fishing, music, drawing and hiking.\n\n\"He was a son and a brother,\" his grandmother Lana Stackhouse said. \"A good, hard-working man who wanted children of his own.\"\n\nBut in a flash, he was taken from them. She urged Trimble to take full responsibility for all three of the lives he took.\n\nFamily plans to turn to advocacy\n\nAfter the sentencing, she said her family was working to advocate against drunk driving and help victims.\n\n\"Cases like this mustn't be taken lightly,\" Joy Stackhouse said.\n\nGeyer said by pleading guilty, Trimble had taken a step toward accepting fault for his actions.\n\n\"You have taken a measure of accountability but that doesn't mean you can escape responsibility,\" he said.\n\nGeyer said Trimble didn't think or care about anyone but himself on Oct. 1.\n\nAnd, he added, despite the incident being referred to as a crash, an accident, a mistake, it was no accident.\n\nThe extremely high amount of alcohol in Trimble's system, paired with his reckless and indifferent choice to get behind the wheel of a vehicle, meant he caused the death of three people and left their families with emptiness and grief.\n\nGeyer said he wasn't sure a lengthy prison term would deter others from driving while intoxicated.\n\n\"I hope that I am wrong but I have just seen this too many times,\" he said. \"I hope your time in prison will stop at least one person from drinking and driving.\"\n\nFor questions, comments and news tips, email reporter Whitney Woodworth at wmwoodwort@statesmanjournal.com, call 503-399-6884 or follow on Twitter @wmwoodworth", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/24/live-updates-donald-trump-north-carolina-california-trip/77911002007/", "title": "Hegseth confirmed; Trump tours fire damage in LA", "text": "The Senate narrowly confirmed Pete Hegseth as secretary of Defense late Friday night, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.\n\nHegseth, who had been beset by allegations of sexual assault, public drinking and intoxication, and abusive treatment of women, secured the support of all but three Republicans to win confirmation with a 51-50 vote.\n\nSens.

They embraced and spoke to the media together.\n\n“We’re gonna need your support, we’re gonna need your help,” Newsom said. “You were there for us during COVID, I don’t forget that, and I have all the expectations that we’ll be able to work together.”\n\n“We’re gonna get it done,” Trump responded, adding: “We’ll get it worked out, ok?”\n\nTrump noted that California will need a lot of federal help.

DOJ fights judge\n\nWASHINGTON – After President Donald Trump granted clemency to Oath Keepers militia founder Stewart Rhodes for his Jan. 6-related conviction, a federal judge ordered Rhodes on Friday to stay away from the U.S. Capitol now that he is out of prison.\n\nWithin hours, the Justice Department – which under the Biden administration had secured Rhodes' 2022 conviction – argued that Judge Amit Mehta didn't have the authority to issue that restriction. Trump commuted Rhodes' 18-year sentence Monday along with the sentences of 13 other defendants. He also pardoned roughly 1,500 defendants who faced Jan. 6-related charges.\n\nRhodes left a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, on Tuesday and by Wednesday, he had visited Capitol Hill. Mehta issued his brief order, which also applied to seven other defendants whose sentences were commuted Monday, following that visit.\n\nThe order states that all eight defendants need Mehta's permission to visit the Capitol in particular as well as Washington, D.C. in general.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department said in its motion that the commutation of Rhodes' sentence means he is no longer subject to the terms of probation or a supervised release from prison.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Quite a day': Devastated Pacific Palisades neighborhood abuzz ahead of Trump visit\n\nLOS ANGELES – Activity buzzed outside Fire Station No. 69 in the Pacific Palisades late Friday morning in anticipation of President Trump’s arrival to inspect the wildfire damage.\n\nThe throng gathered less than a block from burned-down neighborhoods included members of the Secret Service, Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Teddy’s Tacos.\n\n“It’s quite a day,’’ said Teddy Vasquez, 39, surveying the scene near his taco truck that has been serving free food outside the firehouse since less than 72 hours after the fires broke out Jan. 7. “Firefighters left their homes to be out here. The least I could do is come out here and feed them.’’\n\nWith Trump expected to arrive by helicopter at about 2:30 p.m. local time, law enforcement walked along nearby Fiske Street, a demolished block of homes that Trump is expected to survey after an aerial tour of the ruin.\n\nAlso, banquet tables have been set up inside the fire department for an emergency briefing that will include the president. Fire captain Jeff Brown, a key participant in the activities, declined comment. But Vasquez, the taco truck owner, was happy to chat about Trump’s impending arrival as his workers began to heat flour tortillas.\n\n“Hoping President Trump likes tacos,’’ said Vasquez, who lives in Long Beach. “I think he will after he tries Teddy’s.’’\n\n– Josh Peter\n\n“I want more babies,” Vance says in his first speech as vice president\n\nVice President JD Vance on Friday told anti-abortion activists at their annual March for Life rally in Washington that the country had failed its citizens.\n\n“We failed a generation not only by permitting a culture of abortion on demand, but also by neglecting to help young parents achieve the ingredients they need to lead a happy and meaningful life,” he said.\n\nHe said a “culture of radical individualism” had led to people viewing the “responsibilities and joys” of raising a family as obstacles.\n\n“Our society has failed to recognize the obligation that one generation has to another as a core part of living in a society,” he said. “So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America.”\n\nVance, a former senator from Ohio, has advocated boosting the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $5,000 per child to help with the cost of raising children.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\n‘Houses, trailers, bodies’ float past during Asheville flood: victim\n\nThomas Bright described for President Trump his harrowing escape from a home that had been in his family for 80 years and four generations before Hurricane Helene destroyed it.\n\nBright woke up at 5 a.m. to the sound of trees falling on the house in the Azalea Road area of East Asheville. He began moving five vehicles from around the house to a road about one-third of a mile away, as the floodwaters began to rise.\n\nWhen the water was ankle-deep inside the house, he retreated to a loft. When the water reached their hips, he made a makeshift ladder to climb onto the roof.\n\nHe spent four hours on the roof writing farewell notes on his cellphone to his two children and his two grandchildren as debris from the storm floated past. His garage floated away before the water crested at about 4 feet high on the roof.\n\n“We didn’t think we were going to make it at all,” Bright said. “We were watching houses, trailers, bodies coming by us.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n‘Horrific’: Fairview resident tells Trump of flood and bodies\n\nMona Nix-Roper, who lives in the Fairview area of North Carolina, told President Trump her home became like an island in September as floodwaters from Hurricane Helene rose around it.\n\nShe was home alone because her husband was staying with a 98-year-old neighbor to make sure she was alright. When Nix went out to check the road and bridge that provide access to her home, she found they were gone.\n\nFire Department officials urged her the next day to evacuate because of the risk of landslides. Her 21-year-old son Nathan hiked in five miles after roads became impassable to help her leave.\n\n“He said, ‘Mom, grab a bag, we’ve got to go,’” Nix said. “I said, ‘Son, there’s no way I can hike out of here.’ He said, ‘No, we’ve got to go.’”\n\nAs they walked out, they saw a neighbor’s body that had turned blue in the water.\n\n“Horrific is just all I can say,” Nix said. “There were people out everywhere looking for their loved ones. And there were dead bodies. My son’s like, ‘Mom, you’re going to see things you don’t want to see.’”\n\nNix’s home was without power for two months, so she lived in her church’s sound room. Others had lost everything, so she said she is embarrassed to ask for help.\n\n“We need help,” Nix said. “It’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nTrump appeared moved.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of bad things, but I’ve never seen anything like it,” Trump said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump thanks March for Life activists via video\n\nWhen Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, President Trump on Friday said a “historic wrong was set right” thanks to the “tireless work and devotion across five decades” of anti-abortion rights activists as he addressed March for Life rallygoers at the National Mall.\n\n“Three years ago, I was so proud to be a participant,” he said. “Six courageous justices of the Supreme Court of the United States returned the issue to the state legislatures and to the people where it belongs.”\n\nIn his second term, Trump said he would “stand proudly for families and for life.”\n\n“Under my leadership, the reformed Department of Justice will finally investigate the radical left attacks on churches and crisis pregnancy centers, and we will bring perpetrator to justice,” he said.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nPastor describes generosity of volunteers helping recovery\n\nPastor Ramona Nix told President Trump she had dedicated her Eagle Rock, North Carolina church a week before the storm arrived with Hurricane Helene in September.\n\nNix stayed in the church building for three months, sleeping on the floor for three weeks, because the community’s needs were so great. Her son ferried supplies in, Nix said.\n\n“Before the week was over, the church was so packed, we couldn’t even walk,” Nix said. “Even our sanctuary, it was up to the platform.”\n\nVolunteers arrived from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana and Oklahoma to help with the recovery. “They were coming in day and night,” Nix said.\n\nAt one point, Nix asked a woman who arrived if she could do anything special for her.\n\n“She said, ‘I don’t want to be selfish, but could I have a cup of coffee,’” Nix said. “I handed her that coffee and she stood there. Tears just poured. She said, ‘You don’t realize how important the little things.’ It’s not the big things in life that we have, but it’s the little things.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\n‘I didn’t think I was going to make it’: NC victim to Trump\n\nKim West described her harrowing escape from her home as it flooded from Hurricane Helene in September, as President Trump visited the storm-ravaged Swannanoa, North Carolina.\n\nAs the river waters rose near their house, Kim and her husband Chris West started moving vehicles to higher ground along the road. By then, water was ankle deep inside the house. Kim West grabbed her purse and pug dog, and Chris West put dog food in a trash bag.\n\n“By the time we got into the driveway, it was already waist deep,” West said. “I didn’t think I was going to make it.”\n\nThey were stuck on local roads for hours because of flooding. The waters finally receded about midnight, after they began evacuating at 5 a.m.\n\n“We just lost everything that we had,” West said. “Didn’t even have a brush for like three days.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nThune and Johnson address March for Life rallygoers\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday addressed the annual March for Life rally at the National Mall in Washington, saying the anti-abortion rights protesters were “not alone.”\n\n“You are part of a great movement united around the truth. That every life is precious,” he said. “I stand with you in this fight and so do many of my colleagues in Congress.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., talked about being a “product of an unplanned teen pregnancy\" born in 1972, one year before abortion was legalized when Roe v. Wade became the law of the land.\n\n“I am so eternally grateful that my mom and dad ignored all the people who told them to just take care of that problem,” he said. “They chose to embrace life and to have me the first of their four children.”\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump granted pardons to 23 anti-abortion rights activists.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump suggests abolishing FEMA\n\nPresident Trump ratcheted up his criticism with the suggestion he might abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency because of its response in North Carolina to lingering damage from Hurricane Helene in September.\n\n“I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe even getting rid of FEMA,” Trump said after a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina. “Frankly, FEMA’s not good.”\n\nTrump accused FEMA crews of being unfamiliar with areas when responding to disasters. FEMA also imposes rules and requirements on crews that aren’t as good as what local officials provide, Trump said. The federal government should instead send funding to governors to manage their own response to disasters, he said.\n\n“FEMA has turned out to be a disaster,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly – we pay a percentage to the state.”\n\nAfter speaking with flood victims in Swannanoa, North Carolina, Trump later added, “If it was up to me right now, I’d end it right now.\"\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nPolitics shadow Trump's visit to North Carolina\n\nGlimpses of the politics behind disaster aid were visible as President Trump visited North Carolina to review damage from Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump recalled a whistleblower reported that Federal Emergency Management Agency crews refused to help people with Trump's 2024 presidential campaign signs in their yards. “That’s not good,” the president said.\n\nTrump noted that North Carolina and adjoining Tennessee each supported him in the last election – the Volunteer State slightly more.\n\nThe president also called for California to adopt voter ID, to ensure the citizenship of voters, to receive disaster aid for its wildfires around Los Angeles.\n\nThroughout his comments at a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina, Trump cited problems with former President Joe Biden’s response to the disaster that left 104 people in North Carolina dead, 73,000 homes severely damaged or destroyed and Asheville without running water for two months.\n\n“It doesn’t matter at this point: Biden did a bad job,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTennessee governor thanks Trump for helping Appalachia\n\nTennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, whose state abuts North Carolina and was also damaged by Hurricane Helene, attended President Trump’s briefing on the disaster and thanked him.\n\n“The people in this region – including Tennessee, the people of Appalachia – are grateful that you are here and that you haven’t forgotten them,” Lee said. “There are other disasters. This was enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee.”\n\nTrump joked about which state gave him more votes. “I hate to tell you, North Carolina, it was Tennessee,\" the president said.\n\nLee said one of the counties hurt in the disaster supported Trump with 88% of the vote.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says Anthony Fauci can hire his own security\n\nPresident Trump said the federal security detail for Dr. Anthony Fauci, a former head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease, had been removed Thursday because it can’t last a lifetime and he could hire his own protection.\n\nFauci led the federal health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to harsh criticism from Republicans about studies of the origin of the disease and the lockdowns to combat it during the first year.\n\n“When you work for government, at some point your security detail comes off,” Trump told reporters while visiting storm-damaged North Carolina. “You can’t have them forever.”\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also lost their security details during the first week of his administration.\n\n“They all made a lot of money, they can hire their own security, too,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nNC Reps. Edwards, Foxx and Moore to help lead recovery\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, announced he would help guide recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene with three House Republicans from the region with the most damage.\n\nThe lawmakers are GOP Reps. Chuck Edwards, Virginia Foxx and Tim Moore.\n\nTrump announced that Whatley would lead the recovery effort with Democratic Gov. Josh Stein.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump wants voter ID in California for disaster aid\n\nPresident Trump said on Friday he would like to see two changes in California – the adoption of voter ID and the redirection of water from the northern part of the state to the south – in exchange for disaster aid for wildfires.\n\nTrump said he wanted voter identification to ensure the citizenship of voters. He also repeated his complaint that the state should divert funding from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Los Angeles to fight fires.\n\n“I want two things,” Trump told reporters upon his arrival in Asheville, North Carolina. “After that, I will be the greatest president California has ever seen.”\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says OPEC lowering oil prices is key to stopping war in Ukraine\n\nTrump said his proposal for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce the price of oil is key to stopping the war in Ukraine.\n\n“We want to see OPEC cut the price of oil and that will automatically stop the tragedy that’s taking place in Ukraine,” Trump said in Asheville, North Carolina. “It’s a butchering tragedy, for both sides, by the way.”\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said a key to stopping the war is for OPEC to cut its prices because “if you have it high, that war is not going to end so easily.”\n\n“OPEC ought to get on the ball and they ought to drop the price of oil and that war will stop right away,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump offers ‘a lot of money’ to NC, overhaul of FEMA\n\nPresident Trump told reporters in Asheville, North Carolina, that the federal government would supply “a lot of the money” to repair damage from floods and landslides after Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump also proposed to overhaul the FEMA so that states respond to their own disasters rather than the federal government.\n\n“We’re going to fix it as fast as we can,” Trump said. “It’s a massive amount of damage.”\n\nTrump said Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein would work on plans for demolition of damaged buildings and cleaning up debris. Trump said the federal government would probably provide 75% of the funding.\n\n“We’re going to supply the money, a lot of the money,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said he would review “the whole concept of FEMA” because states such as Florida with hurricanes and Oklahoma with tornadoes are better at responding to disasters.\n\n“I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,” Trump said. “I think you’re going to find it a lot less expensive – less than half – and you’re going to get a much quicker response.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff ‘glad’ Trump will see devastation from wildfires\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, a frequent critic of President Trump, said he’s glad Trump is visiting Los Angeles to tour the wildfire damage but that he and Sen. Alex Padilla have votes scheduled and couldn’t attend.\n\n“I’m glad that he’s going to see the devastation because I think, frankly, until you see it and the scope of it – whole neighborhoods gone block after block after block – it’s hard to wrap your head around,” Schiff told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”\n\nBut Schiff said he hoped Trump and congressional Republicans wouldn’t put conditions on funding for disaster aid.\n\n“We've never done that when it comes to our fellow citizens who are hurting,” Schiff said. “And California, frankly, has been the most generous state in terms of supporting our fellow citizens, whether they're in red states or blue when they face disaster.”\n\nSchiff said overhauling the Environmental Protection Agency and the FEMA, as Trump has suggested, are areas that could lead to bipartisan support.\n\n“All of that is ample ground to get together and make things happen,” Schiff said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he didn’t invite California Sen. Adam Schiff on trip\n\nPresident Trump said he didn’t invite Sen. Adam Schiff, a frequent Democratic critic, on the trip to areas of Los Angeles damaged by wildfires.\n\n“Is he going? I don't know. I mean, I really don't know,” Trump said. “You know, if he's going to be there it would be cheaper, but I didn't invite him. Somebody did.\"\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., has asked that disaster aid for California not come with strings attached, after Republicans suggested potential restrictions on the funding. Schiff is a former member of the U.S. House who previously led the first impeachment of Trump over his dealings with Ukraine and has questioned whether his nominees to become Cabinet secretaries will act independently from him.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he will watch ‘March for Life’\n\nPresident Trump said he would be watching the “March for Life” in Washington as he traveled to North Carolina and California to visit disaster areas. He said Vice President JD Vance would represent the administration “very well.”\n\n“I’m going to be watching it,” Trump said. “He’s going to be representing us very well.”\n\nTrump also noted that he pardoned 23 people who he said were \"unjustly\" charged for protesting outside abortion clinics.\n\n“It was disgraceful what happened,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump calls DOD nominee Pete Hegseth ‘a good man’\n\nPresident Trump praised his nominee to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, as a “good man” but didn’t predict what would happen with his Senate confirmation vote scheduled for late Friday.\n\n“He’s a good man. I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Trump said. “I hope he makes it.”\n\nGOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against limiting debate on the nomination. Trump also questioned whether Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would support Hegseth because Trump and McConnell have had disputes in the past.\n\n“I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: North Carolina was ‘allowed to fester’\n\nPresident Trump told reporters on Friday morning outside the White House that he’s going to North Carolina because the state has been treated badly since Hurricane Helene and to California where he said the wildfires should have been extinguished already.\n\n“North Carolina is a horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester. It should have been done months ago,” Trump said. “North Carolina has been treated very badly.”\n\nTrump will visit Los Angeles later in the day to hear about the wildfires.\n\n“We’re going to take a look at the fire if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's travel schedule ‒ minute by minute\n\nPresident Trump left the White House by helicopter at 9:16 a.m. for his tour of disaster areas in North Carolina and California on Friday. Here’s where he is going (all times Eastern Standard Time):\n\n11 a.m. in Fletcher, N.C.: Trump will receive a briefing on the recovery from Hurricane Helene, which flooded much of western North Carolina in September. Participants include a handful of lawmakers, state Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler; state House Speaker Dustin Hall; and Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan’s Purse.\n\n12:05 p.m. in Swannanoa, N.C.: Trump meets with families affected by the hurricane. Participants include Ramona Nix, pastor of Eagle Rock Church; and people who received benefits from Samaritan’s Purse: homeowners Chris and Kim West; Thomas Bright and Jackie Mitchell; and Curtis A., Amber and Curtis B. Wright.\n\n1:15 p.m. Trump leaves Asheville Regional Airport on a flight to Los Angeles.\n\n5:40 p.m. Trump arrives at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n6:25 p.m. Trump tours the Pacific Palisades Neighborhood. Participants include Fire Capt. Jeff Brown; Jason Hing, chief deputy of emergency services for the Fire Department; and homeowners Mike and Gaby Shaw.\n\n7:05 p.m. Trump receives an emergency briefing in Pacific Palisades. Other participants include Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass; Ric Grenell, presidential envoy for special missions; Randy Moore, chief of the U.S. Forest Service; Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors; and Ed Ring, director of water and policy for the California Policy Center; and a dozen House members.\n\n8:20 p.m. Trump leaves for Los Angeles airport.\n\n8:50 p.m. Trump flights to Las Vegas, where he will spend the night.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\n‘Deportation flights have begun’: White House press secretary\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Friday announced that Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants was underway.\n\n“Deportation flights have begun,” she wrote on X. “President Trump is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: if you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences.\"\n\nLeavitt also included two photos of people boarding military aircraft.\n\n‒ Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Stein to meet Trump\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is planning to meet Trump on the tarmac of Asheville Regional Airport during Trump’s visit to Western North Carolina, according to The Citizen-Times, a USA TODAY Network partner.\n\nEarlier in the week, Stein, a Democrat, said Trump’s planned visit to western North Carolina, which was ravaged by Tropical Storm Helene nearly four months ago, was “very good news” for the region’s residents. The storm killed more than 100 people across the state and caused an estimated $60 billion in damage, according to the latest estimate from the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management.\n\n‒ Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nWhat is Trump’s schedule today?\n\nTrump's disaster-area tour begins around 10 a.m. EST on his first trip away from Washington. First comes a late morning visit to hurricane-damaged Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nHe'll then be wheels up on Air Force One in the early afternoon, heading west to Los Angeles and Santa Monica to visit areas ravaged by multiple wildfires. Trump is expected to reach California around 6:15 p.m. EST.\n\nThe president ends his Friday with a flight to Las Vegas, where he'll spend the night before hosting a downtown rally on Saturday. Trump won Nevada in 2024 after losing it four years earlier, and he recently told reporters he wanted to “thank them for the votes.”\n\nA video message from the president will also play at the annual March for Life rally by anti-abortion advocates on Capitol Hill this morning. Vice President JD Vance will address the crowd during the rally in his first public appearance in his new role.\n\n‒ Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJudge blocks Trump's birthright citizenship order, calling it 'blatantly unconstitutional'\n\nA federal judge in Seattle on Thursday blocked Trump's administration from implementing an executive order curtailing the right to automatic birthright citizenship in the United States, calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour at the urging of four Democratic-led states issued a temporary restraining order preventing the administration from enforcing the order, which the Republican president signed on Monday during his first day in office.\n\nThe order has already become the subject of five lawsuits by civil rights groups and Democratic attorneys general from 22 states, who call it a flagrant violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n– Reuters\n\nTrump's CIA director confirmed\n\nThe Senate easily confirmed CIA Director John Ratcliffe with a bipartisan 74-25 vote Thursday afternoon, making him the second of Trump’s cabinet picks to clear the chamber after Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nRatcliffe previously served as the director of national intelligence during the first Trump administration.\n\n– Riley Beggin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/05/election-day-2024-live-updates-michigan/76043196007/", "title": "Election Day 2024 updates: Detroit turnout; Macomb counting", "text": "The day has come. Tuesday, Nov. 5 is Election Day in the U.S., and eyes are on Michigan as a swing state in the presidential race. Meanwhile, Democrats are fighting to maintain a razor-thin majority in the state House, other key roles of representation locally and in D.C. are in play, and races down the ballot will decide leadership in the realms of education and justice.\n\nHere are the latest updates from Michigan on Election Day 2024.\n\nDetroit election worker crashes car while transporting small number of ballots\n\nA crash involving a Detroit elections worker transporting absentee ballots is not expected to delay the city’s vote count.\n\nThe worker was driving from the city clerk’s New Center election headquarters, where signatures on absentee ballots are compared to the signature on voter registration cards, to the absentee counting room at Huntington Place, where absentee ballots are unsealed and counted.\n\nThe worker crashed her car at about 10 p.m. near west Grand Boulevard and Linwood Street. Police arrived and waited for election workers to pick up the ballots, said Detroit Police Department Deputy Chief Franklin Hayes\n\nHayes said the driver was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries.\n\nDetroit elections director George Azzouz said only one container of ballots was in the vehicle and the ballots were picked up right away for delivery to Huntington Place. The containers hold less than 300 ballots.\n\n-M.L. Elrick\n\nHarris sorority gathers to await results\n\nThe women of the nation’s oldest black sorority, the one to which Vice President Kamala Harris belongs, gathered at an event space in downtown Detroit Tuesday for an election night watch party.\n\nThe event, hosted by the Lambda Pi Omega chapter of AKA Sorority, Inc., drew around 200 people.\n\nThe party was billed as non-partisan and participants were not allowed to speak to media. The sorority is not allowed to make political endorsements and group leaders were fearful any comments by individual sorority members would be construed as an official position of the sorority.\n\nDecked out in Alpha Kappa Alpha regalia — salmon pink and apple green shirts and jackets and sweaters with pearls around their necks — the women sat together in front of a giant television broadcasting election night coverage, dancing, eating and talking.\n\nA few woman wore pink Chuck Taylors. The Converse shoe brand is as synonymous with Harris as pantsuits were with Hillary Clinton.\n\nWas the footwear choice by chance or by choice? No one was talking.\n\nThey probably didn’t need to.\n\n-Georgea Kovanis\n\nGOTV texts from Michigan politicians misdirect voters\n\nA text from state Rep. Kathy Schmaltz, R-Jackson, sent Tuesday incorrectly said that polling locations would “open tomorrow”, prompting a complaint filed with the Secretary of State’s office, according to a press release from the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus.\n\nCaucus chair state Sen. Erika Geiss, D-Taylor, blasted the text as a “blatant attempt at disinformation and voter suppression” in a statement.\n\nA text from Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II also was received 24 minutes after 8 p.m., when polls closed. It encouraged voters to head to their polling locations and “VOTE TODAY,\" according to a copy of the message sent to a Free Press reporter.\n\nA consultant for Schmatlz’ campaign and a spokesperson with the governor’s office did not immediately respond to a Free Press request to comment.\n\n-Clara Hendrickson\n\nMacomb clerk trying to speed up vote counting\n\nMacomb County Clerk Anthony Forlini said he was heading to New Baltimore with a sheriff's deputy to pick up memory sticks with voting data, then would head to Chesterfield Township to do the same in an effort to get election results to the county − and thus online to the public − faster.\n\nThe county participates in a program where a sheriff's deputy and county clerk's employee, in this case Forlini himself, go to municipalities and pick up the sticks. It's a secure process, where they transport them to the county's election department in Mount Clemens.\n\nHe said three communities used the program in Tuesday's election.\n\nForlini previously told the Free Press he worked with the sheriff in the August primary as well.\n\nAbout 45 minutes before most polls in Michigan closed at 8 p.m., Forlini told the Free Press: \"It's been a very busy day at the polls, and I think voter turnout is going to be fantastic.\" He reported no issues at the polls.\n\nAbout 9:15 p.m., Forlini said long lines continued and people in line in Harrison Township were voting past 8 p.m.\n\n-Christina Hall\n\nDetroit turnout to reach 51%, results by midnight\n\nDetroit is on pace to reach 51 percent voter turnout with all ballots to be counted by around midnight, a top city election official said at the Huntington Place absentee counting site after polls closed Tuesday at 8 p.m.\n\nMore than 82,000 city voters cast ballots in person on Election Day as of 5 p.m. That comes after 92,000 voted absentee and 43,000 voted early, said Daniel Baxter, chief operations officer of the Detroit elections department.\n\nWorkers have been counting absentee ballots since Oct. 28 in a more streamlined process than that of 2020, when Huntington Place, then the TCF center, descended into chaos amid allegations of impropriety.\n\nNo more than 8,000 additional absentee ballots were expected to be delivered for counting Tuesday. Most were submitted via drop box.\n\nBaxter’s turnout projection is at the low end of the range provided by Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey at a briefing last week, when she expected up to 55 percent of eligible voters to cast ballots. Voter turnout in the city reached 51 percent in 2012 and 2020, and dipped to 49 percent in 2016, when Hillary Clinton lost the state by fewer than 11,000 votes. At current estimates the overall number of votes could match the roughly 257,000 people who voted in the last presidential election in 2020.\n\nAsked how this election differs from 2020, Baxter said, “There’s no chaos going on right now, no pandemonium. Nobody is banging on windows, nobody is shouting stop the count.”\n\n“Do you hear that?” he said. “I think I hear people singing Kumbaya.”\n\n-Violet Ikonomova\n\nNo truth to Trump post about Detroit law enforcement\n\nDetroit police are prepared for the General Election but there is no evidence to support a false claim from former President Donald Trump about law enforcement in the majority Democratic city.\n\n“A lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia,” Trump posted on his social media company Truth Social around 6:30pm. “Philadelphia and Detroit! Heavy Law Enforcement is there,” he added.\n\nDetroit police did not specifically respond to Trump's asserting, instead offering a statement Tuesday evening as polls closed about the security of the election.\n\n“As we have done in prior elections, the DPD has assigned personnel to locations throughout the city to ensure public safety during this election cycle for all voters. The amount of staffing deployed for this event is no different than in prior elections,” Detroit police said in a statement forwarded to the Free Press by a spokesperson in the mayor’s office.\n\nThe department says it's in close communication with the city clerk “and will provide any needed assistance in ensuring election integrity.”\n\nIn 2020, Trump encouraged supporters to protest outside the city’s absentee ballot counting center as part of his false claim widespread election fraud caused his loss in Michigan.\n\nAs protesters inside the then-TCF Center complained of what they believed to be voting fraud, police began to add road barricades, closing Washington Boulevard nearby the convention center and separating the group from a smaller band of counter protesters who also showed up.\n\nClerks are processing ballots quicker this year; they credit new election laws established as a result of an amendment to the state constitution in 2022, allowing early voting and enabling voters to automatically receive absentee ballots for all future elections.\n\nThis year, election officials were able to pre-process absentee ballots eight days before Election Day. Some clerks chose not to.\n\n-Sam Robinson\n\nVoter turns Green in protest\n\nChelsea Thacker, 34, of Grosse Pointe Woods, said she was so disappointed with human rights abuses in the Middle East that she refused to vote for either Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump for president.\n\n“Jill Stein, because she’s the only candidate against genocide committed by U.S.-backed Israel in Gaza and Lebanon,” said Thacker after voting Tuesday at Grosse Pointe Woods Community Center on Mack Plaza.\n\nThacker added she’ll never again vote for a Democrat or Republican presidential candidate until they change their positions on what she called the most pressing human rights issues.\n\n-Matthew Dolan\n\nFirst-time Detroit voter: Not enough women in charge\n\nAt the East English Village Preparatory Academy, an eastside Detroit polling station, the Free Press stopped seven voters late Tuesday as they left the building separately and at different times. All said they had voted for Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\n\"I wasn't hyped about it, but I did it - the other option wasn't an option\" said 34-year-old Jeff Peake, a union carpenter who referred to Trump as \"the greater of two evils.\"\n\nFor the King sisters − three college-aged voters who showed up together to vote − it was Harris's commitment to protect women's rights that mattered most to them. They also loved the idea of a woman leading in the White House.\n\n\"You don't see enough women in charge,\" said 18-year-old Periece King, a first-time voter and nursing student who voted alongside her two sisters:-21-year-old Peria King, who is studying to be a stenographer, and 22-year-old Pierrah King, who works as an Amazon driver.\n\nWhen asked if anyone in their family was voting for Trump, they laughed and said, \"maybe an uncle.\"\n\n-Tresa Baldas\n\nMore than 3.4 million absentee, early votes cast in Michigan, state officials say\n\nAs of 6 p.m., just over 3.4 million absentee ballots and early votes — 46.6% of the state's active registered voters — were cast in Michigan, according to state officials.\n\nOfficials said 93% of absentee ballots sent statewide had been returned.\n\nThe number of Michiganders who had registered to vote as of 6 p.m. Tuesday was up to 16,573. In 2020, more than 28,000 voters registered on Election Day.\n\n-Kristi Tanner\n\n5:30 p.m.: Reproductive rights, ending 'extremist ideology' motivate Detroit voter\n\nKelly Flores-Mendoza, 23, of Detroit, who voted after work, said what drew her to the polls were reproductive rights, strengthening — and not defunding — education, supporting who might be the first female president, and to put an end to Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nFlores-Mendoza, whose parents are Mexican immigrants, she said she feels the fear in her community if Trump wins another term. She feels it herself.\n\n\"His recent insane rhetoric and his extremist ideology — it ignites violence,\" she said.\n\nThis election has been stressful for her, considering what's at stake and how close the race is. She was excited to vote for Harris. But, she was bummed that her polling site, the Roberto Clemente Learning Academy in southwest Detroit, ran out of the werewolf \"I voted\" stickers.\n\n-Andrea Sahouri\n\nVideo: Voters in Oakland County share who they voted for in presidential election\n\nHundreds of DJs perform at polling sites across state\n\nAs voters lined up early Tuesday to cast their ballots at the Northwest Activities Center in Detroit, a DJ kicked things off outside to energize the crowd, playing \"Happy,\" by Pharrell Williams.\n\n“We're trying to bring excitement to voters, to get them out to vote,” said Jacqueline Kapilango, who goes by DJ Asset, a volunteer with the group DJ at the Polls.\n\nJamiel Martin, the Michigan project manager for DJs at the Polls, said it's an effort in 11 states.\n\n\"Our goal is to inspire folks through the DJ's performance, to excite people to come out to vote,\" Martin said. He said some polling locations may have lines, so the DJs are out there to \"keep the vibe upbeat.\"\n\n-Nushrat Rahman, Susan Tompor, Jalen Williams and Gina Kaufman\n\nTwo women diverge at the ballot box in Birmingham\n\nIn the leafy environs of Birmingham outside the First Presbyterian Church polling place on West Maple Road, one voter said explained her vote.\n\nTwenty-year-old Nicole Merchant, an advertising and theater major at Michigan State University, said she was inspired to fill in Vice President Kamala Harris because of the Democrat’s support for women’s rights, abortion freedom and key issues important to the gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans communities.\n\n“This feels like a major turning point for our country and it’s very important that I’m here,” Merchant said.\n\n-Matthew Dolan\n\n5 p.m.: Detroit Police: Threat made against polling site not credible\n\nThe threat made on Election Day eve to shoot up a polling location on Detroit's northwest side was not credible, Detroit police confirmed to the Free Press on Tuesday.\n\nPolice didn’t say to whom the call was made but had said they were giving special attention to the polling location, which is in the 21600 block of West Seven Mile Road. On Monday, Detroit police said the department received a 911 call from an individual \"claiming to have heard a threat to a polling location via a Facebook post,\" according to a police spokesperson.\n\nDetroit police said around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday that polling locations in Detroit are \"looking great,\" with no reported incidents of threats or crimes at the sites.\n\n-Andrea Sahouri\n\n4:30 p.m.: Returning citizen appreciates power of the vote\n\nThe 2024 election was the first time Josh Puckett was able to vote in 29 years.\n\nPuckett, 47, of Redford was released from prison in July and is already prominent in metro Detroit's criminal justice reform circles. This year, fighting for reforms also meant voting in those who support changing our flawed criminal justice system, he said.\n\nWhen the Free Press spoke to him around 2:30 p.m. at the Clippert Multicultural Magnet Honors Academy polling location in southwest Detroit, he was in the neighborhood where he grew up, volunteering as a nonpartisan poll observer.\n\n“Seeing it through to the end means making sure everyone's vote matters and no one gets turned away,\" he said. \"I’m really proud of Southwest Detroit. This is well organized.\"\n\nPuckett estimated he's seen at least 100 first-time voters at Clippert, and everything had gone smoothly.\n\n(In fact, Detroit police said around 4:30 p.m. that polling locations in Detroit were \"looking great\" with no reported incidents of threats or crimes at the sites.)\n\nAnd although he wouldn't say who he voted for at the top of the ticket, voting down-ballot was what brought him to the polls — including the races for Michigan Supreme Court and local judges.\n\nHe did say, however, his support for Palestine made the decision between Trump and Harris difficult. Puckett said without hesitation that he believes Harris will swing Michigan and win the election.\n\nBut Dakota Shananaquet, 49, of Redford who volunteered as a poll observer at Clippert with Puckett, hesitated before saying, \"Harris.\"\n\nShananaquet, who is Native American, said indigenous issues are key for her. She voted for Harris and explained that under the Biden-Harris administration, a lot of good was done for her community, including Biden's appointment of a Native American secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland.But as an indigenous woman, voting for Harris wasn't exactly easy, either, given the current administration's support for Israel's assault on Gaza that she described as a genocide. \"We identify it, because we as Native American people went through the same thing,\" Shananaquet said.\n\n-Andrea Sahouri\n\n3:15 p.m.: Abortion a top issue for Royal Oak voter\n\nElliot Callan, 19, of Royal Oak, said he wasn’t planning to vote until he was propelled by one issue: abortion.\n\nCallan, a hospital kitchen worker, began to learn more about the presidential candidates and their views on ending pregnancies. He said he felt inspired to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris because of her strong support for a woman’s right to choose.\n\n“I’m all about less government in our lives,” Callan said, adding that the last thing a pregnant woman trying to make a difficult choice about an abortion should have to worry about is government intervention.\n\n-Matthew Dolan\n\nState: 92% of absentee ballots sent have been returned\n\nIn an update just after 3 p.m., election officials reported that 58,466 absentee ballots had been returned since polls opened this morning and that 92% of absentee ballots sent — 2,164,803 — have been returned statewide.\n\nThe number of people who registered and voted on Election Day increased to 9,612.\n\n-Kristi Tanner\n\nVideo: Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson dances with crowd outside of Pasteur Elementary in Detroit\n\n2:25 p.m.: Two Ferndale voters express different reasons for choosing candidates\n\nTwo twentysomethings emerged separately from their Ferndale voting booths Tuesday afternoon with starkly different reasons for choosing two opposing presidential candidates.\n\nOutside Ferndale Free Methodist Church on Woodward Heights, Matthew Flint, 26, who works for Costco, cast his ballot because he was driven to oppose the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.\n\n“He lacks character,” Flint said in an interview. “I picked her (Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris) because he’s so bad.”\n\nJust a few minutes later, Connor Elkins, also 26 from Ferndale, who works as a union drywall installer, described filling out his ballot for Trump, whom he said would solve the problem of illegal immigration. Elkins previously spent more than four years in the Marines, and said he believes the country’s armed forces were stronger under Trump’s leadership than the Biden administration, including Harris.\n\n“There is now a bold line between them,” he added.\n\n-Matthew Dolan\n\nFlat Rock voter doesn't want results to be rushed\n\nSiblings James, 28, and Samantha Smith, 24, walked into the Flat Rock Community Center confident in their decisions in casting their votes. The two shared the sentiment that the working class and immigration and the border were their biggest concerns headed into the election, and planned on voting straight Republican.\n\n“I voted for Trump last time. The reason I voted for him is I wanted him to shake up Washington. I think there was a lot of crooked politics in there, to be honest,\" said James, a former Marine. “And Trump, being a businessman, I think he knows how to run a country. He does pretty good for himself now.”\n\nJames said he doesn’t want the results to be rushed.\n\n“I think timeframe is not really an issue. I think they should really take their time, because I'm one of the people that strongly believe that the last election was rigged and that there was false ballots,” he said.\n\n-Eric Guzmán\n\n1 Northville precinct relocates because of gas leak\n\nA voting precinct in Northville, which is in both Wayne and Oakland counties, relocated on Election Day due to a gas leak.\n\nPrecinct 1, which is at the community center on Main Street, suspended voting operations Tuesday, the city announced in a Facebook post about noon.\n\nPrecinct 1 voters now need to go to Hillside Middle School, the city stated in another post.\n\nThat location is the site of Precinct 2 and is at 775 N. Center Street in the city.\n\nConsumers Energy is on scene of the gas leak, the city stated.\n\n-Darcie Moran\n\nBackup tabulators deployed in Oakland County\n\nOakland County saw brief issues with vote tabulators on Election Day, officials confirmed.\n\nSome precincts in a handful of communities such as Rochester Hills and Pontiac had problems earlier this morning with their tabulators, said Oakland County Clerk Lisa Brown.\n\n“That does not stop voting,” she said, noting that backup tabulators have since been deployed.\n\n-Kristi Tanner\n\n11:38 a.m.: Same-day voter registration surpasses August primary\n\nIn an update just after 11:30 a.m. on Election Day, election officials revealed same-day voter registration had hit 3,704.\n\nIn the August primary, same-day registrations were reported as 3,600, said Angela Benander, chief communications officer for the Michigan Department of State.\n\nTurnout on Election Day had also crept up to about 46.1% of active, registered voters in Michigan, she announced. That includes 25,000 absentee ballots returned so far on Tuesday.\n\nShe said Michigan, at the time, had about 7,300 military overseas ballots that were still due back. Military overseas ballots must be postmarked on or before Election Day and are accepted within six days after the election to be counted.\n\nBoth Flint and Detroit were reportedly moving swiftly in counting absentee ballots.\n\n-Darcie Moran\n\n11:03 a.m.: Concerns of treason out of Grand Rapids\n\nRodney Bragg, 58, of Grand Rapids, said he cast a straight party ticket for Democrats on Tuesday, as is the tradition for him and his family.\n\nStanding outside LaGrave Avenue Christian Reformed Church near his city’s downtown area, he said he viewed Harris as a more trustworthy candidate and had been urging family members to vote for her. He believes she’s a step toward a brighter future.\n\nA veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, Bragg said Harris would never back events like the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol, something he said for which Trump is to blame.\n\n“They called it an insurrection. To me, that was treason,” Bragg said. “I can’t accept that. They attacked the Capitol. I swore an oath.”\n\nGrand Rapids is the heart of Kent County, a west Michigan county that’s emerged as a key battleground in statewide elections in recent years. While Trump carried Kent County on his way to winning Michigan in 2016, Democrats at the top of the ticket have won there in each statewide election since 2018.\n\nLong before Trump, Michigan has been an 11th-hour campaign stop for presidential hopefuls\n\nTrump, in what’s become a tradition itself, held his final rally before Election Day in Grand Rapids, giving a nearly two-hour long speech to supporters at Van Andel Arena which ran past 2 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n-Arpan Lobo\n\n9:30 a.m.: Working out on Election Day in Warren\n\nSome voters were headed to an exercise class instead of the polls shortly after 9:30 a.m. Tuesday at the Warren Community Center, south of 14 Mile Road west of Mound Road.\n\nKevin Klindt, 51, stood in line for about an hour for early voting at Warren City Hall roughly a week ago, he said. He voted for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“I think she’s a better leader than Donald Trump,” he said.\n\nHe’d like to see the Democrats successfully back a woman as president. He also backs the Democrats because he feels that party has helped him a lot with Social Security; he is on disability related to mental health.\n\nLinda Gardner, 77, also at the center, said she voted absentee about a month ago for Harris.\n\n“I think all these old guys need to just move over a little bit,” Gardner said, including GOP candidate former President Donald Trump, who is 78.\n\nShe recalled Trump’s portrayal of current President Joe Biden, 81, as too old and noted how close they are in age.\n\nGardner said she is also concerned that Trump is “quite unpredictable as far as his presence on the world stage.”\n\n-Susan Tompor, columnist\n\n9:10 a.m.: More than 800 register for same-day voting\n\nMore than 3.3 million voters already cast their vote in Michigan between absentee ballots and early voting, delivering a turnout rate of 45.8% of active, registered Michigan voters, said Angela Benander, chief communications officer for the Michigan Department of State, in a morning call with reporters.\n\nOn Tuesday, 8,000 absentee ballots were also returned and 829 people registered to vote Tuesday through same-day voter registration, she said. Turnout was also looking good at voting sites.\n\nThere was one location reporting massive lines: Grace Emmanuel Baptist Church in Flint, she said. However, the line there is said to be moving quickly, despite its presence.\n\nThere have been typical “blips” but no major concerns and no reports of weather-related issues or closures, said Benander. More than 100 department employees are monitoring on the ground Tuesday and agencies are prepared for any potential disruptions.\n\nBenander also offered a story positive in the eyes of her team, saying a Wexford County high school government teacher took his whole class to watch him vote so they could see how the process works.\n\n- Darcie Moran\n\n8:30 a.m.: Groceries, day care and result timing in Warren\n\nVasilios Raspoptsis, 33, of Warren, said his family used to spend $200 or $220 a week on groceries before inflation took off.

He also said that the tension headed into this year’s election was \"higher than historically\" for him.\n\n“People are just aggressive,” Frederick said. “I even read it online.

It’s just very aggressive.”\n\nFredrick said he hopes to see results by Thursday, and hopes that “things are done correctly.”\n\nWhen will we see results?Learn more here.\n\n“We have to have trust in our voting system,” he said. “And right now, I think that’s lacking.”\n\n-Eric Guzman\n\n7:34 a.m.: Thinking of ancestors while voting in Detroit\n\nIf Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris becomes president, it would be “monumental,” said 27-year-old Detroiter Lauryn Allen after she cast her ballot shortly after polls opened.\n\nShe waited in line for more than half an hour at the Northwest Activities Center in Detroit, but that didn’t really matter. It’s exciting because a line means people are voting, she said.\n\n“It's humbling because I have that chance and opportunity to have a voice, and at one point, my ancestors didn’t,” said Allen, who lives on the west side of Detroit and works as a researcher at Henry Ford Hospital.\n\nWatching Harris at rallies and on social media, Allen felt like the presidential candidate was the right choice. She was inspired by Harris’ passion.\n\nA Harris win would mark a shift in how Black and brown girls see themselves and how men communicate with women, she said.\n\nAllen expects to stay up all night for the results. In 2016 — the first presidential election she voted in — she recalls the quiet of her campus after GOP candidate Donald Trump won.\n\n“But now me, being back home and me just feeling so energized and happy and excited for the future, I believe that when it gets closer to midnight and through the night, I'll be excited,” she said.\n\n- Nushrat Rahman\n\n7:20 a.m.: Youth eyes school board race in Dearborn\n\nSounds from a nearby factory and traffic filled the air as Election Day kicked off Tuesday and a few voters trickled into Salina Intermediate School in Dearborn.\n\nSporting an apron, flyers and a sign, 18-year-old Abdulrahman Masherah of Dearborn walked along the sidewalk outside the school.

She’s also concerned that Trump supporters don’t want to hear differing viewpoints.\n\nShe doesn’t feel represented by either candidate, but she plans to vote for Kamala Harris.\n\nOthers in line planned to cast their ballot differently.\n\nMichael Griffin, 71, of Warren, and his wife, Shirley Griffin, 74, stood among voters with plans to vote for Trump.\n\nThe retirees both voted for Trump when they lived in Indiana in 2016 and after they moved to Michigan in 2020.\n\nMichael Griffin said he was “tired of all this crap, mainly the border and inflation.”\n\nGriffin said he wasn’t a fan of boys playing in girls’ sports either. Concerns regarding transgender students have been fodder for GOP advertisements in the state.\n\nBut what really upsets him, he said, are illegal border crossings and how so many people have easily crossed the Mexican border into the United States.\n\nHe and his wife remain optimistic that Trump can win a second term in the White House.\n\n“We talk about it all the time,” he said of the election.\n\n“If he gets the turnout, he wins.”\n\n— Susan Tompor, columnist\n\nMichigan’s biggest 2024 election contests\n\nThe presidential race is looming over the whole nation, but is especially close in Michigan, one of seven key swing states this cycle. Polling in Michigan is close enough that it’s impossible to predict the outcome. And that’s not the only hot contest.\n\nMichigan’s U.S. Senate race between Democrat Elissa Slotkin and Republican Mike Rogers has been running tight, with the open seat considered a key prize for either party.\n\nThere are also three ultracompetitive congressional races. The 7th and 8th Congressional Districts near Lansing and Saginaw, respectively, have open seats. In the 10th Congressional District, it’s a rematch between incumbent Republican U.S. Rep.

Before that, he got six DUIs in California over a six-year period. None of that would keep him off the road.\n\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles reissued him a driver’s license in 2017. The next year, on Christmas Eve, he drove drunk again, running stop signs and a traffic light in midtown Sacramento, going more than 80 mph, court records show. He T-boned another car, killing a 28-year-old man who was going home to feed the cat before heading to his mom’s for the holiday.\n\nKostas Linardos had 17 tickets — including for speeding, reckless driving and street racing — and had been in four collisions. Then, in November 2022, he gunned his Ram 2500 truck as he entered a Placer County highway and slammed into the back of a disabled sedan, killing a toddler, court records show. He’s now facing felony manslaughter charges.\n\nIn December of last year, while that case was open, the DMV renewed his driver’s license.\n\nErvin Wyatt’s history behind the wheel spreads across two pages of a recent court filing: Fleeing police. Fleeing police again. Running a red light. Causing a traffic collision. Driving without a license, four times. A dozen speeding tickets.\n\nYet the DMV issued him a license in 2019. Wyatt promptly got three more speeding tickets, court records show. Prosecutors say he was speeding again in 2023 when he lost control and crashed into oncoming traffic, killing three women. He’s now facing murder charges in Stanislaus County.\n\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles routinely allows drivers like these — with horrifying histories of dangerous driving, including DUIs, crashes and numerous tickets — to continue to operate on our roadways, a CalMatters investigation has found. Too often they go on to kill. Many keep driving even after they kill. Some go on to kill again.\n\nWith state lawmakers grappling with how to address the death toll on our roads, CalMatters wanted to understand how California handles dangerous drivers. We first asked the district attorneys for all 58 counties to provide us with a list of their vehicular manslaughter cases from 2019 through early last year. Every county but Santa Cruz provided the information.\n\nBecause California has no centralized court system and records aren’t online, we then traveled to courthouses up and down the state to read through tens of thousands of pages of files. Once we had defendants’ names and other information, we were able to get DMV driver reports for more than 2,600 of the defendants, providing details on their recent collisions, citations and license status.\n\nThe court records and driving histories reveal a state so concerned with people having access to motor vehicles for work and life that it allows deadly drivers to share our roads despite the cost. Officials may call driving a privilege, but they treat it as a right — often failing to take drivers’ licenses even after they kill someone on the road.We found nearly 40% of the drivers charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019 have a valid license.That includes a driver with two separate convictions for vehicular manslaughter, for crashes that killed a 16-year-old girl in 2009 and a 25-year-old woman in 2020. In July of last year, the DMV issued him a driver’s license.The agency gave licenses to nearly 150 people less than a year after they allegedly killed someone on the road, we found. And while the agency has since suspended some of those, often after a conviction, the majority remain valid. In Santa Clara County, a man prosecutors charged with manslaughter got his current license just a month and a half after the collision that killed a mother of three young children.\n\nAnd many drivers accused of causing roadway deaths don’t appear to have stopped driving recklessly. Records show that nearly 400 got a ticket or were in another crash — or both — after their deadly collisions.\n\nA commercial driver drove his semi truck on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, killing a motorcyclist in Kern County in 2021. Less than a year later, he still had a valid license when he barreled his semi into slow-moving traffic, hitting four vehicles and killing a woman in Fresno County, records show. Another man, sentenced to nine years in prison for killing two women while driving drunk, got his privileges restored by the DMV after being paroled, only to drive high on meth in Riverside and weave head-on into another car, killing a woman.\n\n“It is somewhat shocking to see how much you can get away with and still be a licensed driver in the state of California,” Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said. “I don’t think anyone fully understands what you need to do behind the wheel to lose your driving privilege.”\n\nAlmost as interesting as the information in the drivers’ DMV records is what’s not there.\n\nHundreds of drivers’ DMV records simply don’t list convictions for manslaughter or another crime related to a fatal crash, we found. The apparent error means some drivers who should have their driving privileges suspended instead show up in DMV records as having a valid license.\n\nThe cases we reviewed cut across demographics and geography. Defendants include farmworkers and a farm owner. They include off-duty police officers and people with lengthy rap sheets, drivers who killed in a fit of rage and others whose recklessness took the lives of those they loved most — high school sweethearts, siblings, children. The tragedies span this vast state. From twisty two-lane mountain roads near the Oregon border to the dusty scrubland touching Mexico. From the crowded streets of San Francisco to the highways of the Inland Empire. From Gold Country, to timber country, to Silicon Valley, to the almond capital of the world. So much death. More people than are killed by guns.\n\nDangerous drivers are able to stay on the roads for many reasons. The state system that targets motorists who rack up tickets is designed to catch clusters of reckless behavior, not long-term patterns. And while there are laws requiring the DMV to suspend a driver’s license for certain crimes, like DUIs, there is no such requirement for many vehicular manslaughter convictions.\n\nIt’s often up to the DMV whether to act. Routinely it doesn’t.\n\nThe DMV declined to make its director, Steve Gordon — who has been in charge since Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed him in 2019 — available for an interview to discuss our findings.\n\nChris Orrock, a DMV spokesperson, said the agency follows the law when issuing licenses. “We use our authority as mandated and as necessary,” he said.\n\nEven when the DMV does take away motorists’ driving privileges, state officials, law enforcement and the courts are often unable or unwilling to keep them off the road. We found cases where drivers racked up numerous tickets while driving on a suspended license and faced little more than fines before eventually causing a fatal crash, even though authorities could have sent them to jail.\n\nTaking away someone’s driving privilege is no small decision. It can consign a family to poverty, affecting job prospects, child care and medical decisions.\n\nStill, the stakes couldn’t be higher. More than 20,000 people died on the roads of California from 2019 to early 2024.\n\nKowana Strong thinks part of the problem is that lawmakers and regulators are too quick to treat fatal crashes as an unfortunate fact of life, as opposed to something they can address.\n\nHer son Melvin Strong III — who went by his middle name, Kwaun — was finishing college and planning to start a master’s program in kinesiology when he was killed by Dimov, the driver with six prior DUI convictions. Kwaun was a bright and innocent young man, she said, just starting his life.\n\n“It’s just another accident as far as they’re concerned,” Kowana Strong said.\n\nHoles in the DMV’s point system\n\nYoung people think they’re invincible. It’s the old who know how unfair life is, Jerrod Tejeda said.\n\nHis daughter Cassi Tejeda was just 22. She was months from graduating from Chico State with a bachelor’s degree in history and a plan to be a teacher. Outgoing and athletic, she wanted to travel, see the world and make her own life.\n\nShe had a girlfriend who was visiting. Courtney Kendall was 24 and a student at Louisiana State University.\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon in January 2022, a Volvo SUV topping speeds of 75 mph ran a red light and smashed into their Jeep, court records show. The collision killed them both.\n\n“The most difficult part besides the incident is every day that goes by you're always wondering what if. What would they be doing today?” Jerrod Tejeda said. “Would they be married? Would they have developed into the career that they chose? Where would she be living?”\n\nTanya Kendall lamented not being there to protect her daughter, hold her hand or say goodbye.\n\n“Instead, I was left with the unbearable task of choosing what outfit she would be buried in. Buried, Your Honor. Not the gown she would wear to her graduation from LSU — the one she will never attend,” the mother wrote in a letter to a Butte County judge, adding that she and her husband stood in their daughter’s place, accepting her diploma.\n\nSuch pain was preventable.\n\nThe driver of the Volvo, Matthew Moen, had a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit, according to court filings. And it wasn’t his first time drinking and driving. Moen was caught driving drunk in Oregon in 2016. He never completed the requirements of a diversion program and had an outstanding warrant at the time of the fatal crash, the Butte County district attorney’s office said. In January 2020, he was convicted of DUI in Nevada County for driving with a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit, given a couple weeks in jail and put on probation for three years.\n\nHis license was valid at the time of the fatal 2022 crash, records show.\n\nAcross the country, states grapple with how to effectively spot and punish drivers who could be a danger on the road. Often they rely on a basic point system, with drivers accruing points for various types of traffic violations and thresholds for when the state will take away a motorist’s driving privileges. But like many, California has such high limits that drivers with a pattern of reckless behavior can avoid punishment.\n\nThe state suspends a driver’s license for accumulating four points in a year, six points in two years or eight points in three years. What does it take to get that many points? Using a cellphone while driving is zero points. A speeding ticket is a point. Vehicular manslaughter is two points.\n\nBetween March 2017 and March 2022, Trevor Cook received two citations for running red lights, got two speeding tickets and was deemed responsible for two collisions, including one in which someone was injured, court records show. (A third red-light ticket was dismissed.) At-fault collisions add a point to a driver’s license, according to the DMV. But the incidents were spaced out enough that none resulted in a suspension.\n\nSo Cook had a valid license on April 14, 2022, just a month after his last speeding ticket, when he blew through a Yolo County stop sign at more than 100 mph.\n\nAt that exact moment, Prajal Bista passed through the intersection, on his way to work after dinner and a movie with his wife, according to details of the crash that prosecutors included in court filings. Bista was driving the speed limit and on track to make it to work 30 minutes early.\n\nThe force of the collision nearly split Bista’s Honda Civic in half. Investigators determined Bista had been wearing his seat belt, but the crash tore it apart. They found his body 75 feet from the intersection.\n\nOn March 28, 2024, Cook pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter.\n\nJust a month later, on April 30, the DMV issued Cook his current driver’s license, agency records show. Less than two weeks after that, he got a ticket for disobeying a traffic signal.\n\nMelinda Aiello, chief deputy district attorney in Yolo County, said her office didn’t know anything about the new license or the red-light ticket until contacted by CalMatters. What’s more, the manslaughter conviction — like hundreds of others we found — isn’t listed on Cook’s driving record.\n\nCook’s license was still listed as valid in California DMV records as of early 2025. But for now, he’s off the roadways: Last summer, Cook started serving time in state prison.\n\n“It’s stunning to me that eight months later his license is still showing as valid and the conviction for killing someone while driving is not reflected in his driving record,” Aiello said. “You killed somebody. I’d think there might be some license implications.”\n\nOrrock, the DMV spokesperson, said he couldn’t speak directly to why so many convictions are missing. But, he said, “we acknowledge that the process and coordination between the judicial system and the DMV must continually evolve to address any gaps that have been identified. And we’re looking into that.”\n\nKill someone, get your license back\n\nThere are laws requiring the DMV to suspend a driver’s license for various convictions. A first DUI conviction, for example, is a 6-to-10-month suspension. Felony vehicular manslaughter is a three-year loss of driving privileges. The agency isn’t necessarily required to give a license back if its driver safety branch deems a motorist too dangerous to drive, agency officials said.\n\nBut CalMatters found the agency regularly gives drivers their licenses back as soon as the legally required period ends. And once crashes, tickets and suspensions fall off a driver’s record after a few years, it’s often as if the motorist’s record is wiped clean. So even if the driver gets in trouble again, the agency often treats any future crashes and traffic violations as isolated incidents, not as part of a longer pattern of reckless driving.\n\nPerhaps that’s why Joshua Daugherty is licensed to drive in California.\n\nIn July 2020, Daugherty drifted onto the highway shoulder while driving near Mammoth Lakes, overcorrected to the left and lost control, court filings show. His Toyota Tacoma cut across the lane into oncoming traffic, where an SUV broadsided it. Daugherty’s girlfriend, 25-year-old Krystal Kazmark, died. Police noted that Daugherty’s eyes were red and watery and his speech was slurred when they arrived. He told officers that he’d smoked “a couple of bowls” of marijuana earlier in the day, according to records filed in court.\n\nKazmark’s mother was devastated. Like other victim relatives we spoke to for this story, Mary Kazmark tried as best she could to summarize a life into a few words — an impossible task. Her daughter liked to sing, travel, cook, draw, snow-ski, water-ski, wakeboard, hike, read, entertain friends and plan parties. She was a responsible kid, her mother said, always the designated driver with her friends. She oversaw guest reservations at one of the Mammoth Lakes lodges.\n\nMary Kazmark said she tracked down Daugherty on the phone a few days after the crash.\n\n“He just said, ‘I can’t believe this happened again.’ And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’”\n\nShe eventually learned it wasn’t the first time Daugherty’s driving had killed.\n\nIn August 2009, in a strikingly similar incident, Daugherty was speeding along a Riverside County highway when his Ford Expedition drifted onto the shoulder. Witnesses told police he veered back to the left, lost control, hit a dirt embankment and went airborne, the SUV flipping onto its roof. A 16-year-old girl riding in the back died. Daugherty was convicted of misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. He was sentenced to 180 days in custody and three years’ probation, according to a summary of the case filed in court.\n\nBecause of the earlier manslaughter conviction, police recommended he be charged with murder for the death of Krystal Kazmark. But the Mono County district attorney’s office charged him with a mere misdemeanor.\n\nFelony charges typically require a prosecutor to prove “gross negligence.” A prosecutor in another county described the difference between a felony and a misdemeanor this way: A felony is one in which you tell the average person the facts and they say, “Wow, that’s really dangerous.” A misdemeanor is one which they say, “That’s dumb but I’ve probably done it.”\n\nThe Mono County district attorney’s office refused to comment on the case, because the prosecutor and the elected DA at the time have both since retired. The office did provide a prepared statement explaining the charging decision. “It was determined that there was not a substantial likelihood of conviction at trial,” it said.\n\nDaugherty pleaded guilty and was convicted in January 2023. He was sentenced to a year in jail. The DMV suspended his driving privileges after the fatal 2020 crash, a DMV report shows. But losing his license wasn’t enough to keep Daugherty off the road, records show.\n\nTwo months after his conviction for killing Kazmark, before he reported to jail, police caught him driving on a suspended license.\n\nStill, the DMV reissued Daugherty a license in July 2024.\n\nTo recap: That’s two convictions for two dead young women, plus a conviction for driving on a suspended license, and the California DMV says Daugherty can still share the road with you.\n\n“It’s so sad. You make a mistake and then you don’t learn from it and then you cause another person to lose their life,” Mary Kazmark said. “It’s unbelievable that he can continue to drive.”\n\nOrrock said the DMV couldn’t comment on individual drivers.\n\nWhen law enforcement reports a fatal crash, the agency’s driver safety branch flags all drivers who might be at fault. It then looks into the collision and decides whether the agency should suspend those motorists’ driving privileges. If the driver contests the action, there’s a hearing that could include witness testimony. Suspensions are open-ended. Drivers need to ask for their license back, and agency personnel decide whether the suspension should end or continue. These discretionary suspensions typically last for about a year.\n\nAnd while officials said the DMV can continue a suspension if they think a driver poses a danger, Orrock said they need to give drivers an opportunity to get their license back. He said there’s no process in the state “to permanently revoke a license.”\n\nGet your license back, get in trouble again\n\nRoughly 400 drivers accused of causing a fatal crash since 2019 received a ticket, got in another collision or did both after the date they allegedly killed someone on the road. (The reports don’t show whether the drivers were found at fault, only that they were involved in an accident.) That’s about 15% of the drivers for whom we could get DMV reports.\n\nDrivers like William Beasley.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2016, Beasley collected five speeding tickets and a citation for running a red light in Sacramento County, court records show. Then around 9 a.m. on a sunny Tuesday in October 2019, he killed a man.\n\nWilliam and Deborah Hester were crossing the street to go to a dentist appointment at a veterans facility when Beasley’s silver pickup sped toward them. They thought they would make it across. But the truck didn’t stop. At the last minute, William Hester shoved his wife out of the way. She heard the truck smash into her husband’s body and screamed, according to court records.\n\nBeasley still didn’t stop. He fled the area and tried to hide his truck. Investigators used nearby cameras and license plate readers to track him down days later. Beasley admitted to being in a collision.\n\nHe later pleaded no contest in Sacramento to hit-and-run and misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. A probation report in the case revealed Beasley was nearly blind in his left eye.\n\n“Mr. Hester is with me every moment of my life,” Beasley said in an interview. “I took away a father, a grandfather, a husband, and they consider me a murderer. That’s not who I am.”\n\n“My accident with Mr. Hester was just that, an accident. Nothing more,” he said, adding that he worked as a courier for years and sometimes got speeding tickets because he was rushing.\n\nIn May 2020, the DMV took away his driving privileges.\n\nIn November 2022, Beasley got his license back — “because I could and I needed to,” he said, adding that people deserve second chances, particularly for accidents.\n\nAlmost immediately — less than three weeks after getting his license — he was in another collision, his DMV report shows. In early 2024, he got in yet another. His license was suspended when his car insurance was canceled, records show.\n\n“It makes no sense to me that they would give him a license and give him the opportunity to hurt someone else,” said Loriann Hester Page, William Hester’s daughter.\n\nHer father’s death broke the family, she said. He drove a tank in the Army, played guitar in a band, liked to ride horses.\n\n“My dad was such a wonderful, kind man,” she said. “He would always walk in a room and wanted to make everyone smile.”\n\nBeasley said he doesn’t plan to drive again.\n\n\"I am 75 years old,” he said. “I am blind in one eye. I have had a situation where a man was killed, he lost his life. I am not going to repeat that situation at all.”\n\nStill on the road, license never suspended\n\nThe DMV does have the ability to act quickly. In some cases, it suspended a driver’s license shortly after a fatal crash. However, we found numerous cases in which the DMV did nothing for months or years, often not until a criminal conviction.\n\nIn July 2021, truck driver Baljit Singh drove his semi on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, killing a motorcyclist in Kern County, court records show. There are no suspensions listed on his DMV record during that time, even though the agency has the discretion to suspend someone’s license without a conviction.\n\nLess than a year later, as his case wound its way through the slow-moving court system, Singh plowed his semi into the back of a car in Fresno County, killing a woman, records show. He ultimately pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter in Kern County. He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter in Fresno for the second fatal crash. The DMV finally took away his driving privileges in February of last year.\n\nProsecutors say Jadon Mendez was speeding in December 2021 in Santa Clara County when he lost control and caused a crash that killed a mother of three young children. A few weeks later he got a speeding ticket. And yet, the DMV issued him his current driver’s license on Jan. 27, 2022 — 49 days after the fatal crash.\n\nThere were no suspensions listed on his DMV record as of early this year, even though Mendez was charged with manslaughter in May 2022. The judge in his case ordered him not to drive, as a condition of his release. But such court orders don’t necessarily show up on a driver’s DMV record.\n\nThat might be why he didn’t get in more trouble in December 2022 when he got a speeding ticket in Alameda County. Prosecutors didn’t know about that ticket until CalMatters asked about it, said Angela Bernhard, assistant DA in the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office.\n\nMendez’s manslaughter case is still open, and his license is still listed as valid.\n\nWhen asked about the Mendez case and others, Orrock acknowledged that while there's a DMV process for deciding when to revoke or suspend a license, \"sometimes the process takes a while to happen.\"\n\nWhen the DMV doesn’t act at all\n\nIn many cases, the DMV doesn’t take action even after a conviction.\n\nIn May 2022, a semi driver named Ramon Pacheco made a U-turn in front of an oncoming motorcycle, killing 29-year-old Dominic Lopez-Toney, who was finishing his rotations to be a doctor.\n\nCourt records show Pacheco had gotten in trouble behind the wheel before. He had been arrested for DUI in 2009, caused a collision in 2013 and got a ticket in 2016 for making an unsafe turn. It wasn’t enough to keep him off the road.\n\nNeither was killing a man.\n\nMonths after San Joaquin prosecutors charged Pacheco with vehicular manslaughter, he got into another collision for which he was also deemed most at fault.\n\nAs the case dragged on, Lopez-Toney’s large but tight-knit family wrote dozens of letters to the court, pleading for justice. Dorothy Toney wrote that, more than a year since her grandson’s death, she was still haunted by images of his “mangled and broken body” and the gruesome details in the police report. “Somedays,” she wrote, “I wish I had been there to gently hold his hands” and “tell him how much I loved him.”\n\nThe letters are full of shock and outrage that the driver had faced so few consequences. “Allowing this truck driver to continue driving and engaging in civilian activities with only a mere consequence of probation is appalling,” wrote Lynelle Sigona, the victim’s aunt.\n\nPacheco ultimately pleaded no contest to misdemeanor manslaughter and received probation. His DMV record as of Feb. 11 indicates his driving privileges were never suspended; his commercial driver’s license is valid.\n\nPacheco’s defense attorney, Gil Somera, said his client isn’t a reckless driver. His prior incidents are relatively minimal, he said, given the fact that “truck drivers drive thousands and thousands of miles a year.” Pacheco needed to turn around and didn’t think there was another place he could do so, since he was approaching a residential area, Somera added.\n\nPacheco wasn’t being “inattentive or reckless,” Somera said. “And it’s unfortunate and sad and tragic this young man died because of this decision he made to make a U-turn.”\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy, Lopez-Toney’s mother has become an advocate for truck safety.\n\n“Road safety and truck safety is not a priority right now with our legislators, with our government,” Nora Lopez said. “Changing our mindset, our attitudes, our culture on the roads is not impossible.”\n\nIn an interview at her Castro Valley home, she talked about her only child. He was smart and caring, liked snowboarding and animals, loved food. On vacations they would take cooking classes together, Lopez said. He studied molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley and was almost done with medical school.\n\nShe still has the dry-erase whiteboards in his old room. One is filled with his small and neat study notes; another has what appears to be a to-do list. There’s a note that says “Surgery: 600.” Lopez said that’s when he was due to start his surgical rotation in a San Joaquin hospital, just a couple of days after he died.\n\nShe said he just wanted to help people and serve the Native American community as a doctor, a future that a driver snatched away.\n\n“It’s because of a man’s recklessness and carelessness — no regard for humanity,” she said.\n\nWhile felony manslaughter is an automatic three-year loss of driving privileges, a misdemeanor typically carries no such penalty. It’s discretionary — it’s up to the DMV to decide whether to do anything. And the man who killed Lopez-Toney is far from alone in facing no apparent punishment from the DMV.\n\nWe found nearly 200 drivers with a valid license whose DMV record shows a conviction for misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter but for whom there is no suspension listed.\n\nWhen shown a copy of Pacheco’s current driving report, Lopez sat in silence for several seconds.\n\n“Does this make sense to you? It makes no sense to me,” she said. “With his record, how does he still have a license?”\n\n‘Are we going to put that loaded gun back in their hands?’\n\nResearch on dangerous drivers appears to be thin and largely outdated.\n\nLiza Lutzker, a researcher at UC Berkeley’s Safe Transportation Research and Education Center, said much of the focus in the traffic safety world is on creating better design and infrastructure, so people who make honest mistakes don’t end up killing someone.\n\n“I think that the issues of these reckless drivers are a separate and complex problem,” Lutzker said. “The system we have clearly is not working. And people are paying with their lives for it.”\n\nJeffrey Michael, who researches roadway safety issues at Johns Hopkins University and spent three decades working at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said he understands officials might be hesitant to impose harsher penalties more broadly, “for fear of the unintended consequences.”\n\n“We live in a society where driving is really essential,” he said. But he said the findings show the agency needs more scrutiny and analysis of who is on the roads.\n\n“These are not unresolvable problems,” he said.\n\nLeah Shahum, executive director of the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit promoting safe streets, said sometimes officials prioritize preserving people’s ability to drive rather than ensuring safety.\n\n“We don’t all have the right to drive,” Shahum said. “We have the responsibility to drive safely and ensure we don’t hurt others.” She added that many people need to drive in this car-centric state. “That does not mean there can be a license to kill.”\n\n“If we know somebody has a history of dangerous behavior,” she said, “are we going to put that loaded gun back in their hands?”\n\nThe gun metaphor was common in the thousands of vehicular manslaughter cases we looked at across California. One prosecutor described dangerous behavior behind the wheel as akin to firing a gun into a crowd.\n\nIn letters to the court, surviving relatives and friends described the hole left behind, writing about an empty seat at a high school graduation, a photo cutout taken without fail to home baseball games.\n\nIt’s a void one young man tried to explain to authorities — the sudden, violent, blink-of-an-eye moment where life forever changes. For him, it was at 6:45 p.m. on Feb. 27, 2020, on Lone Tree Way in the Bay Area city of Antioch.\n\nTwo brothers, ages 11 and 15, were going to meet their dad at a Burger King. They crossed to the median and then waited for a break in the traffic before continuing to the other side. The older one made it across, according to court documents. His younger brother stepped into the street just as a driver gunned his car to 75 miles an hour — 30 over the speed limit.\n\nThe older boy watched as his younger brother “just disappeared.”\n\nThis is the first piece in a series about how California lets dangerous drivers stay on the road.Sign up for CalMatters’ License to Kill newsletter to be notified when the next story comes out, and to get more behind-the-scenes information from our reporting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/11/05/2024-election-analysis-updates-trump-harris/76013872007/", "title": "Election results analysis: Trump vs. Harris race too close for comfort", "text": "Opinion staff\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAfter months – years – of anticipation and rhetoric, Election Day is finally here. After one final pitch to voters in the crucial swing states of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have come to the end of their bruising, blustering and, yes, unprecedented campaigns.\n\nNearly 78 million Americans have already cast their ballots early, and millions more will head to the polls Tuesday – our columnists among them. And while all eyes are on Trump vs. Harris – either just another political contest or a fight to save American democracy, depending on who you ask – the next president of the United States isn’t the only race captivating voters. Or us.\n\nOur USA TODAY Network opinion columnists bring you live commentary, analysis and on-the-ground coverage from across the country. We’ll break down what we’re seeing and contextualize what you’re hearing. We’ll all get through this. Together.\n\n2024 election results are clear: American voters are divided\n\nAfter a nerve-racking night of watching election results, one thing is clear: American voters, those who bothered to vote, are divided by what we want for this country.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nDonald Trump was leading in both the Electoral College and popular votes by margins that clearly show his message and campaign resonate with voters. Kamala Harris could still win the election, but it's also clear that voters didn't wholly buy what she was selling after taking over for President Joe Biden.\n\nWe'll know soon enough who the next president will be. But we already know whoever wins has a ton of work to do for any chance of uniting us.\n\n—Louie Villalobos, USA TODAY\n\nWith Ohio win, GOP control of U.S. Senate looks all but certain\n\nRepublican businessman Bernie Moreno has beat out incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who serves as chair of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nThis win all but cements GOP control of the Senate, with West Virginia already called for the Republican and Montana expected to flip to Republican control as well.\n\nThe Ohio victory most likely has a lot to do with former President Donald Trump’s decisive win in the state, with a nearly 12-point margin. The Senate race in Ohio had been one of a few considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report.\n\nMoreno had trailed Brown in polls for much of the race but started gaining traction by talking about inflation and illegal immigration – issues that voters across the country have continued to say are important to them this election.\n\nMoreno’s win bodes well for other close Senate races, including in Michigan, where former GOP Congressman Mike Rogers currently leads U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin.\n\nNo matter what happens in the presidential race, it’s good for the country if there’s divided government. Republican control of the Senate is a great place to start.\n\n— Ingrid Jacques, USA TODAY\n\nTed Cruz cruises to reelection in Texas Senate race\n\nIn a result that should come as no surprise, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has won reelection, easily defeating his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred.\n\nFor months, news reports and commentary portrayed the Cruz vs. Allred race as tight (even I said it was in September) and predicted that it would go down to the wire on Election Day.\n\nIn reality, the race wasn’t close.\n\nAll the major newspapers in Texas endorsed Allred, and the former NFL linebacker came across as mild and moderate. Allred’s record, however, was that of a typical liberal, and Texas voters didn’t sign up for it.\n\nNot even a last-minute campaign stop from Vice President Kamala Harris could boost Allred. The event, which also featured Houston native Beyoncé, might have hurt Allred because it further associated him with national progressives.\n\nTexas isn’t turning blue anytime soon. Ted Cruz’s Senate race just proved it.\n\n— Nicole Russell, USA TODAY\n\nIs Trump going to win? What Florida can tell us.\n\nWith more than 95% of votes counted, former President Donald Trump swept to a huge win in Florida. His 1.4 million vote lead is an incredible margin for a state that went for President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. Trump won Florida in 2016 by a small margin and in 2020 by a bit more.\n\nOnce the ultimate swing state, Florida has become a solid red stronghold. Much of that is due to the leadership of Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was elected in 2018.\n\nRick Scott, who on Tuesday won reelection to the Senate, served as governor before DeSantis and has certainly helped in building the GOP’s momentum. But it is DeSantis who has led a red revolution in the Sunshine State.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump became the first Republican candidate to win Miami-Dade County since 1988.\n\nNew residents, many of them conservative voters, have flocked to Florida thanks to the state’s weather and the fact it does not have a state income tax. From 2022-23, Florida gained 194,000 people from other states.\n\nDon’t count DeSantis out for higher political aspirations. Just because 2024 wasn’t his year, doesn’t mean we couldn’t see him again on the national stage.\n\n— Nicole Russell, USA TODAY\n\nDemocrat Sarah McBride wins Delaware Senate race, becomes first trans person elected to Congress\n\nSarah McBride just made history as the first transgender person to be elected to Congress in Delaware’s at-large district, beating Republican candidate John Whalen III, according to NBC News and CNN.\n\nMcBride has served as a state senator in the General Assembly since 2021. During her term, she spearheaded the Healthy Delaware Families Act, which provides workers with up to 12 weeks of paid family or medical leave.\n\n\"I know that the only way for me to do right by the LGBTQ community is for me to simply be the best member of Congress that I can be, and that means continuing to do what I've done in the Delaware General Assembly,\" McBride told me in July.\n\nTrump has repeatedly gone after Harris’ support of the trans community, spending at least $17 million on ads attacking the vice president for supporting things like gender-affirming care. Despite his hateful rhetoric, trans people aren’t going anywhere.\n\n— Sara Pequeño, USA TODAY\n\nHurricanes often depress voting. In North Carolina, Helene drove voters to the polls.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. — Something emerged from the wreckage caused here by the terrible Hurricane Helene that might seem strange but upon reflection makes a lot of sense: political enthusiasm.\n\nIn one of the bluest parts of North Carolina where debris is still piled sky-high and people are still missing nearly six weeks after the deadly record-breaking storm, left-leaning voters from Asheville and surrounding Buncombe County packed into Highland Brewing, one of the city’s founding beer-makers.\n\nThe Democratic watch party of 450 had reached capacity with would-be attendees spilling into other parts of the brewery.\n\nThe surge of political interest comes not despite the storm, but because of it. Wanting to do something – anything – to help, residents looked for somewhere to volunteer in the immediate aftermath of the storm. They were corralled by an unlikely activist, the county’s Register of Deeds, Drew Reisinger, who sent them out to do wellness checks.\n\nThose volunteers then turned to the election, knocking on doors and asking their neighbors to vote.\n\n“That really built community in a way that by extension became a way for us to get out the vote,” Democratic Party Chair Kathie Kline said sitting behind an entrance table to the viewing party.\n\nHurricanes are supposed to depress voting. But in these parts of North Carolina, people refused to let the death, loss and destruction silence them.\n\n— Joel Burgess, USA TODAY\n\nStein wins North Carolina governor's race. Will battleground state go blue for Harris?\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. — The Associated Press has called the North Carolina governor race for Attorney General Josh Stein, who is projected to defeat the state’s scandal-ridden lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson.\n\nDemocratic supporters are filing into the ballroom at the Marriott in downtown Raleigh for the state party’s election night festivities. The song “Just Dance” by Lady Gaga is blaring through speakers.\n\nWhile some may consider North Carolina Trump country, it is very much in play. At the time of writing this, polls show Trump leading in the state by just 1 percentage point. In 2020, he won the state by fewer than 75,000 votes.\n\nThe last time North Carolina went blue was in 2008, when Barack Obama won by just under 14,200 votes.\n\nOther races to watch in the state include the first congressional district and state superintendent.\n\nWhile North Carolinians are notorious ticket-splitters, Stein's victory could mean a boost for Harris.\n\n— Sara Pequeño, USA TODAY\n\nElection results trickle in as polls start to close. Finally, we can stop guessing.\n\nPolls are starting to close in several states. Do you know what I’m most looking forward to hearing? Fewer people trying to guess the future.\n\nAmericans have been nearly buried in polling data – most of it unreliable – and every other second, some new “expert” has spouted off on social media about how this or that “indicator” strongly favors one candidate or another.\n\nIt appears we, as a country, have traded patience for an addiction to a steady stream of hack prognostications that, in total, tells us nothing.\n\nThroughout election season, there have been two options:\n\nDo your thing, advocate for your preferred candidate, vote and then wait for the voting process to unfold, knowing it will happen before too long.\n\nConstantly freak out over polls by pollsters you’ve never heard of and allow people whose only talent is being frequently wrong get in your head and make you feel anxious and wholly unwilling to … you know … just let the election happen and await the results.\n\nIt’s our wholly irrational demand to know the outcome before a vote is even cast that has birthed these dime-store Nostradamuses. And I, for one, look forward to them sinking into irrelevancy once the actual election outcome has been made clear.\n\nThe need for instant gratification is killing us, folks. And it's making a lot of otherwise useless people feel important.\n\n— Rex Huppke, USA TODAY\n\nIf Trump loses, I hope Republicans send him and his election lies packing\n\nElection week is a tumultuous time, particularly in recent years, as the legitimacy of our elections has been called into question almost entirely on no serious basis.\n\nThe 2020 election wasn’t the first contested election result in American history, but it was the most brazenly lied about one. Many Republicans still refuse to admit that they lost in 2020 out of their ridiculous loyalty to Donald Trump.\n\nMy only hope for this week, and maybe an unrealistic one, is that regardless of the winner, our politicians put the country over partisanship to admit that the race was a legitimate one.\n\nThis is naturally unlikely in the event of a Trump loss, given his response to his defeat in 2020. If Republicans truly cared about the state of America, they would be wise not to follow his lead in the event of a loss. They have the chance to act as they should have in 2020, jettisoning Trump and his election lies from the party, but they have given me no reason to think they might change.\n\n— Dace Potas, USA TODAY\n\nFor Trump, win or lose, it's the end of an era\n\nFormer President Donald Trump celebrated the beginning of Election Day in Grand Rapids, Michigan – marking the third time he’s closed out his campaign in this city in a key battleground state.\n\nTrump won Michigan in 2016 but lost it in 2020. He’s hoping for a repeat of his victory eight years ago.\n\nRegardless of the outcome Tuesday, this final rally in Michigan also likely marks the final campaign rally for Trump – ever.\n\nHe seemed to acknowledge that in his remarks.\n\n“This has been an incredible journey,” Trump told the crowd. “It’s very sad in a way. This is the last one.”\n\nAt 78, Trump has said that if he loses this election, he will not seek the presidency in 2028. If he wins a second term this week, he will be barred by the Constitution from seeking a third term in four years.\n\nSo, this is it. For nearly 10 years, his rallies have dominated the news cycle and have become a phenomenon that is uniquely tied to Trump’s brand.\n\nAnd even though the media quickly moved on, let’s not forget that Trump nearly lost his life at one of his rallies this year.\n\nI’ll never forget hearing the news about the July assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. It was a dark day for the country.\n\nYet, Trump’s immediate response – with a fist raised while blood ran down his face – is iconic.\n\nNo matter how you feel about the former president, the end of his campaign rallies marks the end of an era.\n\n— Ingrid Jacques, USA TODAY\n\nCould we have our first Black, woman president? Philadelphia mayor reflects.\n\nPHILADELPHIA — Cherelle Parker took a long beat to consider the question on Election Day: Did she think, growing up, that she would ever see a Black and South Asian woman as president of the United States?\n\n“No,” said Parker, a Black woman and Democrat now serving as Philadelphia’s first female mayor.\n\nParker is known for her projective oratory, her signature speeches always building to a crescendo designed to drive home her point. Her pause, followed by a soft-spoken “no,” showed just how personal this presidential election was for her.\n\n“Representation matters,” Parker said, rolling again into a methodically upticking tempo in her response. “My grandmother was from Manning, South Carolina. All of the matriarchs in my family, when they got to Philadelphia, they were domestic workers. I know some people don't even know what a domestic worker is, but that means my grandmother was paid in cash, an envelope left on a table for her after she cleaned the houses of wealthy families while she was taking care of me, her granddaughter, who was born to a single teenage mother.”\n\nLike Vice President Kamala Harris, the mayor graduated from a historically Black college and university.\n\nParker addressed about 30,000 people at Harris’ final campaign rally in Philadelphia on Monday evening, telling them, \"The path to the White House is paved through Pennsylvania, the Keystone State.”\n\n“When you look at her and you see her, you say, anything is possible,” Parker said Tuesday. “She's been prepared to meet this moment, and I'm telling you for generations to come, they will know I, too, can do that if it's what I decide to do. There are no limits.”\n\n— Chris Brennan, USA TODAY\n\nWill abortion ballot measures be a deciding factor in 2024?\n\nSomething I’ll pay close attention to as election results are reported is the impact of abortion in driving voters to the polls.\n\nExpanding abortion rights was a key motivating issue in the 2022 midterm elections, especially for women, and helped Democrats minimize the anticipated Republican “red wave.”\n\nIn fact, in all the states where abortion has been on the ballot since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, reproductive rights have prevailed. That’s been true in blue and red states, including Michigan and Ohio, which now have lenient abortion rights enshrined in their constitutions.\n\nTen states have similar measures on their ballots this election: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota.\n\nI’ll be watching Arizona and Florida most closely.\n\nArizona is a battleground state, and if abortion drives more women to the polls, it is likely to boost Vice President Kamala Harris, because women are much more likely to support the Democratic nominee.\n\nIf the abortion amendment clears the high hurdle of 60% support to pass in Florida – which has become a decidedly red state – that does not bode well for pro-life efforts in other states to stop similar expansion of abortion access.\n\nThis election is different, in that it is a presidential election year and former President Donald Trump is on the ballot. We’re also further removed from Roe being overturned.\n\nRegardless, I expect abortion will still play a role.\n\n— Ingrid Jacques, USA TODAY\n\nWhat does canvassing mean in politics? All the difference on Election Day.\n\nIt’s Election Day, but the job of political canvassers is not yet done.\n\nCanvassing has evolved from door-to-door conversations and phone banks to social media connections and digital coalitions. But it’s still a significant influencer in voter turnout and in swaying undecided voters.\n\nAccording to volunteers, one of the great benefits of political canvassing is in-person voter engagement. Having a one-on-one conversation with an undecided voter may encourage them to learn more about the candidates running for office and could even persuade them to vote.\n\nI spoke with an experienced canvasser, Lakesha Cole, founder and principal publicist at She Pr, about her work on political campaigns.\n\n“Canvassing for Military Families for Kamala has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my adult life.” Cole said. “I grew up in a very civically involved family and can recall visiting the polls as a kid with my grandparents and walking around the neighborhoods with them, encouraging other neighbors to vote.”\n\nIn today’s political climate, where misinformation is rampant and trust in the government is low, canvassing provides an invaluable interpersonal connection that few other campaign strategies can replicate.\n\n— Marla Bautista, USA TODAY\n\nWhen will we get the election results? Pennsylvania governor dodges the question.\n\nPHILADELPHIA — Two questions loomed over the lunch here as Democrats gathered to swap presidential Election Day gossip: Who will win Pennsylvania? And when will we know?\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who made the short list for vice president candidate, was eager to describe a day of voting where Democrats and Republicans worked together in a bipartisan way to overcome technical troubles at polling places. He was far less eager to predict when Pennsylvania’s result would be announced.\n\n“What we've seen since 2020 are clerks of elections learning how to do this job even better,” Shapiro said. “They’re more skilled. They've got better technology, more equipment and a whole lot more practice.”\n\nHe also noted that the use of mail ballots in Pennsylvania has significantly decreased since the 2020 election, held during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pressed for a prediction, Shapiro said this twice – “I think all that together should speed up the count.”\n\nSharif Street, a state senator from Philadelphia and chair of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, was cautious to avoid speaking for election officials but more open to making a prediction. He said Pennsylvania’s result could be announced “by the end of the day Wednesday.”\n\n“We want to get an accurate count,” Street said. “I think that's the most important thing.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat who represents parts of Philadelphia, said the timing of the result will be determined by the margin.\n\n“Are we talking about a 1.2 (percentage point) race like it was in 2020, or are we talking about a 537-vote race, as it was in Florida in 2000?” Boyle said. “That's the last variable that will dictate whether or not we're able to know in the early morning hours on Wednesday or if it will go longer than that.”\n\n— Chris Brennan, USA TODAY\n\nIf Harris loses, will Democrats complain about election integrity?\n\nI hope we learned from the 2020 election that voting is secure in all 50 states. Nonetheless, state voting laws could influence election results this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, a majority of U.S. Supreme Court justices granted Virginia’s request to temporarily block an order that would have required the state to return about 1,600 people to the voter rolls.\n\nThe case involved Virginia’s efforts to revoke the voter registration of suspected noncitizens under a state law enacted in 2006. In August, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an executive order requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to conduct daily checks of voter rolls to remove noncitizens.\n\nThe Biden administration argued that Youngkin’s order violates the “quiet period” provision of the National Voter Registration Act, which prohibits states from removing ineligible voters within 90 days of a federal election.\n\nThe dispute over Virginia’s voting rolls is just one example of recent integrity news stories across the country. From arson attacks on ballot boxes in Oregon and Washington state, to the Supreme Court’s decision Friday to allow Pennsylvania to count contested provisional ballots against Republicans’ wishes, election integrity claims could cast doubt on election results.\n\nFor the past four years, Democrats have claimed there are almost no election integrity issues in the United States. If Vice President Kamala Harris loses a close election and Democrats show concerns about election integrity, I’m calling their bluff now.\n\n— Nicole Russell, USA TODAY\n\nGen Z appears to be voting in battleground states\n\nFor most of this year, I’ve been focused on what Generation Z, those born between 1997 and 2012, thinks about this election.\n\nThe Harris campaign, in particular, has done much work to reach Gen Z voters – and it appears to be paying off. Harris has a 51-point lead among college students in battleground states, according to a poll from The Generation Lab.\n\nOutreach hasn’t stopped ahead of election night, either. The Gen Z advocacy group Voters of Tomorrow announced that it made 6 million direct contacts with young people over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the Access Hollywood tape is going viral on TikTok – introducing an entire new generation of young people to the vile comments Trump made in 2005.\n\nGen Z voters could very well decide this election. We’ll see if this pays off for Harris.\n\n— Sara Pequeño, USA TODAY\n\nIn Wisconsin, epicenter of 2020 election denial, pro-democracy groups brace for the worst\n\nMILWAUKEE — Wisconsin was an epicenter of election denialism in 2020. With Donald Trump repeating false claims he won the state throughout the 2024 campaign and the Republican Party training thousands of polling place observers, pro-democracy groups have braced for the worst.\n\nAs of noon central time, however, election monitors from Protect Democracy’s Wisconsin chapter said there have been minimal reports of issues at polling places.\n\n“At this point, things are running pretty smoothly,” said Edgar Lin, an attorney and policy strategist with the group.\n\n“There’s been scattered attempts at voter intimidation, people not knowing about Wisconsin’s voter ID laws.”\n\nIn July, police removed two election observers from a suburban Milwaukee polling place for being disruptive while objecting to ballots during a primary election. Lin said his group is most focused on voters being obstructed at polling places or frivolous ballot objections.\n\nIn a courtroom Tuesday morning, attorneys for the Republican Party walked back claims in a lawsuit filed Monday that its polling observers were being restricted at Milwaukee polling places.\n\n“For today, what we’re looking at are disruptions that slow down the voting process and sow doubt about the election results or lead to false claims of victory,” Lin said.\n\n— Jim Fitzhenry, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nJoe Rogan endorsed Trump – the guy he once called a dangerous man baby\n\nBro-darling podcaster Joe Rogan – who once called Donald Trump “so f---ing dangerous,” a “man baby” and “a guy (who) can incite a bunch of morons to do something really f---ing stupid” – has now endorsed the dangerous man baby for president.\n\nOn the eve of Election Day, Rogan posted his support for the former one-term president and convicted felon on social media, effectively blaming that support on fellow bro-darling weirdo Elon Musk: “The great and powerful @elonmusk. If it wasn't for him we'd be f---ed. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.”\n\nCool.\n\nThe fact that this happened, and more the fact that this matters, further illustrates that nothing makes sense anymore, and I should hasten my plans to go into the forest and live in a tree.\n\nRogan, Musk and Trump form a turducken of three people many Americans would love to hear less about, so it’s a perfect ménage à trois of ick in an era of near-boundless stupidity.\n\nBut here we are. If Rogan’s endorsement means something to you, congratulations. I have no response to that.\n\nIf you, like me, are exhausted by the buffoonery we’ve experienced throughout Trump’s campaign, you know what to do. Get out there and vote for the one who isn’t surrounded by buffoons.\n\n— Rex Huppke, USA TODAY\n\nHarris used pre-Election Day rally to remind voters of the dangers of Trump\n\nPHILADELPHIA — Consider these words said at a historic location in this city to a massive rally crowd the day before a presidential election.\n\nDonald Trump is “a loose cannon who could put everything at risk.” And “none of us want to wake up Wednesday morning and wish we’d done more.” Or “every issue you care about is on the ballot.”\n\nVice President Kamala Harris?\n\nNo, that was Hillary Clinton, speaking at her final campaign event on Independence Mall on the Monday evening before the 2016 election, before the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of State narrowly lost Pennsylvania and the presidency to Trump.\n\nHarris came to Philadelphia on Monday for her own closing event on the iconic steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a venue made famous by several “Rocky” movies. Harris spoke 2 miles northwest of where Clinton made her closing case eight years ago.\n\nHarris drew an adoring throng of 30,000 supporters who remained through a chilly evening, listening to performances by The Roots, Ricky Martin and Lady Gaga before Oprah Winfrey introduced the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nIt was designed to be hopeful, but there was an echo of anxiety for those who remember how Clinton seemed on the cusp of becoming America’s first female president before Trump surprised her (and himself) by eking out a victory here and the other “blue wall” states of Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nHarris and most of the speakers before her Monday night alluded to Trump and the dangers they see if he wins the presidency again.\n\n“We have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of politics that has been driven by fear and division,” Harris told the crowd. “We are done with that. We’re done. We’re exhausted with it.”\n\n— Chris Brennan, USA TODAY\n\nNorth Carolina is still reeling from Helene, but Asheville residents make a point to vote\n\nOn Friday, I went to Asheville, North Carolina, to talk to voters who were affected by Hurricane Helene. One polling place I visited was still operating as a clean-water station, a donation drop-off spot and a place to get hot meals.\n\nAt another polling place, the Buncombe County Democrats had a large sign that read, “Stronger than storms, stronger than hate.”\n\nAsheville is a blue dot in an otherwise red part of the state. Despite previous concerns about voter turnout, the 25 counties affected by Hurricane Helene had a 2% higher voter turnout during early voting than the rest of the state.\n\nThis can be attributed to the Buncombe County Board of Elections, which immediately worked to change polling places and voting hours to allow folks to vote.\n\n“Asheville is politically strong in their beliefs,” voter EJ Wright told me. “It doesn’t matter if there was still floodwaters out here; I think people would still be out here trying to vote.”\n\n— Sara Pequeño, USA TODAY\n\nToo distressed to go to school because of the election? Snowflake culture is out of control.\n\nAn elite private school in New York City told families last week that students will be treated with kid gloves on Election Day.\n\nNo homework will be assigned Tuesday at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, and the day after the election – or whenever the results become known – “students who feel too emotionally distressed” will be excused from class. Psychologists will be available to offer counseling.\n\nThe principal of the upper school (a fancy term for high school) told families that regardless of the outcome, the school will provide students with “the support they may need.”\n\nWhat is this teaching kids? If anything, all the attention to the “anxiety” they may hypothetically experience is probably causing a lot more of it.\n\nI’m guessing it’s the teachers and administrators at the school (and parents) who feel the most anxious about the presidential election, and they are transferring their feelings onto the students in their care.\n\nThe school is not alone in its coddling. I’ve heard of colleges planning “emotional support” following the election. News organizations, including The Washington Post, have offered advice about how to “survive” election anxiety and deal with “loss.”\n\nIt’s bad enough if adults can’t handle the “stress” of voting, but it’s more alarming to force that anxiety onto young people.\n\nAs comedian Jerry Seinfeld, whose children have attended Fieldston, told The New York Times: “What kind of lives have these people led that makes them think that this is the right way to handle young people? To encourage them to buckle.”\n\nThat’s definitely the wrong message to send.\n\n— Ingrid Jacques, USA TODAY\n\nCan we trust the polls? They were wrong in 2020 and 2016.\n\nPolitical polls were once reliable indicators of electoral outcomes, but not anymore. In the 2016 presidential election, polls leading up to the election largely predicted a win for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, only to be confounded by Donald Trump’s victory.\n\nThe results shocked the world and marked a major turning point in public trust in political polling. News outlets, pollsters and political analysts scrambled to analyze why the polls were wrong. The reasons cited ranged from underestimating rural turnout, changing voter behavior, sampling errors and problems with timing.\n\nIn 2020, the polls showed that Joe Biden had a 12-point lead over Trump. In reality, Biden won the election by about 4 percentage points.\n\nThe inaccuracies continued to diminish voters’ trust in the polls. Today, voters are less likely to respond to pollsters, producing even less data to analyze.\n\nEven though polls aren’t as accurate predictors of the outcomes of elections as they once were, their impact remains substantial. Polls should be used to gauge sentiment and trends, not predict election outcomes.\n\nIf we’ve learned anything from the mishaps of 2016 and 2020, it’s that polling needs to be refined and its uses limited. Voter emotions and sentiments can shift leading up to Election Day, and while polls do offer insight, they are no longer the crystal balls they were once thought to be.\n\n— Marla Bautista, USA TODAY\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Republicans started challenging votes before polls opened\n\nThe polls hadn’t even opened in Pennsylvania before local boards of election had to start fielding thousands of challenges to ballots cast by people living overseas.\n\nThe experts at Keep Our Republic, a nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to protecting elections, discussed that in a media briefing Monday afternoon.\n\nJohn Jones III, a former federal judge in Pennsylvania appointed by then-President George W. Bush, noted that a lawsuit filed by six Republican members of the U.S. House from Pennsylvania attempted the same maneuver last month before being struck down in federal court.\n\n“Thousands of ballots have been challenged,” Jones said. “So election bureaus are going to have to go piecemeal through these and make a determination.”\n\nJones also predicted that the boards “will make pretty quick work of these and deny the challenges” because they tend to follow the same approach.\n\nThe gist of the argument: Claim that state election officials don't do enough to verify the identities of U.S. military service members and their spouses who vote while stationed in other countries.\n\nU.S. District Judge Christopher Conner’s response last week – the members of Congress waited until too close to the election, didn’t have standing to sue and “failed to articulate a viable cause of action.”\n\n— Chris Brennan, USA TODAY\n\nThis column has been updated to include new information and a new video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2025/01/07/nhtsa-tesla-cars-phone-app/77509277007/", "title": "NHTSA to examine Tesla feature that allows cars to move via phone ...", "text": "David Shepardson and Akash Sriram\n\nReuters\n\nWASHINGTON — The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday it has opened a probe into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles in the United States over reports of crashes involving a feature that allows users to move their cars remotely.\n\nThe new investigation comes after the U.S. auto safety agency in October opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving software after four reported collisions, including a fatal 2023 crash.\n\nNHTSA said it is opening a preliminary evaluation into Tesla's Actually Smart Summon feature over reports of four crashes involving Tesla vehicles.\n\nThe vehicles failed to detect posts or parked vehicles when they were operating on Actually Smart Summon, NHTSA said, adding it had reports where users \"had too little reaction time to avoid a crash, either with the available line of sight or releasing the phone app button, which stops the vehicle's movement.\"\n\nActually Smart Summon was launched in September and allows users to remotely move their vehicle toward them or to another location using a smartphone application.\n\nNeed a break?
